Stay off of google as you don't know what, if anything, you are dealing with. Just because you are BRAC2 does not mean you have BC, thought it's good to know that you are being followed closely. Most biopsies do come back B9. Do you know what was seen about the lump that made them want to biopsy it? There are different kinds of lumps that happen to our breasts, and many of them are B9. If you can get a copy of the MRI report and post it, we can help you understand stand how concerning things may, OR many not be.",

MRI shows it not really acting like a malignancy but they dont really know what it is. In the end only a biopsy and sticking it under a microscope will they be able to identify it. So off to the breast surgeon this coming tues. In the end a biopsy is really the only way to definitively know what is what. So do take several deep breathes.

Observations like \"tightly clustered\" or \"linear\" are flag of concern that will have a radiologist rating it a BIRAD 4 (basically meaning, a biopsy is warranted) Does this mean it definitely is cancer? No, but it could also very well be. It IS a flag of concern. (In my layperson's experience here, it's like a orange flag of concern, not red. But definitely a flag.

Cant really give you any insight as to what you have described, but it sounds like they are doing the right thing sending you to a surgeon at this point.  My guess is if the radiologist was concerned, they would have come into the room and talked you to personally. From all you have written it's kind of hard to give you any real feedback as it's more vague than anything.  What I would suggest while you wait for getting an appointment with the surgeon is to get a copy of the radiologist's report of the U/S. With that, those of us laywomen here who have a bit of experience with such can give you a better idea of what the imaging showed and how concerning it is. To keep things in a perspective, I was sent for an MRI and was told I would hear my results in 24 hours. By the time I had gotten home my PCP had called me saying they were sending me to a breast surgeon. My anxiety went THRU THE ROOF!. I went to the BS, had a biopsy and my results were a B9 lesion known as PASH.  So at this point, what I am saying is really try not to panic and don't do any google searching. You really don't know what is what and why you are being sent to a surgeon.  Get a copy of the US report. We can offer some better feedback then HUGSSSSS",

And I have the added part of the journey in that I went for my ultrasound guided biopsy yesterday but it was a no-go. So on this coming Tues I have to get an MRI to see if this needs to be surgically removed. So thus far, not even a biopsy. I have been thinking a great deal on all of this these past few weeks. I have felt my own anxiety level go sky high at times. Full of fear etc. \"Cancer\" is a very powerful word.  It evokes all kinds of negative emotions and fears. You certainly are not alone in that  In the past \"cancer\" or \"breast cancer\" felt like a death sentence. In many ways that was true. But not any more. Chances really are that you are ok. If by some chance, though, that the Dx is cancer, remember it's not a death sentence. There is so much that can be thrown at this beast. I know your emotions will still be all over the place for awhile. That is ok. It's amazing how much power the idea of cancer has. Understandably so. But try to reclaim some of the power if you can by reminding yourself there is so much out there to fight this kind of war. A great deal. HUGS!!  (PS. PATS and Red Sox fan too. I live in the Hartford, CT area )",

What to expect etc. \"Breast cancer\" is an umbrella term that covers a whole host of different cancers that can effect the breast.

Not all breast cancers are a like If you do have BC, hang on tight, for the ride can be tough, but it is do-able.  I still advise you not to do too much research. You arent educated in this area and you dont have even the basic knowledge to know how to wade thru information. Rather than informing your intellect, it will only be fueling your fears. HUgs to you. Try to stay busy with other things. The boards can get quiet over weekend and esp with holidays. Many women here like to take the \"weekends and holidays off\" from thinking anything having to do with BC. And so they go and enjoy their families and loved ones and live life without thinking of BC all the time.  They like to take real and serious breaks... :) God Bless",

Hang in there! http://www.uptodate.com/contents/nipple-inversion The nipple is the central projection in the areola. When the nipple is pulled in and points inward instead of out, it is termed nipple inversion or retraction. Nipple inversion can affect one breast or both, and can be congenital or acquired. Acquired nipple inversion can be due to benign or malignant causes. Benign nipple inversion is usually a gradual process, occurring over a few years. When nipple inversion occurs rapidly, the underlying cause can be inflammation, postsurgical changes, or an underlying malignancy [1",

When it comes to the reverse this is what I have come to understand. When who have been Dx-ed with ADH or ALH (both which put a woman at increased risk of cancer; some experts think is can be  step before cancer cell development), when those ladies have had lumpectomies, areas of DCIS (associated with ADH) or LCIS (associated with ALH) have been found. Both DCIS and LCIS are Stage 0 breast cancer. Meaning they are non-invasive forms. I have never heard of a woman who has PASH (which is what I have) and had it removed end up having cancer found with it. And I have done extensive research on PASH since that is my Dx. The thing with PASH is that is can grown back. Even when it's removed, it can grow back. It can also disappear on it's own. The protocal for dealing with PASH is to have it removed. I chose not to, and my breast surgeon was in agreement. ",

Some people do do better by assuming the worse case scenerio and preparing for that. It does seem you are one of those who are hardwired like that. So start researching things like grade and staging, start researching hormonal receptors and how that figures into treatment. Start educating yourself on the variety of options for mastecotomies. Research what kinds of treatments are available. That way you will feel more incontrol than you do now. It's clear you are drowing in fear. So face those fears. Head on. Stare breast cancer in the face and go \"Ok what if I do have breast cancer. What I am going to do.

There are all kinds of conditions that can affect the breast that are *not* breast cancer. That is what the biopsy results will show. Exactly *what* is *what* going on with your breast. Since this was your first mammo, they dont have a baseline one to compare it to. THIS was your baseline. So they are beign cautious, which is good. Can we tell you if you should be worried or if it's just nothing? Not really, one way or the other. Should you be worried? Not necessarily. Is it going to be \"nothing\". Possibly so. Factually and medically speaking, it's really hard to tell. Most biopsies (up to 80%) come back B9 (benign). So the odds  are on your side.   But no one can say definitively. Only the results of a biopsy can ultimately do that. Hang in there. The waiting is a bitch. That is a fact, too.  ",

On occasion, a BIRADS5 comes back b9, but that is not typical. SO, with that in mind, a few things. 1)\"breast cancer\" is an umbrella term that cover a whole host of different kinds of cancer that can affect the breast. I think there is about 22 different kinds. With that in mind, it will take some time for *your* cancer picture to come into view. 2) In the \"Just Diagnosed\" forum there are a couple of thread that can be helpful to you as you get your ducks in a row, while you *wait* to know exactly what you are dealing with One is at the top of that forum put up by the Moderators with links. Another is entitled \"Just Diagnosed--Get Prepared\". In there you will find some practical advice from what others have learned was helpful them in the initial stages. 3) Please stay away from Dr Google. a) he is not a doctor b) a lot of what is out there is dated c) again, there are all kinds of cancer that can affect the breast and you don't know exactly what you are dealing with yet 4) Keep up with the xanax. Even women who normally don't reach for pharmicutial help found that, in the initial stages of their Dx, they needed some sort of anti-anxiety meds to help keep their head and heart quiet. There is going to be a lot of information coming your way. You need to keep your head as quiet and clear as you can while you make your decisions. 5)This webstie is a great place for information. With that said, I always advise ladies to stay within those forums and threads that best reflects to what they know about their situation. For example, right now I would say stick to the \"Just Diagnosed\" forum. Later, go to the \"Treatment\" sections, etc. As you find out what kind of cancer you have (i.e. ER? PR? Her2? ) etc, there are forums for that. Hang tight. Keep breathing. Based on the preliminary look of it being 1.1 cm , that would put you in Stage 1 (very early stage). A more accurate determination will come later, but hang on to that. What is seen is small.",

The biggest thing one should focus on when it comes to dreams is how you are feeling. Not so much the actual \"what is going on on the movie screen\" The symbolisms I see in your dream is the idea of  peace, feeling safe and cared for, and the unconditional of those you have loved unconditionally (your cats). Like someone in an earlier post said, it sounds like a transition dream esp where you said, unlike most of your other dreams, you are not in the lead in this one. But that things are \"ok\" even though you are not in the lead.  I hope one of the feelings you had when you woke from the dream was a sense of peace and safety because that is how it read to me.  ",

Many of us here call  it \"pinkwashing\" When have heard soooooooooo much about breast cancer, that when something goes wrong with our breasts, it's the first thing we think of. And for you since your mother died of BC, it's even all the more magnified. But the reality that are TONS of things that can happen to our breasts that have nothing, nada, zip, zippo, to do with breast cancer.  But we are so pinkwashed, the fear sets in the moment there is something \"different\" What you really need to do is to have a good sit down with your Dr and talk about this. Express your concerns, your fears.  Would the BRCA testing help because of your mother? Not necessarily. It's when a woman's family history is heavy with BC and/or Ovarian cancer is suspected that it's look to. That means, mother, sisters, aunts, etc. More than just one relative. The two biggest risk factors for getting BC are these. Being female and getting older.  I hope you call your Dr and can have a productive conservation. I think that would help you the most. ",

Is it cancer, some say yes, some say no. Sometimes in does because invasive, sometimes it doesnt. So your confusion there really is just reflecting the confusion that even the experts argue over about it. AFA as clusters. Yes, it's the clustering of microcalcifications (not macrocalcifications), that is a \"yellow flag\" of something possibly be suspicious. If they are not clusters, it's not really alarming. If I recall correctly from my past research, it's the idea that the clusters could possibly being signally necrosis (the dying of cells). Something like that. I want to see if I can find one of Beesie's posts to help clarify (she is a poster here who has done extensive research as a laywoman with DCIS into it)  Ok here is one It's in the DCIS forum and it's entitled \"DCIS facts and misinformation\" community.breastcancer.org/for... ",

From what you posted, no you are not really being kept in the dark, even though it seems like it, and that is understandable. But I would advise that you get copies of those U/S and mammogram reports, (which you are legally entitled to), and also tell them that you want a copy of the pathology report (another name for the biopsy result report). At this point, until you have biopsy, they just may not have much to tell you other than the masses that are seen. With that said, get copies of those reports, and post them here, and we can help you better understand what they are seeing and how concerned they are.",

Many women have B9 lumps removed for peace of mind.  I chose not to do anything with mine. Both myself and the BS was fine with that as surgery would pose other possible problems for me. Core biopsy is a normal recommendation. The idea of spreading cancer cells due to biopsy is an e.x.t.r.e.m.e.l.y. E.X.T.R.E.M.E.L.Y. rare, very rare possibility. Very rare very rare. My biopsy was stereotatic. So imaged guided (my tumor is not palpable and deep inside near the chest wall.) You are numbed up so there is little discomfort was my experience. Since your (if I recall correctly) is closer to the surface it really shouldnt be a problem. It's when it's image guided that it gets more complex because of all the imagine equipment.  Can your husband be with you? Mmm not sure. Are you having it done in the Dr office? Or other place. I know there was no way they were going to let anyone in the procedure room when I had mine done. My experiencing watching the ladies here is that inconclusive results are not common. If there is any question what they do is send the sample to another facility to have another pathologist look at it.",

Because of my situation (paraplegic who is chair mobile with a manual wheelchair) and considering that the tumor is in the 4 o'clock position against the chest wall (it's not even palapable) I personally prefer not to remove it. Complications to that kind of surgery, and how I use my arms and chest all the time, would out weigh any concern of leaving it alone. (Im not worried about it).

What exactly would be the benefit of getting a BRCA test done  in the big picture other than to know whether or not you are + or - My understanding is that even when women test + for BRCA, that is only an indiction of possible risk of getting BC.

A radial scar is a benign hyperplastic proliferative disease of the breast. Proposed possible causes include localized inflammatory reaction and chronic ischemia with subsequent slow infarction. Histopathologically radial scars contain hyperplastic tissue cells and a central fibrous core, with radial extension of tubular structures (the spiculated peripheral borders), mimicking infiltrating carcinoma. This tubular formation has two rows of cells, epithelial and myoepithelial 9-10. The malignant potential is two times greater than in the normal population without radial scar 11-12.   (and to go back to post that 'Leaf' posted in this thread back in Aug of 2009) Be very, very, very careful about statistics. As Mark Twain said, \"There are lies, damn lies, and statistics.\" There is controversy about how much risk a radial scar portrays, but in this paper they get a relative risk of almost 2. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18297395 What is relative risk? www.breastcancer.org/risk/unde... When they say 'double your risk' it does NOT NOT NOT mean 2 x the lifetime risk of the average woman (in the US) = 2 x 12 % = 24%. When they say 'double the risk' they mean double the risk of the woman WITHOUT any particular risk factors. (The average woman in the US has some risk factors.) The figures I've seen tossed about for this 'base' risk factor is about 3-5%, so double that risk would mean a lifetime risk of about 6-10%. These are estimates, of course.  (Marie here: about risk factors. Concerned it's important to remember that the 2 biggest risks that ALL women have are a)being a woman and b) getting older. Those are THE biggest factors in getting BC)",

Keep yourself busy until you get the biopsy (which usually not that bad, to be honest) and the results. Get a copy of those results, as well.

With that said, if the area was screaming cancer, you would have a BIRAD5, not a BIRAD4. 80% of BIRAD4 comes back B9. Remember that. With the very little information you have shared, it sounds like they are recommending a biopsy because of the increase of microcals. Microcals are NOT cancer, but what they can do is raise a flag of pre-cancer or very very early stage (knowns as DCIS, a NON-invasive very early cancer) SO take some more deep breathes.

Because of how they may appear on a mammo (clustered), they are often biopsies as they can be an early indication of early stage BC. But not always. Microcals, in and of themselves, are not cancer. They are what can be the left overs of dying cancer cells. Also, there are all kinds of things that cause microcals. Most of which are NOT cancer  I hope that make sense  ",

The medium to rapid enhancement is a way of describing the blood flow to these nodules. The contrast dye that you were given shows how quickly (or not quickly) the nodes are getting blood to them. Many cancers needs blood to grow. Now it's important to know that MRI's are notorious for picking up everything, and that includes things that are not cancer. There are other conditions which will also have blood flow to them that would show medium to rapid enhancement Because of the blood flow (medium to rapid enhancement) they are doing the prudent thing sending you to a breast surgeon. Most likely you will have some sort of biopsy done.  ***PLEASE NOTE THIS***** In no way am I saying you have cancer. Even your MRI isnt saying that.

You do have a flag of concern, but it's not screaming cancer. And yes, there things that can show up on mammo's/US's and MRI's that \"scream\" cancer.

I am sure if someone who has researched aprocine cysts more knows more about it, they will add their insight. I wouldn't be too concerned for them wanting a core biopsy done.

It's also important to remember that a radiologist is a doctor with their specialty in those procedures that have to do with imaging. Based on what you have posted, she is concerned on how the lymph nodes look now based on how they have looked in the past. That is significant, and should not be overlooked. It sounds like to me, based on what you have posted, she wants to get the pathology report back on the this biopsy first, and then deal with the lymph node changes. (IE one step at a time). It sounds like you are in very good hands that that she is not going to let you fall thru the cracks and that she wants to make sure that definitive answers are found to explain the changes she is seeing on the imaging. If you are wondering \"are the other reasons beside cancer that can explain the changes in lymph nodes?\". The answer is yes. Infection being one. So take slow deep breaths. You don't have any solid answers yet. Only a biopsy can do that. You have a Dr there who is making sure solid answers are found.",

If you are at high risk, I would recommend getting to know the ladies in the \"At High Risk\" forum. They know what it's like to have to face repeated biopsies and other such realities when one is known to be at high risk. So glad that your results are B9 and I hope any biopsies you may have to endure in the future are as well. And if there is every time that they do come back positive, that it's caught very early. So many ladies here wish that they could have caught their BC early. HUGS and the best of everything to you. :)",

When they are like this, based on what I have learned and seen women come thru here with similar, it is possible that DCIS is present. It's a non-invasive form of cancer and basically the earliest stage (Stage 0 , I believe is the classification.) You may want to read up on that. DCIS (Ductal carcinoma In Situ). You may also what to read up on terms such as \"Grade\", \"Stage\" \"Form\". Again, biopsy is the gold standard so only that can tell you. **IF** it comes back positive for DCIS, know this. It may take a bit more time for what YOU are dealing with to come into view. \"Breast cancer\" is an umbrella term that covers a whole host of different cancerS that can effect the breast. Pure DCIS is normally treated surgically and often times with radiation, but not chemo, since it is not invasive (IE it has not invaded the breast tissue and is contained the the ducts)",

Mammos tend not to be good imaging techniques for someone your age because younger breast tissue is more dense, making mammo's not very useful. However since your clinical signs are so clearly obvious it could be that it did show something. That said, with the way you describe your breast and the \"caving in\" look and retracted nipple, something IS going on. And no radiologist can look at a film and say it's \"fat necrosis\"...only a biopsy can tell you that. Go for the MRI and then get copies of all the reports, including the mammo, and post the results here, and we can help you understand what is being said. Don't be surprised if you are sent for a biopsy. Agains something is going on with your breast, and it's important you find out what One step at a time. You need to find out definitive answers as to why this is happening to your breast. (AFA as double Mx to \"just get rid of them\", having a mastectomy comes with it's own set of problems and complications, so you don't want to that. Besides, if you do have cancer, and your clinical signs are troubling to be sure, having an Mx most likely won't be enough. ",

Getting it checkout is the right thing to do. Should you be concerned? No, not at this point. Many things happen to our breasts that have nothing to do with cancer. It's highly likely your dr will order a Mammo and/or a US. From there, a next step, if there is to be one, will be determined if necessary. Even if they want to do a biopsy, 80% of those are benign too. Many times they do a biopsy to have an answer to the question of \"what is this?\" Doesn't mean they think it's cancer. There are all kinds of B9 lumps that can show up in our breasts. So hang on. You are doing the right thing. If you have mammo and/or U/S done, you can get a copy of the radiology report and there are several of us here who can help put it into layman's terms as to what they are seeing and where on the spectrum of \"concern/no concern\" it falls. Again Welcome. Feel free to ask any questions or just vent. Whatever you need :)",

Hormonal fluctuations can cause breast pain. I know that is happening to me right now. Im 52. Diet can also be a contributing factor.  Breast pain here a link. What do your reports say as to the degree of density in your breasts? In some states, like mine of CT, if a radiologist reports that a woman has extremely dense breasts in their reports, then insurance can't deny an MRI. There is an actual grading system of density. Do you have the actual copies of your reports? If not, I would get them. Another option would be to see a second opinion and see what they say.  Another link explaining breast pain",

At your age, you may very well be peri-menopausal and that is a possible explanation. The pain I have is only in one breast and it's due to hormones. When you say your Dr., what kind of doctor are they? Your PCP? OB/GYN?  Ok, I just check CA law (at least as of 2015) and, at least with MRI's, yes your insurance company can deny covering one. Not sure about U/S. If anything, I find it odd that they don't do a U/S because that is usually is a better option than mammos. Hopefully djmammo will pop in and give you some insight. ",

Having it removed is most definitely something you can request, regardless if it's B9 or not (obviously it's coming out if not). Try your best not to panic with your dr saying \"its suspicious\". There is an spectrum of what \"suspcious\" means when it comes to what a radiologist says. That may simply mean that they, based on their training, cant say with 100% confidenence what exactly it is. So a biopsy is needed. 80% of biopsies come back B9. If you would like, if you chose to get a copy of the radiologist's report (it's your legal right to have a copy if you want one), some of us here can help you better understand what the concern is in more layman's terms. Even then, though, we cant tell you for sure if it's cancer or not. Only a biopsy can. These reports, to put it in a more simplistic way, can give you and indication of is it a more yellow flag of concern or is it a red flag of concern.  ",

I find it a way of helping those who are bound up in the fear and anxiety of a possible Dx, since I know what that is like. I also see it as a way of  being a sentinal for those of you who are fighting it. I get the impression that many women who are fighting it may not have the patience of dealing with the fear, and sometimes irrational fears, of those who have are going thru the diagnostic process. But to be fair, I have been a paraplegic for 40 years so I know how to deal with people who are fearful of various medical conditions. I tend not to get wrapped up in their fears, but can be of assistance in some ways. Some people are hardwired to be fearful, anxious. I can see why it would not be helpful to them to hang out on a cancer board. But I am not hardwired that way.   I think of it as being the \"receptionist\" that you first meet when you walk into a Dr office. A friendly face and smile of re-assurance that you are in good hands and that people care... ",

We have had it drilled into our head that \"if you find a lump get it checked out\". What we arent taught is that most lumps are not cancer. And it doesnt help when people, well meaning as they are, say \"you will be fine\". No one knows at this point what the lump is. It cant be known by imagining alone (mammos, ultra sounds etc) exactly what it is but it can give some insight, so dont be surprised if they ask for a biopsy. You said it's at the 10 oclock position and 3cm x1 cm. Does that mean you have had a mammo or US done? Do you have a copy of the radiologist report? If so, some of us can help you wade thru some of the medical-ese and give you an idea of what is being seen. At this point it's really hard to know anything other than there is a lump and the doctors what to find out exacly what it is. The waiting is hard. Very hard. Try to keep busy and occupied. Biggest piece of advise, dont go doing too much research out on the internet. You will feed those dark thoughts you are having and it may very well be for no good reason. ",

Having a biopsy done for calcifications is really quite common so don't panic (HARD NOT TO, though, we know this) Most biospies do come back B9 so hold onto that. (80%) If by some chance it does come back positive, take a deep breathe. From what you described it's in a very very early form. Breast cancer (and know that is an umbrella term that is used to describe a vast host of different kinds of cancer that can affect the breast) in the early stages is VERY treatable these days.   And \"if\" it comes back positive (and from what you said, I do emphasis \"IF\" ) it will take a bit more testing to find out exactly WHAT kind of cancer you are dealing with. And that will determine what kind of options and choices you have in dealing with it. My advice right now, hang tight as best you can while you  wait for the biopsy results.  Depending upon the results, then go from there. In the mean time, dont do too much research (it can be frightening if you dont know what you are dealing with).",

Not with the techs. :) I would suggest getting a copy of the radiologist report on your diagnostic mammo. Good luck and keep us updated.",

She spent a great deal of time looking, taking messurements etc etc. Her look was serious and focus. In the end, something was there that only a biopsy could tell us what it was. It was a PASH tumor. Benign. When something is seen that isnt readily decernable as to what it is, it's not uncommon for the radiologist to come in and take a closer look. But that doesnt mean it's cancer. It just means that a biopsy is warrented. The truth is this in the end. Nothing is definitive for the most part until a biopsy is done. We have had women come in here with mammos and US that were \"highly\" suspicious for malignancy, but in the end, it was B9. We have also had women come here with mammos and US not really all that concern or suggestive of malignancy and have it come back as cancer. We have had everything in the middle to. It's really really hard to not to try and diagnose one's self with imaging alone. But only a biopsy is definitive. We are here for you either way. It is HARD we know.  ",

Truth be told, there are many things that can happen to our breast that have nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with breast cancer. Getting a biopsy is a prudent thing to do, just to figure out what is going on, if anything.  Our lymph nodes can swell for many reasons, including infection.  So, in all honesty, take a deep breath and relax.

So it is an anxiety causing time  Blood flow \"can possibly\" (emphasis that) be a sign that a mass is malignant, but it's not the only kind of lesion that will have blood flow. Other B9 conditions can do that too. Hang tight. Try your best NOT to research too much. It will only add fuel to your imagination at this point. Wait until you get more definitive answers from a pathology report on a biopsy. If you have questions feel free. Im sorry that the rest of your life at this point makes all of this just that much more frightening and anxiety causing. Those of us here will help with what we can as best we can.  ",

I suggest not doing too much research at this point on the internet as it can just freak you out and you really dont know what you are dealing with.

Try your best not to panic, dont do too much research on google (you will just be reading stuff that more often than not has nothing to do with what you are dealing with) Google is helpful AFTER you know exactly. Not so much before.   Best thing for you to know, is that since you are having it removed, you dont have to go thru all the hoop jumping of pushing for a biopsy. That will automatically be done.  ",

Have you asked to be sure that the biopsy is covered by your insurance with a BIRAD 3? (Don't assume anything with insurance. Check) If you have mental health struggles with anxiety and worry etc, and a biopsy will be the only way of handling it, then do what is best for your mental health. You don't need anyone's permission here to have a biopsy. :) If you are looking for us to validate your desire to have one, mostly likely you won't find it here, either, with a BIRAD 3. Like Chi said, the most of the women here would have given their eye teeth for a BIRAD 3 with 6 months follow up. 6 Months is not a long period of time. It sounds like you want to go ahead with the biopsy regardless of what our input is. So do it. :) Again, you don't need our permission. ",

What you are having is a lumpectomy or an excisional biopsy. (Pretty much the same thing). A day or so off is fine. You wont needs weeks. It's not as scary as it sounds. It's not a mastecomy. You will be fine in a day or so.  First off, most masses are not cancer, so remember that. In terms of your question about where can breast cancers occur in the breast---the answer is anywhere. They will take the mass and put the tissue under a microscope to figure out exactly \"what\" it is. When is your surgery schedualed? ",

It just struck me as odd about both the biop and the SNBiop...  You asked if it's possible for it to be so clearly cancer that even a tech can tell. The short answer is yes. Sometimes it is that obvious. They cant give you an official Dx though without a biopsy however. (There is a lady on this board who was told by her Dr that if for some reason the biopsy came back negative, that they would go in and do a lumpectomy to make sure they got the whole area because the Dr knew she had cancer. And she did.) If you were told there is a 95% chance of being cancer that means a BIRAD 5. We have had a couple of women this past year with a BIRAD 5 come back B9, but that it not the norm. Most of them do come back positive.   Other women on this board have had similar situations of being told that yea, that they had cancer and that the biopsy would confirm that. Sounds like you are absolutely surrounded by quality care for this.  That is good.  Take it one step at a time. And wait until you get all the information together. \"Breast cancer\" is really an umbrella term that describes all kinds of cancer that can effect the breast. What you may have may not be exactly what your sister has.  We are hear for you. There are also wonderful women in the other part of these boards who are on this journey. Though I think you are the first lady I know who may very well have it while dealing with your sister's treatment. That leaves me kind of dumbfounded on what to say to you.  ",

In my view, a biopsy is overkill based on the report. Seriously. Also you must keep in mind that anytime a biopsy is done, scar tissue is formed, which can impact further imagining as you grow older.

If so, it will be helpful in you can copy it word for word. From what I remember, you were given a BIRAD 4? Being sent to a breast surgeon in and of itself is not necessarily worrisome. It's prudent since it's their area of specialty. But not necessarily worrisome. If you do have the report, we can help you better understand :) EDIT: I read back. You were given a BIRAD 3, which means most likely B9!!    Don't worry about the breast surgeon. Perhaps you are being sent to help ease your own anxiety. That is a good thing if you are extremely worried  AFA your PCP being a radiologist, he was one 20 YEARS ago. He is not an expert, not by a long shot. There has been a TON of advancement in radiology in 20 years. I doubt he has kept up with all the development  area of medicine in general, never mind breasts specifically I would have far more trust in a present day radiology of 2014 than one who practiced it 1994. That is a lot of time to be out of a medical specialty. He is not \"rusty\"; he is out of the loop. Mammography has made GREAT advancements. Not sure if MRI's even existed? ",

If you look down the left side of the page, you will even see a link to how \"stage\" is determined. But there are other things besides \"stage\". There is \"type\", \"grade\" etc. Keep breathing. A lot of information is going to be coming your way. Remember that \"breast cancer\" is an umbrella term that covers well over 20+ different kinds of breast cancerS that affect the breast. You will be learning what kind YOU have.  Keep breathing",

Always keep that in mind. That is why it's important to get annual mammograms and follow up accordingly.  Dont get lulled into thinking you are \"safe\" because you can check off various \"risk factors\" with \"no\"  If you are a woman, and you are getting older, you are at risk.

Some can be ruled out by imaging alone. Im don't recall. Do you have the radiologist's report? If not get it. We can help you understand which areas may need biopsing and why other won't. Cysts don't need to be biopsied. Things that are clearly fibros, also don't really need to be biopsied if they have the classic fibroendanoma look to them Best thing to do is exactly what you are doing to get piece of mind. Seeking a second opinion with experts.  We understand your fear and anxiety. And we understand you need to have answers. Just try to separate your anxiety and fear and don't let that control you and push you into the fear of self-diagnosing yourself.",

They \"take the weekend off\" from cancer. They don't come here, they don't talk about it at home, they don't ANYTHING related to breast cancer. They literally take the weakend off. So when you go on vacation, do  you best to leave all the cares, concerns, worries, fears, whatever, here. Leave them all right here, on BCO. It will be here when you get back. It won't be easy but try. Make a pledge with your husband. No cancer talk on vacay. No serious stuff. Just smiles, lots of loving, whatever (Of course if you both find that it hits you while on vacay and the tears flow, let them. But don't get stuck in those tears for the duration of you vacay) You will be able to do this. It won't be the easiest thing in the world, but you WILL be able to do this. Promise. And yes, Stay off Dr Google.  And yes, you do have an excellent Dr there. They are right. Go now on vacation. The next months are gonna be busy and whirlwind. Soak the sunshine!! And the warmth!!!",

While you are waiting to get the biopsy and have more factual information come in based on your situation, I wanted to point out to you in the \"Just Diagnosed\" section of the  boards there is a great sticky thread at the top that is for newbies to help start getting your ducks in a row. It has some great practical advice as you begin this. A couple of thoughts for you at this point. 1)it's gonna take a bit of time to figure out what specifically YOU are dealing with. 'Breast cancer\" is an umbrella terms that covers a whole host of different kinds of cancerS that can effect the breast. 2) If you find that anxiety, fear and worry are unmanagable, ask for a prescript for an anxiety med. Many women, including those who stear clear of pills, find that this is needed, esp in the early stages. There will be a great deal of information heading your and you need to be as calm as you can be as you navigate all of this. 3)Stay away from research a great deal at this point. Wait until you get more information. You will be hearing terms like \"stage\" \"grade\" \"hormonal receptors\" etc etc. The main page of breastcancer.org at the top has tab that is very helpful when it comes to understanding diagnosis, treatment, terms etc etc. Keep taking slow deep breathes. The beginning part of all of this is overwhelming. But hang in there. It will get better as things become clearer and a treatment plan is put into place",

One thing you can ask about since you have very dense breasts is having an MRI. In my state (CT) if a woman is most dense breast tissue, an MRI can not be denied them. So when you get the results of your biopsy, talk this over with the surgeon or the Dr. The different imagine shows different things. Mammos aren't that great dense tissue. US can't pick up microcals, MRI's pick up EVERYTHING and are notorious for false positives (and are expensive), so aren't ordered nearly as much. But if you have Extremely dense breasts, then I highly recommend talking to your Dr about getting one, if for no other reason to have a baseline of what your breasts are like.  The waiting is hard. I found the anxiety almost debilitating  Oh and the 50 years of age thing, push back against that. HARD. Don't accept that. There certainly are enough women here in there 40's with BC. Be proactive---even aggressive---with that one...",

Get solid information before making any drastic decisions like Mx or hysterectomy. And yes, second, even 3rd opinions. You are not in a situation that you have to make a decision *RIGHT NOW*. You have time to research and weigh your options based on YOUR individual situation. For example, with DCIS, you will not get chemo. It simply not done for DCIS.

Continue with the icepacks for that is the best help. In the meantime, how can I help right now, tonight? Do you have questions that are swirling that you need to ask? What I am hearing from you *right now* is that you are feeling alone and very scared  AFA how long before results, it depends on the lab that is used. Average is 5-7 days. It's getting late where I live (north east USA) so I will be off to bed soon, but I will be checking in if you have any questions. Post them and I will get to them. ",

So glad you found someone to listen to you and that they are moving forward to find out what it is. Anther possibility is something called PASH. Is it possible to have BC at 23? Yes, it is \"possible\" but highly, really highly, unlikely. A fibroadenoma, PASH are much more likely at you age, as well as a phyllode tumor (though not sure how likely that is. I don't know much about them.) SO hang on. Really really good chance your condition is B9. But you are doing the right thing as to getting it taking cared of. Please keep us updated. The biopsy will give you your exact diagnosis.",

The answer to your question is, the are things that can be seen on imaging that are \"red flags\". Only a biopsy is definitive however. If your results come back positive, know you have found a great site to help you thru this. Where you are right now tends to be the more scary part of the journey. A couple of thoughts for you right now. BREATH slowly in and out. Seriously. It can help when the anxiety goes thru the roof. If the results are positive, try not to panic (HARD AS HELL THAT ONE) but try. There is a spectrum of different kinds of \"breast cancer\". It will take time and more testing to find out \"what kind\" you may be dealing with. If you need some help with staying \"calm\", make sure you ask your doctor for some help, prescription wise. Get copy of all your reports. There is a great thread in the \"Just Diagnosed\" forum that gives you tips how to get prepared. BIGGEST TIP: Doing research is good BUT it's important not to get too far ahead of yourself. That will only fuel fear and anxiety. And you dont need that. If you surf these boards try and stay within the threads that most match where you are at right now. Otherwise you will feel overwhelmed, never mind freaked out. Again you dont need that. In many ways, dealing with BC is \"do-able\". That is not to say it's easy, or like walking on the beach. But \"do-able\" Another big tip. If your results are positive, seek a breast surgeon, and if there is a \"breast care\" kinda of center in your area. You want a team of drs who know breasts. That its there main focus. Let the ladies here know what you need, how you feel. The sisterhood rages strong. :) ",

So having a lesion removed is always a viable option.  But the PASH itself is Not cancer. It's another finding that was found with the cancer(in her case DCIS, a non-invasive form). ",

Yes to that too. I had PASH and chose not to have it removed as it was not bothering me, and mine did go away. Monitoring it to see if it grows is a reasonable path if one choses. Or having it removed, if one choses. Sometimes it does continue to grow where it causes pain, and in that instance it is usually removed.  Michelle, how large is your lesion? If it is small, removal wont make a marked difference. If it is larger, then yes it can.  With PASH,  you dont have to make a decision \"right now\". ",

Meaning extremely rare) Pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia (PASH) is a type of benign breast lesion that occurs as a single palpable mass or a dense region on a mammogram The masses observed in individuals with PASH are benign (non-cancerous) and require diagnosis only to distinguish them from cancerous (malignant) lesions.  It may be mistaken for angiosarcoma; however, the breast lesions caused by angiosarcoma are different than those seen in PASH The size of PASH lesions range from incidental microscopic findings to breast masses that are palpable or evident on a mammogram. Masses are usually large (5-6 cm in diameter), with reported diameters ranging from 1 to 12 cm.  The masses may grow over time PASH most commonly affects premenopausal women. The age range of people diagnosed with PASH is 14-67 years; however, most individuals are diagnosed in their late thirties or forties Surgical removal of the PASH lesions has been performed in some individuals.  A wide margin around the mass may be removed to prevent recurrence. Although PASH lesions often grow over time and may recur, they are neither associated with malignancy (cancer) nor considered to be premalignant (pre-cancerous).[1]  According to the medical text, CONN's Current Therapy 2007, approximately 7 percent of people experience a recurrence of PASH.[2]",

What it means is that there is something there, and they dont know what it is. Most of the time (80%) those areas of concerns are benign. Since this is your first mammo, there are no previous mammos to compare this \"area of concern\" to. They are just wanting to just check into it. It doesnt mean they think you have cancer. Not by any means. They just see something that they can't identify without a biopsy. I know that can seem confusing to us laypeople, but to them they just want to find out definitively \"what is it\" Again, most of the time (80% remember that number) \"what it is\" is something OTHER than cancer. Enjoy your holiday as much as you can. For those of us who have been thru the \"tailspin of terror\" we get what you are going thru.

Im not sure what kind of studies have be done with \"bio-identical replacement therapy\" however. 2) that going off of them will automatically reverse what has happened. Im not sure if that is true. Perhaps it is. I don't know. You mentioned your Doc. Is this your family practicioner? A breast surgeon? Do they know that you have been on bio-identical hormone replacement therapy?

Another option, though it can be expensive and insurances don't like to cover them, is an MRI. In some states, if a woman has dentist breast tissue, insurance company's can't deny them.",

Breasts are natually lumpy for many women and what you are feeling could be just normal breast tissues (fibrocystic breasts. 2) ask thme how dense your breast tissue is. At your age you should be loosing some density now. That is why mammos work better in women 40 and older and not so much younger women. Tissue density. 3) ask them did the mammo pick up any breasts conditions. (I found out when I got my last report that I have a fibroandenoma that I was never told about. I cant feel it. But it's never been a concern and it's never changed so no biggie IMO). 4) Im not sure about Canadian law, but here in the USA we, as patients have a legal right to copies of all reports. It cant hurt for you to have a copy of the actual radiologist's findings. That way, in the future, you, too, can compare. 5)You may find out that the mammo does pick up the lumps and that they can tell what they are (ie fibro, cyst etc). So to you question, should you push to see what the lumps are. I would say, first find out what the mammo report says. Then, based on what it says, then make a decision. Get the report first. That is what I would do, then proceed.  ",

He will get you thru the biopsy too, just ask. AFA the rest. Since there is a higher concern for malignancy, Im gonna recommend, when you are ready, to go to the \"Just Diagnosed\" forum and a sticky thread at the top called \"Just Diagnosed--Get prepared\" In that thread you will find some very practical advice and suggestions to help you thru the early stages if this indeed is BC. With that in mind, dont do too much research just yet. It would be awhile even if you get your preliminary results before you get a really clear picture of what YOU are dealing with. There are a multitude of cancers that effect the breast, each with its own characteristics. What the course of treatment is often differs a great deal person to person. You may want to get some basic understanding by going to the tabs at the top of the BCO page called \"Symptoms and Diangosis\" as well as \"Treatment and side effects\" This will give you a decent overview of BC 101. Have you been in contact with your other doctors that deal with your other medical issues? If not, it may be prudent to give them a call and start putting heads together thinking and strategizing. Gonna need a good team of Dr's who will have good communication with each other.   If your kids are in school, it also may be wise to contact the school  at some point.  See what kind of support system they can get going with your kids.

Based on the little that was in your report ..ie \"\"There has been an interval increase of the asymmetric density of upper outer quadrant of right breast\"....it isn't screaming cancer. (With the caveat that we don't know what the US report said )The radiologist can't identify exactly what this is, so a biopsy will be done. Can radiologist look at something and based on their education make a good educated guess that it's cancer? Yes, they can. You are not in that situation. So hang tight. Dont do any internet research since you don't know enough to filter the information you come across accurately. The biopsy will let you know exactly what the \"There has been an interval increase of the asymmetric density of upper outer quadrant of right breast\" is all about. Many things happen to our breast, and most of those many things, are NOT cancer. Hang in there! The waiting is brutal, we know. If you decide to get a copy of the U/S report, we can help you understand that as well. Up to you. How old are you? Do you know how dense your breast tissue is? Is this asymmetrical density something they have been watching do you know over the years?",

Why do they say you dont need a mamo until 40????? Younger are left on their own with a false sense of safety I think. I AGREE completely. While \"statistically\" it is \"older women\" who get BC, there are plenty enough of younger women who get it too, where NO woman  should have a false sense of security, IMO. Not that women should walk around in fear of getting BC, but we all should be well educated in breast health no matter our age. Another reason, too, is that, typically, younger women Dx-ed with BC tend to have a more aggressive form of it, all the more reason to catch it early. To be fair on the \"age 40\" thing, the truth in that arena is that the younger the breast tissue, the more dense it is so even a mammo for a younger woman is no promise of finding anything suspicious. This can be true for even an older woman with dense tissue. Mammos are not fool-proof. That being said, I am glad that I came up with the guidelines that suggested getting a baseline mammo at 35 (I did) and then annuals starting at 40 (I have). It was because of that history of mammos that was able to show, that when I went for my annual last Nov., that there was a very clear new finding that had never been there in all previous films. I think that should be stressed for women. Get a baseline in your 30's. I live in CT where now it is required by state law (pushed by our former Gov. who was Dx-ed with BC while in office)  that each woman's mammo report let her know how dense her breast tissue is. If it meets a certain standard, then their insurance companies can not deny her a Breast MRI, which is a better way of screening very dense breasts. I hope this kind of law goes into effect across the states ",

That you have cancer.  I would think your nerves are raw and frayed. Take slow deep breathes. When you see the Dr on Friday, ask for a prescrip for an anti-anxiety or what they think would be helpful to you, emotionally speaking. You will have a basic Dx of cancer, but a more indepth Dx of exactly what kind of cancer, its characteristics (which will determine treatment) will take a bit longer. Chemo first, called neo-adjuctive chemo (I think that is the wording) is when they give you chemo to shrink the turmor. And MRI (and perhaps other testing) will give them a bigger and better picture of what is going on.  Read the information they gave you. Bring someone with you to your appointment to either write down or record what Dr says. Going emotionally \"numb\" and not hearing or understand everything that is said to you is normal. A lot of information is going to be coming your way and having someone there will help you since you wont be able to absorb everything. Try to stay focused on where you are at in your journey. Not everything, not even in these forums, will pertain to you. I hightly recommend that you go to the main page of breastcancer.org and look under the \"Diagnosis and Treatment\" tabs. There is all kinds of medical-eze to wade thru and breastcancer.org's main section breaks it down into lanuage that laypeople can understand God Bless",

We all understand the emotions you are feeling right now the getting all those fears out is helpful. As you know, we cant tell you exactly what is going on with your breast, but it is a good that you are seeing your GYN in a couple of weeks. My only advice based on observing the various ladies here is that dont let your GYN brush it aside as \"nothing\". Tell them you want to find out what it is. With fibrocystic breasts and age a mammo may not be helpful, but at least a US. Make sure you show them the indention just like you described to us, even if it means you doing the positions you explained. We will be here for you. Stay away from Dr Google right now. He never is much of help at the \"worried\" stage and just gives you so much information that just doesnt apply.   Seeing your DR is the best course of action at this point. Good luck... ",

This is the right place. At this point, just try to keep busy until they figure out what it is they are wanting more pictures of. Feel free to get copies of the radiologist reports of your mammos, U/S and any other testing you may have. Since you have concerns, and listed some risk factors, perhaps start a file of all these reports. You may be fine now, but for future reference as well. Remember this two. The 2 BIGGEST risks for getting BC are these. 1) Being a woman 2) getting older. Those even trump family history, etc etc. (Most of the women on these boards have had children and breast fed them, so I dont really buy into the *risks* of not having kids or not breast feeding them as truly risk factors) For now, try to stay distracted. You are in the \" *what is it* waiting room\" and that can be unnerving. Dont get ahead of yourself, and dont do too much googling. Truth is a lot of what you read is most likely outdated. Plus \"breast cancer\" is an umbrella term that covers a very very WIDE varieties of different kinds of cancerS that can effect the breast... Take deep slow breaths if you feel a wave of anxiety hit you.... Oh and with your dense breast tissue, (you didnt mention your age) you may want to consider getting an MRI. mammos dont do well with dense tissue...",

I think you should take all of that energy and focus on your very real and medical proven diagnosis of diabetes. That is real. That has been proven. You need to educate and get yourself educated on THAT right now. When you have something definitive about what is going on with your breasts, then deal with that then. But right now, what you have on your plate is diabetes. That is more than enough. Time to focus on that reality.  ",

Lumps in breast is really doesnt sound worriesome because breasts are lumpy. It's when A  new and distinctive lump shows up that it needs to be checked out.  Has your right breast normally fuller than the left? If you are right handed, it should be. Breasts are not symmetrical. One is always fuller. It's only if this is a new finding that it needs to be checked out. I've gone over all your posts and what I do get is that you havent been aware of what is normal for your breasts....I'm betting that now you have looked a paid a ateention you are noticing what ids normal for you. Nothing you have wriiten is what I would call \"symptoms of breast cancer\". I would call it normal breasts for a 44 y/o woman.  Since you have never had a baseline mammogram before, it's good you went and had one. It will give them a baseline, plus it will give them a chance to see if anything needs a closer look. When new women come here I often use the analogy of what kind of flags are being raised---a red flag for serious cocern---a yellow flag for a semi-concern. From what you have wriiten, I wouldnt even say that you have raised a flag, red or yellow. Let's now wait and see what your mammo shows. Thus far, there is nothing you haven written is saying \"breast cancer concern\"...Nothing.  ",

Which makes more sense. You will be getting another report, the actual report of the biopsy which will give you the answer as to whether or not it's cancer. Based on what the U/S report says in describing what was seen on the U/S, and the 4a, it's really leaning towards, and in a big way, being B9. IE not cancer. In more clear terms, you do not have the report from the core biopsy yet. What you have is the report of the ultrasound, since you had an ultrasound guided biopsy. The report from the biopsy is called a pathology report. Not a radiological report. :)",

Getting removed is the right course of action and then you will be monitored more closely than the \"average\" woman who also doesnt have BC. That way you dont fall thru the cracks. I recommend that you go to the forum called \"High Risk\"....the ladies there will help explain and give you some great insight and advise...",

You said that you have received the core biopsy results for the two new findings and it reads \"Two intraductal hypoechoic masses both with several punctate echogenicities.\" Were these reports from the Core Biopsy? Or the ultrasound? If it was from the core biopsies, did it have a BIRADS rating? (To be honest, it sounds like the U/S report, not the pathology report) \"Two intraductal hypoechoic masses both with several punctate echogenicities\" doesn't not sound alarming to me, as they both sound like they have well defined borders. But that is only my opinion",

Punctuate means characterized by dots or points Echogenicity is the ability to bounce an echo, e.g. return the signal in ultrasound examinations. In other words, Echogenicity is higher when the surface bouncing the sound echo reflects increased sound waves. \"punctate echogenicities and hypo echoic masses\" is the medical-eze words used by the radiologist to describe how the ultrasound waves are reacting, and the image they are producing. So you have two masses showing up. Based on your entire radiological report, which includes the BIRADS 4a reading, it's not alarming. A BIRAD 4a is very close to a BIRAD 3, which means \"probably benign\" You have a good report there, with those two masses. :)",

It will take a bit of time for YOUR picture to come into view. It will be based on that picture that a treatment plan will come together. Many times you do have options within that, based on what is found. If you need some sort of help with the dealing of the anxiety etc (anti-anxiety meds) please ask for them. Most women, including those who tend to push pills away do find that, especially in the early stages, the meds very helpful at keeping their head calmer. So don't hesitate if you think it would be helpful Top of this forum \"Just Diagnosed\" you will find a sticky for \"newbies\" Some very practical advice and insights that can help you get a sense of having control.  Most of the women who come here explain the process of \"it's sucks, yea, but it was more do-able than I first thought\" So, keep taking deep breathes.  Also know that on the weekends often times the boards get a bit more quiet as many of the women here \"take the weekend off from anything cancer\".

Tell that to your Dr so that they hear why you are scared. With that, this is something that is very important to understand. MANY things can happen to our breasts that have nothing to do with cancer. There a different kinds of lumps that are quite common in young women your age. Things like cysts, and fibroendanomas, etc. Infact, most lumps are NOT cancer. You are doing the right thing in getting that checked out. Any lumps or breast changes need to be checked out. It's not likely that they will recommend a mammogram for you because they don't work well with dense breast tissue, which at your age, you have. They may an ultra sound however which will work better. Now, based on your use of the word \"Mum\" and not \"Mom\", Im guessing you are either from Europe or Australia. I don't know what kind of laws or health care is at your disposal, but if you are extremely anxious over this, try to impress upon them that you need AN ANSWER definitavely one way or the other, which would mean a biopsy to put your mind at ease if an ultrasound does not give you a definitive idea of what is going on. (Here in the USA, we have a right to having copies of any reports, be it radiology or pathology etc. If that is something you, too, can get a copy of, if they do a U/S, get one. We can help.) In the mean time, get into the Dr and have it checked. STRESS to them that with you mother's BC at early 40's that you are very scared and anxious. That you need to know what this lump is about. Hang in there. We are here for you.",

The good news part of all of that that it seems to be minimal. The next step is to gather all the information of exactly what and how much is going on, and then get a game plan together on how to deal with. Also you may want to consider a 2nd, 3rd opinions when you get all the testing done. My first impulse is to say \"hang in there\" but it seems so hallow considering how you must be feeling.

I've gotten to know what raises flags of concern when women post here with their symptoms. You haven't posted anything that raised flags, not even yellow ones.  ",

Would love to meet you for lunch or something and just talk. I am willing to bet that you are fine when it comes to your fears of IBC, and that all you are experiencing is more related to EVERYTHING else you are dealing with and the anxiety. My sister took care of my step-father when he was declining with alzheimers and it really did take a toll on her health, too. And sent her anxiety thru the roof. She is the one who is dealing with PTSD now. Like you said, Anxiety is the worse. It really is. ",

Exactly what did the report say about the density of your breast tissue? So check specifically your state laws, and specifically how dense your tissue is. The percentage of density is important. ",

But with the family history of BC, it is important for them to find out exactly what the focal asymmtery is.

Stay away from Dr Google. Until you know what exactly YOU are dealing with, he wont be helpful. \"Breast cancer\" is an umbrella term that describes a whole host of different kinds of cancers that can affect the breast. Some are very aggressive and faster growing. Others are slow and sluggish. There are just too many variables because there are so many different kinds of cancers. Second. I am sorry for the lost of  your sister to ovarian cancer. My sister faced a possible ovarian cancer scare just 2 months ago. Things turn out B9, gratefully. But it was scary scary scary. Also important to point out, and I am no minimzing what your family experience with your sister. \"Cancer\" is very very scary. But not cancers are equal. As a general statement, ovarian cancer is far harder to deal with than many breast cancers. So keep taking those deep breaths that Jane suggested. You need to know what YOU are dealing with, you the the details. What you may be dealing with will be different from what you sister dealth with. And I say that, knowing that cancer, any cancer dx, is terrifying. Try hold onto facts when you get them. Hopefully it will help with the emotions, at least a bit. Also, if you do end up with a Dx of breast cancer, dont be afraid ask for a prescription of some sort of anxiety meds to help you thru. This wont be a time to \"tough it out\". Most women I have seen, even those who have said that they were stalwarts of strength, end up asking and needing something to help keep their mental health at an even keel. That is ok. You may want to head to the \"Just Diagnosed\" forum and start chatting with the ladies there for some insight and support if this does turn out to be BC. Ladies here are very supportive with holding each others hands and letting each other express fear, anger, anxiety, you name it God Bless and keep breathing",

Since your sister did have ovarian cancer and you are looking at a probably BC cancer Dx, I think its a good idea, espically if you or your sister have children. If you want more information on this I would suggest the \"women at high risk\" forum. With the new health care laws I dont think insurance can drop you. Sounds illegal to me. For one thing, even women who do test positive for BRCA 1 or 2 it doesnt mean that they definitely will end up with cancer. It does mean that they are at a greater risk. Being a woman and getting older is actually more of a risk of getting BC than being BRCA 1 or 2 positive. But they do increase the risk",

I think you should considered talking with a mental health professional who deals with people who have cancer. I think you need to have someone there that you can talk opening with about your sister, her death, your family and your own Dx and now personal journey fighting BC. Dont do this alone. You seem to feel the need to take care of others (understandable) and are looking at their reactions and how they are being. All well and good. But you need to also take care of your health. Seriously, consider talking to someone who is a professional in dealing with cancer patients mental health needs. When you get your BC team together, talk to your oncologist about this. Im sure they can recommend someone or point you in the right direction. Your sister's Dx and subsequent death is clearly haunting you (forgive the pun, but that is what is sounds like)",

In all the years I have been here, I have known a handful of women Dx-ed with radial scars.

(***opps just re-read your title*** a US....)  Try not to jump so far ahead of all of this. As women we are taught to pay attention to lumps and changes in our breast.

But it is, in the big scheme of things, not as frequent as older women Because the borders of this lump are irregular, having a biopsy done is the very prudent thing to do. Im glad that they didnt brush it aside.  The waiting is hard. All of us know that here. At this point, dont do much research.

In there you will get some good solid practical advise to help you navigate the beginning of this journey, esp if your head is swimming or in something of a fog. Try to stay within those threads that most closely align with where you are at at this particular time in your journey.

Not the completely B9 results that all hoped for, but there are women on this board would would give their eye teeth to have had that diagnosis. I highly recommend the \"High Risk\" forum. There the other ladies can help you understand much of this and what to expect. They can also relate to all of the feelings of concern, anxiety etc that you may be feeling now, or about the future. Mommy, you are so far ahead of the curve in all of this. That is the silver lining to focus on. Please keep us updated on the MRI and lumpectomy.  ",

There are many things that can explain what you are feeling, and a doctor can help that. Most of the women here have breast cancer, so their experience may or may not be helpful. There are many things that can happen that have nothing to do with BC. And you won't find those women here (with the exception of a few of us like myself who stick around to help new people like yourself when you are first worried). Many women who come here initially with breast concerns end up being just fine. Make an appointment to see your doctor and start there. Good luck and let us know how it goes. HUGS",

With the mammo, depending on what is seen, they may also do some diagnostic mammos (it's more focused imaging), possibly a U/S. The radiologist will make that kind of call. You may or may not find out tomorrow what the radiologist recommends. If the radiologist is there on site, you may be told right away either 1) they want a biospy, or2) a follow up mammo in 3 to 6 months, or 3) things are ok, nothing concerning. If the radiologist isn't there at the time, you it may take a day or so. You can ( and I would recommend this) request a copy of the radiologist's report, regardless. That way, you have something to refer to in the future if need me. For me, when I go to have mine done and I am signing in, I tell the receptionist that I want a copy of the report So will you find out anything tomorrow? The answer is it really depends. Maybe yes, maybe no. Don't expect the technician to tell you anything. If anything, they shouldn't. They are only there to take the imagining. They are not to give you any info as they are not the radiologist (who is an MD BTW). If they want a biopsy, again, don't freak out. Even 80% of biopsies are B9. Many times a biopsy is recommended as a matter of prudence, and not necessarily that they think you have cancer. It just that there are some thing that they can't say definitively that it isn't cancer and only a biopsy can do that. ",

Imaging (mammo and U/S) can give a bit of better assessment, but even then they are limited... Get copies of both your mammo and U/S reports. Those of us here can help you wade thru the medical-eze and give you a better understanding of what *MIGHT* (and I stress *might*) be going on.... There is soo much that can happen to our breasts that have NOTHING to do with cancer. With all of the breast cancer awareness focus that has been going on for years, that fact tends to get lost. Most things that happen to our breast have nothing to do with cancer. And that is an important fact",

You will get more information about the tumor itself (i.e. grade, type etc) from the biopsy which will happen from the surgery. That information is ultimately more important than stage. I think your mother has made a wise choice. If you go to the main page of BCO, you can get more information as to things like grade, type of cancer etc. You say you want to do the best thing for your mother? Does that mean she really isn't capable of making her own health decisions anymore (i.e. you are her PoA?). If she is capable of making her own decisions still, then it sounds like she is making the best thing for herself, which is a good. God's blessings!! And enjoy your time with your mother!!!

How old was your grandmother when she had BC? And was it your maternal grandmother (your mother's mother?) Most times we have women coming here thinking that they have Paget's or IBC because of what they see, and it turns out to be a dermatilogical in nature (skin) issue....a fungal infection or something similar What you are describing is not BC symptoms so much as skin issues that just happen to be on your breasts. That's the difference. Good thing to have it checked out",

With you being 30, it makes the mammogram you had not as effective (mammos don't do well with dense tissue, which younger women like yourself have). I wouldn't assume that you are looking at a diagnosis. If anything, it probably is B9. Even with your mother's BC, that doesn't mean you have an increased risk. That happens if there is a genetic componant to BC. Only genetic testing can determine that. Talk with the surgeon. A biopsy may be prudent, that is why they gave it a BIRAD 4. Or you may very well with being ok waiting 3 or 6 months follow up. What we are taught is that many things can happen to our breasts, most of which are B9. That included B9 lumps, like fiberandenomas, which are very common for someone your age. If it were me, I would go with the core biopsy, just for peace of mind. ",

You are in the toughest part right now, the waiting for information. To your question of \"does a solitary lesion mean\" that it seems to not have spread. The best answer is \"perhaps\". Did the Dr say how big the lesion was? First of all \"breast cancer\" is an umbrella term. There are over 20+ different kinds of cancer**S** that can effect the breast, not to mention subtypes. There are even subtypes to subtypes. There are many factors that go into the question of \"has it spread\". One of those things is called \"grade\". There are 3 grades. 1,2,3. Grade 1 is low grade, which means it's not as aggressive as Grade 2 o4 3, and less likely of spreading. That does **NOT ** mean that Grade 3 has definitely spread. It's just that Grade 3 is more aggressive and could possibly have. With that, it doesn't mean that Grade 1 does not spread. It can, too. Only more testing will give you the answer of \"has it spread\". There is so much to learn about BC and you are at the very beginning stages. So hang in there. Only testing is going to give you an idea of what *YOU* personally are dealing with. Stay off Dr Google. He will be of no help to you. Go to BCO's main site and there you can read the beginning ABC's of breast cancer and start getting used to the jargon. Keep breathing. Seriously, take some time to really focus on breathing",

What your report is saying is that there is \"something\" on your mammogram that they, the doctors, cant really be sure what it is. So they are saying you need to have a biopsy to determine if it is B9 or if it is cancer. They simply cant tell. Most BIRAD 4s come back B9, so hang on to that. It's hard to tell you \"what are your chances\" at this point. There just isnt enough information, medically speaking. Best suggestion I would offer right now is to not do a whole lot of research on google or whatever. There is sooo much out there when it comes to breast cancer (and there are a lot of different kinds of cancers of the breast) just like there are a lot of different kinds of other B9 conditions of the breast.

If yours does come back positive it's gonna take some time to find out exactly what you are dealing with. Try to stay in those threads that most closely resembles where you are at. Otherwise you are just going to get all the more anxious and overwhelmed. 3)there is a great thread in the \"Just Diagnosed\" forum called \"Just Diagnosed:Get prepared\" there is some excellent, practical advice there on what you can do as you head down this path, if you do, indeed head down this path 4)Dont panic (I know I can hear ya, \"Yea right, dont panic. HA!\"  )  Seriously, though, dont feel you have to do everything \"right now\". You do have sometime to gather information, get second opinions, as far as treatment. There is a great tab at the top of the page called \"Treatment and side effects\". 5)If things really do get so overwhelming and you get so anxious that it becomes difficult to function, talk to your Dr about getting a prescription for something to help with the anxiety. It's not uncommon for someone in the beginning to \"get a little help\" in the beginning as you get used to the new information. In the mean time, feel free to vent here, ask questions, whatever you need.  ",

We are told that it may, for some kinds of bc (there are over 20 different types). But truth be told, most of the women here are mothers, grandmothers, and a great many of them breastfed their kids, so if it reduces risk, I don't think it's as much as people think. Two biggest risks of getting breast cancer? 1)being a woman, and 2) getting older. The two things we can't control.... Any lump needs to be checked out, but most of them are B9 in nature.",

There is so much info out there that is dated. 3) Im guessing you know that BIRADS5 does lean more towards cancer, but also know this. I have seen several women with BIRADS5 that come back negative. There are some conditions that mimic cancer on films (radial scars, necrosis etc). So you will only know for sure after a biopsy is done. 4) 6x5x9mm is very very small, so *IF* (and I stress *IF*) it is cancer, you caught it very very early on.

You are however doing the right thing by having it checked out.  It's not likely the breast surgeon will do a biopsy right then and there unless it is a cyst and she asperaties it. At least that is my understanding. Will she request an MRI? Possible, but it's not normal protocol to have an MRI prior to a biopsy unless it is known that a woman has very dense breasts. Insurance companies arent too fond of MRIs do to their expense and high false negative results. You are right, however, most women, 80%, who go on for a biopsy end up with B9 results. From what you posted  about your mammo and U/S, nothing is screaming \"cancer\" (and yes, there are things that can be seen on imaging that can look highly suspicious for cancer. Yours does not by what you posted) It's hard, the not knowing, but try not to panic. What you are describing can be explained by other conditions other than breast cancer. Hang in there.",

In the meantime, you may want to take some time to research what sort of things that are seen on mammos and US that raise red flags so that you understand your radiologists' reports.  That way if you read something on those reports (\"irregular borders\" \"spiculated\" ) you will know that it a biopsy is really warrented. Microcals, like you know, \"MAY\" be indictivie of very early breast cancer, but that is not a given. Those above words I used are more serious indicators. So if you know exactly what is more serious than others, you will go ahead with the biopsy. Good Luck and God Bless ",

First off, stay away from Google. You don't 1) know enough and 2) have enough information to do a research with the right kind of ability to filter thru the nonsense and even outdated material. You did the right thing with having a doctor check out the lump. Know this, however, most lumps are B9. Because of all the \"pink washing\" with the awareness campaigns over the years, we tend not to think in terms of a lump being B9. We tend to think of cancer. And that is backwards thinking in the light of reality. Many things happen to our breasts and most of them have nothing to do with cancer. For example, you mentioned a young child, so I am guessing you are either in your 20's or 30's. Most lumps for women of this age are things like cysts, or something called fibroendenomas, and they are common, and they are B9. Like I said, you ARE doing the right thing in having it checked out. So don't feel like you are overreacting with having it checked. Just know, that the odds are heavily, yes heavily, in your favor that it's B9. Hang in there. And STAY AWAY FROM GOOGLE ;) HUGS",

As to your  question about whether or not everyone sees and breast surgeon when it comes to a breast cancer scare I think a lot of it depends on the policies of the clinics they are using. Do you have copies of your mammo, ultrasound reports? That could helps us help you understand why they asked for a biopsy. Many things will show up on those tests that they will ask to have a biopsy for to be on the safe side. Know that 80% of all BIOPSIES come back B9 (ie non-cancerous) There are things that can show up on a mammogram or ultra-sound that can either look like a \"yellow flag\" or a \"red flag\". If you have copies of your reports some of us here can help you understand why you had a biopsy. For now, dont panic. \"breast cancer\" is an umbrella term used to call a whole host of differnt cancers that can effect the breast.",

So the question is, why does the cloth have a wrinkle. Your diagnosis was a radial scar. That is what caused the distortion on the mammogram image. The normal protocol is to have a radial scar removed. Concerned, I'm going to be very blunt here, while at the same time respecting the frustration you are experiencing. Perhaps you are experiencing anxiety as well. Everyone here knows what a trip anxiety is. You have been given the blessing of having a B9 finding. Yes, there is a small chance of malignant cells that can l be found, and that is why it's protocol to remove a radial scar. To make sure there are none. The women here are fighting for their lives. In fact, in the Stage IV forum, those women are fighting for time. You are not. Please keep that in perspective. Given that perspective, I find your post comes off as being insensitive to what the women here are going thru. You are very fortunate. The women here who are fight for their lives, or more time, would have given their eye teeth to have been given the diagnosis of a radial scar. Count your blessings rather that focusing on the hiccups that you have been experiencing in the diagnostic process. You still come out with \"YAY!!! B9 finding!\"\"",

When I went for the US guided biopsy, they couldnt find the area, so they did more diagnosic mammos again. It showed up in some of the images but not all. The radiologist was perplexed so advised an MRI to make sure that it just wasnt some fold of skin or something before trying again with another biopsy. MRI did pick it up. So then I went for a steretactic biopsy. It came back as PASH. Its rare and when it is found, it tend to be just an incidental finding. Mine was an actual lesion. Good luck!

(the word \"enhancement\" is often used From what you posted,  there was no suspicious enhancement of areas going on.  I have no clue as to what is going with your breast, but really, according to the MRI results, there is nothing alarming going on when it comes to the blood flow (cancer needs a blood supply to grow), there is no concerning enhancement. Keep looking to get an answer. After my MRI, it was clear that something WAS there, but because there was no alarming enhancement, I was pretty confident that it wasn't cancer. But I kept going until I found out what is was, because something WAS there that as new. For me, it turned out to be a PASH tumor (its a benign rare kind of tumor)  (Its that alaraming enhancement that also makes MRI give a lot of false positives. Many things can cause it, not just cancer. MRI's are notorious for false positives)  Reading what you posted, you really do have good reason to exhale. Biopsy is prudent for sure, but you really do have reason to exhale.  ",

Try not to panic. Having something \"of concern\" does not = breast cancer. What it means is that something needs to be checked out. There are a lot ..A LOT of things that can go on with breast that are NOT cancerous. Hell I just found out that I do have a tumor, but even that tumor is benign. Most breast issues are NOT cancer. That doesnt keep our imaginations from running wild, I know, but it's still a very important FACT to keep remembering.  ",

It's my understanding that monthy BSE haven't been part of your routine for the most part, right? So, keeping that in mind, you are not used to what your breast normally feel like. What you are feeling may very well be part of your normal breast structure. Breast are more than just fat; they have all kinds of tissues and structures to them. That's one of the reason young women are encourage to do BSE so that they can get to know what their normal breasts feel like, so that when something does show up, they will sense that it's new and different.  Considering your experience with your mother, I can well understand your shying away from BSE. Let's look at what you know at this point. Your risks factor at this point is that your mother had it. That is a legit risk factor. That doesn't mean you *WILL* get BC, but it does increase your risk. That being said, most women who get BC don't have family history.  It is very rare for someone in your age bracket to get BC. As you know, not impossible, but indeed rare.   I think what is happening to you (and it's very understandable. It happened to me) is that your fear, your terror is fueling your imagination. And now your imagination is F-ing with your head and your heart. Very understandable. My advice? Keep reminding yourself you have *NO FACTS* at this point when what you are feeling. You have deep fear, deep terror, but no facts. Keep holding onto that fact. Again, a person can not tell by how it feels. Not even doctors can do that, and they are trained. What you may be feeling for all we know is part of a duct, or a lobe, or a fibroendanoma, etc etc. Keep reminding yourself of that. Since you are just getting used to what the structure of your breast feel like, you really dont know if what you are feeling is completely normal for you. Hang in there. If I recall right you go for a US tomrrow. In the meantime, stop examing your breast. You seem to be inadvertantly just throwing another log on the bonfire of terror. And that is not helping your right now. Let us know how it goes. We are here for you.  ",

If statistics hold \"true\" and you do get a Dx of BC, it will still take some time for you to get YOUR personal picture of BC in focus. \"Breast cancer\" is an umbrella term that covers a whole host of different kinds of cancer that affect the breast. So one step at a time. Dont do any research on the internet until you have FACTs of exactly what type, if any, kind of cancer you may have.  There is a thread at the top of the \"Newly Diagnosed\" section of the board that gives some great practical advice as to getting all your ducks in a row if you do, indeed, have some form of breast cancer. It will help you gain some control back that you feel you have lost in the early stages. One step at a time. One day at a time. ",

A BIRAD5 is not a diagnosis of cancer, but more of a rating system that radiologists (who are specialized  trained medical doctors) use to flag areas of concern. Most women who come thru here who have had a BIRAD 5 do end up with a positive diagnosis of cancer, but I have seen a few who turned out to have a B9 condition that mimics cancer on imaging (they tend to be either radial scars or fat necrosis). So, like itsjustme said, you wont know definitively until you get a biopsy done. The radiologist is just making a very educated guess based on his training and experience. Praying that it's something other than BC. God Bless",

One thing that has helped me is to identify when the anxiety flares and what am I doing at that moment that is possibly triggering the flare. It doesn't fix the anxiety, but at least I become more self-aware as to what some possible triggers are. And I have learned that, for me, researching on the internet the medical conditions or symptoms that are present is a BIG trigger. Google in so many ways is not my friend when it comes to putting myself at a website that may or may not having anything to do with what the reality is.  I find it a real balancing act of \"being informed\" and \"scaring myself and making the anxiety FLARE\" \u2026..Im facing that right now with a loved on who is going in for treatment next week for a medical condition. Chances are she will be ok, but there is this fear that echoes in \"Grand Canyon\" of my mind\u2026and it goes on and on and on and on\u2026.Forcing myself NOT to do anymore research at this point as the treatment MUST be done. It's the long term risks that are scaring me, though. I have been told (but not sure if it's true) is that since I am perimenopausal, that too can add to the anxiety.  It sucks, whatever the reasons. ",

I can very much understand your confusion Realy strange!  At this point, try you best to just wait and see what imagining shows. Then start formulating questions. Ask for copies of the radiologist's reports on the US and mammo. One thing is for sure. Most breast issues are not cancer. It's always wise however, to have any medical concern, whether it's happening in our breasts or any other part of our body, checked out. Breathe and find some fun things to do.

When they do the mammo, depending on the facility, they may also do a U/S and/or what is known as a diagnostic mammogram (which is a more focused kind of mammogram). Ask for copies of those reports and we can help you understand in layman's language what is being said in the report. From there you may end up having a biopsy. If that happens, know that even 80% of those come out B9. The waiting is going to be hard. Searching \"Dr google\" doesn't help because Dr Google isn't a doctor and he can't give you a diagnosis.

Most of what you are reading has zero, zero, zero to do with what you are dealing with. Why do I say that? Because you dont know what you are dealing with. The truth is \"breast cancer\" is an umbrella term that covers a whole host of DIFFERENT kinds of cancers that can affect the breast. Kinds that only can be determined under a microscope. You dont have any pathological data on your lump so you have nothing to go on other than you have a lump. Dr GOOGLE doesnt have the data need to wade thru all the TONS of stuff that is out there and find what is right for YOU personally.  Most lumps found in women's breast are NOT cancer. Your BIRADS 4a means that even the radiologist is leaning more towards that it's not cancer more than they believe it is.  But they are being prudent and professional by having it biopsied so that they know for sure. Hang in there and STAY AWAY FROM DR GOOGLE. DR GOOGLE doest know what your lump is about....  ",

AFA your question of how can someone feel good and still have breast cancer? Many women who end up with a  Dx-ed with  breast cancer feel fine. Many have lived very healthy lives infact. A person doesnt necessarily have to feel sick in order to have cancer. But it is a mind-twist, isnt it. The idea of it being possible of having cancer and yet feeling absolutely fine.  And with the advancement of technology and the ability to find many cancers in earlier stages adds to that. There are reasons why a BIRADS of 5 is given. Many cancers have a certain look to them. A well trained and experienced radiologist knows what these looks are. That is why they flag them BIRADS 5  Again it's not a given that it is cancer; like carpediem said, there have been other ladies here in these past months who were given a BIRADS 5 and it came back negative. SO there are other conditions that can mimick what  cancer can look like on a US or mammogram  and fool a radiologist.",

Most women your age have very very slow growing cancers. Plus, and I mean this so very sincerely. Breast cancer and pancreatic cancer are very different. Try your best not to compare.

There are several kinds Stereotactic (you lie on a special table where the breast hangs down thru a hole. Then mammography like  paddles compress the breast and they decide exactly how they are going to approach the mass) US guided biopsy (the ultrasound machine is used to to aide the radiologist/surgeon to the mass) etc. For me, I had a stereotactic biop and had a lot of brusing and most of the brusing (and there was a lot of it)  was due to the compression of the paddles. The actual site of where the needle went was much much less.  My mass was very close to the chest wall and surrounded by some fairly large viens so they didnt go for a direct route, but a route that would avoid the veins. ",

Yes he can, but it will only be a general educated GUESS.  Nothing factual and definitive. Only a biopsy can do that. Depending on where the samples are sent and what their normal time table is, it can be a couple of days to about a week for results to come back Googling really isnt very wise because you really dont know what exactly you need to be looking for in all honesty.  ",

Im fine with that and agree. I do have plans to go away for the first couple of weeks of Jan; he said go...have a good time...it can wait until you get back Im very comfortable with that as well. So I am going to enjoy the holiday, and my vacation with my sister. Then I will re-visit this with a biopsy and see what it is that is new ",

Going thru all of this is all so very scary, isn't it? Beyond scary if you ask me. Glad you had a biopsy done because only then will you really know. Mostly likely, it's not cancer. Most lumps are not. But no woman should have to live if the \"what if\" 's. I will keep you in my prayers, that's it's B9 and you can get back to your family worry free.

But sometimes the \"rest of the story\" does get lost in that understandable fear. 1) that most lumps are NOT cancer 2) that THE number one risk for breast cancer is ..being female...and the second biggest risk? Getting older. All those other risk factors (having children vs not, breast feeding vs not, life style etc) all are \"factors\" but not nearly as real risk factors as we may imagine. Exceptions to that being, 1) hormonal replacement therapy and if has the BRCA gene mutations (this is where family history  can suggest there is a gene mutation) Most of the women on this site who do or have fought BC are mothers. Many of nursed their children etc. Many of them, like you, have lived very healthy life styles. etc Again, all that said, most lumps, esp at  your age, are something other than cancer.  ",

It helped me evaluate by knowing their creditials A tech is not a doctor, unlike the radiologists. Their educational background is much much less than any radiologist (M.D).

It's the micro-calcs that *can* be a warning sign that cancer *may* be present, but never a guarentee. Calcs in and of themselves arent cancer. They *may* be the left overs of cancer cells dying off. Even with mirco-calcs it is not that they are present that is sometimes a flag; they are often there. Its *HOW* they appear, their pattern if you will...Are they forming a circle? are in a linear form? If so, then *may be* something is going on. That is when a biopsy is recommended when micro-calcs are present, if they are in those patterns that raise a flag of suspicion. From your post this is what I sense the doctor is saying to you. 'There are calcs present. We are going to compare them to your last mammo and if they are changing their pattern and doing something that may raise a concern, we will let you know. To look at then right now, there they are not alarming\" Hope that helps ",

Again, the biggest risks for getting breast cancer you already have. You are a female and you are gettting older. Because of that, you and the rest of us are always at risk.  I know that there is some concern when it comes to use of birth control pills. I think it's because they are hormones. Also something about alcohol because of it's effect on estrogen on our bodies, but all of that still seems not complete agreement with scienetists.  You ask the women on this board, and again many of them lived very healthy life styles like you, and they will tell you , it's really a crap shoot.  Live your life and just be aware of your body and it's changes.  ",

From what you posted it sounds like to me that the radiologist couldnt make a determination from imaging as to whether it's malignant or B9 so to be on the extra cautious side, is recommending a biopsty to know for sure... That is a good way to go. Erring on the side of caution.  Try not to panic. From what is written it's not sounding alarm signals. Just want to know for sure, what *it* is. Wise course of action.",

Like you know, ultimately, only a biopsy can give the definitive answer. But if you are asking, are there things that can be seen on a mammo, ultrasound, or MRI that are warning signs, or yellow/red flags to the tech or radiologist, the answer is yes. Depending on their experience and training will also impact what they are seeing. Also, some are more aggressive in finding answers, others less so. Remember, they too are human beings. And how they react will also be impacted based on their own personalities. Again, warning signs can be seen on the various imaging tests, but only a biopsy can give you are definite answer. My personal thoughts to you is, dont get sucked up completely by their reactions (you used the word \"grim\") because you cant really tell what that means. At the same time, dont dismiss it outright either. They see something that makes as a professional, a flag go up for them.  So take a deep breath, write down all the questions you have. Do some research if you feel like it (I found the symptoms & diagnosis section of this site very helpful in that). As a new person to this board you will only be able to post 5 posts a day (protects the site from spam) until you get to 50, but you have unlimited \"private messaging\" capabilities. Feel free to use that if you need to. God Bless ",

My sense from your posts is that because you havent had mammos for several years you have a great fear that if it is cancer, you may be facing later stage (I see you posted a question on the mets boards).  Your fears are very understandable. But really really try not to anticipate anything until you are there. Hang onto what your dr said about if it is positive, it's treatable. What time is your biop on Fri.? ",

WHat does that mean? 3? 4? 7? 10? It's one thing to have not have one for many years, its another if it really was just a few. Also, do you know if there was anything that they were watching with the past mammos that you did have? When it comes to bone mets, from those women have them (from what I remember), the most likely places they show up is spine, pelvis, sternum.  That doesnt mean they dont show up in other places, but the above seem to be the most common places. Eileen, if it does happen that you get a positive result, please talk to your doctor about getting some sort of anti-anxiety or anti-dpression medication. Im concerned about this paralyzing or gripping terror you are experiencing, esp since you live alone and family isn't too close geographically.  ",

Your concern over what stage you are at is a normal one for when people are first Dx-ed.  The lack of not fully knowing, based on actual testing, does give time for both the head and heart to be filled with all kinds of fears and imagination. I think also you are feeling tremedous guilt over how you put your own health on the backburner because of your dealing with your husband's health is understandable. Please try not to dwell on that.  I know there is nothing we can say that is really going to put your fears to rest. Only medica testing will do that. In the meantime Im praying for you, praying for an early stage. From all that you posted, the actual factual medical information and what the Drs have said, you do seem to be in an early stage.  But I do know your fear has  you dreading the worse.

Even when biopsies are recommended, it's not because they think it's cancer, as 80% of biopsies are benign (non-cancer) What you are reacting to is what many of us call \"pink washing \", meaning we have heard since we were young teens, if you find a lump, check it out (which is true).

If the area that they wanted to biopsy according to the radiology report is the area that the pathology (biopsy) came from, then a 6 month follow up is normal protocol YAY! Your biopsy came back B9 and it's recommended that you have a follow up in 6 months. Very typical recommendation. :) Enjoy your spring and summer!! :)  This is where you have to remember that you don't understand the medical-ese and it may confuse and even frighten you. You are fine.

Box 228, Whiteknights, Reading, RG6 6AJ, UK. p.d.darbre@reading.ac.uk The upper outer quadrant (UOQ) of the breast is the most frequent site for incidence of breast cancer, but the reported disproportionate incidence in this quadrant appears to rise with year of publication. In order to determine whether this increasing incidence in the UOQ is an artifact of different study populations or is chronological, data have been analysed for annual quadrant incidence of female breast cancer recorded nationally in England and Wales between 1979 and 2000 and in Scotland between 1980 and 2001. In England and Wales, the recorded incidence of female breast cancer in the UOQ rose from 47.9% in 1979 to 53.3% in 2000, and has done so linearly over time with a correlation coefficient R of +0.71 +/- SD 0.01 (p < 0.001). Analysis of independent data from Scotland showed a similar trend in that recorded female breast cancer had also increased in the UOQ from 38.3% in 1980 to 54.7% in 2001, with a correlation coefficient R for the linear annual increase of +0.80 +/- SD 0.03 (p < 0.001). These results are inconsistent with current views that the high level of UOQ breast cancer is due solely to a greater amount of target epithelial tissue in that region. Identification of the reasons for such a disproportionate site-specific increase could provide clues as to causative factors in breast cancer. ",

I'm don't think I have ever seen something that is well defined given that kind of a score. Does the report say anything else? Could you copy, word for word and exactly as it is written, the report for us. I find myself confused. What was found on your right breast would be normally given a BIRAD 3, hence the follow up, not a 4, which would have called for a biopsy.",

It can take a while to learn to trust again after such an experience. Since everything turned out well for you, when you start to feel the anxiety, and the paranoia rising, try delibertating telling your self  \"everything turned out fine, I'm going to trust that\" In a sense, your head telling your heart, it's ok.

Be prepared to be there for a 1.5-2 hours...Not that it takes that the biop itself takes that long, but the setting up, getting in position, them giving you instructions will. A snug bra can be just one of your tighter fitting bras (they will give you a small ice pack, I mean really small) or a sports bra.... Be prepared to find a position laying on your belly for about 30 mins. Because once you are in position and they set up the equipment, you really cant move. You certainly will be able to work if you want I would think. What time is your appointment set up for? My only thoughts are though if you want to keep an ice pack on the site to help keep the swelling down. Do you have access to a freezer where you work? Is it \"absolutely necessary\" to ice it? I dont think for me it was, but it does keep the swelling down, and I dont think I would have swelled up all that much. Hopefully other women who have had a stereotactic will speak up with their experiences... I know for me, I would have been fine going to work after. It just so happens my appointment was set for 2 pm so by the time I was done (345) the work day was over ",

Not sure why you are even thinking breast cancer in the first place, let alone advanced breast cancer? There are so many reasons why a person can experience discomfort or pain in any part of their body and have it have nothing to do with cancer of any kind. Dont let your fears and/or imagination replace facts. You will get emotionally off balance and THAT  alone will diminish your quality of life. Never mind cancer   Do what Annie suggests.

At your age, you may not have a mammo done once you get insurance squared away as mammos often are not very helpful due to the density of younger breasts. More likely you would get a U/S. Since you have been having non-stop pain, I would talk to your doctor again (especially since it's been almost a year from last time). More than likely, you are ok. But you should have this checked out. Again, talk with your dr and try again to get some imagine done. I am assuming you can't palpate a lump and neither can your Dr?.",

Malpractise suits are something that they really avoid at all costs. Please try not to worry about that. Being filled with anxiety and worry over the results of your biopsy is very normal. Try your best to keep busy with something if you can. It is extremely hard, I know. If things are really that hard, perhaps you can talk to your Dr and get something to help you relax? ",

All sorts of things can cause calcs, even injuries. Calcs in and of themselves are NOT troublesome. It's the pattern they are found in. I think they are just being cautious. Enjoy your baby!!

Second, get a copy of the radiologist report, that way you can read exactly what they are seeing. Even with seeing a breast surgeon, Im guessing that they are wanting a second opinion, a second set of eyes on the films. At this point, they aren't sending you for a biopsy (which, even then, most of the time, that is precausionary) Honestly, try not to panic. And don't do any researching. Your imagination is going to dark places without having any hard core data. WE ALL GET THAT. Trust me. We all have been down that road. So, go and see the breast surgeon. Get copies of the radiologist report. One step at a time. Chances are, especially if the radiologist wasnt concerned right off the bat, that you are fine. They are just being prudent.

To answer some of your questions since you are looking for answers. 1)Yes, we do have women here in their 30's (and even later 20's) who have been Dx-ed with BC. We will point you in their direction if it comes to that. They even have their own threads in various forums. 2)The things you have posted, \"spiculated\" is a flag for cancer, but only a biopsy will show for sure (other things can mimic that look and not be cancer. I have seen several women with that and have it not be cancer) 3)It \"lit up on MRI contrast\". That also can be a flag for cancer. But you need to know this about MRI's, they are notorious for false positive and many thing can \"light up\" on and MRI and not be cancer. Again, only a biopsy will know for sure. So, yes, you do have some \"flags\" that are leaning towards cancer, but only a biopsy can tell you for 100% sure. Whether or not a woman has chemo, regardless of age, depends on what kind of breast cancer it is and how far along it is. You see, \"breast cancer\" is an umbrella term that covers a whole host of differenct cancerS that can effect the breast. IF, and I stress IF, you do have cancer, it will take awhile for YOUR particular picture to come into view. There will be testing of the area for things like \"hormonal receptors\" (basically what hormones, if any, are causing your cancer to grow, how much and how fast) STAY AWAY FROM DR GOOGLE UNTIL YOU KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON. He will only frighten you and you dont have the medical background to sift thru what he has to say (and a lot of it may be outdated) How can we help you in the mean time?",

Size does when it comes to staging ( I, 2,3 ,4) and also something known as \"grade\" (1,2,3). Grade has to do with whether it's fast, slow or intermidiate in growth. Also \"type\"... The fact that your mother's is indeed very small and slow growing is a good thing. Means it was caught early. What did her biopsy results say? Get a copy of the pathology report.  ",

My thoughts on what you wrote is that even though the biopsy came back benign, because of the atypical cells your wife may have something like ADH (Atypical ductual hyperplasia)or ALH (atypical lobular hyperplasia)  which puts her risk of getting BC a bit higher. By actually taking the lump out they can look more closely as to what is going on and which condition it might be if either.  You may want to post your concerns in on forum down called \"High Risk Women\"  I dont think that either condition drastically increases her chances (but to be honest I am not sure) but it does warrant that she be followed a more closely so that IF she does end up with cancer, it can be caught early",

Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia or Atypical Lobular Hyperplasia If my understanding is correct \"some\" consider DCIS as pre-cancerous, but for the most part, it is considered cancer that is not invasive. When you get your results, ask for a copy of them. No doubt your head may be in a whirlwind and we can help you understand some of the language. Is it possible that it could still be B9? Yes that is possible. Based on what you were told, however, be a bit mentally prepared that it's not B9. Only a biopsy can really give you a definitive answer (there are some B9 conditions that do mimic cancer on imaging, so there is where the possibility lies) Based on the bit you have shared of what you were told, what the Dr saw has a look of either precancer or cancer, and the biopsy will tell you if that is correct. SO hang tight!! (ITS HARD we know) When you get your diagnosis and if you feel the need to ask for a prescription for an anti-anxiet medical (esp if it's cancer) don't be afraid to ask for it. Most of the women who get a diagnosis, and even those who really DONT like taking pills, admit that in the beginning stages of the journey, some form of anti-anxiety aid was indeed helpful. DONT DO ANY RESEARCHING on what you are told quite yet. IF you do have cancer, it's going to take a bit of time for ALL of the pieces of the puzzle to fall into place. \"Breast cancer\" is an umbrella term that covers a whole bunch of different cancerS that can effect the breast. And each kind, and the staging of it, has different approaches.  The ladies here can help you with unraveling that information given to you, what it means, and how it will impact you going forward. BREATH\u2026KEEP BREATHING\u2026SLOWLY\u2026 *IF* it is cancer, the fact that it has the look of possibly being pre-cancer means to me you caught it early\u2026.THAT is good",

The \"a\" is more towards the lower end of the scale, the \"c\" the higher, and the \"b\" the middle. In my layman's way of explaining\u2026.BIRAD4c is closer to a BIRAD4   BIRAD4a closer to a BIRAD3 and BIRAD4b and right between the two.

One of the reasons that it was recommended is because most women who get a call back for a diagnostic below the age of 50 turn out to be nothing and the women F.R.E.A.K. Out with the call back. IE there is a lot of undue stress and anxiety. Same recommendations still stand. Baseline at 35, annuals starting at 40.   I see it as poor education. Women are taught, and rightfully so, never to ignore a lump. To get it check. What women are NOT taught, is the most lumps arent cancer. So women are set up to freak out because they have been poorly educated over breast health. AFA your first question. The truth is MOST women Dx-ed with BC have NO family history. That is the factual reality. That idea of the \"family history\" tends to lull women into complacency if you ask me. They think \"I have no family history so I am safe.\" Not true Biggest risk for having breast cancer is being a woman. Having family history increases the risk (though I think that is more true if there is BRCA1 or BRCA 2 positive gene going on). Here is a link to more information on Breast cancer risk www.cancer.org/Cancer/BreastCa...  My own advice to any woman who finds a lump. Get it checked but dont freak out.  ",

The intraductal papillomatoisis does increase your risk for future cancer a bit, but not much. The fact that you are a woman and as you age is still your biggest risk, as is true for all women And since you had an MRI, which with your breast density is a wise thing, they got a real good look at what was going on.  Have intraductal papillomatoisis removed is normal.

I had my biopsy this afternoon. I had a stereotactic which is a tad bit different from and US guided but it's all for the same idea just different ways of imaging the area they want to biopsy. Mine really wasnt that bad at all. They do numb the area so really all you feel is pressure. The idea of it I found (IE imagination) to be worse than the actual biopsy. My sister went with me (and drove) to be my support system but I would have been fine if I had to drive myself. That said, if you find that you normally are freaked out over medical procedures you may want someone there. My appointment was at 2pm and I was done by 3:45 so it is a bit of a wait. Although I think US guided biopsies may require less time. One thing I would recommend. Wear a sports bra. The extra compression is not only supportive but also helps the healing process. Try not to worry (HARD WE ALL KNOW!) Most biopsies come back B9 (80%). It's just safer to actually find out what the lump is about rather than ignore it.

Like I have said before, the term \"breast cancer\" is an umbrella term the covers a wide variety of cancers that can effect the breast. It takes some time for all information to come in before a treatment plan to be put into place depending on exactly what is going on. Many women also seek second opinions on treatment plans. Esp those with early stage. There is a great thread in the \"Just Diagnosed\" section entitled \"Just Diagnosed-Get prepared\". In there many women find useful, practical advice on what they can do to \"get their ducks in a row\" as they proceed on this journey. Between a diagnosis and treatment actually getting under way, women take this time to educated themselves on what kind of situation they personally are deal with based on the results that come in. Also, many women often feel anxious and ask their Dr's for some sort of anti-anxiety to help them stay in a calmer place as they want to have as clear and as calm (as possible) of a head on their shoulder. If your results do come back positive, you may seriously consider asking for some sort of prescription like that. You may never need it, but it may be good to have, just in case.  ",

Nothing you have written is screaming cancer. Not by a long shot. It sounds like you have some good doctors who are being prudent, especially since your mother is a survivor (YAY for her!!) and just wanting to know what the microcals are about. More often than not, they mean nothing. Micro and Macro cals can be found for a varitiety of reasons. You didnt mention (at least I didnt catch it in your posts) if the microcals seen are seen in some sort of pattern. IE linear or cluster. When they show up in a pattern like that, it is a bit of a flag. IF (and I stress IF) is does come back positive for something, it's far more likely it will be 1)VERY small in size and 2) either DCIS or LCIS, both of which are stage 0, non-invasive cancer and VERY VERY treatable. Keep breathing slow deep breaths. This is the hardest time. DONT BE SEARCHING DR GOOGLE!!. Since you are an educator (and thank you for teaching our children), and feel a need to at least educate yourself on something, I would stick to the topics of DCIS or LCIS. Dont be beyond that and I would do your reseach on this site or credible medical sites. God Bless. Keep yourself busy. Most like it is nothing. Most women who come thru here and have a biopsy on microcals come back with B9 results.....",

That can only come with a biopsy.  Like Beesie I wonder why the rating is a BIRAD 4/5 as there is a big difference between the two.  I would suggest you talk to your breast specialist why the confusing rating? Maybe there is something new happening in the industry of breast imaging with the radiologists. If that is the case, I would lean, based on my layperson's experience you have a higher chance of having cancer than not if they put the 5 in the rating\u2026.Just a guess on my part though. Either way, at this point, it doesn't matter what the rating is since you have had a biopsy.  The biopsy will give you your diagnosis.  Sending B9 thoughts your way",

Don't panic. Your Dr is just being thurough. Which is a good thing, especially since you have extremely dense breasts, which is why they are wanting an MRI. Women who have extremely dense breast tissue should be given MRI's as they are better imagining tools for that kind of breast tissue. So, again, don't panic. They just want to make sure things really are ok. :)",

Some studies showed higher risks of death from breast cancer in patients with tumors of the inner quadrants, or inner quadrants plus central portion of the breast, or lower quadrants, or all quadrants except the upper-outer quadrant,whereas other studies showed no association whatsoever between tumor location and breast cancer prognosis.\"  So obviously there were no conclusive findings at the time of your mother's diagnosis. Even looking at the details of the study, there are a few other things that stick out to me: As for the results themselves, this study is by no means suggesting that everyone who had a lower inner quadrant cancer is going to get mets.  Here are the 10 year survival rates from the study: So yes, there is a \"statistically significant\" difference in the results, and a 12% mortality rate is not good.  But 88% of the women with lower inner quadrant Stage I BC were alive after 10 years. Lastly, about what scans are given upon diagnosis, the NCCN treatment guidelines for physicians are the guidelines followed by most doctors in North America.  These are updated every year.  The 2009 edition indicates that for Stage I, bone scans and CT scans are optional, required only if symptoms indicate a need.  See page 9: http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/PDF/breast.pdfs I don't mean to downplay anyone's concerns and I agree that it's important to understand our diagnoses and the implications of our diagnoses.  But we also have to realize that new information becomes available every day and a study that is released one day might be contradicted by another study the next day.  There is no point in becoming fearful because of one study, where the authors themselves admit that the analysis is not as complete as they would want.    EDITED TO ADD:  In reading the couple of posts after mine, I just want to clarify that I'm not suggesting that anyone who has symptoms or reasons for concern ignore those things and not seek all the tests and treatments.  I'm just saying that if you don't have reasons for concern, don't let a study like the one above make you worry.  If everyone of us scoured the internet we could all find studies that say that our specific diagnosis is particularly bad for some reason or another. ",

Get that \"doesnt bode well\" thought out of your mind. That isnt the case at all.  It just means he really cant tell and it would be wise to get a definitive answer thru biopsy. Remember, biopsies more often than not (up to 80%) come back B9 as well. But he is being a causious doctor, as he should be. He isnt saying that they are cancer. What he is saying is he doesnt know.

If he couldnt seen one of the lesions while doing the biopsy, he couldnt biopsy it. My guess is that when you go to the BS the BS may have a couple of options. 1) would be to biopsy the second lesion with a wire guided biopsy. 2)or and MRI guided biopsy or 3)waiting 3-6 months and watching it. For me, I went for a US guided core biopsy and they couldnt find it either so that attempt at a biopsy at that time was a bust. But it did show up on mammo and MRI. So I ended up having  a stereotactic biopsy.   Im guessing it will depend on how concerned the BS is. Good luck to you too ",

Fuzzy \"no knowing\" what is what is an awful place to be. You have every reason to have a great deal of hope. Breast cancer is one of those cancers that soo very much research has gone into that there are A LOT of \"tools in the tool box\" to attack it with. Im not minimizing it's seriousness, but really, you have a great deal of reasons to be very hopeful and aggressive. I can understand the though of chemo being very scary. But I have read many of the experiences here from these wonderful ladies. The biggest common thread of most is that \"yea it sucks, but it's more do-able than I first thought\" Hang on to that. Also, think of chemo as \"ok you f-ing cancer cells, we are about to kick your stupid ass to the curb so quick you won't know what hit you\". Look at chemo as your army who is gonna help destroy the enemy. Look at chemo as one part of your serious kick-ass  weaponry against the invading arrmy.  You will get thru this.  ",

Take slow deep breathes. 2nd..and this is important. Dont get ahead of yourself and where you are at right now. If you are reading the various forums on this board, try and stay within those threads that the most closely align with where you are at. \"Breast Cancer\" isn't one disease. It's a boat load of all kinds of different cancers. Each unique so how it is treated depends on the \"personality\" of the kind you have.  It's going to take a bit of time to find out exactly what kind YOU have.  In the \"Just diagnosed\" section, you will see a \"sticky thread\" of \"Just Diagnosed: Get prepared\" It will give you practical steps you can take to make you feel a bit more in control It's not uncommon when first diagnosed to feel like the rug of life has been ripped out from underneath you and feel out of control. These practical steps will help aid in giving you control back. You have found a great site with ladies who have walked this walk. They will hug you, scream with you, rant with and for you, cry with you, laugh with you, encourage and uplift you. You are so not alone. Not by a long shot. Many have walked and are walking this journey. 3rd. GET COPIES OF ALL YOUR REPORTS! Pathology, radiology etc etc. The women here can help you discipher them if you would like. 4th. If you have the (very common) thought of \"this is a death sentence\", just toss it out the window. It is cancer, yes, but now a days the survival rate of BC is quite high, esp here in the USA because tends to be caught early. Even in young women.",

The reason I ask is because you said you have been told you have very dense breast tissue. In some states, when a woman has that, their insurance has to pay for yearly MRIs since mammos and US dont work as well. I know you said you had an MRI last year. Was there anything there? A fibroendenoma or cysts or whatever? They can grow even though they are B9. If you have anything like that and it'sgrowing, that certainly can cause pain, be pressing on nerves that would lead to numbness etc etc.",

We all know what it's like to panic and have our imaginations run beyond wild, and yet at the same time wanting to be informed. Having that happen at the same time is a real mind twist. I applaud your desire and need to be informed, but it is important to be careful and do a balancing act. At this point, you dont know where your journey is at this moment. It really may be completely B9. If you are wondering the \"what if's\" down the road if it comes back B9, the reality is that because 1) you are a woman and 2) as you age your chances of getting BC will always be increasing, regardless of what your biopsy says this time. I know we all wish we arent at risk ever, at least I do, but that is just not reality. We are, and will always be. So, my thoughts are, educating yourself is important for sure. Just be careful you arent feeding imagination/worry bucket. And I know that is a hard line to find. God Bless.We all know how hard it is ",

In my state of CT, a woman who has extremely dense breast tissue (>75%) can not be denied a MRI as MRI can get a better look. If calcs are the only thing present on imaging and it is cancer, generally that is early cancer, but that is only a general observation. How early stage breast cancer is treated really depends more the kind it is. \"Breast cancer\" is an umbrella term. If its something like DCIS or LCIS is surgically removed, often times with radiation and perhaps something like tomaxophin.  Daf, I am sorry this is one more concern on your life's plate. Praying that the calcs are not a flag of something bigger going on. Hope this hurdle turns out to be nothing and that you can get a transplant. Prayers and God bless\u2026.",

Which is basically a lumpectomy that is done to an area that has not been biopsied, which is what you are asking about. Im guessing your doctor didn't inform you of that option? Or perhaps it has something to do with how your insurance works. They may require a needle biopsy for diagnosis rather than the surgical exisional biopsy",

It's just a distortion that shows up on a mammogram and a closer look is needed to see what is causing that distortion. It basically means something is showing up a distortion. All of the three diffenent imaging for breasts, (mammo, US, MRI) will pick up different things. For example, microcals and architectural distortion will not be picked up by a MRI. MRIs are looking for blood flow, and not just in general, but pick up and wash out. Remember this when you read your reports or anything online. You don't have the education that the radiologists (who are doctors with specialized focus in radiology) so you really won't understand what you are reading without some guidance. I think that is where a great deal of your confusion is coming in. Most women will end up having a biopsy or so after awhile. That doesn't mean they have cancer. It's just that many things happen to our breasts, especially as we age and hormones change, and a biopsy will be asked for to see \"what is going on\". Changes are typical. I do think Michelle gave you some great advice if you believe you have been harmed. I hear that your head is spinning and that your anxiety is going thru the roof. Just keep reminding yourself that you don't have cancer. it may help keep your thoughts from spinning circles it seems to be caught up in. If you are having a hard time sleeping, perhaps you can talk to your primary about getting some anti-anxiety meds to help you until all of this clears up.",

For example in my state (CT) if a woman's mammo shows that she has extremely dense breast tissue (>75%), by state law, her insurance company cannot turn down a doctor's order for an MRI. That is because mammos don't do well with dense breast tissue (and why mammos are not ordered all that much for younger women. they can be pretty useless)",

Yes, that does happen from time to time. But more often than not, it is cancer. So hope you are one of those who do get a B9 result, yet, as far as possible, try to mentally prepare for it to be cancer. I know that really isn't truly possible, but its highly likely you have BC. So take a deep breath. Take several. Don't do any research yet. \"Breast cancer\" is an umbrella term, and if it does come back as cancer, it will take some time to know what kind YOU have. Get a prescript for an anti-axniety med. The beginning of this journey is hard because of the unknown. Anything that helps keep you somewhat level headed will be helpful. If you feel like you need to be doing something, start with the main page of BCO, and under the diagnosis tab, you will begin to learn some of the medical-eze that you will hear (\"stage\"\"grade\" \"type\" \"hormonal receptors\" etc\u2026 prayers Ally. I know you feel like you just got blow out of the water and kicked in the gut at the same time",

Only a biopsy can tell you or the doctors or everyone else out here in internetville if it's cancer or not. More often than not, it is not cancer. But it is often time wise to get an actual biopsy, under a microscope, to tell you, factually and scientifically, if it's cancer or not\u2026 Hemming an hawing by either doctors or patients just doesn't hold up to what pathology says. Good luck AND SEE A BREAST SURGEON. NOT A GENERAL SURGEON.",

The only way to really know what is causing the shadowing is to biopsy it. From that you wrote, even the radiologist can't say even with their expertise. That is why they need a biopsy.  Read my signature. There was something there. They couldn't tell just by looking at the films (I had mammos, Ultrasound and and MRI) A biopsy showed that it was a benign tumor. That is what your reports is in essence saying. \"There is something there; we dont know what it is\" Again back to your question: How nervous should you be?  I would say, try not to be nervous, but this does need to be check out. This part is always the hardest, the \"not knowing\". Do you best to keep your self busy and dont do too much research on it. There simply is not enough information for you to go on at this point and all that research will most likely do is scare you. If you feel a need to check around here, try your best to stay only with those threads that really represent where you are at. Most threads here don't really apply to you at this point. No need to fuel anxiety Ask any questions you need to though!!  ",
