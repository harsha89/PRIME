I am also pretty happy with my decision so far. As far as the radiation, I have read a lot of horror stories about it, but as you said it only lasts a few weeks.  Thanks again, Terry",

This is different than what you were diagnosed with. DCIS is non-invasive cancer cells that have not spread beyond the location, (in this case the milk duct).  They also do not have the ability at this stage to spread. BUT my grade was 3 and that means that it could possibly change into invasive CA and then spread into the breast tissue,  become invasive. So at first I thought I was having a lumpectomy until I talked with the surgeon. Because my DCIS was so close, right behind the nipple he highly suggested that they remove the nipple and enough tissue to get clean margins. He also did a Sentinel node biopsy and the same time. This is done to make sure that no cancer cells have traveled to the lymph nodes. Since DCIS is non-invasive it shouldn't have spread to the lymph nodes. But I was told that because mine was a grade3, the highest grade before invasive, that it was a precaution.  I found out last week that he did indeed get clean margins and that there was nothing in the lymph nodes. The surgeon told me that in my case a mastectomy was not needed, but that he would do what I wanted him to do.  My surgeon did a pretty good job still keeping the shape of my breast minus the nipple. All in all I wanted the cancer gone and that was the most important thing.  I am still recovering but doing pretty well. Oh, also I will be having radiation for 6 weeks  and taking Tamoxifen for 5 years to prevent any new occurences in the surgical breast and also the other breast. I hope this give you a little insight even though out cases are not the same. Good luck to you whatever you decide",

I have read more than one article stating that is not true. Here is the link to just one of those articles. www.hopkinsmedicine.org  I hope this helps you to make a more informed decision.",

I'm still taking vicodin most days.I'm wearing a sports bra and continue to pad it with a washcloth as my doc advised to prevent seroma from forming. Everything just seems so overly sensitive.  I don't know if my pain is coming from the breast or the snb i had done. I really don't like taking the vicodin but it's the only way I can get through the day.",
