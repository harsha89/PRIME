    "Content": "Oct 21, 2016 11:25AM - edited Oct 25, 2016 12:54PM by Moderators When I began radiation, my oncology nurse recommended that I purchase a single sling, new to the market, to protect the underside of my breast. It was fantastic! I am still devoted to my sling, but I find that my friends who have recently been diagnosed with breast cancer do not have knowledge of this device. It is worth sharing what I know. The sling buffers the harmful effects of constriction on radiation damaged skin and allow sthe area in question to breathe. With its unique structure, the sling allows the skin to breathe as it is lifted off of the ribcage while wicking away perspiration preventing sore skin-to-skin contact. This deflects some of the tissue damage and, when the damage does occur, it allows it to heal more quickly.",
