I am extremely confused and could really use some guidance.Last January my mammogram came back suspicious; biopsy determined 3 lumps in left breast to be benign fibroadenomas. Now I have to have mammogram every 6 months followed by MRI every 6 months. The Breast Cancer Risk Assesment Tool puts me at high risk with a score of 44%. I  was tested for the BRCA gene deformity and DO NOT have them.  My oncologist has given me the choice of taking Tamoxifen for the next 5 years along with blood thinners or have the PBLM. I am 44 years old and in the middle of Menopause.  I have been happily married for 26 years and have 3 children.  I am terrified of the Tamoxifen but I am terrified of these lumps in my breast. I too am not handling the idea of \"just waiting for the diagnosis.\"  Any thoughts or ideas? If you are in the same situation, I would really appreciate your opinion. Thanks!

The BCRAT scored me at 42.3%.My mom died with breast cancer (unknown type) mets to the brain;  my sister has DCIS; I have had a biopsy already; I started my period at age 10; too many years to count of hormone therapy treatment for menorrhagia from age 10+; first child at age 21; and I have a BMI of 35 HelloFromCT:  I am so glad to hear that someone else has what I call \"the  cancer thought\" in my breast everytime the fibroadenomas are sore.  I am thinking it must be cyclic because they are only sore at certain times of the month.  I have one fibroadenoma at 3o'clock on my left breast and everytime I put on my seat belt....I can feel it and my mind goes straight to a dark place. My oncologist did not mention having the PBM until my third visit. She said that most women do better with having their breasts removed if it is their idea in the first place.  She told me that they have found that when they tell a woman she must have a PBM, she tends to have more trouble accepting it. I took this to mean that since there was no rush, they just gave me some time to consider all of my options. I also have Fibromyalgia and the Breast MRI is like a torture machine!! All of the Dr.'s visits are taking their toll on me. I have to go for the ultrasound, then the mammogram, then the mri, then to the surgical oncologist, then to the medical oncologist, then the nutritionist, and just when I think I am through......it starts all over again!  I am a nurse and I understand why all this needs to be done but that doesn't mean I have to like it.  Also, it has gotten to the point where I am very irritable and emotional before each visit and just cry and cry.  Before and during every visit I am terrified of what they are going to find this time.  It would be so nice to just forget about it all and just pretend everything is fine:) About the insurance...please keep me updated. My dr. told me that my insurance would cover it with the risk I have but I haven't contacted them myself.  Thanks!",
