Has anyone tried the cold socks/mitts for neuropathy and did it work? I used it for abraxane and didn\u2019t get neuropathy until the 4th cycle but the study I read only mentioned Taxol. Since Halaven is such a short infusion I\u2019m wondering if the cold socks will even affect it? I\u2019m just trying to keep as much of myself intact for as long as possible. Thanks.",

No green tea, no vitamins with antioxidant ingredients. Pajim, I don\u2019t think my numbers are that low and they started me on this at the same time I started Halaven. Maybe it\u2019s preventative to keep me able to stay chemo. He knows there\u2019s a lot going on in my household and that I have to keep going. My tumor grows quickly (it\u2019s big enough to see) when the meds stop working so we don\u2019t want to stop it for something like low blood cell counts! MO said it\u2019s the Halaven working because faslodex usually takes 6-8 weeks to show a difference. I\u2019m hoping my achiness goes away during this week off. Don\u2019t know which pain belongs to which medication but I would sure love for them all to go away. Good for you and tumor markers falling. That\u2019s always a good feeling when the numbers go in the right direction!",

How wonderful you\u2019ve been her caregiver A diet with plenty of fiber is helpful as well as lots of water. With summer coming a lot of in-season fruits and veggies will be easy to find and they are easier to eat when they taste good. Miralax is a stool softener, not a stimulant laxative and can be used often. Activity is also helpful. Good luck!",

And about all I drink is water! Lots of it! Oh what a long week! I forgot to post my blood test results. After having my granddaughter spend her spring break with me and my aunt and uncle coming in on the day she left, I was a bit tired. They left on Sunday. My WBC were 10.4 - almost high. Absolute neutrophils were high - 7.3 - but not much. The doctor didn\u2019t mention it. Tumor markers were up - 35.5 vs 33 last week (they\u2019ve never moved moved much but when they\u2019re higher my current med has stopped working). Doctor said he didn\u2019t know why they\u2019re up but he thinks my tumor has shrunk more so I\u2019m having a PET/CT scan next week. Another marker that went up but is still in the normal range - LDH. It went from 146 last month (that\u2019s about where it\u2019s been since I started) to 175 last week to 216. Don\u2019t know what to think. I\u2019ll wait for scan results and see what it shows. I\u2019m hoping for a scan with no mets showing! ",

I also still have my original tumor and on the scan the edges were \u201cill-defined\u201d and the doctor said the SUV was almost low enough to be in the normal range and not even need to be reported. I\u2019m talking with a surgeon next month to discuss surgery. My oncologist has said it\u2019s unnecessary since it\u2019s spread but the original tumor has always been an issue for me. Every progression it has grown larger and more painful and then the medicine shrinks it until it quits working but it has never gone away. I want to see if cutting out would keep it from seeding new mets. I may or not go through with surgery but I at least want to feel sure about the decision. I\u2019m really sorry about your uncle. It\u2019s hard enough to do this yourself but to watch someone so close go through it at the same time has to extremely difficult. And hiding it from your grandma! I wish you the best, Sarah, with this conundrum! I went to Disneyland yesterday and I\u2019m exhausted today. Hard to get moving!",
