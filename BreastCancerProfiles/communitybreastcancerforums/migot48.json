She will have to go to the health center next friday to get the second chemo session...Everybody has talked to her about some type of medication that is called TRANSFER FACTOR, which is a natural product. Do you know something about this? I pray God so that my mom can overcome this terrible disease. Thank you for your heartfelt wishes. Milton Gomez",
