A very small 1.5cm was found her2 neg, hormone positive. I tried to have 2 MRI's one with meds 1 without. Could not complete either. Have had second opinions both recommend lumpectomy, radiation and hormone blocker. Lumpectomy is scheduled for March 10th. Was called last night they are having issues scheduling the radiologist to insert the wire and they don't have another surgery opening for 2 weeks. Getting so frustrated with this process. Thanks for all your posts and suggesting 1 day at a time. Anyone else unable to complete an MRI before surgery? Praying for all of you.",
