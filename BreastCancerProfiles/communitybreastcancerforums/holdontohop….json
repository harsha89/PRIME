We share a well with our neighbors.  The well is on their property and the electricity for the pump is from their house.  We have been talking about the best way to handle this in a power outage.  We may end up sharing the cost of a generator just to run the well pump. We have plenty of gas stored in our shed.  The thing I can't figure out is how to run a generator when it is raining.  The instructions say keep it outside (of course) away from doors and windows and don't run it in a garage or shed.  Then how are you supposed to keep it dry???  I will be doing more research after this storm is over. Still praying for those who have been so severely impacted by Sandy.",
