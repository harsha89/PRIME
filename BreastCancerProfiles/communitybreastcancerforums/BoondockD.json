Imencken, check out YouTube I found several helpful clips on how to tie scarfs. My favorite is one that you actually use a rubber band, almost like putting your hair in a ponytail. Rock on everyone!!!!!!!",

But I'm so thankful to be able to read what you guys are up to and how things are going, so THANKS!! A/C #3 is coming up and I'm not sure I'm ready!!!??? My hair held in till day 16! Ya it was a short lived dream.  I cut it short (like Carol season #4). Then a few days later even shorter (like Carol season #1), as the longer pieces really hurt when they came out. Now I look like a cartoon that got blown up it's all patchy and half gone.  No wig just been wearing beanies. Will do a scarf if I go anywhere fancy. lol I also have my port on the left side. Dr. said it was up to me and I wanted a strong side and it helps to have on left for work. It gets bruised during the infusion and stays bruised for almost the whole 2 weeks. That happening to anyone else????? Lord I don't know what's going to happen when I have to do this every week??? Read about over watering and you guys not being able to drink a lot of water. Don't know but this may help I mix it up and drink other things in-between my water..... I do an A&W Cream Soda first thing in the morning (it helps my tummy) then a bottle of water, bottle of Gatorade, bottle of water, bottle of Vitaminwater, bottle of water, 32oz Ice Tea, and so on. For me drinking the Gatorade is the hardest part. Gods speed everyone!!!           ",

Haha Don't care about my hair, let my 4 year old cut it a few days ago. It was a blast we had so much fun. I have curly hair so all the different lengths don't matter to much. My big worry is working through it. I'm like 99.9% sure it's doable. But...... God's speed everyone! PS, when y'all say drink lots of water... How much is a lot? ",

I went shopping for supplies after and that went well. Sleep good till around 2300hrs then woke up nauseous and a little dry heaves (nothing close to what my 20s were like LOL) so not too bad.  Took the anti nauseous meds then back to bed. Today is going good, drake 36oz of water first 2 hours after waking. Well on my way for recommended amount. Thanks ladys for the heads up on that.  Doing light house work, cleaning and laundry. But not getting the steroids go getter that others are having.  May be due to my extremely low Iron.  Eating is going slow but my tummy has been off since double mastectomy. So cold caps, I saw a lady yesterday doing it and wow what a lot of work.  Personally I could not do it.  But if you have the time/support/and courage go for it.  This lady had a team of 3 people helping her she had to change her cold cap every 15 min I think.  They had a ice chest with dry ice and unknown amount of cold caps in it.  They guy would have to put on gloves to take out and get it ready then the 2 ladys would put it on.  The lady getting chemo looked to be in soooooo much pain the first 5 min it was on her head. So that's just an FYI. Thanks everyone for all your help and support  its so nice to read where and what everyone else is doing!!!! Rock on everyone!!   ",

Lol! Imencken, no wig just going with the scarfs and hat route. Don't know if you watch the Walking Dead but I can't wait to rock the \"Carol\" hair when it grows back. I cut my son's hair and every time I cut his he asks to cut mine. So this time I was like totally go for it! God's speed everyone.",

I also have very sore and raw fingertips.  Last week I was working on my sons Halloween costume and got some super glue on my fingertips. Wow was that nice, turned out to be 2 days of pain free hand washing and cooking. lol As for a head cold, I had one over the weekend got to the point I could not swallow as my head was so stuffed up.  Again not a recommendation but I took some children's Robitussin. Man did that help!!! I live in a small town with not much choice for supplies. Went with that due to it was alcohol free, would not make me drowsy and did not have any other harsh drugs.     Gods speed!!   ",
