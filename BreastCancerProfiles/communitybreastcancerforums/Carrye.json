I found the information on radiation side effects on this website to be of limited help to dark skinned women like myself. Sure we may not notice that we have turned red, but we do notice when we have turned charcoal black. I finished rads today. My radiated breast is 75% black. It looks, in the words of my white bff, charred. The black, charred dead outer layer of skin is starting to peel off. It would be great if the website operators would acknowledge the full range of skin color changes that commonly occur. My white radiation oncologist said my changes were very typical. Also, Due to my dark skin, i have never had a sunburn in my life so i also find the common description of radiation side effects as like a bad sunburn, so be of minimal help. Thanks to all and best wishes to all.",

I did radiation with breath holding which involved a device similar to a scuba mask in my mouth, clips on my nose and a pair of goggles on my eyes throughehich i saw a computer monitor . This is offered to reduce radiation nicking the heart. It forces lung in front of the heart. I dont know how prone position could be combined with this. I have the impression that newer breath holding options and the latest more accurate rads delivery equipment alleviates some of the concerns that might suggest prone positioning. At my facility xrays were always taken pre rad delivery to make sure i was in the right position mapped out by the doc and physicists, All of this meant my pre boost rads took about 30 minutes. I never had the feeling anything was being done to save time . It took as long as it took. I had a lump. And didnt need axil rads. I think bet most doc just dont think there is an evidece basis for prone rads for typical breast cancer patients. What does the recent research say? The use of tatoos and other markings helpnthe technicians get our bodies into the precise position each time. If we gonupside down. On the table, how would that work.",

Radiation following lumpectomy is standard of care for that reason. Surgery cannot guarantee that every malignant cell has been removed. All it would take is one stray cancer cell to lead to another tumor. Ask your doctor to share the data on radiation so you can make a well informed decision.",
