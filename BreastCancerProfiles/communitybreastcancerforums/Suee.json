I have just been told by Myriad that Golden Rule will only pay when I have been diagnosed with either breast or ovarian cancer?? My mother had breast cancer at 48 my middle sister at 41 and my eldest sister has just been diagnosed at the age of 57.  I am keen to have the test but cant pay the $3000+",

I am looking at going back to the UK for testing but it doesn't seem as if they do the same testing there. Thanks for your help Sue",
