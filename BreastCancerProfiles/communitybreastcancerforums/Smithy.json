At a certain grow out length do the curls straighten out? Also regarding hair color - with the white/grey hair that seems to come in the beginning stages - how many inches until you noticed a different color come in? Or did the white / grey stay? Has anyone noticed hair thinning - while growing out - due to Tamoxifen?",

My hair was fine...it does feel very coarse coming in. Of course that could be because I keep shaving it back down. I just keep seeing areas of little bald patches. How long until you noticed there weren't any bald patches? I love your hair! Artsee - you are a hair dresser :) If I keep shaving my head until I see an even shadow - will that mean that it will grow out in an even shape/pace at that point ? Right now I wear my hair at a zero. I will then try to keep it at a 1...when that looks good move it up to a 2... will this work? I love your blonde hair. Mine was blonde. At first the white fuzz was all I was shaving off - now my stubble seams to be turning quite dark. Since my length is stubble not the start of hair growth when can I dye it blonde? At a 3? I Googled \"bald women\" so I could get make up ideas...I noticed that there were a few European models with shaved heads. It was neat to see how they used accessories.:) Is anyone else keeping it shaved until it is thicker? If so - how long have you been shaving? My \"fuzz\" started coming back during my chemo.:) I had my last chemo 10/11.",

      "Content": "May 23, 2012 07:07PM - edited May 23, 2012 07:13PM by Smithy I wanted to mention one more thing! I was recently on one of the discussion boards on this site...I was reading what members felt about going on the Mirena IUD. Many of us were a bit confused that our obgyns would suggest this as an option because the company of the product (Bayer) says NOT to use the Mirena IUD if you have ever had breast cancer. Well, here is what I found interesting - someone on the site mentioned the word alopecia (a condition of complete baldness) - that the Mirena could have that as a side effect. I was just at a dinner party earlier that night - a friend of mine said she had the Mirena IUD and loved it. SHE HAS ALOPECIA!!! I got off the breastcancer.org site and started a mad dash google on Mirena and baldness. A lot of woman had clumps of hair falling out...and hair thinness... long story short - doctors are telling women that this product does not cause hair loss. Bayer says it does! The word Alopecia - along with other side effects ...are NOT mentioned in the patient info packet - only in the physician info packet. I read both info packets online - this is true. There are I believe three class action lawsuits forming. I called my friend as soon as morning came. She was blown away. She had asked her doctor 3 years ago if her hair loss was from the Mirena, he - like most doctors - responded absolutely not. It was caused by stress from her last pregnancy. She also had the side effects of loss of libido, mood swings, depression, irritability, and an overall sense of feeling like she was going crazy. To give you all an update - she had the IUD taken out on May 7 - the withdraws were horrible - but for the first time in 3 years she has hair growth. And eyelashes are making their way back!! Her mood...everything...has improved. These forums are so important...they really do change lives. I will have to go find the woman who mentioned the word Alopecio in her post...she truly saved the quality of one woman/family's life. :) Trouble growing hair back....deppression, irratibility...might not just be the things we take (meds) and face while going through breast cancer - but for some of us it could be the Mirena IUD.      ",

All I can say is I love how time goes by. :) All things change. It seemed - at first - like it would take forever for my hair to come in. Now I've got this mop of curly hair. I stopped my chemo in October. I enjoyed having the shaved head look...so I kept shaving it down to a zero. Once my hair started showing signs of even growth I started growing it out. I kept it at a 1 and a 2 for a while. Soon as my hair was at an Annie Leynox crop stage - I had it dyed blonde. That was fun. Once I could get my haircut I did. I went to my son's barber. I wanted someone who really knew how to cut short hair. And had lots of practice! I like what he has done with my hair. I loved the fun super short pixie stage. I'm growing it out now because I am so curious to what my hair will now look like. I have a two inch curly fro! After I find out - there is a good chance I will go back to my super short 1 1/2 inch long pixie. lol . For those of you sporting the bald look - or the shaved look - enjoy! I mean really - when is the next time you get to walk around with a shaved head? I dressed the part with artsy clothes, jewelry, and fun makeup. When I went in for my haircut - my son's barber had no idea I had had chemo - he just thought I was a woman that chose to go bald. lol I'll take that. :) Sounds good to me.  ",

It is a beautiful wig - but when I wear it I am given the feeling that something went wrong with my body. Oh right - I had breast cancer...:) When I wear nothing on my head I feel physically comfortable - and completely forget that I do not have any hair. I forget that I even have had breast cancer. You are right - it is like no one even notices. At least not in a negative way. I do get complimented on my \"haircut.\" When I was younger, I wanted to have a shaved head but my parents wouldn't let me. Come to think of it - when I was younger I wanted larger breasts, too. There is an example for being careful for what you wish for. Lol Our select population's quest for hair - regardless of to wig or not to wig...it is all the same - a psychological quest for the personal feeling of normalcy. It is all good.:)",

The only time I felt uncomfortable was when I had to run into the store - on a school night - to pick up shampoo and conditioner for my son. It didn't hit me until I was waiting in line - bald - at night - with only my shampoo and conditioner - that I looked a bit odd. Thank God I wasn't at Walmart - I would probably be on that people of Walmart site.",
