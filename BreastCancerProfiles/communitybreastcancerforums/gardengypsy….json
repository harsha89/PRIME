She has instructed me in LD massage techniques, warning signs, and how to purchase a sleeve if I ever need one. She's emphasized how much we can do in the early stages so that it doesn't progress. Today I heard about a woman who developed a severe case of LE 5 years after treatment ended. For crying out loud. Can we please catch a break here??",

Things are tough, but I feel like I am on the other side. It's been 8 months since I completed treatment. It's so good to hear that you are by your mother's side through this very intense journey.

I have joined exercise groups and see alternative healers. I am not saying you should do these things. You get to choose what you need to get through this.

The prosthesis covered by my insurance company is extremely comfortable (it had better be - it cost $500!). I wear it for work and when going out in public. I have never worn bras before either, just athletic gear. I was fitted by a specialist in the hospital for both the bra nd prosthesis. The bra is surprisingly comfortable. I began with a TE when I had the mastectomy. Couldn't wait to have it removed. Sometimes I think my healthy breast is a little lonely. Lol. No regrets.",
