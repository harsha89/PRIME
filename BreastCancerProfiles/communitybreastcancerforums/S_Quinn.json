They place a clip in the breast to mark before surgery which they remove after chemo even if you have a path complete response - they take out all the surrounding tissue. I had a complete pathalogical response to the primary tumor, but I had 14 pos axillary lymph nodes and 8 pos mammary nodes. I don't think you're going to get away with no surgery. If you had no pos nodes before surgery you may get away witout axillary disection. Good luck Quinn",
