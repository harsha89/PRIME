Swelling that comes and goes, discharge a few months ago but none since, a line across my nipple, and then about two months ago my left nipple started itching like crazy. The only thing to really make the itch go away is to like pinch my nipple. The breast surgeon referred me for ultrasound and mammogram. Both came back negative. Now just today the left nipple has been exceptionally itchy again and the aereola is dry and flaky. Could the mammogram have missed pagets? Can that happen Log in to post a reply",

I see a shurgeon Tuesday afternoon but don\u2019t know if something bad is happening and I need to go see someone sooner? Background - 29 years old. Five weeks postpartum NOT breastfeeding. Swelling in left breast with change in nipple (not circumferential retraction just a weird crater like slit though the middle. No lumps. Ache comes and goes. Been going on a week and a half. Today the swelling in my left breast went down to the point where both breasts almost look d the same size again and that full feeling went away. Right before bed it started to swell and feel full again. It\u2019s maybe one cup bigger than the right. While holding my daughter I noticed my left breast got tingles and went numb. The tingles and numb sensation has come and gone all night and have spread through my arms, fingers, and legs. Comes and goes. Anyone experiencing symptoms something similar? Think I\u2019m ok to wait and see the surgeon Tuesday afternoon Log in to post a reply",
