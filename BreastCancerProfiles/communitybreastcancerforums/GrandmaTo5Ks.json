Currently I have rust colored discharge from my left breast only. I have called and will see my doctor on Wednesday.  Since 4/4/15 I have been dealing with a 10mm complex cyst in my left breast. I have had numerous mammograms and ultrasounds, and a biopsy which said only \"clustered apocrine cysts\". That was last October. My last mammogram in June this year they said the cyst was only 8mm (I'm guessing because of the biopsy?) And they didn't do an ultrasound.  So here we are 4 months later and I'm having this spontaneous rusty discharge. Should I be worried? Should I push for something specific to be done?  Also, my maternal grandmother had breast cancer. Thank you all for your time. I appreciate you all. Log in to post a reply",
