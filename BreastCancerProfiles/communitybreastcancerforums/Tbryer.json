I told doctor my last visit that I wanted a print out of everything but I forgot to re mention it before I left. So needless to say I walked out without them. But I noticed how you all have everything listed at that bottoms of your pages so I will be updating all mine here soon.",

Not so sure what to say here but I will introduce myself as one who has been diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer. I have been battling this sense July 2013 which then was stage 3. I went through 12 cycles of chemo than radiation. But a week and a half after my chemo treatments were finished I found a lump in my armpit. They did a pet scan which found a lump in armpit (lymph node), one under my collar bone (which was there from the very first pet scan) and two lymph nodes under my breast bone. So they did radiation than another pet scan. At that time the lymph nodes under my breast bone was gone and the other two had shrunk and showed very low activity. So they decided to do chemo again in hopes to kill them off. Well when that round of chemo was done a week later I found a lump near my collar bone. The doctor felt I needed another pet scan in which this time it has now spread to my lungs (stage iv). I am just so freaked out. I am not sure how to react. My chemo doctor seems to act as if there really is no hope. There is no experimental treatments right now for me so the only thing to do is put me back on strong chemo, (oh no here we go again). My hair was just growing back, I was feeling stronger and my hope level was so high, only to be knocked backwards again. I feel so alone, so scared!",
