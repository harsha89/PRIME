    "Content": "dtown wrote: Hello Everyone, I am working through my 3rd fight with breast cancer in 3 years and am needing to make a treatment decision -- I could use some insight if anyone has experienced with re-irradiation and/or xeloda. In 2012 after my first diagnosis (IDC stage IIb, left side) I had 36 radiation treatments to my left breast, axilla and supra clavicle after DD chemo, lumpectomy and followed by Tamoxifen. In 2014 - (6 months after completing treatment) I had a local recurrence in my left breast and an axillary lymph node. This was treated with a bilateral mastectomy, axillary dissection, hysterectomy and oopherectomy, afinitor/aromasin. Now, 2015 - (1 year after completing treatment) I have a regional recurrence. This time in 2 \"left over\" lymph nodes in my axillary chain (1 high up in the armpit and one sub pectoral near collar bone) as well as 12 supra clavicle lymph nodes in my neck. These have all been removed surgically and 14 out of the 22 nodes removed were \"grossly positive, many with extra capsular invasion\". My team at The Mayo Clinic, along with every other doctor I've seen has recommended I re-irradiate the entire area. Treatment would be 2x's a day for 18 days. My dilemma is this: one opinion is to take Xeloda in combination with re-irradiation because it will weaken any remaining cancer cells and make them more susceptible to the radiation, the other (Mayo Clinic) does not recommend Xeloda for me because as it is a chemotherapy agent it targets and weakens not only cancerous cells but also all the healthy cells. The second go round with radiation could prove to be too much toxicity and cause major heart/lung/brachial plexus nerve damage and there is concern that since this is my second radiation to the left side weakening my healthy cells will cause far more damage down the line than necessary. Basically, cancer may not get me, but the toxicity of trying to fight it very well might. I am only 34 and obviously am trying to live a very long, participatory, and happy life with my little family of 3. Thank you all for your input!
