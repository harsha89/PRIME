      "Content": "Jul 16, 2008 05:19AM - edited Jul 16, 2008 05:21AM by lilsunshine This is really confusing for you. I am so sorry you are going thru this, it must be so stressful, especially in light  of your sister's situatuion. I know with my bone tumor and now my new \"lesion\" in my other leg I see 2 drs, one in DC where I live and the other one in TX. I totally trust every word the dr in TX tells me. He has done all my surgeries and I know I am getting the best care from him. You need to find THAT dr that you can lay all your trust in. Hard to do when you are new to the game and everyone is telling you a different story. I myself am waiting for my 1st breast MRI{I have had countless Mri's and bone scans Pet scansEtc} and I wait to see what it will tell. The BCC dr told me that my inverted nipple could be a tumor behind it pulling it in. A lot to think about while you wait. I have a bone marrow problem that they can't decide whether it is a problem or not. Obviously it has been 2 yrs and I am still moving around , I have lost 25 lbs lately and run a low grade fever, and feel like crap all the time. THe area in my proximal femur hurts a lot now but I don't even say anything anymore. UNfortunately my favorite Othro ONc dr retired 2 yrs ago and the new one is OK , he too is a friend of my BIL , who is also an Ortho dr , but it's not the same thing. I guess until  I get a frank tumor like my last one a bone marrow thing is not exciting. I hope that you will get the right answers you need , and your sister will beat this. Monday will come for both of us and we will get good results. Bonnie",

They got in the surfical suite and found that it was just a series of complex cysts and were able to preserve all of her reproductive organs. She also had to have a kidney surgery 6 weeks later.  It is scary when our children are involved. We can sit back and think a litle more calmly when it is ourselves but our babies? No way!I hope that it is not BC, she is way too young to go thru something like this. She should be enjoying life and school and flirting with boys and getting A's in school. Not that I think she is too young to get BC, I know that this can strike any age,just like cervical cancer or ovarian cancer. I highly recomend the vaccine for HPV, Guardisil. We must protect our daughters now while they are still young enough. Bonnie",

I think this is lymph nodes.I also have what I think is a lymph node in my groin or down my thigh but the Gen Surgery drs dismissed me and said \"Oh well it has been like this for over a year\" ???? Can you believe this? I already have my 2nd opinion appt scheduled, as my core needle biopsy too was \"inconclusive\" and at 1st , they were like come back in 6 months , then the NP calls me and said the Rad Dr says they would feel better if I had another MRI in 3 months. I said I am not waiting 3 months! They had hinted they wanted to do an excisional biopsy, why didn't they? I think they didn't want to admit they were wrong? I don't know. The female Rad dr is the one I trust, I think she is the one pushing{pushed} for me to get what I did get. Good luck in your continued good health, Ekiz, I can't actually feel a \"lump\" but I have outward signs like 6 months ago , my left nipple all of a sudden  stated to invert. I had already noticed a slight size differenc. It didn't help that I had to go buy new bras as I had gone from a 38 c to a 36 b as I have lost 25 lbs since last Nov without trying! And I had noticed that while driving I had a spot on my \"breastarea\" that itched and I would scratch at it. Also wearing a seatbelt hurts  and puts pressure on my chest. I do have chest pain sometimes that will take my breath away, that is shooting from my breast! My nipples ache and almost feel as if I am nursing a baby but I am 47 and 3 yrs post-menopasual{sp}. The 1cm mass that was found on MRI was said to not be a fibroidenoma, now what it is , that is a mystery?THe biopsy  itself was really not that bad, although when the male Rad Dr said this, I wanted to smack him. He said it  like he was talking to a 5 yr old. I have had 7 major sirgeries and 2 Tyroid FNB and believe me those are actually much worse!HaHa Bonnie",

I have what I am sure is a lymph node in my left leg that has been swollen for over a year. My PCP {dr} told me it was an infected hair from shaving{I had to laugh at that one!} but I went back to her for my Pap smear a few weeks ago and said \"Hello remember that infected hair? well it's still there} It's not that. Yesterday I had to go to the GYN dr for yet another Pap/ appt as she couldn't open my cervix. This dr said she didn't think it was a lymph node but it is definetely something. I have already had a tumor on my other leg so I am worried. Apparently there is something wrong with my bone marrow so I don't know. I have a \"lesion\" in my proximal femur close to this area so it could be associted to this, she is sending me to Gen Surgery, to find out what it is. If I had been to Mexico I would swear it was like on one of those TV shows and I had a big worm growing in my leg! OOH Yuck!  Suz Stay on top of your health and don't let anything slide by.

Anyway I am glad that you are staying on top of this. You need to be diligent about your health, the tiredness could just be low iron BUT combined with your other symptoms the drs need to investigate your symptoms til you are satisfied. This is why I am going for a 2nd opinion. I had a bone tumor and basically diagnosed myself because the Dr at our clinic laughed when I went to see him and told him I needed to see an Ortho dr and that I thought I had a bone tumor. I did and I have an above the knee amputation and he was fired!!!! I wasn't the only one he screwd up with and our clinic got tired of his incompetence. Bonnie",

Make sure you take some Tylenol{ask 1st they told me to} and take your Mom or someone with you. I had mine and it was really not that bad, the rcuperation was a breeze. I have an above the knee amputation and have had 7 surgeries so I have had some serious recuperations for this. So I can tell you that I would {and probably will} do another breast biopsy anyday over leg surgery. Or a tyroid FNbiopsy. Ouch! Those are brutal. Please know that I will be thinking of you, Bonnie",
