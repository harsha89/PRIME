I am 38 and the doctor told me the lump is a fibroadenoma which is very common. The last 3 weeks were very hard not knowing what was going on. This site is wonderful, it allowed me to get my feeling out. I will keep you in my prayers. I first had a mammogram and an ultrasound, which were both abnormal. Then I had a core needle biopsy. Although, no cancer I am going to have a lumpectomy on Thursday. Staying busy during the wait helped me. Feel free to express yourself here,it helps.",
