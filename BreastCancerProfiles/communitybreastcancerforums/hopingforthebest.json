June 12th I had my physical and brought it up again. Just worried! My doctor sent me to a surgeon and she did a needle biopsy. Which showed up A typical suspicious pathology result. What does that mean? They said that they think that it might be cancerous. I will have to do an MRI on Friday or Monday. I should be having surgery by the end of the next week. I very badly need some support for someone going through this. I have been crying on and off for the last eight hours. I have a 3 and 8 year old and don't want them seeing how scared and upset that I really am. What should I expect. Log in to post a reply",
