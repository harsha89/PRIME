ER+ PR+ HER- None of the Hormonal treatments work on me - never have. Seems my horomones are non functioning Ibrance failed as did Affinitor (doubling my tumor markers in 1 month). Xeloda was a good fit - 18 months and NEAD - until it failed. After hearing about patient Perkins, I contacted NIH / NCI about their Immunotherapy trial. Sent all my information, scans etc to be evaluated just to see if I qualified for an interview. First hurdle passed. Went to Bethesda to meet the whole team, had a slew of tests (including MRI of the Brain) and lots of blood work. Felt good to be given the green light to proceed. Waited 30 days off medication and scheduled Apheresis on a Monday and Liver lesion extraction on a Thursday. Now I have to wait about 3 weeks to see if my cells grow. Then another couple of weeks to see how many mutations they are able to detect. If all goes as plan, they will freeze my cells until I am ready to proceed. I will start my first IV chemo next Tuesday - Abraxane. If this treatment is successful, I can stay on it until it fails, then I can decide to continue with another conventional treatment or go with immunotherapy. This is still in early stages, but at least there is a glimmer of hope. However small. I do feel this is the wave of the future fight of cancer. I have also been told that if the treatment does not work, I am able to go back to conventional therapy. I just wanted to share my treatment plan with you all. I have explained this in very abbreviated form. Never, ever lose hope!",

They are more interested in your mutations and how your T cells recognize the mutations. And their genetic testing is by far much more detailed than Foundation One, thus having more mutations recognized. Once they find the T cells that match the mutations, they now grow them by the BILLIONS. They no longer needto find many, many mutations. This is open to anyone. They also don\u2019t care if you are ER/PR + or TN. They just care about the mutations and the T-cells.",

That can take 3 weeks. Days after the apheresis, they removed a superficial liver lesion that also went straight to the lab to harvest my Tcells in the tumor and get my tumor mutations. This whole process can take 2-3 months. If my cells only recognize the mutations weakly, then there is a program to enhance the Tcells to recognize the mutations more strongly. That can take 6 months. I do not know if they have a limit on \u201camount or type\u201d of chemotherapy. This is a government trial, so they cover all medical costs. After you are accepted, they will also cover your flight. For my latest tests, I did not have any expenses. Call them and see what they say. You will need to submit progress notes, history, scans, etc. They will give you a list of what they need. Then they will convene and decide if you might be a candidate and if yes, invite you to come. Your first visit, you will need to supply your travel and hotel. Once you are in, they will supply airfare and your stay in the hospital. JFL - We had started sending paperwork back in October, but my liver lesions were not big enough. Affinitor failed quickly causing my tumor markers to explode. We sent them my liver MRI showing growth and the team said that it was the right size. We were aware that they needed me to be 30 days medication free. So we were proactive. They made all the appointments for after the 30 days. While all the testing is being done, I am encouraged to seek traditional treatment until it fails. They just ask that they be informed as to any changes in traditional treatments. I do know that an exclusion would be having brain Mets. They do a brain MRI to verify you are clear. They have been great to work with and very responsive",
