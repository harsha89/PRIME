So Ladies - what happens when you are in the middle of recon with tissue expamders and are now in need of chemo?  I haven't been able to find much about doing things in this order?! My bilateral mast with recon was on 12/2. Any help or words of advice would be much appreciated.  Oh and I will be 47 on 12/24 and thought that I am probably somewhat perimenopausal.  thanks much - Just-Sher Dx'd on 10/28/09 w/DCIS.

      "Content": "Dec 19, 2009 02:43AM - edited Dec 19, 2009 02:44AM by Just-Sher momto3  After my DCIS diagnosis, I meet with the BS who wasn't sure that she would be able to remove all of the DCIS.  She sent me in for a Nuclear Breast imagining Scan.  The scan showed that I had 3 areas of DCIS.  If she were to removed the 3 areas, including the tissue in between, it was possible that I would be very disfigured, hard to reconstruct if not impossible.  I opted to have both removed so I wouldn't have to wait for the \"other shoe to drop\".  Ironically, I had had issues with my left breast in the past.  The cancer however was in my right.  I was surprised when the path report came back, that there wasn't any sign of cancer in my left. My BS told me that the pathologist really wouldn't even \"size\" the DCIS in my right breast because it was so wide spread, more areas than the imaging showed.  It was in the path report that they found the microinvasion 2.5mm. When I had the bilat mast.  I also started recon with tissue expanders.  By having both breasts done at the same time I will be able to have better symetry and less worry. I am now meeting with an oncologist on 12/22, to discuss the next phase of treatment.  BS said that it will most likely be chemo. Meet with the PS today, and fortunately was told that recon will still continue even when I am going through chemo.  Yea!  Funny how little things like that are considered good news nowadays.   Oh, FYI- all of this was found during my annual mammogram.  No lump.  Just-Sher",
