I need help....Let me give you a little history.  Seven years ago I was diagnosed with DCIS in my left breast.  I had a lumpectomy and 7 weeks of radiation followed by 5 years Tamoxifen.  Fast forward 7 years and I have had a recurrence.  In May I had a double mestectomy.  At the time it was thought i only had 1 tumor in my left breast but when the pathology was done they found 4 tumors.  I had 2 out of 11 nodes with cancer.  I just completed 8 rounds of chemo yesterday.  I was feeling very relieved that I was able to put this part behind me (chemo).  Today I had an appointment with a radiation Oncologist.  My medical oncologist said that we needed to check that box off....at least go see them.  He said we should be HIGHLY suspicious if they recommend radiation again because I have already had it.  His words were...It would be pretty sad if we get rid of the cancer but i have to walk around with an oxygen tank because I have lung issues with having rads again.  Todays Rad Dr said that she recommends 5 weeks of rads of full breast ond neck where the lymphnodes  are.  I was floored  I couldn't even comprehend what she was saying.  My husband asked what long term side effects could occur and she made it sound like not many.  I am SO confused.  I called my medical oncolgist to make an appointment to discuss this with him.  Have any of you had radiation twice on the same breast?  If so what type of side effects did you have?  My gut is telling me not to do this again...it obviously did not work the first time and the Onc said this would be at a lower dose then I had before.  If the high dose didn't work what makes them believe the lower dose will?  Needless to say ladies I am VERY confused.  If you could shed some light on this issue I would really appreciate it.

YES!!!  However, this is my second time with BC and up to this point I feel I have been as aggressive as possible with my treatment.  I'm not sure that having rads again will minimize the chance of recurrence for me....My goal is to be around for a long time for my boys....how sad would it be if I do rads and my quality of life diminishes because of it. I will keep you posted on what I find out.  I have an appointment with my medical Onc Friday and am hoping to get into another Rad Onc this week for another opinion. Please keep your opinions coming!!!",

Where I live there is a group of Drs from every field that will review your pathology, history etc and give you a recommendation. I met with them... on this panel there were... med oncs, reconstruction surgeon, radiation onc, breast surgeon..etc..you get the idea. They actually called in 2 other radiation Oncs to consult. There recommendation for me was NO to rads. Several reasons were given. 1. The standard is if the tumor is 5 cm or larger you radiate...mine was 3.8 2. If you have 4 nodes or more involved....I had 2 3. Margins are not \"clean\" mine were The Drs looked at my pathology and my reports from my first diagnosis and felt the risks outweighed the benefits. By doing rads again I run the risk of other cancers. My chest wall and lungs are at risk for scar tissue. Would need a different reconstruction...I have expanders in and reradiating will damage the blood vessels further. I also have a higher risk of wound infection. As of right now there is no indication I have BC. Doing rads right now does not mean I won't get BC again...remember it didn't work the first time. The Drs said they would like to keep something in our back pocket incase it does come back. If I do rads now there is no chance of me doing it again. The Drs said they would like to have as many things as they can to throw at the cancer God forbid it comes back. After looking at all the pros and cons I have decided that I am not going to do rads at this time. Please know this was a very difficult decision to come to and not one I made lightly. I feel I made the right choice for me. I feel good about my decision and I actually slept for the first time in a long time. I wanted to stop back in and let everyone know what I decided and thank all of you for your support. Lisa",
