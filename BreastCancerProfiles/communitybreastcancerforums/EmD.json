I've read the whole internet (lol) and they do say cysts are usually smooth (and feel like water balloons, so kinda squishy and round) BUT (big but!) not all of them feel the same (breast tissue can make it hard to feel the lump/cysts actual consistency and simply no two bodies are the same), not all cysts are B9 (most are) and not all hard lumps are cancer (most aren't.) The biggest thing I learned in all my googling and reading is that there is no answer there and there is no one thing that will tell you whether it's cancer or not, the only way to find out what's going on with your body is getting screened and tested when needed, which is what we're doing. So my advice is not to google because there are no answers there and the potential for making the wait much worse for yourself is huge. Keep us updated t8momma and fenella, I'll do the same and remember, we're not alone in this!",

She was going to refer me to get an u/s last time but we had the wrong paper work for me to be covered so I go next week (with the right paper work!) to get the referral. When are you scheduled for your u/s? I'm also having pain, well it's not really pain just kind of discomfort that is occasionally bothersome and usually not. Good luck, praying it's nothing for both of us and take it from me, don't google and try to decide what your lump is, it's a viscious circle with no answers to be found.

I noticed this by accident when I was undressing, but since then I've been looking closer to see if it goes away or not. I'm sure it's nothing but I don't know if I should mention it to the Dr so she can look. My risk is very low, my only risk really is that I have PCOS which (for me) = estrogen dominant hormonal imbalance, other than that, really no risk factors, so I doubt very much that my symptoms signify the lump being something malignant, still, it's hard not to fixate while you wait for the tests isn't it.

The Dr had scheduled me for a Mammo and U/S today so I went in and the ladies at the Mammo part sent me up to get the ultrasound first, lady at the ultrasound area said the Dr always wants mammo first and then went out to talk to the Dr. She came back and said they'd do the ultrasound and then decide if they want the mammo \"the Dr usually wants mammo first but because you're so young...\" (Not sure what she meant by that.) So she does the u/s and she seemed to really try to find something but couldn't see anything. At one point she was looking in the area and I could see a black tear drop shaped thing on the screen but she didn't mention it so not sure if I was just seeing things. She asked me to find the lump and then put the u/s wand directly on it and couldn't find it even then. So she said it's probably just tissue changes, it can feel lumpy and bumpy (which it doesn't, it's fairly uniform except this small lump) and that it was probably just that I'm getting older and have had kids (I'm 28 and have 2, my youngest is 5.) She told me the radiologist sometimes wants to come and see if he can see anything and went out when she came back she said he didn't, want to and I didn't need the mammo and sent me on my way. I've read a few threads here with the same situation (palp lump that isn't seen) but didn't see any update on what was done and what the outcome was. I want to accept this and rest with it but I can't rest with lump+pain that's \"nothing.\" I see my Dr for the report and results on the 25th. Advice? Log in to post a reply",

I'm waiting on my referral to be approved under a state program (because I'm uninsured and, lucky for me, low enough income to be covered otherwise I don't know what we'd do) and then I'll get an appt for the u/s (hopefully within the next week or 2). I TOTALLY understand wanting to get it out of your head, I had the lump confirmed on Oct 31 and I've been waiting ever since to sort out the referral :/ I told my husband I'm going to eat an entire cake in celebration when I can finally get this thing out of my head!

We've used the university hospital here for my son and had a great experience, so hopefully, should we need it, it will be the same off the pediatric ward. The place I'm going for my u/s is a different hospital though which I've never been to, so I'm a little bit nervous about how that one will be. I have two little ones too (7 and 5) and when I pray about this I pray that I'll be here for them above everything else, I'm not afraid of death except that it would mean leaving them and I can't bear that. I haven't cried about it, at the rational level I'm convinced it's nothing and even if it isn't, it's not a death sentence, but the mind quickly takes you there doesn't it? The worst was when my husband said the dreaded \"if anything happened to you...\" I almost broke down then. \"Give your troubles to God, he'll be up all night anyway.\" I love that. It helps me to remember that any sickness is a spiritual cleansing, and that God gives us what He does in His wisdom, even if we don't understand it. \"We plan and God plans and God is the best of planners.\" Faith is the biggest comfort for me, I don't think it matters too much specifically what one believes spiritually, we are all spiritual beings and there is great comfort to be found in that. I watch the show Parenthood and it has a breast cancer storyline this season, it's been both comforting and terrifying to watch as I go through this whole lump finding ordeal. I feel like I'm seeing cancer things everywhere, I keep coming across documentaries about cancer, my father in law was just diagnosed with thyroid cancer, of course there's the pink washing of everything. My lump was confirmed on Oct 31, the day before breast cancer awareness month started :/ It's hard to put it out of mind, but I feel like I'm at a good place with it right now since things are moving, this forum has been a huge support to me and I feel so fortunate to have so many who are going through the same with me, as much as I wouldn't wish this on anyone.",
