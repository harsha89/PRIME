First, let me say that I sailed through radiation with minimal short term side effects.  I was tired, but managed to exercise every day; I had radiation dermatitis that cleared up within 2 weeks of finishing rads.   My lumpectomy tissue was 6cm x 5.5cm x 2cm and when down into the facia of my chest wall.  I had an awesome surgeon who \"moved stuff around\" during the surgery so although it is noticable that I am missing ~ 1/4 of my breast when I am naked (and I have to wear padding now) it is barely noticible when I wear a bra (even a sports bra - as long as it is good compression).    I have had shoulder pain since my lumpectomy that has gotten worse since finishing radiation.   I did have cording during radiation, that apparently also has \"healed\" (according to my RO).  Mobility in my shoulder is extremely limited, and I have pretty much constant pain in it.  I also have a very very tight chest wall that makes it difficult to take a deep breath.  I can't really put my arm over my head - the muscles just feel super tight.  It pretty much hurts all the time, it is not the same \"stabbing\" pains that sort of come-and-go every once-and-a-while. The chest wall tightness was so bad that I thought I had asthma (because I couldn't take a deep breath).  My chest wall doesn't really \"hurt\" it is just so tight, and \"heavy feeling\" that I can't take a breath. I can run (I run a lot and am in very good health overall) - but I can't run fast, because I can't take a deep breath, and I can't \"pump my arm\" because of my shoulder. My question for you all - have any of you had this?  How long did it take to go away?  Did you try any physical therapy?  (does it sound like truncal lymphedema?).
