I have to tell you all about my exciting evening....For about 24 hours I had been having a burning pain down the back of my left arm (cancer side) which went all the way to my elbow.  It had slowly began to bother me to the point I was constantly rubbing it for relief.  By 8:30 last night I thought I ought to have this checked out.  Of course my chemo brain was running through all of the SE's from chemo and it freaked me out thinking of blood clots and etc.  When I got there I thought good only 2 people in front of me to see the Dr.  As I waited more and more people started coming in.  Eventually there were sick children everywhere.  The triage nurse saw me and she decided that while I wait in the holding tank I ought to be in a surgical mask so I did.  (My friend who went with me also asked for a mask. LOL).  By 12 midnight they had me in a room.  The doctor made his appearance at about 1 AM asking questions and etc.  I had a EKG, Chest X-rays and blood work.  Everything was normal but I did not find this out until 3 AM.  I finally fell into bed about 4 AM.  By 8 AM I was up getting ready for work.  Boy am I tired!  Oh, I forgot to mention the $200 co-pay for emergency care to tell me I'm normal.  Oh well, I would have had a panic attack it I hadn't gone.  I think the burning pain may be from my mastectomy and the nerves regenerating??????  Did anyone else have this kind of arm pain after mastectomy? Going home tonight and getting into bed early.  No need to take any sleeping aides tonight!",

Good Luck on you tests Simvog!  I start having my tests next month too!  Feels never ending.  Before BC I saw my GP every 6 years for strep or some other crud that was passed to my by my nieces and nephews.  I saw my Gyno every 2 years (not like I was supposed to).  I have never been to so many Dr. appointments in my life. Good Luck TEXAS!!!  Are you having reconstruction? I am doing good, looking forward to get my foob on August 26th!

I have been following everyone since December 1st.  However, not had the guts to post.  Well here goes.  I am new to this so bear with me. I am currently taking 4 TX of TC every 21 days.  I just finished my 3rd TX on 1/19/09.  Just one more to go on 2/13/09! Yea!  It will be my luck the onc will say \"lets do 2 more TX for good measures\".  I am having quite a bit of fatigue during this TX so I have decided to stay home from work to get more rest.  I am feeling a bit guilty since this is the first day I have taken off (except for treatment days).  I have a question for all of you strong women who are exercising during treatment.  I don't know how you do it.  I just don't have any energy on week 1, On week 2 I'm trying to get things back in order from week 1.  Also, I am not taking Neulasta so I have to stay away from the public.  So that leaves week 3.  I would love any suggestions or just a swift kick in the hiney to get me moving.  I hope that everyone has a wonderful day of no or litte SE!  Thank you agian everyone for keeping me going.  You are all an inspiration to me!  Sonia",

I had another fill.  I am now up to 300cc.  Finally feel like I have some boobs.  Today during my fill my right pectoral muscle decided to jump off of the table.  It happened so fast that it scared me.  So far so good...I am not experiencing much discomfort.  At night I just cannot lay on my side or stomach very well.  I am really looking forward to having a normal looking chest (in clothes). Well our board is getting quiet..which is a good thing.  I think everyone is getting busy living their lives and not thinking so much about BC.",

Have a good week! Sonia",

Yeah!  I wish your friend a speedy recovery and the strength to come out the other side of BC strong!
