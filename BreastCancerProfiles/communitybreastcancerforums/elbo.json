You are not being a nuisance and you are not a hypochondriac. By the way, please encourage your mom to get her annual exam. If she cannot afford it, visit the Cancer Society website for where to get free screening. The fact that her sister had it puts herÂ at elevated risk. There's no reason to worry, but no reason to live in denial either!",
