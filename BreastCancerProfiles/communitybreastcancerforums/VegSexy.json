Once I am done with this regime, I will do Herceptin once every three weeks till March 2018. My husband drove me to the first three cycles just in case I had a reaction to something. I had no reaction and after each one I said \"You know, I can take myself\". So, starting at cycle 4 I was driving myself. Like I mentioned above, I just completed cycle 9 and I'll continue to drive for the rest of the regime - unless something really strange happens, but I don't think so. I'm feeling pretty good with the exception of the wired tired feeling from the steroid. I am also working in the office, at home, and at the infusion suite. I workout, walk, go places, do things...you know - living my life as normally as I can :)",
