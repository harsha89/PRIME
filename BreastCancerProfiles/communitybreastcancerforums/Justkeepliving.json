    "Content": "Justkeepliving wrote: I was reading a book called Positively Beutiful about a girl who's mother becomes diagnosed with breast cancer because of BRCA1. I asked my mom if this was why she got breast cancer and she told me that she had CHEK2. My moms mom, my moms aunt, and 3 of my moms moms first cousins all had breast cancer. Both of my grandfathers also had prostate cancer. I want to get tested for CHEK2 but I can't for another 7 years because of my age. My mom tells me not to worry about it but I can't stop thinking about it. She got cancer before 40, who's to say I won't get it earlier Log in to post a reply",
