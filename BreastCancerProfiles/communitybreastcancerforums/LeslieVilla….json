Graviola's cancer-killing ability was even shown against multi-lymphoma.(1)  According to research from Sloan-Ketering Cancer Center, extracts of Graviola have been effective against multi-drug resistant \u201cMDR\u201d cancer cells. (2)  Researcher Jerry McLaughlin of Purdue University explains this is because phytochemical compounds called annonaceous acetogenins found in Graviola have the ability to stop energy production within cancer cells thereby \u201cpulling the plug\u201d on them. (3)  In research funded by the National Cancer Institute, the Indiana Elks Cancer Research Fund and the Purdue Research Foundation, (3) Dr. McLaughlin's laboratory found that a specific Graviola acetogenin called bullatacin preferentially targeted multi-drug resistant (MDR) breast cancer cells in vitro causing their death. (2)  Their research further showed that the annonaceous acetogenins found in Graviola were 250 times as potent as the chemo drug adriamycin against MDR breast cancer cells (2) while being minimally toxic to normal cells.

I've heard of Biafine or using a regular (peeled) aloe plant leaf- I try not to eat meat but someone metiontioned red meat being important for radiaiton so any diet advice i'd appreciate too! This board was so awesome in helping me get through chemo and surgery. need my peeps advice again for the rads! i know most of you are past the radiation now so i'm sure you have some great advice. thank you in advance!",
