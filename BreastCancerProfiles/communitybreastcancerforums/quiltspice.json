I am also working right up until surgery......... would rather not, but need all the PTO I can get for the 2 months off post surgery. I think the pre-surgery countdown wait is stressful. I keep telling myself...... Breath...... breath slow.",

I am so not looking forward to this!!!! :( I had my breast biopsy Sept 28th (it's small, ER+PR+HER2-). Today I went to Walmart and picked up a few things from the \"what to bring to the hospital\" list. So thankful for that list- I just would not have known what to pack!!!!",
