I still am being followed by my MO and will be for a few years. I will be seeing her in Aug. (3 months since last visit) for blood work (tumor markers) and to manage my Arimidex.",

At least it is for me! Linda505, my tumor was probably present for a couple of years as well! It was only discovered because I had an MRI to look more closely at the DCIS in my right breast and wouldn't ya know--they found something in my left breast! I don't know what to tell my friends who take comfort in clean annual mammograms. Technology has to improve here. I alternate between marveling at little things each day,  like how beautiful the sky is and being terribly annoyed each day about little things--like people complaining about how much they have to do! I guess it really is a rollercoaster",

I'm a very pragmatic person, often at the expense of my emotional health. When I was dx there was so much to do! Now, 3 weeks post bmx, it all came crashing down. And where? In a hotel room thousands of miles from home because dammit I wasn't going to let a \"little\" thing like bc get in the way of a business trip! So here I am, alone, waiting another week for my Oncotype and I finally realized, I have breast cancer! Geez that's even hard to write! I could see it, but haven't FELT it until just now. Mammogram didn't pick this up and  so sick of well meaning people saying, \"oh you must've had a bad radiologist\". No, sh*t happens and more often than most realize!

It's as if you're about to go off the ledge and then try and keep pulling yourself back. It's a surreal. I hope you are able to quiet your mind at some points and take care of yourself--hard with 6 kids! Thank you ziggypop for your kind and encouraging words. It's so weird to go through these emotions when I essentially feel health! I'm trying to focus on healing and small victories. Oh and getting used to living with uncertainties. But I suppose that's life even without cancer! There's that damn word again....",
