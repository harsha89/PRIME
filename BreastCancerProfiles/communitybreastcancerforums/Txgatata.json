Still don't have markers or pathology back so still in the dark. They are getting me in for a PET scan early next week and I see my onco on wed. And away we go on the rollercoaster once again! And when I say in the dark, I mean on the ER,PR and Her. It is definitely BC in the nodes",

Because of the holiday, they don't expect the results until tomorrow. My question is, having gone through this twice before, I know you forget to ask so many things, so I wanted to have a list of questions ready for my doc. I saw the orders my MO put forth am doing they asked for ER, PR and Her status. What else should I ask besides the obvious? Do I need PET? Bone Scan?",

I finally got a CT and that along with biopsy showed mets in lung lymph nodes however all docs still think cough is not related unless the nodes are somehow pushing on something. Have you talked to your oncologist? Perhaps a second opinion if it worrys you as CT scans are likely to show more than X-ray.",

Cough got worse so went to regular doc in Feb who thought it was lisonopril. Cough kept up despite going off med and got worse to the point my DH and I switch turns sleeping in our bed. Was at my 6 month Breast Surgeon checkup and she ordered a CT that showed \"Development of right hilar adenopathy suspicious for nodal metastatic disease\". Onco came out and said she thinks \"its\" back as did the thorassic surgeon that is doing EBus this week. My questions are would mets to those lymph nodes cause cough, fatigue and chest pain and if not mets what else could it be? Lymphoma from Chemo or rads? Sarcoidosis? Anything that won't kill me?",

And after all of that talk of making lists, what do I forget? To ask for pathology report and of course it's after close. I guess I should postwhere elsewhere but is it possible to just have mets in the hilar nodes only? My hope would be then I could do the ibrance which many have said shrinks the nodes. Guess i am just wishful planning now",
