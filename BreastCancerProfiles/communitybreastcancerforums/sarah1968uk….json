Later loved Paul Mc, Al Pacino and Dustin Hoffman. Even later (30s) Robert D Jr - embarrassing internet  and video obsession by this point!  May have grown out of crushes now, not sure!    Sarah x",

You have more time now to prepare what to say!  I couldn't do it - you are very brave to be interviewed. There is some excellent advice here - I can't really add anything. Boil it down to a few main points that you really want to emphasise and make a few note cards with bullet points on etc.  Reesie and Coolbreeze  in particular, have expressed some ideas brilliantly - notably the lack of research funding for Stage 4 and the ways that a normal, young woman, who is also a mother and everything else, can live positively with the diagnosis, while still being aware of what it entails. You seem like a strong, bright woman who I'm sure can speak from the heart in your own words. Hope you don't mind me putting my oar in here!  All the best,  Sarah x",

I have been unable to come off effexor, having been on it for 11 years, the SEs being too bad. I have had OCD and associated anxiety since the age of 14/15,soon after my father died and we moved to a different part of the country.The tabs.do numb the anxiety, but can also numb emotions too. Since your daughter's hormones and emotions are in a state of transistion anyway, I would certainly not be hasty to encourage her to take them. As a very, very, last resort, maybe and as long as you are assured that there are no probs coming off them.  Sorry if this is a bit mixed up, Jenni!  Sarah x",

Rads will really kick in after you've finished them and should show results after a couple of months. They can't scan much before this due to soreness and inflammation.
