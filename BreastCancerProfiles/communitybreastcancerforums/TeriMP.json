I was diagnosed in Aug 2014 with IDC 3.5cm grade 3 breast cancer, ER/PR+ Her2-, I did not have chemo until Jan15, 2015, but did have a bmx in Nov 2014. I completely understand the fear/anxiety this cancer causes with all the waiting. I too was/still am worried about microscopic cancer cells floating around in my body. I too did the cannabis oil while waiting for treatment, as did my husbands grandma/grandpa when they were diagnosed with their cancers. Your mom and you will be her best advocate, the one thing I learned during my treatment was I had to stay on top of everything, make phone calls to ensure tests, referrals we booked in a timely manner. Did your mom have any other scans (MRI, PET scan, etc) to determine if lymph nodes were involved? I was told that bc of my age (30), size and grade of tumor it was aggressive but because there was no lymph node involvement it was an \"emergency case\" to get me into chemo before Xmas. I know I'm not of much help but that was my time line, I hope your mom is able to get in soon and get a treatment plan started! Teri",

Once I was diagnosed from the ultrasound / mammogram / core biopsy and met with my BS to discuss surgery options. It was she who ordered the MRI. Most of the ladies I have talked to have had an MRI, if doctors are concerned the cancer may have spread will order a PET scan. I have asked for a PET scan to put my mind at ease but have been told it's not done on my stage as it is unnecessary test that I don't need to be exposed to. It never hurts to seek out a second opinion as this is your moms life, she will need to advocate for herself to ensure she is being heard and getting the treatment she needs/deserves in a timely manner. Wishing you and your mom the best! Teri",

My treatments were every 3 weeks for 12 weeks. I was lucky and never had nausea/upset stomache but seemed to get every other side effect. As treatments went on the side effects got worse but lasted for shorter amount of time; by my last one I felt under the weather for maybe a week. I took 2nd week to recover (as blood count was still pretty low) and started working out by 3rd week to get back into shape. My oncologist originally wanted 6 months of chemo (I think standards treatment) but one of the drugs Adrymicin (known here as the \"red devil\") she wanted to use I refused to take bc of the potential side effects. I am very happy/comfortable with all the decisions I've made regarding treatment. I wouldn't have done anything different. Teri",

I elected to have a bilateral mastectomy (nov '14) and started chemo Jan '15. I chose not to go back to work during this time, it took me a full 3-4 weeks to recover but much longer to be at to vacuum/lift heavy objects. I did heal well and made sure to to the stretches the nurses showed me to ensure I would get my range of motion back quickly. For me surgery was by far the easiest of this whole ordeal. I was on pain meds for about 2 weeks. I tried vacuuming about 3 weeks post surgery and was in quite a bit if pain for about a week or so after. When your doc says no house work or heavy lifting I highly recommend listening. ;-) I wish you the best! Teri",
