My mom has just been diagnosed with non invasive ductal carrcoma(?).  She will has a lump ectomy next Thursday , her lymph nodes are fine and they expect her to make a total recovery.  She is 52. My maternal grandmother and maternal aunt both passed of breast cancer.  My Grandmother in her early 60's and my aunt doagnossed at 28 and died at 32.   I have scheduled a visit with my gp to set up a mammogram for this Friday.  I do self exams regularly but obviously need to step up the screening a notch.  I am 29 and I am terrified, what if the mammogram finds something?  I have been so terrified since my mom's diagnosis that I have made my breasts sore and tender looking for anything suspicious. I am trying to stay strong and be here for my mother,  I am hoping that I can find a bit of support here it looks like a great forum. Jen  Log in to post a reply",
