I ditched the scarves and wig by Halloween, so about two months post-chemo. It was fuzzy and short, but it was hair! Now my hair is finally back to The Way It Was. I had such curly, curly, thick hair after chemo, and my stylist just commented last week that it's changed significantly since I first began seeing her a year ago. I think the hair follicles just get so tweaked with chemo that they produce courser, heavily textured strands for a good long while before returning to normal. I embraced and loved my curls, but I'm glad to be back to the Old Me. Sadly, however, whether from chemo or perhaps the lack of hormones now (I'm 36, on tamoxifen and post-menopause), I have no eyebrows. They never returned. I'm a very fair redhead with blonde brows and lashes, but really, now there's no hair to speak of up there. My lashes grew back just fine.  I finally bit the bullet and had my brows tattooed on and I'm thrilled with the results. No one can tell it's not me and I'm not rubbing off half a brow during my day. Such a time-saver. Worrying about hair is the first sign of life returning to (the new) normal. All the best. ",
