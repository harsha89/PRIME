I had my last TC yesterday. Hurray! I started shedding about 18 days after first cycle - some days worse than others and if I didn\u2019t wash hair carefully it matted and shedding was worse! However it suddenly stopped shedding about a week before third cycle. Waiting to see what happens next and I will continue to treat hair very gently for next 5 - 6 weeks. I shall continue to not washing hair more than every 5 days , like warm water ,and no products or hair drying! Luckily I\u2019m not at work - on sick leave and gearing up for Rads so wear turban on bad hair days. Hope your shedding stops soon. Best wishes",
