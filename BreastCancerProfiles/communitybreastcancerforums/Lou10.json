This time it's stage III, I think IIIa. She had a UMX and discovered that the supposed 1.5 cm tumour of IDC in her breast was in fact two huge masses -- IDC and DCIS -- that basically took up her entire breast. She's now planning to have the other breast removed, since these large tumours were not discovered despite regular surveillance with mammo, U/S, AND MRI. She's struggling with whether she should have the other breast removed now, before starting chemo, rather than waiting until her active treatments are completed. She's very concerned that her remaining breast also has cancer. Since the cancer has spread to her lymph nodes, she'll be having a couple of scans for distant mets prior to starting chemo. If you were in her shoes, would you wait for the scan results before deciding whether, or when, to have another UMX? In other words, if she is found to have MBC, would it still make sense to have a prophylactic MX? Or what if cancer were known to be in her remaining breast? Do you stil treat the breast separately when you have MBC?  Many thanks for your help!",

Because the two lumps were in the same area, the surgeon said she felt she could get them both via lumpectomy and didn't recommend changing the surgery to an MX. I had faith in her and probably would have gone with whatever she suggested. Fortunately, she got clear margins. If I had known more about my risk I might have considered MX, but I didn't.

He sees his out-of-town patients in the morning and they go for their treatment in the afternoon (add to that the travel time). When I asked about driving, he said even if I was feeling up to it, I could have an allergic reaction to the chemo and need a high dose of benadryl, preventing me from driving. I wondered about staying overnight in the city, but that would mean boarding my dog and cat, which I really don't want to do.

An intramammary lymph node may appear or enlarge in response to (benign) inflammatory conditions of the skin; they also may be associated with cancer. The characteristics of the node usually gives some indication of whether it is suspicious for malignancy. Perhaps in your last mammogram it didn't look suspcious, but they want to follow it to make sure it doesn't become suspicious. When you have your follow-up mammogram, you may want to ask if other imaging is recommended because of your dense breast tissue (even if the node is no longer an issue). Hope all turns out fine.",

My gut told me to go with the surgeon with more expertise, even though I knew little about either of them. Turned out to be a good choice as I later found out my surgeon is considered one of the best (even pioneered new techniques). In my case I think there was only 7-10 days difference in timing between the two choices. I received my diagnosis on December 15 and my surgery was on January 25. My cancer had spread to my lymph nodes, but I doubt it happened quickly as I had extranodal extension on both nodes biopsied and my oncologist felt I had extensive lymph node involvement.",

And because I have very dense breasts (>75%), my primary tumour did not show up on either mammogram or ultrasound until after I discovered a hardened area and a \"dent\" in my breast. Even when I was diagnosed with cancer after a core biopsy, the mammogram and ultrasound images of the tumour weren't very clear, so the surgeon ordered an MRI. The MRI clearly showed the malignancy plus a SECOND malignancy that had been completely missed. (And now, after almost a year of cancer treatment and a fairly high risk of recurrence, it seems I may have a fight on my hands to get an MRI as part of my follow up. Go figure.) No one ever told me that the degree of density of my breasts was among the strongest risk factors for breast cancer, in addition to making it much harder to detect. I stumbled upon the risk information on a section of the Cancer Agency's website for health professional. Wasn't even told this before surgery ... had I been, I think I would at least have considered other surgical options. So ... if breast density is an issue for you, you may want to talk to your doc about whether an MRI would be warranted, regardless of the results of the biopsy. I sure hope your lump is benign and your fears are put to rest.",

Also I made sure not to look at the tube when I entered the room or when they were repositioning me ... kept my eyes closed whenever possible. The tube is open at both ends and you have a \"call\" button in your hand. The noise can be deafening, particularly with the older machines, but I actually found it helped distract me.  If your MRI has been scheduled, or you at least know where it will be, you could call the MRI department and ask questions about the procedure. Maybe ask first if there's someone who can talk to you about it, in case the person who answers the phone is busy. Great that you're having the MRI.
