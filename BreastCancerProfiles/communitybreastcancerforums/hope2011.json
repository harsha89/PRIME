My new doctor is sending in the blood sample.  My first doctor's office sat on the request for permission to do BART testing for about 2 weeks.  That is one reason it took so long for results.  I'm going genetic counseling tomorrow so maybe I can start understanding some of this.  It should be another 2 weeks for results.  They did the BART testing and no charge and now the blood test at no charge.  They must be really intrigued.  I know I am!!! ",
