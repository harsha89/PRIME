They were really noticable and looked a bit like insect bites.  I thought not much of them and thought they would go away.  A few days later they were still there and still looking the same.  I showed my sister who I am staying with and she said they looked a bit like a rash, like a lovebite (they definitley aren´t that!!).  I had breast implants 6 months ago so called my surgeon and he said to see my doctor and get referred to a breast specialist straight away (however this was relayed to me by his secretary so again i didn´t take much notice!).  After about a week and half they still were there so I started looking on the internet and that´s where i read about and saw pic´s of IBC.  I got really concerned then as the pictures looked just like what i had.  My sister took me to a private doctors here (i am staying in Lanzarote with her until september) and he diagnosed dermatitis. My sister mentioned IBC but he looked at us like we were mad! He was checking my breast for lumps ... and there are none.  That was a week ago and the marks are still there BUT they have faded, not gone, just faded, they are still definitley there.  Can anyone tell me what they think, should i get a second opinion?  The problem is that I am in lanzarote and i´m not sure if i could see a breast specialist here.  Should i fly home and see someone? Not sure if this is relevant but from what i have researched it might be... my periods started when i was very young (9) and my mother had cancer (cervical) when she was 28.  Thanks for taking the time to read this, Louise x Log in to post a reply",
