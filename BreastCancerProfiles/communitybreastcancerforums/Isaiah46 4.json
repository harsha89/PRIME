      "Content": "Isaiah46-4 wrote: Yesterday I saw a second opinion Surgical Oncologist at Emory and today I went to see my breast surgeon who diagnosed me. They both have different treatment ideas and both specialize in breast cancer. The SO wants chemo before mx, while the BC said it did not matter. The surgical oncologist wants an aggresive plan because I'm only 45 and the tumor measures 4.5x4cm (chemo, b/mx, chem/ radition). She's also sent me to genetic counseling, while the other person did not even mention it. Is it better to go with a surgical oncologist (that specializes in the breast) or a breast surgeon. Its IDC ER+ PR+ HER2- Ki86 not in yet Grade 2-3. PET shows cancer contained in the breast. Dx 5/3/2013, IDC, 4cm, Grade 3, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
