My surgeon said that many places would not have even picked it up.  My IDC tumor turned out to be only 2mm.  Another fortunate step in my early dectection was that my biopsy radiologist suggested that I repeat the procedure.  My first biopsy results were benign--however, the doctor wanted to review the results over the weekend.  She called me Monday morning and told me she was not satifsfiied with the number of samplings and suggested that I come in for a second biopsy (at no charge).  The second biopsy was painful as I hadn't healed from the first one but worth it--it picked up the invasive cancer cells (along with some DCIS).  Then my surgeon ordered the MRI for better imaging prior to the surgery.  I'm fortunate to have good doctors who are thorough and I feel like a poster child for early detection.  As a first step, make sure that the doctors who are reading the mammograms have lots of experience and try to go to a place that has a digital machine if you have dense breast tissue. ",
