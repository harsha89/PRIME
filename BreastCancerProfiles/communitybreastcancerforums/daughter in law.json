She was afraid to go to the doctor and said she was just going to let nature take its course. Over the last month, a nurse saw her breast during a routine ekg and told her to get a mammogram. The mammogram showed a large mass (over 6 cm) that was highly suggestive of invasive ductal carcinoma. She was scheduled for a biopsy-she had a fine needle biopsy- and when she finally told the family, I accompanied her to the doctor to receive the biopsy results. The doctor said that the biopsy showed that her tumor was in fact cancerous and has recommended a mastectomy with an axillary node dissection in two weeks. When I asked what else the biopsy showed, he said nothing b/c the amount of tissue sampled was so small. There are no further tests scheduled before the surgery. Is this unusual? I am wondering if the reason he is proceeding quickly without further tests is possibly b/c the tumor has already begun to come through the skin. My mother-in-law has had some watery, bloody discharge from the surrounding skin (not the nipple) and also has some blisters. Any ideas out there on how bad this is? Log in to post a reply",
