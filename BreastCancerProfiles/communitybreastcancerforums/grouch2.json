      "Content": "grouch2 wrote: Hi All, I had a breast MRI and I am waiting for results. I am a 8 year survivor, stage IIa. I had the MRI done initially in March and they came back with a recommendation to do a MRI assissted biopsy, because the breast specialist thought she saw DCIS. However, the call came 5 days before my father passed away, and the doc agreed to repeat the MRI in three months, and see if there are changes. So, after two turn-downs from insurance and one call from my doc to the insurance co., I've just had my repeat MRI (7am this morning). I've survived all the months of waiting by telling myself that I'm in the percent that will be negative. However, I had to sign additional forms at my doc's today, because she is no longer in my insurance approved network as of Tuesday night. The forms gave only three options to fill out to remain inÂ network for treatment: Pregnancy, surgery and/or cancer treatment/chemotherapy. When I asked the receptionist what to put in these areas, she stated that they will fill them out. (I won't see the doc until my results are ready from the MRI). OK, this freaks me out a little bit! I'm definitely not pregnant, but I don't like the other choices and to me, it sounds like my doc already expects the MRI to come back positive this time. So, I guess I need to get ready for a biopsy again. If it is DCIS, the treatment should be less stressful than the chemo and radiation I did before, but I don't want a renewed membership in the cancer club! Not again! Help! I'm scared! Am I overreacting? Dx IDC, 2cm, Stage IIB, Grade 2, 3/8 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
