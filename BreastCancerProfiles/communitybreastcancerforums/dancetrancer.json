I did a search for IGAP, but I didn't find too many threads dealing with this.  Has anyone here been through this?  I met with PS today, this procedure is really the only flap procedure I am eligible for, due to not having enough stomach fat.  Although my PS was FABULOUS (spent an hour+ reviewing various options and was extremely compassionate), he does primarily DIEP's.  Only does like 6 IGAP's a year.  I was not pleased with the pics of the scar left in the buttock region of the one patient sample he showed me.  Plus, he said he may have to lipo the other side to balance out the two buttocks after the IGAP and reinject that fat to the IGAP side. BTW, he didn't say this was the best procedure for me, but basically said if I decide to go with a free flap, this is the only option (besides a lat flap with an implant - and I do not want an implant).  I am investigating microfat grafting as well.  Apparently there aren't many other options (beyond implants) for someone who is fairly thin. :-(    Cold caps work! coldcapphotos.shutterfly.com/p...

I ask because I am about to have some more tests and surgery...not sure if I should insist on all blood draws, BP, etc. being done on the legs/feet (I'm bilat MX, SNB one side).   If I am going to do this, I would like to go into my doc's office(s) armed with research studies or organizational opinions that say this is the standard of care.  I have read that many have had difficulty getting their healthcare provider to listen/respect the precautions for those at bilateral risk.  Cold caps work! coldcapphotos.shutterfly.com/p...
