I later found out that those x's help the radiologist know how to position you, which way to tilt you etc.They also made my bean bag mold that day. Once the CT was done RO and radiologist got together to see what would work better prone position or on my back and then I had my Sim a week later. The day of the sim they gave me tattoos and they told me how many treatments( Canadian protocol 16 treatments, higher dose and 6 boosts). They printed me out a schedule of all 22 appointments ( they had asked me at the CT what time worked best for me and tried to accommodate that) and I started RADs two days later. I was confused too because I heard everyone talking about their Sim so I thought the planning/mapping CT was the same thing, but it wasn't. I hope this helps clear up some of the confusion. Patty",

My RO said he was going to try the 16 treatments (higher dose), but didn't know if my skin could take it, so he might alter treatment midway to a lower dose and more sessions. I guess if any of you with fair skin, get too harsh a reaction, your RO will do something similar. Has anyone used cornstarch for itchy skin? I thought I read that somewhere.

I'm a teacher and wasn't sure what to tell the kids, as to why I would be out. My boss said she had a book written to help teachers tell their students they have cancer, and I was like, \" cancer, who has cancer?\" It was a little surreal. Going through rads, I felt empowered, as if I was killing off all those nasty cells, so I was not stressed or worried. Now that I just finished rads, I'm getting a little worried. If I feel a pain in my good breast, I think, what's going on there? I'm supposed to meet with oncologist tomorrow to start tamoxifen, but one tumor was hormone positive and the other was not, so I worry that it will come back. I'm sure all of the women here have the same worries. You are not alone! Try to do things to de-stress. Maybe yoga or meditation. I started back on my treadmill and that helps me deal with the stress, and I've been making juices every morning. I usually make one called \"mean green detox machine\". If the cancer comes back there's not much I can do about it, except deal with it, but by doing these little things, it helps me feel a little in control. Good luck to you.

I had a breast reduction with my lumpectomy, but since there is still so much swelling, it doesn't really look any smaller.  Smartinez, My RO isn't sure if I will be on my stomach or back. I'm having sim on Wednesday, and then they will decide then. I think he said it depends on a few factors such as breast size, location of the tumor and the best way they can angle the radiation. I will be starting my radiation in about a week or so, and was thinking about cooking up a bunch of dinners ahead of time to freeze. Im planning on working, and with the holidays coming and the fatigue, I thought this might be a good idea. Anyone have any good, make ahead recipes? Patty",
