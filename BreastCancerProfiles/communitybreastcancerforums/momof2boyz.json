    "Content": "momof2boyz wrote: Good evening and thanks to all who provide so much support to each other on this board. I'm looking for any thoughts/advice on this.  I am a 36 year old mom of two boys (ages 11 and 9).  (Obviously not breastfeeding, never have.) Last few days, I noticed some itching of my left nipple - nothing I couldn't handle, just finding an appropriate time and place to \"scratch!\"  Today, I woke up with soreness of the nipple that kept getting progressively worse.  It is now extremely red (right nipple is brownish) and I am having a clear, watery discharge without any stimulation/expression.  It's spontaneous.  It is leaving a very faint yellow stain on my white tank top, causing my nipple to stick to my shirt.  It is soooo sore and burning.  The rest of the breast looks pretty normal.  Just isolated to the one nipple.  I can't even touch it, even with a warm wash cloth, without brining tears to my eyes.  Late this evening, there was a few \"pink\" dots on my tank top from the continued \"oozing.\"  Not sure if could be blood or not. If it is something like Pagets (thinking unlikely as breast cancer does not run in my family), could symptoms really come one this quickly?  Thanks for any insight/advice you are able to share.  :) Log in to post a reply",
