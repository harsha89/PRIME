My mom has ER+, PR-, HER2+ BC which was 2.1 cm and multi focal but node negative. She recently completed the 12 weeks of paclitaxel/Herceptin and had to switch medical oncologists due to her MO relocating. New doctor now suggests that since she was texhnically stage 2, the paclitaxel may not have been sufficient and wants to add FEC. This has of course thrown a wrench in what we thought and trusted was the plan! Anyone else with similar stats get paclitaxel/Herceptin ONLY? Looking for any light anyone can help shed as we try to decide what to do next! Log in to post a reply",
