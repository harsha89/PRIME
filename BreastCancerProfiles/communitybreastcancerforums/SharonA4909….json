      "Content": "Dec 1, 2014 10:36PM - edited Dec 1, 2014 10:40PM by SharonA49090 Tomorrow, 12/2 is my \"cancerversary\".  It's the day I went to Cancer Treatment Centers of America, Midwest and found out that the PET scan they performed on Sunday, 12/1 /13 showed Stage IV infiltrating lobular carcinoma with mets to sternum, thoracic and cervical spine.  So I went from a Stage 2 Large B Cell Lymphoma survivor recently diagnosed with breast cancer to Stage IV in a matter of weeks.  I am very fortunate to be NED at present, my next PET scan and mammogram are at the end of this month.  I know there is no cure for Stage IV Breast Cancer but I'm hoping I will be able to live several years.  Right now my only treatment for the cancer is Anastrozole.  I take other meds for the side effects (pain mostly).  The pain has been getting worse in my left hip and the top of my left leg, I need to get back to exercising.  I know it will help the pain, but it's a catch 22.  There is one milestone I'll feel I'm able to achieve, my only child is getting married 11/7/15 and I'll be able to dance with him at his wedding (it may not be pretty, but I'm going to do it).  Now, with the help of God and my doctor I can hope to see my first grandchild.  I have read that Stage IV sisters with just bone mets have made it ten years or more after diagnosis.  I hope to be there someday.
