My doctor also wrote 2 pages for me while she was explaining everything. She was very thorough but it was very overwhelming. I was glad I don\u2019t need Chemotherapy upfront. I had chemo for my bone cancer in the 80s. If I do end up needing it I can deal with it.",

My breast surgeon was away this week and I am going to see her Tuesday. Check out the book Breasts an owners guide by Kristi Funk (a well known breast surgeon in CA). She does write about wait time I think ideally you should get treatment going within 3 months of diagnosis there is a slight change with recurrence rate after that time period. I hope we both get what need ASAP",

It stinks more then words can say that any of us have rob go through this. I am nervous about tomorrow, finding out the specifics of my cancer. I keep flipping back and forth with feeling really positive and then thinking horrible outcomes. I survived childhood cancer 30 years ago, very aggressive bone cancer. I had the cancer out within weeks of diagnosis and thankfully after a year of chemotherapy I survived. Can I manage that again?  ",
