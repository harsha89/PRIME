You will find tons of information here and also lots of support from others who have been there and understand all the emotions and fears running through your mind. Also my condolences on your mom passing. Because of positive lymph nodes and the fact that you are a grade two Chemo definitely looks like it's in your future. My tumor was less then 1cm and I was only a grade 1 and only had one positive out of 13 nodes. As for why they took that many it might be the same reason my surgeon took out more on me. I went in for the SNB. That node looked suspicious so he took more to save me from having yet another surgery if it was positive. Ah the fear of chemo. I don't believe there is a woman on the chemo threads that hasn't gone through that fear. I wasn't afraid of breast cancer my mom is a 23 year survivor. I was scared to death of the chemo. Don't compare how your mom reacted to chemo as the way you will react. First I don't know her age but she was older then you, second we ALL react differently.  As for the fear itself all I can say is the fear I had about chemo was much worse then the chemo itself. Most others will tell you the same thing. I was on Taxotere/Cytoxin. During my treatments I also received Atavin and Aloxi. The day after treatment I always got a neulesta shot. I never got nauseous. My bothersome SE's were hair loss (its back now) neuropathy and hand foot syndrome. I could pretty much do anything I normal would do except that I did need to take naps. It's nowhere as bad as we imagine. Hope this helps and good look to you.",

Unfortunately for me I do have IDC and am going in for a Sentinel Node Biopsy this Friday 5/2. You made reference to a mercola.com and a book you had read. I urge you when researching anything about breast cancer make sure it is a reputable source of information. There are many misleading things out there. I checked out that site and found a disclaimer at the bottom of the page saying the entire contents of the website is based upon the opinions of Dr. Mercola  unless otherwise noted. Karin",

She wanted me to call back because she had a question to ask me. Turns out she had recommended me to an American Cancer Society person as a good candidate for a model she was looking for for an ABC show airing this Sunday. Because of Hippa laws or whatever it is called she could not give her my name or number but could call me and ask me to call the representative, which I did. I will be on a local Philadelphia show this Sunday morning. Sun, Oct 12, 11:30am - 12:00pm ABC's channel 6 WPVI Take Action: Beating the Odds Against Breast Cancer Patients, breakthrough treatments and a panel to answer questions. From what I understand Robin Roberts will be part of the panel. As for me at this point all I know is I will be the model for the American Cancer Society's Look Good...Feel Better program. They will start with me bald (semi bald, it is starting to grow) and with no make up then show how make up and a wig can transform you into not looking like a cancer patient. Don't know if I will get a chance to speak but I am taking my pole dancing picture with me and if the opportunity arises they will know about all of my friends here that have helped me through this. Randie - hope your recovery is going well.",

Not like chemo days when I had all the time in the world to get on the computer. So much is going on but no time to explain now. But I must share how I got the courage to go wigless at school. We have a second grader in our school that has some form of lice that you can't get rid of. She's had it for at least 2 years that I know of. Don't know all the details but that her parents shaved her head bald to help control them. For a month or so she always wore a hat. Last Monday December 1st, she came bearing her 1/8 of an inch head of hair. She was very subconscious of it and when walking in the hall would pull her shirt over her head to hide it. Her teacher made her pull her shirt down and you could see the embarrassment she felt as she walked by my class. I pulled her to the side and took my wig off to show her my hair. I told her I wouldn't wear my wig anymore and that we would get through this together. Fridays we always have a morning meeting in the gym with the whole school present. I invited her to sit with me if she wanted and we could show the whole school our new fashion trend in hair together. She chose to sit with me and the whole time I don't think she once thought of her hair. I just had to share that with you. I had set Dec 1st as my goal to go topless but didn't have the courage that morning. It took a second grader to give me the courage.",

On Monday I had my dreaded colonoscopy. It was a piece of cake. The worst part was it took 10 stabs to get the IV started. I felt like a human pin cushion. Chemo left me with dried rolling veins in the left arm. I didn't drink enough water the day before (only drank the prep) so I was a bit dehydrated. Good news is I'm fine down there and don't have to see that Dr. until the next colonoscopy. XOXOXO",

They stopped production at the sand plant my husband works at back in October. They let most go then but kept some on. Today he came home and said he is now cut back to 8 hours a day. That is cutting back on half of our income. Most of it came from his overtime. He has a few months left there but unless a position opens up in another plant he will then get laid off. At 57 years old it is hard to find a job when all you've ever done is be a truck driver and a scale master. 57 in itself makes it hard to find a job and in this economy, well don't even want to think about it. As for the cut back we ourselves now have a lot of cutting back to do. I have already been doing that knowing this might happen. Now its do I get rid of the cable, cell phones, internet access etc. Some things got to go because now we can't afford them. What scares me the most is now I must seek out a full time job. I love my job and don't want to leave but there are NO full time positions available. I have been trying to get one since I got back into the school system. I've always said God will open the door when I need one. Please God I need one now.",

I kept going back to thread to catch up with what each of you have said there or said over at FB. Then I copied and pasted on the thread. You see I cheated. Edited to say: You see I had a lot of spare time this morning. Grandson didn't spend his usual Friday night sleeping over at Mom-Mom's. He had a sleepover at a friends instead (I lost out to a friend ). Anyway when I woke up this morning he was not here and DH was still sleeping.

Looking into her eyes and listening to her she seems worse off then I was at that point. Knowing all the feelings and emotions I felt her pain. I gave her my number and she is supposed to call me over the weekend. She had also mentioned that a nurse from the Breast Cancer Bridge was going to call her. She sounded like she was waiting for a call from them. Knowing the nurse that would call her and knowing the hours she worked I realized my co-worker would not be there to receive the call. So I called the nurse and gave her the info asking if she would call on her own time over the weekend. She said she would.

I sat under the dryer for a few minutes then she finger styled a bit more and snipped a bit and shaved bottom hair line.",

      "Content": "Mar 14, 2009 03:25PM - edited Mar 14, 2009 03:33PM by MsKarin Thanks! So you can better understand why I love the new look, maybe I should take a picture of my untouched hair after a shower. It feels so good to have control over the curls. Speaking of my hair cut guess what I got in the mail today. My stylist sent me a Thank you card. She wanted to thank me for coming in and supporting her business. In case you missed it she is the one that gave me the wig and did my face makeover on the ABC BC special back in Oct. At that time she had given me her card. On it says \"Curly Hair & Hair-Loss Specialist\". Who else better to trust (when you don't know of anyone else)? The trauma of loosing hair was bad enough; I didn't want to traumatize myself by getting a bad hair cut on already short hair. Anyway (besides the trust) my going to her was also a way of thanking her for what she did back in Oct. by utilizing her service. This thank you thing might go on forever. I just sent her a thank you for the great cut and new look. Edited to say: Julie please forgive me. I forgot to mention you and your family are now added to my prayer list. I got sided tracked and forgot the main reason for wanting to reply back to you.",

Not to worry though, as you can see we snuck back in and we're hiding out in here until her shift is over. So how are you feeling today? How do you like the music in the background ? Jean brought her CD player and the CD she made for all of us. We turned it down low as to not wake you. Don't be alarmed by the shovel in the corner. ranD had quite an ordeal yesterday with her resp therapist. She had a scary day yesterday and is resting in the recliner by the window. If anyone tries messing with her today she's ready. I know it's a bit cold in here, that's why you have all the extra blankets on you. ranD needed some more air so we opened the window and pushed her recliner next to it. I'm so glad you have a big room. We were able to convine the nurses at the nurses station (before Nurse Ratched showed up) to bring in another recliner so Gracie could join us. As you can see we are all here. That is except Linda and otter. Well they are here but stepped out to go to the nurse's kitchen. Linda is making us some Scallion Pancakes and otter is brewing up some tea. You can go back to sleep if you'd like. We'll wake you when they get back with breakfast. Oh I almost forgot to mention you had a special visiter stop by. Lauren stopped by to check on you. Sweet Dreams.",

For example, they have developed a special platform for overweight women with large breasts. The platform allows women to receive radiation therapy while lying on their stomachs. (Conventional radiation therapy to the breast is given to a patient lying on her back.) The treated breast suspends through an opening in the table below the patient, allowing radiation oncologists to target treatment better and to avoid radiating the tissue surrounding the breast. http://www.mskcc.org/mskcc/html/2381.cfm Not that you are fat or large breasted but do you think this is what they will do to you?

Some one I had never met, only spoke to here on the thread and by phone. It only reinforces my spiritual beliefs on God, energy and the universe. Our bodies separate us and make us individual, but through the spirit we are all connected as one. ranD is no longer restrained to the body and is part of the energy with no restrictions. Be still and you might just know she stopped by to brighten your day. OK, I had put my good news on the back burner to focus all attention to ranD. Are you ready? I got the position. I am now a full time special education paraprofessional working in the Autism Spectrum Disorders grades 3-5 class. I already know 3 of the students and bonded to one already. He took an instant liking to me. Twice in May I had sat in on the ASD class to observe. Three of the students from that class will be moving into my class. Hope all are doing well, I have a lot of reading and catching up to do. Cyber hugs to ALL. Edited to say Rock, yet another new word you have taught me. Are we on the same wavelength today? Does this fall under Ubuntu? (\"Our bodies separate us and make us individual, but through the spirit we are all connected as one.\")",

I am still waiting to hear if there will be. My family told me that on the first shot I looked very nervous. I knew this before they told me. Because it was a live show we did a quick run through before hand. During the run through the camera was only on me for a little bit. During the live show the camera stayed on me longer while they introduced me. Rock called my smile a Million Dollar smile. My husband calls one of my smiles a dumb grin.  I know which one he is referring to because it is a dumb grin. So when the camera didn't move off of me I was thinking am I doing the dumb grin or am I OK? Thank God the only time I had to talk was when the host asked me \"So Karin how do you feel? I wanted to be creative and respond with \"Thanks to the American Cancer Society and Mary Ann I now Look Good and Feel better\". After all that was the reason for me being on the show, to promote the Look Good...Feel better program. Instead my nervousness took over and I gave a quick either Fine, thank you or Good, thank you reply. I don't even remember which one it was I said. To sum it all up I am a little embarrassed of myself on air. My family told me I also did my nervous twitch thing. I wear dentures and sometimes when I am nervous I suck my dentures back up tight. They told me I did that but I still looked fine and not to worry about it. Oh well I wasn't on to look glamorous anyway. I was on to give hope to those getting ready to go through hair loss and show you can look normal and not like a cancer victim. I did manage to accomplish that. The highlight of my day was meeting Dr. Weiss. I still can't believe I got to talk with her. You never know how much things you do can touch the lives of others. I let her know and see (through our pictures) how she is responsible for bringing us all together. I gave her a big teary eyed thank you from all of us. Dr. Weiss was wearing the Breast Cancer logo necklace available for purchase on this website. If you don't know about it you can find it by going to the Breast Cancer .org homepage. Go to the bottom and click on Visit our gift shop. I would proudly wear this necklace because it is a reminder of all of you and what got me through my ordeal. I wish they made it in silver so I could afford to purchase one.  ",

Don't know what I'm going to do. I don't want to get another wig but it is still too short to go topless at school. Last year when I had long hair the kids would laugh when I took off my glasses because they said I looked like a guy. Then again the kids could just call me Mr. Karin if they want.  Will post a new hair pic soon. I have been on Femera 3 ½ weeks and so far so good. Have noticed a few hot flashes or Flush-flash as Rock calls them. Usually during the evening or at night while sleeping. Can handle these with no problem. When going through menopause I suffered real badly with Funeral-pyre flashes (Rocks term). Back then the only thing that gave relief was soy protein powder mixed with milk. Drank it daily for over a year. As the song goes, I wish that I knew what I know now, when I was younger. If I suffer from those again I will have to deal with them or ask onco for something.",

To replace the cards I would like to have a 4x6 of each of you to put in a photo collage that I have. Please, please, please. If you're interested in helping me out send me a PM and I will give you my email to send me a current or chemo day's photo of you. You have become a part of my life and I would love to see you every day. I was thinking of using the May Group photo but would like individual photos of your choosing.

I was so looking forward to it and yes I am disappointed but all things happen for a reason so I'll just be happy that Noelle and Rock got the chance to meet. I was going to try once more and see if any time Saturday was opened if Noelle would still be in NYC. The weather forecast for Saturday took that out of the equation. Rock - I hope everything went well at the dentist today. Just like Jackie I too can not boldly walk into a dentist office. I would rather have a colonoscopy then go to the dentist. How did your radio interview go today? I am so excited for you and the adventure you are about to undertake. It sure as hell will beat the adventure you took last year. Just be careful and don't physically absorb too much of what you learn from the women. Listen, observe and be empathic but don't get too wrapped up in their stories where it causes you to feel for them and it brings you down. I just worry for you because you are a compassionate person and I want this to be a good experience for you not something to bring you down. Noelle - I may not have made it up there but hearing your voice on the phone made you pop out of the computer and made you all the more real to me. Kristy - I know you won't get to read this today but I'm thinking of you and pray all went well today. Mary - Pray your Dad's surgery goes well tomorrow. Christine - Glad you got excited reading the posts, LOL Linda - Congratulations on your 1 year anniversary. Jackie - Hope you enjoyed your massage. Sue - I'm singing loudly and emotionally with you, WAAAHHH! Heather, Otter, Kerry, and anyone else I might have missed thinking of you too. Still praying for ranD",

Eddie as for age I must say that it has nothing to do with this. At the time School House Rock made it debut on TV I was a college student. I didn't have a radio and would turn it on to listen to the songs as I cleaned my apartment. I loved that show and got hooked. I also have the Special 30th Anniversary DVD that includes every School House Rock song ever created. DARN! That's the End!",

Her mother has pancreatic cancer and has not been doing well. I think I might have mentioned it a few months ago. Anyway when she first called she was crying and very distraught. We talked for about forty five minutes. When we hung up she was feeling much better and we were laughing about Jeremy. She is the aide in his regular class. I didn't realize that my husband had been listening to the whole conversation. He came over and gave me a big hug and told me he was very proud of me. I said for what? He said for what you told Stephanie. I don't even remember all the things I had said. That is why I know it wasn't coming from me but through me. Each morning, part of my morning prayer is: Please tug on the part of you that dwells within me so that I am constantly seeking and finding the connection to you. When dealing with others; especially those under my care please let me have that connection so that the words I speak and the actions I make Lord come from you and not of myself. Don't know why I just told you all this but maybe someone needed to hear it. Thinking of you ALL and sending out love and (((hugs)))",

I have been busy with my daughter since her passing the BRC. She didn't feel comfortable on my motorcycle (yeah, I don't have to share) so we went cycle shopping. She bought a Honda Rebel and we have been riding together. I will post pictures on FB when I get a chance. After not riding all last summer because of the chemo it feels really great to be back on the bike. I am going to start riding it to work. I was afraid of helmet head but it actually makes my chemo curls look better. Who would have thought? Besides riding I have been prepping myself for a job interview by doing some research. Things look really GOOD for me filling a spot for a full time paraprofessional in the Autism program. At my request I took autism training 2 summers ago so Nora (women in charge) knows me well not to mention that my principal thinks very highly of me. The autism program is located in our school. They will be interviewing last of May or beginning of June. I feel really good about this. I have always believed that God would open the door for me with a full time job I love when I needed one. Since Curt's cut back I didn't look for the job with my Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Hyde, it came to me. I know I can do this and believe it is mine. Please add this to your prayers. Speaking of Mr. Hyde I met the dark side of him last week. He called me a fat a$$, threw a ball at me, told me to shut the F*ck up, snatched my glasses off my face and threw them across the room and finished by saying he had a knife in his pocket and was going to cut my neck off. I managed to talk him back to Dr. Jeckle so we are ok. What has me ticked off is after filling out the report the supervisor of the program for the district told me that, that was his last draw and he was now expelled from the program. She was going to let him finish out the week so his parents could make other arrangements. Guess who showed up today. Yep you got it. When I called the main supervisor she said since he had a good rest of the week he could stay. The only reprimand he has gotten for his actions are from me not allowing him to do the things he loves like going to the computer room or going to talk to his aunt that works in the kitchen. Good news is that I still have another month with him. Maybe there is still time for me to help him change.",

Just as stated above rest will slowly be absorbed back into the body after time. The good news is that I have a few months left before you can see my lopsidedness, lol. Right now I still look even.

I just kept playing with it in my hands so that it was always in contact with either palms, back of hand and finger nails. Also iced my feet. Hubby had shoulder surgery back in March. They gave him a Cryo/Cuff to keep his shoulder iced. I wrapped it around my feet and it worked well. This was treatment 3 for me. I too will see what happens but I do know I did it for treatment 2 and last treatment I had no HFS like I did first time and the neuropathy was very slight.

I KNOW it played a big part in lessening the effects for rest of my treatments. My onco nurse also gave me ice pops (ones in long plastic tube) to suck on during taxotere infusion. I believe this also helped because after first treatment (didn't do ice pops) had an overall sore mouth but after sucking on pops had no problem at all the rest. The ice pops is two-fold. You could suck on ice chips but then it only helps mouth. By holding the ice pops in your hands and playing with them I believe it helped with the first two SE's I mentioned. I took about 5 with me and kept in an insulated lunch bag along with frozen water bottles to help keep them iced and cold. Enjoy the day, Karin",

Are you taking Vitamin B6? Don't remember what oncology website I read it on but remember seeing most Dr's. Recommend 100-150 mg. I have been taking 100mg. After my 1st treatment I got it in my big toes only (thank GOD you can walk without applying pressure on the toes) and my finger tips. Got worse in hands, so bad that I couldn't open a bottle of water, hold a pen etc. I had originally described as being bright red, feeling like the beginning of a blister even though you couldn't see a blister; it must have been because skin did peel right before next treatment. I had read of a study done in France. http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/results/frozen-glove0805 and http://professional.cancerconsultants.com/oncology_supportive_care_news.aspx?id=34612 What I do: Applied Udderly Smooth Udder Cream a few times a day, really thick at bed time then covered with soaks. Once finding out about Udderly Smooth Hand and Foot Cream made for HFS, I started using that. Couldn't find locally not available yet so ordered directly from Redex. Already mentioned above, B6 100mg. During 2nd infusion I covered my feet in ice pack and played with ice pack with my hands. This time no HFS symptoms. Neuropathy instead. A few times at base line of the balls of my feet they burned. Felt like they were on fire. I then rubbed on cream, and elevated. Never lasted more then 15 minutes. No problems with hands this time. Hope you find some relief. Enjoy the day, Karin",

I thank you my friend for being here, You understand and are truly my peer. Together we're strong and will get through, So to each of you, I must say Thank You. This also applies to our many supporters like Otter etc that frequent our thread. I had to edit to appoligize to Otter. You ARE part of this group, you just started in April.

They didn't know how to deal with or respond to me. I would first fall into the pit of gloom. Worrying about things that never even cross my mind, turning every thought into a negative thought. Then I would be fine one minute and a B with an itch the next. Anyway because it happened all 3 times and on the same days I do believe it is chemo related and a SE that they don't tell you about.

On a page from the National Cancer Institute it states [About half of those taking docetaxel experience a side effect known as \"hand-foot syndrome,\" the symptoms of which can range from relatively mild tingling and numbness to painful peeling and blistering of the skin.] For those that don't know docetaxel is taxotere. That tells me 50% a lot more then 3% or 6%. The link is at http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/results/frozen-glove0805 I attribute my bout with HFS after treatment #1 to the fact I did a lot of walking the first few days in a pair of loose fitting clogs which caused friction on my big toes. Rock said she jumped rope which would cause pressure on each landing. Somewhere in the back of my mind I think Otter said her shoes were too tight which would also cause pressure and explain why she got it on the part of her foot that she did. Otter correct me if I'm wrong, but then I'll just blame it on chemo brain, lol.   Otter - Do last two sentences need correcting? Cristine - Wednesday 30th, my last T/C, yippee!

This coming Wednesday it will be 8 weeks since last Taxotere/Cytoxan infusion. I still have very mild neuropathy in my left foot. My right arm still gets that weird sensation like it did after surgery (5/2) but no swelling in it. Sometimes I don't even notice it. It does seem to be getting better but I think the rads have something to do with it still hanging around. Hair, oh give me a head of hair, long flaxin waxing. First hair to make a come back was of coarse my unwanted facial hair. I am now doing my daily morning plucking. Still have ALL my eyelashes. Waiting for fall-out. Maybe I WILL be one of the lucky ones. As for my eyebrows, they did thin out, a few bare spots but they are now filling in with new growth. I had read some where here on the boards that the eyelashes or eyebrows can fall out a few times before hanging around so I am waiting to see what happens with me. When I first shaved my head I shaved it down to 1/8 of an inch. It was all very light. I kept a lot of that fuzz through out this whole ordeal. It is now about a ¼ of an inch and very dark around the sides and back. The top is sparser and has more white or grey. Does anyone know, is the top the last to grow? Rads - 21 down and 13 to go including the boosts. I am now red under arm at SNB area, incision site and nipple area. It is also starting to feel slightly sore. Not really sore but I know its there. I love my rad techs. They make it feel less like being on an assembly line as rock had put it. We joke around a lot and I've made Dan blush a few times. When they leave the room I get to stare at the ceiling and the fish that decorate the tiles. I can say I actually look forward to my treatments and joking around with them every day. Edited to say I forgot to mention that every day around 3:00 I get dog a$$ tired. I try to take a nap but cannot fall asleep. I know I will have fun with them this week. I think it is on Tuesday that our school is having pajama day. You wear your PJ's to work. I go straight from work to my treatments. I'm NOT going to change. I can imagine the conversations we'll be having that day when I show up in my PJ's and robe. Hubby just woke up, time to do the breakfast thing.",

Oh, and congratulations on real hair. ALL - As for Labor Day, 28 years ago I was in Labor on this day and gave birth to my twins. Before I could call my one daughter to wish her a Happy Birthday she called me and wished me a Happy Birthing Day. The other stopped over. I have mixed emotions on this last day of what we consider the summer. Part of me is sad to see it go and the other is so darn excited. Tomorrow I go back to school, faculty only. Then Wednesday the kids come back. Yeah, I can't wait. If things haven't changed since I talked to the principal a few weeks ago, I will be working in a second grade class this year. This means I will have a few of my kids from last year. Looking forward to the BIG GERMIE HUGS & KISSES I told them to give me when they saw me in September. Enjoy the day, Karin",

It has taken me a while because you all seemed to have gone the professional route and at first that made me feel separate from you. I grew up in a very upper class town. At that time it was the 13th wealthiest in the state (not that my family ranked up there). Seeing how hypocritical every one was it turned me into a rebellious teen of the 60's- early 70's. My dad died when I was 16. Because of this my mom worried that if something happened to her who would take care of her children. I had 2 sisters one 3 years younger the other 8 years younger. Her solution was to cut the apron strings with me, throw me out @ 18 and make me grow up. I floated around for awhile from friend to friend then entered college on an EOF grant. I attended for 3 years. The 4th year I didn't qualify for because I made over 2 thousand; had to just to survive. Financial aide told me to sign up and use social security from my dad. My mom (and you thought your moms were something) told me that he was her husband before he was my dad and that if I signed up for it, it would cut down on what she received for my two sisters. If I did it she would cut me off from the family and disown me. I had already been there done that didn't want to go that route again, so I didn't use what I was entitled to. Thus I never got four year degree. During my time at college I had done an internship working at project Head-start working with 4 year olds. I loved it. So when I couldn't finish college I got a job at a preschool working with 4 year olds. During this time I got married, got pregnant then gave birth to twin girls. My husband was an over the road truck driver, so I was home with my daughters. When they started school I worked as a substitute teacher. Things got tight and I needed a full time job. Didn't want anyone else raising my girls so I found a job as a courier driver working while they were in school and home before them. It was great because during the summer they rode with me. This job felt comfortable. I loved it. It was a private courier. My main customer was GE. Pick up and drop offs were not time sensitive. Perk of the job was I could stop and shop along the way as long as I docked my time. I did this for 15 years before realizing I wanted something more. So I quit and went back into the school system. All my adult life people have joked about me being a kid magnet. I am currently a first grade paraprofessional. I LOVE my job. I sometimes wish I had gotten my degree so I could teach but recently I discovered that is not what I was meant to do. These days (no child left behind) teachers have too much red tape crap they must do. It robes them from what they want to do. Parents are too busy making a living they miss time with their kids. Don't know if you're familiar with the term but we are abbot district. I as just an aide am able to give the kids the love, attention and encouragement they might be lacking from home. I KNOW I have made a difference in many of my students. That's it, that's me. I can't wait till September gets here. Where the kids weren't allowed to give me hugs during end of year because of chemo, I had told them when we come back to school in September, when they saw me in the hall to give me the BIGGEST, GERMIEST hug they could. Enjoy the day, Karin☺",

Thanks for the suggestions but I think I'll keep the Enjoy as it is a reminder to look for the good and enjoy something throughout the day. Nobody said it would be easy. Eddie - Loved the pictures. I want to redo mine with props. Who knew when I did it that it would become a tradition? When I saw the onco Friday a week ago I told him about my mood. He was going to give me Zanax or Zoloft. I told him school would be starting and that I didn't think I'd need anything. Don't want to put yet more drugs in my system. Plus I really don't look at this as depression. I have been there before. Couldn't get out of bed in the morning, no ambition and only wanted to sleep. This time it is more an anxiety thing. Worrying about everything (not the BC though). Personal life has many new twists in it. Don't want to talk about it because don't want my mouth to bring things into existence (if you understand that.) When I first started Chemo Onco had given me low dose Ativan. I never had to use it except for the second attempt at my rads simulation. Well since it is used for anxiety I decided to take one today. Will stay on it round the clock this weekend and see if it helps. Now for the bad news. Remember I had quit smoking 5 months ago. I didn't want to be smoking during rads and now is when I picked it back up. That might be part of my anxiety right now. Beating myself up about it and really wanting to stop. I've had 11 treatments and 11 days of smoking. For those that pray please pray that I can let go and let God. I know it was Him that took them from me before. Cold turkey with no withdrawal symptoms, that wasn't me. Thanks for the hug and (((((((((((((((((((((ALL))))))))))))))))))))) Enjoy the day, Karin",

It will return thicker.",

Sorry to worry you all and thanks for the concern. As you know I had been battling anxiety and depression. Going back to school didn't help. I came on one day and saw Jean's mother had passed and Eddie going through troubles with hubby. I am a compassionate person and feel for others so their rough times added to mine. I needed to take a break. My onco put me on Lexapro and I do believe it is starting to work. I feel a lot better. When he had suggested it at the end of August I had refused because I didn't want to put anymore chemicals in my body. Will catch up with you later, grandson is on his way over.

I had discovered my lump a few weeks before the Holidays but because of the holidays and fear I put off doing anything about it. I remember having a picture taken of me and my grandson Christmas day and thinking to myself I wanted a picture of us together incase I didn't make it to next Christmas I could be with him in the photo. Well thanks be to God and all your help to get me through, here I am. I love my family and know they love me but they just didn't understand what I was going through. It was YOU that got me to where I am today. For this I THANK YOU. You helped to give me a positive attitude and kept me from falling into a deep depression. You gave me a reason to laugh when I wanted to cry. I don't ever want to loose touch with any of you. You have become to mean much more to me then some of my closest friends. We have built a close bond that no one else could possibly ever understand because a lot of cyber friends hide behind the internet. In our case we bared our heart and soul to each other. I trust each and every one of you more then friends I have known through the years. Not to get religious on you but I must share this scripture with you. Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their work: If one falls down, his friend can help him up. But pity the man who falls and has no one to help him up. (Ecclesiastes 4:9-10) Thank you all for picking me up. Sorry this got so long but I had to let you know. HAPPY NEW YEAR!",

It means our lives are getting back to normal. During chemo we had way too much time to be home and getting online gave us something to do that didn't require that much energy. More importantly we needed each other during those times so we took the time and put other things on hold. Wants and Needs. You all use to fall under the needs category. I needed you to get through.

I'm just taking it one day at a time. Gracie - Thank God for MILs. My MIL got us through the rough winter months when we were just starting out as a family. One winter he got laid off and she helped us out. During the spring when we were back on our feet we tried to pay her back but she wouldn't take it. We got her though. For Mother's day we bought her a really nice recliner that she had been wanting. She didn't refuse that, lol. Kristy - How did your post-op appointment go? Did they take out the staples? Adrienne - Hopefully you will just experience thinning and not total loss. Rock - I don't think I can sell the belt. DH will need to tighten it to hold his pants up because he will lose weight. Buying junk food and snacks have already gotten cut back, LOL Angel/Noelle - Thanks but internet would be last to go and if so I do have friends with connections. Would just have to visit more so I could use their computer. Now for my biggest challenge, waking up during the work week with another person to fit into our morning routine. In 29 years of marriage I have always woke up without him (except on weekends). He has always left during the wee hours of the morning. This is going to take some getting use to. We ran into a bathroom problem this morning. Uuhhhmmm? Am I supposed to wake up a bit earlier and be the dutiful wife and make DH breakfast before he leaves?",

Cancer patients often find that after chemotherapy, their once-straight hair grows in curly. Chemo affects rapidly growing cells more than slowly growing ones, and hair follicles in the scalp grow rapidly. They are jolted by the chemo, and when they go back to work, they may have a new job description, says Dr. Jennifer Griggs. Over time, the hair follicle tends to return to its normal shape. With little scientific evidence available about how hormones and genetics cause these texture changes, Jonathan Torch, creator of Curly Hair Solutions and founder of Toronto's Curly Hair Institute, has come up with his own theory. He believes changes in the muscles at the base of every follicle are the key to the changes in hair texture that take place over time. These muscular changes, he says, often come during puberty, chemotherapy or menopause, when hormones and medications may affect the muscle tone. Sometimes these changes can be extreme, says Torch, who has witnessed many a client go from curly to straight and straight to curly.\"I can't prove anything medically,\" he says. \"But I have a philosophy that genetically, the muscles are changing. And this changes the shape of the follicle.\"",

It can affect the central nervous system, anxiety was listed under that. Hope you and Bob get a good nights rest tonight so you can deal with the packed house tomorrow. Enjoy the visit with your younger brother. Well really with all but especially him. Sending you some mental oxygen to help you breath better tomorrow. Edited to say: What I meant to say is everything you've been going through now is reason enough for anxiety but the vicodin might be contributing to the level of which you are suffering.",

It's mostly in the back and that's a good thing because I can't see it.   You are forever increasing my vocabulary, thank you. Yet another word I had to look up. Prolly, a short form of the word probably, was created in an attempt to save time and effort in either typing the word probably or even speaking the word. Prolly has caught on easily especially within the internet.    As for my gorgeous smile, you should see it without the dentures, OFLMAO. And just think, on the day we all get together you will. Only my family has seen it. Only feel comfortable enough with family to remove the darn things and you are all family.  How could we forget about you? I look for you every time I come on. Hurry up April 1st.   Then you know that means you look fabuloso!!! Wait what word tops fabuloso? What ever it is that's how you look because you don't have the wrinkles accompanying your look.  Did you decide which Deva products to start out with? Remember Noelle recommended to me No-Poo, One Condition, Angell and Set It Free. I just love their marketing for the No-Poo. For those that don't know they break down not using shampoo like this. We all know what sham means, right? And you know what poo is.  Love the quote \"Be here now.  Be someplace else later.  Is that so complicated?\"  Helps one to remember to live in the moment.  Try to behave and don't go too heavy on the sighing when they come, LOL. And while playing along with their doomsday thoughts you might want to wear a Depends incase your laughing in your mind causes a leakage.  Hope you get to meet up with Roberta. Oh and thanks for the new look. It was your discussion and guidance that gave me the courage to move forward with the trim.  Didn't you know that words aren't always necessary? Just being there can say more then words. This thread has amazing powers; you can actually feel the cyber hugs that go out here. GRACIE - you have to put an avatar up. Hope your pain from Karli's ordeal has lightened up. I pray for her everyday (you too).  I know you prolly (thanks rock) won't see this but hope you are enjoying your vacation. Have FUN, FUN, FUN!  Thanks for telling me about your cat and Deva. I'll make sure I don't sit on sofa when mine is sitting there. My cat likes to chew on the hair. Don't want to give him a reason to chew on what little I have.  The Deva cut is just a cutting technique where they cut the hair dry working curl by curl. And yes it worked on my chemo curls. I posted the picture for you.  And  Bet you are both still on a high from your meeting. Thanks again for sharing the pics and bringing us there with you.  Hope your enjoying where ever it is you went (I forgot). See you soon.  Did you ever figure out where your FB pictures went or was it just a temporary problem with your connection to FB? I know both Otter and I still saw them.",

I choose to look at me and my SE's (or lack of) as being blessed and I have a high tolerance and am not a winer. I do feel like my mom when first waking up or getting up after sitting for awhile. My joints are stiff and take awhile to get back to normal but I wouldn't classify it as pain. Hot flashes are not a problem but I think the Lexapro 5mg is the reason for that. On days I forget to take it I do seem to have them. I also have nights that I can't fall asleep (is that a Femara SE?) I take an Ambien. I have been taking it since Oct. 17th.

Sure enough I remember I forgot when the hot flashes or night sweats remind me. Kerry my onco prefers the Lexapro over Effexor, it's less addictive. I remember going in for my pre-op appointment at the hospital one year ago this week. When the nurse asked me what meds I was taking I said none. She seemed surprised that at 54 I wasn't taking any meds or over the counter stuff. Different story this year. I take 5 pills a day. 1 Femara, 1/2 Lexapro, 2 Os-Cal 500 + D, and 1 B100 B-Complex. Maybe I should change that to 7-9 a day. Now that allergy season has started for me I've also been taking 2-4 Advil a day for sinus headaches. Drug Free no more.",

If she passes we will have to fight over who rides my bike. I planned on riding a lot this year since I stayed off the bike last summer because of chemo.

What ever it is we decide I am in and will take care of Rock's part from here if need be. I have already made a donation in her honor. I believe all things happen for a reason. Yesterday while thinking of Randie I received a phone call from the Cancer Fund of America, from their division \"Cancer Support Services, Inc. (CSS)\".CSS differs greatly from other cancer groups in that its number one priority is funding patient aid rather than research. CSS raises much needed funds to provide urgent items for the patient. It made me think of Randie when she needed oxygen and couldn't get it. I have already made a donation in her honor. If anyone else is interested here is the link. http://www.cancersupportservices.net/ We could also make a donation to BreastCancer.org in memory of her. After all if it weren't for them we would not be here. They are what brought us all together. I can't even imagine getting through my ordeal without all of you.",

White roses represent innocence and purity and are traditionally associated with marriages and new beginnings. The white rose is also a symbol of honor and reverence, and white rose arrangements are often used as an expression of remembrance.",

I had sent her the photo of me that used to be my avatar so she had an idea of my face shape and coloring. At her shop she specializes in Curly Hair (has something in common with our own Noelle) and Hair -Loss. She told me to bring my wig but she had one that she thought we could have fun with. At the make over she didn't seem to care for my wig and wanted to try hers. I warned her if she put it on my head and I liked it she might have a hard time getting it back. She said she kind of suspected that and it was alright I could have it if I liked it. Well I did and I brought it home with me. The American Cancer Society also brought one of their Look Good...Feel Better make up bags for me. Since we used Mary Anne's make up and didn't use it I gave it back so someone that needs it can have it. I already have one from when I attended one of their class. I didn't want to be greedy. As I mentioned early the greatest thing I brought home with me was the experience and memory of meeting with Dr. Weiss and letting her know the bond she had enabled to be created among our group here.

For the first month and a half my index fingers did feel a bit arthritic but that has since disappeared. As for the hot flashes and night sweats I don't have any but as I mentioned in another post somewhere, I take .5mg of Lexapro a day so that may be a huge contributing factor. So if you would suffer from bad hot flashes ask your onco to prescribe you a low dose of Lexapro or other SSRIs (Effexor, Paxil, etc.) So all in all I can say that other then a slower start to the day (getting those joints moving) I physically feel pre B.C. yeah!",

No need to do a fly through this morning. I already said good morning to you all thanks to my wall. I really love having you with me. Those that haven't sent me a pic, I miss not seeing you up there. You ladies just don't know you are a very important part of my life. I think for you I have pulled a lot of the bricks down from the wall I built around myself to protect me. I don't have a lot of close friends by my choosing. I have tons of acquaintances I keep in touch with but none that I bear my soul to. I have been hurt too many times by too many people that I have a hard time trusting anyone. I think the fact that both of my parents are included in that list makes it harder. If you can't trust your parents, your protectors who can you trust. I believe the little girl in me wants to protect the other kids and that is why I LOVE working with the children at school. My father died when I was sixteen and I never shed a tear. My mom is still here and we get along and have a good relationship now because I forgave her because she knew not what she did. I don't know why I'm telling you all this. Maybe it's just to let you know that I do love you gals. I have so much inside that I don't share. Coming here and letting some stuff out when I needed to made it easier for me to reach this cancerversary.",

She told him I was the friend she had been telling him about. He acted shy and bowed his head trying to hide. I told him there was no need to bow because I wasn't a princess or a queen. He thought that was funny and starting giggling. He then put out his hand to shake mine and said Hello, I'm Jeremy. Don't know why I said what I did but I think we hit it off on the right foot.

DH and I just had an argument because we were both upset about the news my daughter (grandsons mom) dropped on us. Too make a long story short without going into detail she too is struggling and might loose her apartment. She received her electric shut off notice. Her whole apartment is electric; heat, water, stove, washer and dryer. She had lost her job in the beginning of January and her only income is child support. She is also the one going to college on grants to be a nurse. We are no longer in a position to help her out as we ourselves are struggling. The argument started because in our conversation I made the mistake of telling him he had taught them how to put wants ahead of needs instead of my reverse philosophy. My twins are going to be 29 this year. He is an enabler to their bad choices including co-signing for a car for the other daughter that she couldn't really afford but wanted. I must admit to avoid arguments with him I too have fallen guilty to enable enabling a few times. How as a parent do you distinguish the fine line between helping when you should or feeling the pain as you watch them fall? I have told her steps she should have taken to avoid this but it fell on deaf ears. Because my grandson that has no say is involved it looks like I might have to get rid of some things in my computer room to turn it into a bedroom again. DH just walked back into the house from the garage. No words needed to be exchanged we hugged. At least things are OK on that end. When I feel up to it I might have to go back and re-read, there were some comments I wanted to make. Thanks for letting me let go.",

Part of me is excited as I have missed my kids over the break. The other part is upset because I got spoiled this week getting to have my first cup of coffee outside watching nature as I started my day. Looks like I'm going to be joining others in the fact that I will now be looking forward to the weekends. I'm still waiting for the arrival of my hummers. They are usually here by now. The last batch of humming bird nectar went to waste but at least I was prepared.   .",

My sister use to be an onco nurse and this is what she told her patients to use. Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use. I would say about 1 teaspoon of each. Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouth wash. Then spit out. Enjoy the day, Karin",
