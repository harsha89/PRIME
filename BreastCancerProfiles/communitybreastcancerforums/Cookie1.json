The oncologists at Moffitt say my tumor was so slow growing and non-aggressive they barely wanted me to go on Arimidex  They also determined the Oncogene DX test came back with a false high score (24) because the tissue sent for testing was mixed with stromal tissue and the results were compromised.   It seems that the Oncogene test can read tissue incorrectly, in other words it can't separate the stroma from the cancer.  After receiving the DX score, they sent cells for a Mammostrat test which confirmed their original thoughts that the Onco test was degraded.  If anyone has other thoughts on this, please let me know.  Thanks for listening.

For some reason, I had believed the Onco test was gospel, but not so according to my doctors.  I wonder if anyone else has had their physicians question these other tests....to be continued... Thanks again Cookie",
