God willing, it is doing the same to my liver, lungs, and bones. My treatment is Gemzar and Carboplatin. My onc sst me up for a 2nd opinion at johns hopkins. Hopkins called last week and I was out, so I will return the call Monday. I suggest doing it that way. It seems to be going fast.

At first they used Taxol on me, but it didn't work and even though my TMs went down (by 2 points) my oncologist didn't feel right about it and sent me for a PET. Sure enough it had progressed a little in the bones, a little in the lungs, and made itself at home in my liver. So we switched to this combo immediately. I have a lot more queasiness with this, which is somewhat helped by dexamethawhatever, zofran (not terribly helpful but I take it the first 3 days after chemo), and a 3 day patch I wear behind my ear. It's not pleasant, but it is manageable. Best of all, it really wiped out those humongous inflamed lymph nodes. I mean, seriously, they are flat. I hope the treatment is doing to the inside (especially liver) what I can see happening on the outside, and I hope it helps you, throwing knock out punches to the cancer.

So I didn't take it the next day, which was yesterday; and yesterday evening, I was still full of energy. I can say for a fact though that I did not have any breakthrough pain the day I took the whole pill. Today has been a painful day from the beginning, despite taking half a dose. I think it is worth discussing with your onc. If you can put off taking medications that make you slow and groggy, I'm in.",

They prescribed lots of stuff for nausea, and I gave myself a couple of good pep talks; and week 2 was much better. Week 3 was my week off and I felt great and food tasted normal. I started cycle 2 Monday. The week has been ok, but I've just spent 2 entire days in bed. I don't know if it is the treatment or if I am depressed. I've enjoyed the rest and I think the treatment is quite tolerable, especially considering I can see it working.",

Apparently they can do that. It was the lymph nodes that told me I was Stage IV. From there, we learned it was in my bones. So, yes, it can mean there is progression somewhere else. When will your mom be scanned for other mets? Love and light go out to you and your mom. I have a question. The chemo I am on now did a whammy on those lymph nodes, and we hope it did the same internally. However, the past week or so, I have noticed pain below my right ribs. It hurt when the doctor pushed on it (surprised me!) and just a little while ago when I was bent down throwing my laundry down the chute. So I think there might be larger mets there now or something made it swell. Has anyone here felt like that? I understand the pain can get quite bad, but I'm more worried about throwing up which I have heard is a part of having liver mets. I do get a scan on Thursday and meet with my onc on Friday, so I will find out soon what is going on in there. It definitely scares me. Also what are foods to avoid with liver mets? I know I have asked the question before. I don't know where I put the note about that.",

I would love to see that on my own reports, but I will settle for seeing it has happened for you and other ladies here. It can be done. That's a great realization. Also, I have had to start neulasta. It really did knock down my neutrophils. I'm taking some supplements, hoping to keep the number high enough that I can get treatment. I was 1.2. It should have been 1.5. The doctor wanted to do the treatment anyway (thank God) and then had me come in the next day for the neulasta. Whatever it takes!",

I don't know how I missed it, but I discovered a large lump in my right breast a few days ago when I sort of hugged myself because of feeling cold. All I could think to do was to call my PCP. I saw her Thursday, and her expression when palpating the lump seemed surprised and concerned. She asked about pain and movement of the lump, and I knew my answers pointed to the C-word. I told her \"that's bad, right?\" and she did not answer me. She wrote the script for the mammogram and the ultrasound, shook my hand, and wished me good luck.  So, basically, I'm a little scared. The diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound is scheduled for March 1st. Sure wish it could be sooner. I'll make sure to ask them to send me a copy of the results -- so I can share that with my alternative doctor. My PCP told me she would call me as soon as she gets the results. I will make sure to call her after I have the tests done. I guess the step after this will be a biopsy. I don't know why they can't just go right to that. This lump is 2 inches. I mean, seriously, how did i miss it? It is so obvious.  It sure is hard to think about other things. I spent the day with friends and am spending the night. They took me to the racetrack and casino. All I could think about was my boob! Sometimes it made me feel sick.  I will be making some major lifestyle changes as a result of this, including exercise and proper nutrition. I understand cancer doesn't like an alkaline environment, and most meats are acid. Most veggies are alkaline. I also know cancer likes sucrose and fructose; so I will be staying away from that.
