It was tossed around by my breast surgeon and her nurse that I would \"get off easy\" with just a lumpectomy and radiation. At the time, I thought they were nuts for saying \"get off easy\".....then the path report came back, not enough margin around the tumor so they had to go back in and take more margin....then that path report came back HER2+++ and it was a whole new ballgame.  Chemo, followed by 7 weeks of radiation and a full year of Herceptin only in the infusions, then 5-10 years of anti-hormone/cancer drug even though I've had a complete hysterectomy 6 years ago. Really surprised I have any hormones at all based on the hot flashes.  You just don't know where this disease will lead you so don't bother worrying too much about what may or may not be down the line for you until your onco gives you the full story when the path reports come back. I have to add, I have learned more on this website than from any of my doctors/nurses/techs.  I have 7 more \"boost\" rads to go. I think I can, I think I can, I think I can......",

I heard the tech say \"Hand me.....bolus\" to another tech and I felt him put something on me in a couple of places but since I wasn't able to move, I didn't get a look at it. I googled bolus when I got back to work and I've seen references to it on this site but once again, no one at MD Anderson mentioned anything to me about it. If you've read any of my previous posts, you'll be aware that MD Anderson docs don't share much info with the patient. The patient has to learn everything on their own and know enough to know what questions to ask and you have to ask in a timely manner because I learned the hard way that I should have requested brachyherapy or internal radiation right after surgery. It is no longer an option for me at this point. Oh well, we live and learn-  some of us faster than others. I've encountered some very bright women on this site who have helped me tremendously on this journey and I hope I can pass something along to anyone traveling behind me.",

I remember soaking in a hot tub and using both hands to stretch my skin apart long ways (same direction as the cording was growing). When one breaks, it makes a snapping sound. I know it sounds gross but it really doesn't hurt.  After my lumpectomy/lymph node surgery, I developed cording down the inside of my arm and have managed to get two good snaps but I can still fill and very thin cord that I can't manage to break but it's not hurting me or limiting flexibility. Hope this helps, but your doctor can send you to PT for them to massage and hopefully stretch or break up the cording.",

My husband was mad but apparently its pretty common in \"breast conserving\" surgery. Next, the pathology report came back with HER2+ cells in the clear margins so they threw the book at me after that. My 4th and last TCH infusion is Sept 2. After that, I start 4-6 weeks of rads,  along with a continuation of Herceptin infusions every 3 weeks for a year, then 5 years of anticancer drug. Hope your margins are clear.",

I cant imagine what I will feel like after 2 more chemos.  Are you saying tbat radiation is even worse than the chemo for fatigue?",

On another note, low thyroid can make your hair thinner and so does too much thyroid so it's a delicate balance. You have to start out with a very low dose and gradually increase it until your thyroid levels are good.  I had to cut the pills in half in order to do increases more gradually due to sensitivity to the meds (can cause anxiety/racing heart if increased to fast).  Synthroid did not work for me because my body does not convert T4 into T3 so hence the Armour thyroid which has both. I've used Rograin for about 15 years (about the time of menopause) so I've never been able to pinpoint if I had hair loss from low thyroid or from taking Armour.....",
