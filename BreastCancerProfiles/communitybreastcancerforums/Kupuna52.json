Really has taken me by surprise because I sailed thru chemo with hardly any SE other than hair loss from with Adriamycin and Cytoxan and numbness in my toes with Taxol.  Also, thanks to everyone for recommendations of creams that have worked during their treatments.  I will be seeking several this weekend while my energy is up because rads are only Mondays thru Fridays. ",
