I would just like to mention that in my case, my first breast cancer was diagnosed as a fibroadenoma (by mammogram, ultrasound and fine needle aspiration) and the surgeons advised me to keep it under observation. After having the lump for 2 years, it was removed at my request because I felt uneasy about it. The surgeon said its a good job that I'm stubborn as the lump unfortunately was cancer. My second cancer in the opposite side, a year later, was diagnosed with the same methods, as a fibrolipoma. This one turned out to be more nasty. I've almost finished my chemo and will be on Herceptin for the next year. I had lumpectomies but I'll be having double mx soon as I feel it will ease my mind a little and hopefully avoid any further new cancers. I have a few relatives who've had breast cancer and I'm going for genetic testing next week, as I have a daughter and we would rather know if there is an increased risk in the family. In a nutshell, my personal opinion is that the best place for a lump, even if the tests show benign, is in the pathology lab, to be sure. I was unlucky to have two sneaky cancers but I've heard similar stories from other people. I think genetic testing is very wise and also, people should go with their gut instinct for peace of mind. I hope you find reassurance and get your test. I think you are sensible and I wish you well. Best wishes xx",
