Saw a surgeon and he seemed unprepared and left me very confused. He did say that a mass was shown on my lungs through the nammagram and told me about a test that needed to be done. I an afraid and confused and I would like to have a caring and patient doctor and hospital . Any suggestions greatly appreciated. Lymph nodes were cancer free and my breast have been hurting since the biopsy. Log in to post a reply",
