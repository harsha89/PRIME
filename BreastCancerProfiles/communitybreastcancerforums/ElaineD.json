Cancer is cruel at any age-but it infuriates me when it hits someone so young. At least those of us who are middle aged had a good spell of health before having to deal with this. But-as I've said before-there are many treatments available for you to try-and no reason not to feel that some of them may be succesful for you. Do ask if you have any questions-and we will do our utmost to help/advise and support-there is so much to take on board in the early days. it's a bit like information overload, so try to go as slowly as you can on this front-and anything you don't understand-shout out!

Most genetic cancers, however tend to strike (on average-this is not written in stone!) about 10 years earlier than the previous onset. So it could be wise to make a decision one way or another quite soon. Good luck-it's a very hard decision to make-but keep in mind, even if your family did have the genetic misprint, it's by no means a certainty that you would have it.

At your age, genetic testing is likely to be a good thing for you (if you were younger, then accurate readings are difficult, as the tissue is dense in younger woman.) But clearly this comes with a lot of emotional stress. How would you feel if you tested positive for the genetic forms of cancer? But, on the plus side it would give you the option to plan your future-at least in terms of having children. I don't know where you are from-if America, I can't advise on how the system works. But here (UK), anyone seeking genetic testing has a few sessions first with a geneticist, to discuss worries, fears, etc, before they go ahead and do the test. This can be very helpful. Our daughter, for example, was diagnosed as having the gene misprint when she was 22-and is glad she knows. Whereas our son, after several meetings decided not to be tested. Neither of them were pressurised in any way to change their minds, by either the professionals, or ourselves. As a very rough rule of thumb, genetic cancers tend to strike about 10 years earlier than the preceding family member-but that is a very rough guide! I'm so glad that you have such good support from your bf and sister-this will be invaluable in the weeks ahead. I hope your worries turn out t be unfounded. Please keep us posted, and good luck.",

It does worry me when we see people hoping for \"cure\"/no recurrence, both situations which are pretty much unattainable. But if you can accept and enjoy the \"good\" periods, while remaining alert to further problems, then you're doing great-not just physically, but mentally too by accepting the constant challenges with which we have to live. Good luck that this lasts a very long time for you!",

I don't think a short delay would make much difference either way, but again, that is merely a guess.... Hope you are gaining in strength each day, and that the problem will resolve asap.",

I don't think it makes us bad people-the frustrations this disease brings makes it inevitable that our patience and empathies may be in short supplywhether it's with lesser stages than 1V with bc, or other medical issues.

For example, one of my younger cousins who also has the misprint, decided to have one more child, and then go ahead with preventative surgery. It possibly didn't make a huge deal of difference to her timing-but she admits she might have left it for another few years, had she not tested positive. Our daughter, who is now 26 (and getting married in March!), has accepted that if she has children, then she would be wise to do it by mid 30s. Surgery is generally recommended, late30s-early 40s, when the risk increases significantly. I strongly recommend you at least talk to a geneticist, and have the risk factors explained to you. There's a huge amount to take on board, and this would be an excellent first step in helping you decide whether or not to proceed. You sound very sensible, so I'm sure you'll work your way through this nightmare.",

Herein lies the danger of being too upbeat, unfortunately-when we get bad news, and have been expecting good news, the shock to our systems is huge. So-you have learned one very valuable lesson already-you can take nothing for granted, there are no guarantees that treatement will be succesful-and most importantly, keeping a grip on the reality and the enormity of the situation is vital.Perhaps the next treatment will be succesful-but all she can do is try. Adding in herceptin may help-or at the least, even things up slightly-people with hormone receptive tumours may get help from hormonal treatment-those of us with HER2+ may get some advantage from adding herceptin into the mix. But.....a further word of caution! We've found that the herceptin alone is never sufficient to contain the tumours-we can't of course, measure it's efficacy when used alongside a chemo.

So she now has to wait 3 months before having confirmation that all is well-not exactly a recipe to help with the stress levels. Does she relax a bit after a few weeks/months if she hasn't had a phone call....Think most of us have a need to have test results confirmed one way or another before really feeling reassured (otherwise we end up thinking, might have been forgotten/lost, etc!)

Someone who hasn't had cancer would view aches, as aches :we think bone mets. Headaches become brain mets, and a cough is likely to be lung mets! Of course, at times, it will transpire that these aches will have a sinister reason. But more often than not, there will be an innocent explanation. At stage 1V I think our fears are reasonable-if not rational. But what does sadden me is seeing someone with a good prognosis also reacting to every pain-that way, they really are allowing the cancer to gain the upperhand, even if only mentally. Our vulnerability is one of the hardest things we have to deal with, and rationalise-if we can. When I was diagnosed with mets, I had no symptoms whasover-a routine chest xray showed mets to the pleura, and subsequent investigations found mets in the liver and bones. No pain, no symptoms-and yet there have been times when I have suffered quite intense pain-yet no progression. I feel that after so long of treatment (2.5 years for me), my body is weak, even although my spirit is willing-and perhaps I just can't cope with pain as well as I used to do. It's also quite exhausting too, which only adds to the worry. \"I'm in pain, and I feel tired, I must have progression\"!!!!!",

At the moment, for example, I am only on pamidronate and herceptin, haveing completed a course of carboplatin in May. Recent increases in pain levels would suggest we have further progression, so I'm fully expecting to resume chemo again after the next CT which is due the middle of next month. I'm surprised that your onc didn't explain this more clearly to you, as it really is such a basic fact of our lives. You may even find that being on active treatment gives you a certain peace of mind, whereas having a break tends to increase the stress levels.You really can't compare prostate and bone cancers to metastatic bc, which by the nature of it has spread to vital organs-in your case, the brain. Being er-/pr- also limits your treatment options to rads and chemo, as hormonal treatments will not be effective on a negative status. Many of us live by the mantra-\"hope for the best, but prepare for the worst\"-ie, stay as upbeat as you can about what treatment can achieve for you-but accept that you will likely have many upsets and setbacks. I would love to say to you, \"you'll be fine\"-but that would be incredibly irresponsible of me. Even your onc can't say this,although he will do his best to treat you as effectively as possible, for as long as possible. Good luck with whatever treatments the future holds for you-there are many different chemo types available (although few which cross the blood brain barrier, so this will limit you somewhat).",

Like so much with cancer, the anticipation of what endless treatment means, can often be a bit worse than the reality of it. Of course it is tough, and time consuming, and often we will feel dreadful. But there can be good times too-especially early on before the cancer itself causes too many problems or pain issues. Enjoy these times-and when you have a bad day, hope that tomorrow will be  a better one. You can do it-if for no reason other than the fact that we have no choice, other than to decline treatment.",

Otherwise I think I would likley have delayed starting for longer. It's fantastic that they are targetting the genetically based cancers, and certainly the initial results are promising.",

There are a lot of tests/monitoring going on at present, as I'm on phase 2 of a trial for PARP inhibitors, which is being used for BRCA+ cancers. I'm scanned after every 2 cycles, and have been stable in the previous 2 scans-and am stable again today. We've had some slight reduction in the mets to the pleura and chest wall, but an increase in one of the liver mets, which overall equals \"stable\". There are 12 cycles of treatment in the trial, and I'm hoping that I can remain stable for the duration, and then either increase the dosage, or add in a chemo. But for the meantime, it'll be business as usual on Monday, when cycle 7 begins.Was hugely relieved to hear the result-the pain has been quite severe recently, and I was starting to imagine the worst. But I'm now a bit more confident that the pain is nerve pain, so will be getting some meds for this next week to see if this helps.

But you know with all the progress there is being made in the genetic field, I think you could take comfort form the fact that if you did have children, by the time that they were old enough for any gene misprint to possibly affect them, there's every hope that the experts will have found some way of eradicating it. It all sounds a bit like science fiction at the moment, but it's a field which is bringing huge progress on a regular basis. You commented about the baby born here, and I'm not meaning that level of manipulation/screening (this made me rather uncomfortable if truth be told) . But the hope is that in the future if a gene is passed on, then it can be eliminated. If you want a family soon-then go ahead and do so . There may be little that this generation can do to avoid it at the moment, but subsequent generations will have access to therapies today which will be far reaching. Without wishing to worry you further-don't forget that a potential BRCA mutation is only one of the huge range of genes that we pass on to our children, and realistically we don't spend time worrying about every other potential genetic problem/issue we may pass on. So, you're absolutely right to pursue it further, but please don't let it dominate your thoughts excessively, and enjoy instead your plans for the future!",

The fact that your m.i.l died form BC again  doesn't automatically imply that there is a genetic misprint in the family, as  the vast majority of BC cases are not genetic. The main criteria for suspecting genetic BC are if- 4 relatives from same side(ie, from exclusively either  your Mum or Dad's branch) with BC/ovarian at any age, 3 relatives  from same side, aged under 60 2 relatives from same side under 40 Even factoring in the possible connection from the prostate cancer, you still only have your Mum, and possibly uncle , as a potentially suspicious genetic BC.

If neither of them did have a BC diagnosis then it's unlikely that a genetic misprint would have been passed onwards from them to your Mum's generation. For this to be the case, then the inference is that they died form other causes, without being aware that they had BC. Not imposssible, but rather unlikley. Just trying to view this dilemna from all angles-am not saying that you shouldn't be concerned and make further enquiries-but as Beesie said, the incidence of cancer in your family is not excessively high. In the meantime, if you can collate as much information as possible, putting into a family tree, then this will help in the original assessment, should you decide to go ahead. Good luck-and hoping that any tests return negative. Best wishes too, to your Mum at this tough time for her..just one final thought (sorry!). If your Mum is undergoing treatment at present, this type of testing might be quite upsetting for her at the moment, so waiting for a few months might be an idea?",

At this stage it really is a case of trial and error to see what treatments may keep our disease under control for as long as possible. As a Mum, my main focus is to attempt to impact as little as possible on my chidrens' lives-I think most Mums feel the same. Perhaps visiting as often as you can manage-but without suddenly running back to her too often, would be the best way forward.If you suddenly start to visit lots more than usual, you may unintentionally give her the message that you think you will lose her soon. Be honest with her-tell her you are frightened and concerned and want to help as much as possible-my kids did this, and it gave me the chance to reassure them that I wouldn't hesitate to ask for help when/if I needed it. This was comforting to us all. Does she have any other family closer? How old is she-you said she was weak-is she coping with the practicalities of daily life, as well as the treatment? It could be that you could investigate some practical help for her if necessary, and this too will give you additional peace of mind-knowing that she has help, even if it can't always be you doing the helping, will be good for you. I really sympathise with your situation-so many of us here feel that it's worse for our families, and loved ones than it is for us. Good luck.",

Having cancer hasn't turned us into perfect creatures-nor can we expect our partners to be perfect either. I am very blessed with my husband. We've been together since we were 15 and so have grown and changed together. He is the most placid, kind, gentle man you could hope to meet, but I can see the fear and frustration in his eyes. All of our longer term dreams have been wrecked, and I honestly wouldn't blame him if he lost patience with all this entails at times. Unkind words are not pleasant-but let's try and keep a sense of perspective. I'm not sure that I would be able to be a model of kindness 24/7, if hubby was ill, and I was supporting him. At the moment, we are managing just fine, but I feel immensely guilty at having to rely on him more and more. Perhaps it's just me, but I would prefer to be treated as \"normally\" as possible, for as long as possible, and not have family tip toe around me, fearful of sayng the wrong thing at the wrong time.",

      "Content": "ElaineD wrote: I've been itching to share this news with you for several months. Brian and I have been discussing the possibility of him taking early retirement : the decision is now made, and it's full steam ahead! On the downside, I feel guilty-he loves his job, and the only reason he is retiring is because of my health. At the moment I am coping, but at some stage I will need progressively more help-and he is adamant that he will be the one to do so. It seems such a huge shame that he has to take such a drastic step, but he assures me that it's what he wants. On the plus side, it's financially very viable for us. All along we have paid extra into his pension fund (we have been in a position for him to retire since he was 50, and he\u2018s now 54!), and his pension is extremely generous, so we have no worries on that score. He is giving 3 months notice, so provisionally our big adventure is due to begin on 31st March. It's heartbreaking that we are doing this-but we are realistic enough to accept that if we want to have any time as retirees, it has to be sooner rather than later. It breaks my heart to know that we won't grow old together, but I'm determined that we should have as long as possible with that type of lifestyle. At the moment we have no plans to travel- no doubt we will have a few holidays along the way, but think we have to get used to a new lifestyle as soon as possible. One of the first things we will do is downsize to a smaller house-hopefully one which has a workshop attached, or one which we can add a workshop to in due course. One of his hobbies is restoring old sports cars, so this could become virtually a self-financing hobby and small business for him in years to come. At present we are in a townhouse-and the 3rd floor is rarely used, so downsizing makes sense. Please don't think me morbid, but I'm also thinking on to a time when I am no longer here so if we can get Brian installed in a house more suited to his needs, and one in which we have had some time together, then it may make life marginally easier for him. It would simply break my heart to think of him having to do this alone at some point in the future, so this will be our first priority. He'll continue having some contact with work, as he'll be kept on as a (non-executive) director. In time he may also be used by them on an ad hoc basis as a consultant. But, in the short term, the focus will be exclusively on ourselves! All in all we're thrilled and excited to have finally made a decision. The kids are excited for us, and both said the same to him when he phoned them earlier-\"nobody deserves it more\" They have seen how hard Brian has worked over the years, and how focused and dedicated he is, so I have to say, I completely agree with them. Exciting times ahead for the clan-watch this space! Dx 11/4/2007, 5cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

However it has likely added to my bowel problems-I have diverticular disease-and my gastroenterologist admitted that prolonged use of tramadol has made these problems worse.

Am I the only one who has moved on from being angry at there being no cure for cancer? It saddnes and hurts me immensely-but I won't waste my precious energy in getting angry at it. We've seen threads in the past blaming medics, pharmaceutical companies, governments for colluding in there being no cure. Maybe it's far more simple-it's too sneaky a range of diseases to respond well to any treatment for any length of time. I want to save my precious energies for doing good and positive things (I make no apology for using the word \"positive\"-where are we without a dogmatic attitude to survival-and again, I won't get tied up in the semantics used) I feel huge hurt that we lose so many sisters so regularly-but anger just seems counterproductive and creates a tension which is difficult to handle. Maybe this is my little bit of living in denial-but I will no longer do anger over things that can't be changed. Doing so is letting cancer win yet another battle. So yes, I too alternate between wanting to be here, and considering spending less time online.",

Thank you too, for your kind words-am just so glad that you feel I'm able to help in some small way, as so often I feel completely helpless......I try to be honest, without being frightening, and just share little tips that have helped me in some way. I had to refocus myself on the \"as good as it gets\" last night! I had chemo yesterday (pamidronate, herceptin, and cycle 3 of navelbine). I've been a bit despondent, thinking that the navelbine isn't working, as the pain seems to be increasing (more so on the right, which is a new development) Part of me hopes that it may be tumour flare-but experience has taught me that it is more usually caused by progression. Scans are due in a few weeks, so all will be revealed... Anyhow, decided to go to bed early-about 9pm, and noticed that my right arm and hand were swollen, and red (I used to have lymphoedema on this side). Our system here is that until 6pm we phone the day unit for advise:between 6pm-8am, we phone the oncology ward. On no account do they want us going to A+E (\"accident and emergency\")! So, I phoned-to be told to come in immediatley with an overnight bag, for good measure. We arrived at 10pm, and a lovely nurse took bloods, and returned regulary to reasure us that doctor would be here soon. By 3.30am we gave up and returned home-not having seen a doc! The nurse was very apologetic-and it was not her fault, but am livid at the doc, as one of the concerns was that it could be  p.e. They were meant to phone and check on me this morning-but nothing so far! So, I'm exercising my mantra of taking a day at a time, and trying not to stress too much!",

I think there's a fine line between hope and denial-and trying to stay on the right side of it is difficult, if not impossible. I guess it's just in my psyche to be as realistic as possible as to my/our situations. I've had a few chemos fail me, and the devastation that alone can cause has further underlined, for me at last, that a  realistic acceptance of the limitation the treatments have at present is actually less stressfuul than expecting superb results-and then being heartbroken if they don't materialise.

I'm not too keen on the \"cancer sucks\" phrase-cancer does so much more than that, and it feels a bit like stating the obvious.

Again, you can turn this to your advantage-because there is no logic to the way it develops/spreads, you can reasonably safely assume that it is by no means guaranteed that because your mets were there for a while, that you will have rapid deterioration. Truth to tell, is that there is simply no way of knowing who will do well on treatement, and who will not.

But if you can be disciplined about it, then I don't think an occasional day would make much difference. Incidentally, I didn't wear mine 24/7-I always took them off at bedtime-it felt blissful when they came off! I have no idea if you wear rings on that hand, but if you do, it would be good to take them off for a while. It can be surprising how quickly the fingers can swell, and the last thing you need is to have a ring you can't get off. Am speaking from personal experience on that one too! I don't know how well informed the medics are with you, but over here most aren't terribly knowledgeable about lymphodema, and even now I sometimes have to explain why they may not use my bad arm for bloods or b.p readings! I also carry  a card in my purse to alert hospital staff if I'm unconscious. Be extra vigilant about scratches-they can quickly let infection in, resulting in cellulitis which can be very painful and unpleasant. It responds well to antibiotics- but any excessive redness and tenderness may indicate the onset of cellulitis, so watch out for that. Am painting a pretty horrific picture of it all-sorry! But it's actually all very manageable, and if your therapist feels that it should be possible to get it under control, then that's a great thing to focus on.",

I also agree that exercise and healthy diet will help-it'll make her feel better in herself, and therefore give her more focus and strength. It's sad she only tried a week of treatment-not nearly long enough to assess how she would feel whilst on treatment. Have to also say, that as far as I know, there is little treatment for kidney cancer? Other than surgery-which she has already had-so perhaps the proposed drug treatment is not so importnat in her case?

Really, it's something that the vast majority of patients have no idea about, until such time as they need to know for one reason or another. And why should they-after  a primary diagnosis, it's good and proper to try to move on,not let the cancer experience dominate life and thoughts. But you clearly have a good understanding of all this involves, which means that you can perhaps help much more than you think. I had a somewhat similair experience-in reverse-yesterday, which might help you. I was having my chemo+herceptin, and got chatting to the girl next to me. She was clearly a primary patient-for some reason, primary/secondary patients are treateted at the same time. Anyhow, I'm always a bit reluctant to give my details, without prefixing it all with \"you might not like what I have to say\". However, she was interested, had a good degree of understanding that our situations were very, very different (she opted to have chemo, despite being told that it would make little difference to her prognosis). She fels that she has to do everything possible to ensure a cancer free future, and I respect her enormously for this. So I shared my history : she was upset for me, wished me well, hoped I didn't brood on stastics, and hoped too that I was able to enjoy each day for what it was. Well, this confirmed that although our situations are diametrically opposed, we had a huge amount in common. As we're on the same 3 weekly cycle, she suggested we meet up next time beforehand, either for lunch or coffee! I was thrilled. We asked to have our appointments as close together as possible, so we've been given the same time. So, we're meeting an hour beforehand for a coffee, and then going down for our treatment. The nurses even asked if we wanted to sit together again...\"yes please,\" came the reply in unison! Sorry for my ramble-but I think it shows that it is possible to be supportive. After all, it's what many of our friends and family are doing without any cancer experience whatsoever. Your experiences will have given you insight into many of the treatments and s/effects-and that alone could be helpful for her. Of course, so much will depend on how much or little she wants-but maybe even the fact of you being long distance could be a good point for her. Who knows-but think so far, as I said, you've done things just right....",

The plan is ultimately (if it works), to introduce a chemo at some point-when the tumours have become more vulnerable to treatment. Obviously we are all a bit in the dark as to what to expect (I'm only the 3rd person in the U.K to have this drug, so there's little information as yet.) What has upset me-is the criticcal comments I have received-\"it's just another hyped up drug, that likley won't work\", \"you must be mad\", etc etc.....Why can't people be more supportive-OH and I decided it was worth a shot, so can't that be respected? I still have conventional chemo options available to me, and I'll be back on them at some point. But for now we wanted to try this-I'm not expecting miraculous results-and in fact, I was as much motivated to try it in the hope of moving the research along a little. So many of my family have now ben diagnosed with the BRCA2 misprint, that perhaps if this in the long term does yield some benefits to future generations, then my very small contribution can be part of my legacy to my family...

I must admit to getting frustrated at reading posts which hold out over hyped promise-we must take care to be realistic in our enthusiaisms, otherwise people cling to a false hope which won't/can't materialise. This may be great in the short term-but when reality sets in (and we accept that 6 mice responding to a vaccine doesn't equal a cure for bc!!!), then the disappointment is even more profound. I feel particulary for newbies when we hold out these \"miracles\" rather than helping them towards acceptance of the limitations of the treatments we have available at this moment in time. Hope is great-of course it is-but we also need to be realistic in our expectations.

Zeeka said: \"I thought this was a place to be free in our attempt to overcome our disease in different ways, I am as sick with stage four as the rest of you, I am not an onlooker but merely trying to make my life a bit happier instead, of always looking at the doom and gloom. You have no\" support\" except for yourselves. Well I need to be positive and happy as I can. I also have a burden to carry, but it is always about yourselves. I am one of you stage fourers, and look how you help! me thanks a lot, ill do it alone from now on ,be as miserable as you like. It's not only you lot suffering. I only meant to try and encourage you with hope and God. dwell on yourselves only,  goodbye zeeka\"",

But slowly it did get better-to the extent now that my arm is now \"normal\" in appearance, and I no longer need the garments. I still monitor it closely-surprisingly for me, I tended to react more to cold than heat, so am always particularly careful to wear gloves in colder weather. It could be that you will get your's back under control much quicker than I did-I hope so! But it is worth persevering for as long as it takes-eventually you will succeed. I can understand your sadness-it is a visible reminder of what has happened to you. Bizarrely, I had more questions from people about my bandages than I did about my body shape (I had had a mastectomy by that point, and didn't have reconstruction, nor use prosthesis) But they do work-and along with massage sessions, you may find the swelling goes down quite soon. Don't expect too much too soon-and please wear the garments as much as you can-they really do work. After a while you won't even notice they are there. Good luck.",

I should say that this was a complete stranger in a bookshop! More often than not, if asked what the bandages were for, I would say, \"you really don't want to know-it's a very long story\" (emphasising the \"very\") Do you know, the vast majority of people were happy with that answer! Initially you will feel self-conscious, but it will pass-just keep reminding yourself why you're doing it. Incidentally, they are not in the slightest uncomfortable to wear. I often had friends and family asking if I was too hot wearing them-but they don't make you sweat-another reason why it was so easy to persevere wearing them. I did however get some tender spots-mainly between my thumb and first finger, and the elbow too got quite itchy at times. Sssh, don't tell, but I used to do the cardinal sin of scratching these areas to get some relief-well, it was more of a gentle rub, but it helped!",

So often we have had to ask for respect, and to be allowed a safe haven for our thoughts and fears, so I do empathise hugely with your frustrations.We too have been accused of being cliqueish-and perhaps we are, up to a point-but only because we really don't want anyone to be in our shoes. We are at the beginning of the end of our treatments, and this brings about a whole series of fear and events which nobody can possibly understand unless they are facing similair problems. If that classes us as cliquish, then it's only because we are desperately hoping that none of you ever need to find a place amongst us.  I have to agree with Otter's excellent last post-of course it matters what stage we are! How naive it is to think otherwise-perhaps there is more than a little over dramatisation of the severity of an early diagnosis at times, which strikes me as sad.Not so long ago, we had someone post on the palliative board, asking about forgoing treatment-and this was before she was even diagnosed! Completely inappropriate, and unnecessarily cruel to those of us who will need to take this step at some point. So yes, the segregation of stages can be useful-but more importantly, as so many have said-courtesy and respect are paramount. Sadly when struggling with the mental and physical traumas this disease brings our way, sometimes commonsense flies out the window. Incidentally I'm another \"active topics\" user-but perhaps it really is time to remove this function, if it's causing more harm than good. Best wishes to one and all-whatever your stage. But please-if you're at a stage less than 1V, don't try to advise me. If you're at a stage less than 3, then you may not be able to help the stage 3 girls too much either.",

At stage 1V, you will require treatment of one form or another for the rest of your life. You may be lucky and have periods of stabilty, or NED. So far I have only had this short spell of stabilty-and have never had NED, so have always been on one treatment or another. But stable in my book is good. I didn't respond to hormonals, taxotere and herceptin worked for a short time-but the tumours regrew quickly when we tried herceptin alone.

Really the only advise, is to take a step at a time.Don't look too far to the future, as the entire situation is frightening and confusing-just deal with problems when they arise. Everyone reacts differently to treatment, and what works well for one, will not work for others-and vice versa. Gene testing sounds like  a good idea for you-it may be that you would not have  a gene misprint-even if your sister does (in which case you could assume it likley came from your Mum), there is still a 50% chance that you wouldn't have inherited the gene. If you had an answer to this, then at least you would be in a situation to consider having prophylactic surgery, to reduce the risk of developing b.c Very tough times for you and your family-try to go with the flow, and take the lead from what your sister needs and wants. But, don't forget to look after yourself as well-I'm sure most of us with metastatic disease would agree with me when I say that it's as bad for our families, as it is for us as patients. The suffering may be different, but it's nonetheless earth shattering. Good luck to you both.",

I'd be surprised if your onc changes anything at this stage-it's simply too soon to make a call. Sorry I can't be more constructive, but this seems to be one of these classic, \"wait and see\" moments.

The pain levels have decreased which is also great (am on no pain medication at all at the moment-was previously on codeine+gabapentin,60mg 3 times a day).

Of course, my brain focuses on the last thing, and am dreading further progression. Hold my virtual hand gals, and I'll do my best to get some good results for us! Am contemplating asking him to scan me less frequently. I don't get too stressed, but it does make me think about cancer more often than normal. Usually I can go about life perfectly happy and content-until the old scanxiety emerges yet again. On this 3 cycle schedule, I'm either gearing myself up for a scan, stressing over the results (in the UK our oncs always give the results on a face to face consult-no collecting results/phoning for them), so we normally have to wait7-10 days for the results. Or, I'm getting used to what the scans have shown-they really do dictate our lives, don't they-even scanning every 4 cycles would give me a bit of a break.

Or does telling us in advance \"how brave, knowledgeable and wonderful\" we are, make these postings any more acceptable....... Re Jenny....She's doing quite well. She and Sam are still theoretically \"together\"-in that they haven't seperated. But it's superficial only, and we feel that they will ultimately seperate. Jen is being open and honest-Sam less so, with few people other than his mother and brother even knowing there is a problem! Jen has decamped into the lounge, where she now sleeps-far from ideal, as you can imagine. Her dear friend moved into the spare bedroom a few months ago, and this is helping her enormously, as it lessens the tension between J+S, and the girls enjoy their time together. Her friend has a 9 month old puppy, so they spend a lot of time walking him, which we feel is good for her-it gets her out and about more than she had been doing, and who doesn't love watching doggy antics?! Jen has also just got a kitten, which she is enjoying (and which fortunately gets on ok with the dog) It's just heartbreaking that her affection is being directed to animals, when she has so much love to give. She's coping better with work, and hopes to be doing a longer week soon-which again we feel will help.....and not just financially!!! No doubt in time, Sam will move on (although they were buying the flat together, Jen has the lion's share as we gave her a large sum towards the deposit)-we are happy to buy out his share, so he can also start a new life. We see little or no hope that they will want to stay together-there are just too many differences in what they want from life. In truth, it appears they never really should have got engaged, let alone married.Heartbreaking for them both.",

So often we read on the boards about how people get impatient and stresed over having to wait for a diagnostic test-imagine how much worse it would be if there were \"routine\" tests added to the mix! It's actually neither practical nor desirable-and prettyinpink has explained very well why this is the case.

It can be hugely dispiriting to hear that despite all treatments, a good prognosis, and every other thing going supposedly well, that mets still happen. It's for these reasons that I often urge non-metsters not to dwell (more than can be helped), on what may or may not happen. We are all so unique, that there is no straightforward equation which can show us how we will fare-and as Shana said, hearing bad news only serves to deflate and cause excessive worry.Please girls-live your lives to the full-hope and expect that cancer has been a dreadful experience that you have dealt with, and which won't return to cause you further problems. You could spend a lot of time worrying, when you could be enjoying life. Conversely, if you continue to worry excessively, and then do have further problems, you'll be filled with regret for the time that you've wasted worrying about what may happen. Plus, cling to the fact that each year new drugs are being found which can help-none of these will take the worry away completely, but may help it stay at a manageable level.",

Like your Mum, I found the \"week off\" the worst for the side effects-tired and neauseous, and I believe that this is quite common. Hopefully it will be working for her-but if not there are other drugs that can be tried-sometimes it's just difficult finding the one which works best for us.I also get similair pains-but on my left side (the site of the lung mets), which as far as we can tell, are stable. But like you, I do wonder if it's the cancer growing-it's hard to think otherwise when we're in pain. But try to remember that there can be other reasons for pain-it's so easy to assume that everything that goes wrong with our bodies is somehow related to the cancer-but you know, sometimes it isn't.....

Firstly, my experience with xeloda was the same (no help for me at all), and I then embarked on a trial, which held me stable for 6 months, which was fabulous. I too then moved on to carboplatin (with herceptin).Scanned after 3+6 cycles we saw reduction in the liver mets both times, and stability in the pleura. A few weeks ago, we decided to stop at 6 cycles, for the following reasons- 1) My platelets were very low each time and the 3 week cycle invariably became a 4 week cycle. 2) I often read/hear, of oncs \"wanting to hit it hard\"/\"throw everything at it\", both on this site, and elsewhere. My onc has a completely different attitude. He aims to use as FEW treatments at possible to gain either a measurable response or maintain stability. The benefits to this being twofold-less poisoning for our compromised systems, and the option of spreading out the treatments for as long as possible. I think of it as \"saving\" some up for future use. In real terms this may only mean an extra few cycles, or an extra few months, but when the time arrives, I imagine I'll be glad of this leeway. The first reason is easy to understand-it's a harsh chemo for the bone marrow, so a break from it will be welcome. Initially I took some convincing of the second reason, when I was initially diagnosed with mets over 2 years ago.But I accepted it then, and it does make sense. If you can accept the rationale which tells us that even at NED, there will still be clusters somewhere in our system, then it makes this strategy more palatable. Like everyone, I would love to achieve NED-but failing that, having options available which can maintain stability are more than acceptable for me. So, for the meantime, we have stopped at 6 cycles, although the herceptin and pamidronate will continue, and I'll be scanned again next month. So, after that long tale, perhaps you and Olga could consider doing the same? It's fantastic she responded so well, and I can fully understand your desire to squeeze every possible benefit from this particular chemo. But, taking a break from it now, means that she still has the potential of keeping it in reserve for future use, before having to try another chemo, which may or may not be as succesful as carboplatin. Personally, I would take a break. The timing for this is good, and would enable you to enjoy the summer. You're a young family, and these times are important for you. I'm often saddened by seeing people focusing so hard on what the future may bring, for better or worse, that they fail to take advantage of what the present is offering. At the moment Olga feels well, has been through a horrendous few months, so some time recouping her strength, and just enjoying life, sounds like a good plan! Hopefully by next summer, Olga will be as well as she is now-in which case you can have another fun filled summer. But if she is in need of treatment at that point, then you will have the comfort of knowing that the summer of 2010 was filled with fun. Please consider taking advantage of this wonderful turn of events-you know more than most, how quickly things can change at stage 1V. You both deserve a break and to have lots of pleasure in your life-both these things are there for the taking, so grab them, if you can, with both hands, and enjoy some quality family time. Sometimes, the short term quality of life, is as important as the longer term aim of controlling the disease as much as possible.... One final thought (hooray, says everyone). I've enjoyed the past few weeks so much, felt overall quite well (painkillers only needed a few times), and have scarcely thought of cancer at all. It's been a huge boon, both physically and mentally, and when I return to treatment, other than that ongoing for the bone mets, I feel it will be with added strength and focus. Good luck with the decision-however you look at it, it's a tough one!",

Consequently he's going to put me back on hormone treatment soon, as the presence of scelorosis implies the possibliity of a healing process-certainly worth trying! So all told, a pretty good reponse after 4 cycles of treatment. He'll scan me again at the end of next month, and decide then if 6 cycles will suffice, or if we'll do another couple.",

It's incredibly frustrating, but just be grateful that it's having some effect on the other areas. Perhaps in due course anotehr chemo will be added which will tackle the liver mets more succesfully. We are all so different, that there would be no point in making any suggestions as to what may achieve better results-it really is a case of trial and error, forever looking for a chemo which can give us as much benefit as possible-what works for one of us, will be useless for another (as I've found out with xeloda and navelbine, which have been no use to me at all!)",

It's not rocket science, but I know I'm much happier when pain levels are minimal. So it makes it all the more daft to try and be brave/save up the meds for when we really need them. Let's face it, if we don't really need them at stage 1V, when will we! So today, I have taken your advice -as I knew I would. Had the codeine this morning and felt so much better for it-then rather spoiled the effect, by having what seemed to have been a bout of indigestion post lunch! I really wasn't sure what it was at first-in fact, not completely convinced that it may not be my gall bladder starting to protest. We were fence painting, so cheated at lunchtime by sending out for that good old British standby....fish and chips! Sooooo tasty-but so greasy! It was lovely, but I suffered..... Other than that, I'm still feeling not too bad at all-so will take another half dose now, which should keep the pain damped down-and as from tomorrow, will take them on a regular basis. Just one thing that puzzles me though-if we're taking them regularly, how can we judge if we still need them-ie, how do we know if the pain levels improve?

We protect our kids, but we don't lie to them. They would have been devastated if they had then had worries prompted by things their peer group had said to them. I think it's vital to keep any explanation as simple as possible-but it's important to be honest with them-or at least, in your case, with the eldest. The younger ones may not assimilate too much, but the eldest, as you have seen, has already been put in the situation of being questioned about you by his friends. If you have further problems, he may find it difficult to trust you-however good your intentions of protecting them, I think you have to be honest with them,even if only on a very basic level. Our kids coped with it all very well (mastectomy and chemo), and took great pride in \"helping\" with jobs around the house. As they were involved, a lot of the potential fear didn't materialise. Then-and now (with mets diagnosed 2 years ago, and kids now in their 20s!), we have always said that we would answer any questions they may have-and if we didn't know the answer, we would do our best to find the answer for them. I honestly think this attitude gave them comfort, focus-and the knowledge that we hadn't lied to them. Given that you have two family members who have had cancer and who are ok, you have a great basis for being able to talk about cancer without it automatically being a chat about cancer=death.",

He was slightly miffed that they had been compared to the last scans done in Exeter (which were last April, before I started on the PARP trials in Plymouth). But, comparing last week's scan to the one last April, shows no change! Given that I had some progression towards the end of the trial, he's actually interpreting that as being equivalent to a reduction of around 20%. The only area of concern is my thoracic spine, which he feels he may want to treat before it becomes problematic. But as I'm experiencing no problems for the meantime, I would prefer to hold off on this until necessary. I loved the way he said, \"we'll maybe do rads after the chemo\"......Seriously, am not expecting to be off chemo in the near future-but it's nice to know that he still feels that it could be a possibilty. Not sure if tomorrows infusions will go ahead, as my platelet count was low last time-in fact, had he not been on holiday he would have postponed it-and was a tad put out that his registrar had given me the go ahead. However, as I'm not bleeding as much (was having nose bleeds quite often) this time, it may be that I've recovered slightly better. He's also going to reduce the dose of the carboplatin slightly, as he feels that should help. So, all things considered, a pretty good result all around. What a relief!

As you still feel quite healthy, and as conventional chemo hasn't been working, then it might be wise to give the trial a try.

I imagine that once the side effects become too horrendous, then we will stop ,as we will know that continuing is just far too rough and imprcatical-but will our hearts still say, \"just a little more treatment, please?\" I do think acceptance is the key-not expecting too much, but setting ourselves reasonably realistically attainable goals. I've been on treatment now for over 2 years-and yes, it's hard, but it has to be done.

I've been on chemo with only a short break for 3.5 years now-and the energy levels are certainly much poorer now than then. It's hard (impossible?) to know how much is due to the toll and the status of the disease, how much is due to the drugs-and how much to the natural aging process!

I'm much happier with this approach-although accept that it wouldn't suit everyone. I also feel that I want to use treatmnet as sparingly as possible, in the hope that it means that I can stay on active treatment for as long as possible. I would hate to use up all my options too soon, in attempting to attian NED.

I'm due to start taxol in a  few weeks-so there are still options for me. But my biggest worry is our darling daughter-how long will it take for her to get well? What if I deteriorate very rapidly, before her recovery has taken root-I really don't think she could cope with any more stress in her life in the near future. I'm hoping that soon, my determination to survive for as long as I can will reassert itself-it's one way in which I can help her, so surely that should help focus my thoughts? I seem to waver between being confident, to getting to the depths of despair. The cold weather we've been having for the past few weeks isn't helping-I simply can't cope with it. I'm very slight (about 44 kilos), so don't have the body fat to protect me. Last weekend, when out shopping, the cold seemed to sneak up on me, and it took 4 hours when we got home for me to feel warm again (made me realise how quickly hypothermia can strike). Plus the cold air in my lungs is most uncomfortable. I know there are no answers to any of my (rhetorical) questions-but I swear seeing my daughter suffer is much worse than being given a 1V diagnosis......Having said that, she's had quite a reasonable week-is coping a bit better with work-which added to her confiding in us, has been a big step forward for her. Brian and I met with our s.i.l a few evenings ago-and how he is suffering too. He admits he is running on empty, and is lost to see a way forward. Having him sit between us on the sofa, with tears streaming down his face, was a humbling lesson. He is still very committed to getting her well again-so we're hoping that working together, we may find a way forward.

The same happened with counselling-she tried a few sessions, but felt it wasn't helping, so stopped. Hopefully we have made her see that it could be a long hard slog back to normality-but we are all determined to get her there-as indeed is she. I had a really useful pm which suggested there could be another cause......thyroid problems! Of course, this makes huge sense (have had 2 friends in the past, misdiagnosed with depression, when the actual problem was the thyroid.)

You're right, that in the grand scheme of things, more lumps will appear-such is the nature of the disease at this stage, when progression is a fact of life. The important thing to remember is that any progression is the barometer we use to judge how efficient any treayment may be. So, if (and I stress \"IF\"), this transpires to be a further met, then perhaps some dosage adjustment is necessary? My onc works on the rough theory that any progression after 3 cycles means the treatment isn't helping, and will try something else. He scans after every 3 cycles so we have a continual picture (although when on drug trials, I was scanned after every 2 cycles, mainly so I could revert to conventional chemo when progression set in) It sounds as if Olga is being scanned after every 2 cycles? In which case changes may be made now, or after 4 cycles. Would you both be comfortable/confident waiting for another 6 weeks to see what happened? Obviously the main advise has to come from your onc, and patience is very difficult at this stage-but we have to give the drugs a chance to help. Whilst we may not see an immediate response, it's worrying when we see progression-stability, or the slowing down of the spread may be what you could hope for after 2 cycles, as this would give some indication that it was having some effect. If there is further progression, then it is worrying, naturally. In terms of the bone pain disappearing completely? This is something which may take longer-or which may never happen, depending on the location of the problem My bony mets still hurt-allthough some of the pain appears to be nerve pain (it responds reasonably well to gabapentin), as the tumours are pressing on nerves. Good luck with the scan-hoping there's an innocent explanation-but if not, and it's time to try another chemo, then good luck too with that. Incidentally xeloda was no help to me-and after 4 cycles I was hugely relieved to be taken off it, as my feet were in such a mess that I couldn't stand, let alone walk-and this was despite doing everything to keep them in as good condition as possible. With a young family, if Olga has any problem like this, then actually another chemo may give her a much better quality of life. I was fine for a few cycles, and then I quickly developed huge blisters around the side of my feet, under my toes, and on the soles of my feet-even moving a few yards was excrutiatingly painful. Obviously, had it been helping the tumours reduce, we would have persevered-but having no response, and such crippling side effects, had me very glad to see the back of that particular drug!",

There is a world of difference between needing controlled pain relief, and abusing prescription medications. I'm really sorry that you feel you need to be in control-again, you will learn that with a stage 1V diagnosis, you have very little control over your life-it all revolves around how much the cancer \"allows\" you to do at any given time. One thing we certainly do not have is control. Whilst I admit that I admire a positive attitude (however unfashionable it is to admit to this), I think we are ultimately controlled by our disease-and we really have little choice other than to go with the flow, and make the most of our good days-and if we have a bad day, then hope that the next one will be better.

It's hard to realise that we will always be on treatment (with an occasional chemo break if we're lucky!), but once I had acceptance of that, I found that mentally I felt stronger.

Like Janis, I pretty much live for the day-if it's a good one, I enjoy it:a bad one then I hope the next will be better....I'm not too good at planning much more than a month or so in advance-perhaps one day! I agree that we're far from a cure, and that there are still a lot of misconceptions about how far cancer treatment has evolved.But, we have to grab what treatments are available-and many of them actually aren't too bad- I coped ok with taxoterrible, for example!

We're looking forward immensely to the day-her fiance is a lovely guy, and we know he'll take care of her. At the same time, am expecting the day to be tinged with sadness. They don't plan on having children soon, so I guess I'll be unlikely to see any grandchildren. They may surprise us though-Jenny has the BRCA2 misprint, so will not likely delay for too long before thinking about kids. We bought her pearls to match her dress (which she was honest enough to say \"weren't her\"!!). We knew they weren't her taste, but just wanted her to have something specific to the day-but have since bought her an alternative-which she loves. The upside to this, is that I've decided to keep the pearls for me-so she'll get them eventually, whether she likes it or not, lol! They're a good match for a pearl ring I have which belonged to Mum-who tragically died of bc on her 50th birthday, so will be wearing them in memory of her. So...lots of emotions will be running high on Saturday-not a dry eye in the house, no doubt.....Just wish Mum (and Dad, who also died of cancer), were still with us. Jenny doesn't really remember Mum at all as she was only 3 when she died. Will post a pic of the happy couple next week-in the meantime, we're counting down the hours to this wonderful day in our lives.Fortunately, I should be at my good phase-had chemo last Wednesday, so am already pretty well recovered-which is as just well as we've got a ceilidh band coming in the evening to play for the dancing (we're Scottish). Not sure how energetically I'll be dancing-but I'll be doing my best. When diagnosed with mets back in Nov 2007, I really didn't expect to be dancing one day at our daughter's wedding.....I'm so grateful that I will be.

I read \"active topics\", and time and again , I see there, as well as on our 1V board, that second/third/ad infinitum opinions are sought. That of course, is everyone's right. But surely it has a knock on effect both on the system, and the medic's attitude towards their patients? If there was more trust forthcoming from patients, wouldn't the medics feel more confident about getting more involved with their patients? I've always felt that there is no right/wrong with treatment protocol-it's trial and error. Ask 3 oncs for their opinion and you'll get 3 different answers-how does that help clarify anything?This is not directly answering the question, but it has been something which has fascianted me-it's almost as if we trust our docs too much over here.The system and people are far from perfect, and chaos is looming on the horizon-but I know with all my heart that the people responsible for any downturn in the care we get will be the government cutbacks, not the staff at the cutting edge, who do a fantastic job under horrendous circumstances. I often joke with them that they would have a very easy life if it weren't for all these damned patients! But I'm sorry to see so many of you discontent with the care you receive-if the vulnerable, ill members of society can't be cherished and valued, then it's a sad state of affairs.Again, I apologise if my comment has offended anyone-I genuinely don't know enough about your systems to make any worthwhile comments, but have always been intrigued by the amount of discontent that is seen, re patients having to look for alternative opinions/change their onc. I can't imagine doing either, unless there had been some very serious breaches of etiquette,or perhaps when I get to the stage of my present team being unable to offer me any further options.",

I'm 2 years post mets diagnosis, with 2 years continual chemo,and find each cycle that little bit harder to handle, and it takes longer each time to return to some semblance of normality. If you can stick with taxotere a bit longer, then it might be good to do so-when is your next scan? At this stage, I'm being scanned after every 3 cycles, so it sounds as if more regular scanning may at least give you an idea as to how effective a treatment is being-otherwise we can waste precious energy speculating. As he's using a much reduced dose, it could be that it would take longer to give some good results-another reason for keeping on with it if you can.

We all react differently to treatments, so it's hard to suggest what she might expect to feel like. Many of us manage not too badly at all-and even if we have bad side effects, there are many meds which we can be given to help ease the side effects-so make sure she doesn't suffer in silence through nausea/pain, etc. At this stage, I would suggest just take a day at a time. Don't look too far to the future, as there is so much information to take in, it can all get a bit confusing if you try to take it all on board straight away. Chop it all up into smaller chunks, and deal with problems when they arise. It's good that you are aware of the seriousness of the situation-but having said that, there are many treatments nowadays which aim to keep us stable for some years. Although you're right-metastatic cancer has no cure, we can still hope to live with it as a chronic condition for quite a while.So far, it has been contained in her bones, which is a relatively \"good\" sign, as the major organs as yet aren't involved, so let's hope she stays that way for a while. At this stage, we all will be on one form or another of treatment for the rest of our lives-but we sometimes get \"chemo breaks\" when the disease is stable-and some of us even have reprieves in the form of being NED (\"no evidence of disease\"). Ultimately, it does return, but nobody-not even the most experienced oncologist in the world-can really predict how our disease will behave and spread. So if you can, take each day as it comes, remain hopeful that her treatment will go well, and just be there for her as much as you can. She will likley feel quite tired at times, so will no doubt be glad of extra help with the kids. Don't be surprised/hurt if her moods change erratically, and she might lash out at those close to her-we all have our down days, when the fear just overtakes us-it's all perfectly normal under such horrendous circumstances. Good luck to you all-do keep us updated-and maybe suggest that she joins us here too?",

He didn't have the scan results to hand, but from the information that he'd been given earlier from the radiologist, the indication is that there has been \"noticeable\" change in the liver tumours (so he presumes at least 25%).  There is also signs of thickening in the pleura. We're naturally disappointed and upset-but realistically had little hope that herceptin+exemestane alone would be an adequate therapy. He's reluctant to put me back on taxotere at present, but may do so in the future. Just before we set out, I said to Brian \"I'm not prepared for bad news\"-I've been feeling physically and emotionally well , so this has been a bolt out of the blue. But in some strange way, I'm relieved to be going back on chemo. He'll see me again in 3 weeks, and scan again 2 months from now. On one hand, I'm dreading it-yet at the same time, I'll be glad to be having more treatment which might help slow down the progression. Comfortingly, he's said that there are still many drugs which he can try-it's still a bit of trial and error at the moment. Fingers crossed this combination may bring some good results. Only 2 months of stability though from taxotere+herceptin, so it's pretty nerve wracking at the moment. Dx 11/4/2007, 5cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

We simply don't know-all we can do is guess-even the oncs are working on guesswork to a large degree.

If you've done the test, and it's positive, then you do have more of a dilemna. I'm BRCA2-as is my daughter and several of my cousins. She was tested at age 21-which in the UK is seen to be as early as the geneticists like to do it-and for various reasons, they would actually prefer to leave it until the child was older. There's very little accurate monitoring that can be done at present until about the age of 30-so a positive diagnosis earlier, can potentially cause a huge amount of stress. But forever the optimist...genetics is such a rapidly evolving field, that it doesn't seem unrealistic to hope that in 20 or so years (by which time your daughter could start to be monitored if she does have a gene misprint), then who knows...it could be, if not curable, then a much more manageable disease.",

All I can suggest is that you try to remain rational, and not panic over every ache and pain. You will have things which happen in your life that have no connection to a previous cancer diagnosis. Try to remain as calm as possible, otherwise you run the risk of panicking over everything-and if you do that, then the cancer has truly won, as it dominates your thoughts.Don't go looking for trouble, where there may be none to be found. Even if you do get a mets diagnosis at some stage, a few weeks/months delay in having it confirmed makes no difference to the overall picture. But I would urge you to try and put this behind you as far as possible-dwelling on when/if you may gets mets is not good for your mental health and emotional well being.

Am mainly concerned with the newest pain, which is in the middle of the join in my ribs-assuming nodes, and gearing myself up to discover progression there. It's the sharp stabbing pain which yesterday I assumed was indigestion, but it's here again today, so perhaps not. I saw my onc last week, and we are due to scan again next month, so all will be revealed in due course. What also occurred to me last night was the fact that until recently, I have only really needed occasional pain relief-so taking the step to regular dosages is a bit of a leap in itself. But on the plus side....when diagnosed with mets 2.5 years ago, I didn't even expect to survive this long. Yet here I am, managing overall not too badly at all, and just getting to the stage of needing to be more procative with pain relief. So, ready now to do what's needed from now on-I know it makes sense-I just needed a bit of persuasion!",

Herceptin can cause damage to the heart-but patients are closely monitored (usually every 6 weeks), and if the heart function detriorates, treatment stops immediately. Recovery usually follows quickly thereafter, and treatment can once again be started. But these sound almost academic points in your case, as I really don't think you would qualify for herceptin.

Going back to my earlier point, about your son not wanting to talk about it-did he know of his classmates's Mum's illnesss? If so, did he talk to you about it? If not it may be that you will find it even more difficult. Sorry Janis-not what you might need to hear-there's no straightforward answer to this one. Am just thinking back to me at primary diagnosis, when my son was 8, and really didn't want much information at all. We were honest with him with any questions he asked-and his way of coping seemed to be to help me with little jobs around the house. Your situation is hugely different-but in your son's eyes in may not be so very different. He sees you going about your life, busy, and that may be enough for him in the meantime?

Understanding and beginning to accept what a stage 1V diagnosis actually means, can take a long time, and you have taken a big step forward towards achieving that goal. Honesty with yourself-and us-is not negative, but is something which we admire-or should! I'm not going to trot out the worn out old platitudes and tell you that you might get to NED for years. You're clearly a sensitive and intelligent girl, and great though it is to hear that there could be things which may help, we need to to prepare ourselves for the overwhelming despair which happens when we have bad scans, or when treatment fail us. I think one of the most difficult things I have to deal with is psyching myself up to try a new treatment-only to watch it fail (this has happened 3 times to date) Each time I think I'm prepared for disappointment-but the resultant devastation from treatments which fail is simply soul destroying. Like you, herceptin never seems adequate alone to hold my tumours. I had shrinkage on taxotere/herc, carboplatin/herc:but within weeks of trying herceptin alone, the growth restarted. I had tykerb (with xeloda, as that's the only use it's licensed for here), so can't comment on the efficacy of it with herceptin. But am pretty certain that someone has had good results with it. So let's hope you do too. Addressing your other point, re that cancer will likely be the cause of your death. Yes, that is true. It hurts like crazy-and again, I won't repeat the old cliche, \"it might not happen\". The likelihood is that it will happen. But where the heart of the tragedy lies, is not that we die from cancer (which is such a  complex series of diseases, that it's not surprising that the death rate remains high), but that we will die prematurely from the disease. You are much younger than me (I'm 54), have accepted that I may manage another few years-but that still feels like a premature death to me. People may say, \"oh, you could be killed suddenly in a road accident\"-as if dying prematurely in some other way is less of a tragedy! One of the very best peices of advice I have ever been given (here from Katie), was \"hope for the best, but prepare for the worst\"-and that sounds exactly what you are doing. It's very hard indeed, to pick ourselves up after treatment fails/bad scans-but somehow we do it. I guess because there is no other choice. Don't ever feel alone in these bad times-we do understand, and will help as much as we can,xx",

But don't let it dominate your life-relax as far as you can, try and get some enjoyment and pleasure in your daily routine....and when you know what you're dealing with (if it turns out to be anything significant), then you will be in a position to ask questions and do some research. At the moment you are going around in circles-you're not even sure what the question is, let alone the information you hope to find. We all want to begin our new treatments as soon as possible-but a delay of a few weeks while your team get the results they need is unlikely to make much difference. So in the meantime, please try not to panic. There will be time enough for that later-if the results show progression.Since you were NED in September,I would try and focus on that, and all that such a great diagnosis suggests. Incidentally, the er status can change, so it may not be that mistakes have been made. My er changed from - to + between primary and secondary diagnosis.",

I'm in quite a similair situation myself-in that varoius chemos have slowed progression in the mets in pleura and bone, but done nothing for the liver mets. I had reasonable success on taxotere, which reduced all by 50%, but when stopped, and relying simply on herceptin, they started growing very quickly again. I then had xeloda-for 6 months, which has seen further progression, so we've stopped that too (I had it in conjunction with tykerb) Naturally, these are huge blows, as we had high hopes of both these drugs. But we're all different, and you could respond very well to xeloda-all you can do is try and see....My onc has said the next combo he will use will be carboplatin and herceptin-but for the meantime, I'll likley be starting on drug trials for PARP inhibitors, as I'm also BRCA2.

I would have loved to have got 8 months from my 2nd chemo (xeloda, which was no use to me at all). I think you really have to try and adjust the timeframe/mindset in your life. Any time given to us when we are stable/NED has to be welcomed. \"A day at a time\" as Linda said-this is my catchphrase. If you can get a run of success from various treatments, it could add up to quite a few years. This is my hope-and one which doesn't seem to unobtainable. I can't spend my precious time chasing rainbows, hoping for miracles-although of course I do both of these things, and certainly wouldn't refuse a miracle if it came my way! But having treatments which can be effective for a number of months/years is the reality we have-if you can learn to focus more on what you have in the present, and keep the fears for the future under control as far as possible, you may find it gives you a new found confidence in whatever the future may bring your way.  ",

It sounds as if you are doing a great job-striking the balance between being supportive, yet giving her the space she may need, is not easy. My hbby too is great-but at times I don't want info/reassurances from him. I just want us to live as normal a life as possible, with cancer and all it entails impacting as little as possible-even if only for a few hours at a time. Our relationship was always a very equal one-and it's hard to become the \"needy\"/ill partner. It can ceratinly put things on to a very different footing-which is heartbreaking, if you were happy with life previously. It's such a cruel disease, but working together-albeit in a different fashion to previously-will give you both strength.

Theer is no intention to open it to TN at any stage in the near future. The next group to likely be included will be prostate cancer patients. It'll be interesting to compare results-and wouldn't it be incredible, if all categories benefited from it?So far, on my arm (BRCA2), they have had only 3 candidates, including myself. One girl had to drop out after 1 cycle of treatment as the side effects were too powerful for her, and the other girl has had her 12 cycles....and is going strong, and so is being kept on it. I hope to be like the latter! I'm finding it a pretty tolerable drug, although I have never experienced exhaustion like this. It hits me like running into  a brick wall, and has me completely weak for about 5 days. Pain levels also fluctuate considerably in the site of the tumours, so we're hoping that's tumour flare.",

Other than that, the s/effects aren't too bad-but it concerns me that you already have mobility problems, and the chances are that they could become more pronounced with this chemo. But....I guess all you can do is try-you may not get any s/effects-if you find it too much, then you can have the dosage reduced (my onc reduced my dose last week, and already I'm seeing an improvement).

If we can accept the likelihood of dying prematurely with as much grace as we can muster, it will make our daily life less fraught with anxiety. I do find taking a day/problem at a time helps enormously, but sometimes it feels almost a little like living in denial-and that's not my way at all! I have very much been thinking of Katie's recent experiences, and this gives me hope. Even when things appear to be at their bleakest, something can unexpectedly kick in and give us some breathing space, so to read her update today, has had me bouncing up and down with excitement (not a pretty sight!!!!)  Of course, nothing is straightforward for me at the moment.....I should have had taxol yesterday. But it isn't used in Exeter for b.c. (honestly!), although it is used for ovarian cancers, and the necessary paperwork hadn't been completed in advance-necessary as it was being used \"out of protocol\". My onc is on holiday, so it fell to one of his colleagues to try and sort out the mess-and 5 hours later we were still waiting. The nurses were so angry and frustrated on my behalf, and by 4pm suggested that we come home, and return today, by which time all the necessary documentation would be done. So off we set once again, after having wasted yet another day. Fortunately I received a phone call a short while ago saying that pharmacy was mixing up my cocktail, so we would be fine to proceed today. I'll believe it when it happens though! Thanks once again for all your kind wishes-I feel a little more in control each day, and feel that as long as we are trying as hard as we can to make progress, then we are doing our best. But I am firm with my onc-even if the options are diminishing, I'm nowhere close to withdrawing from treatment.",

Have dropped in very briefly over the past few weeks. \"I must try harder!\" Seriously, haven't really felt up to contributing too much, but starting to feel a little better about things again-I guess sooner or later we usually do. Anyhow, just to let you know that our daughter had her first counselling/psychotherapy session last week, which went well. She was impressed with the counsellor, reassured that her problem can be addressed and treated succesfully-the more she hears this, the stronger she feels. A long hard road ahead for her, but she's taken the first step, and we're immensely proud of her. I'm still going around in circles, and getting frustrated with it all. Yesterday we should have been going to the Marsden in London to meet with the head of metastatic breast cancer research, to discuss various trials-in particular olaparib, which I am very keen to try.It's being developed as the next stage of inhibitor for those who have been on PARP, responded, then had progression-so I meet the criteria. However, having missed the worst of the weather so far, we awoke yesterday to 8\" of snow. We tried to get to the station, but had to turn around after half a mile. We then needed to leave the car, as it was completely stuck-and still is! So no trip for me. Last week's treatment was split into two-herceptin and pamidronate last Friday:the first taxol being rescheduled for this Weds., to have enabled me to travel without too many side effects. It occured to me yesterday that I haven't had chemo now for 6 weeks-and so had the wash out period necessary for trials covered-ie, if all had gone well yesterday, I could have signed up to the trial, had all the testing done asap, and started on the trial, keeping taxol in reserve.However, this is not to be-and I'll start taxol on Weds as planned-sometimes things simply don't go as we want them to.... Must admit I'm still feeling a bit down about it-I can't get the fact that my onc feels we are running out of options, out of my head. I've had 4 chemos (taxotere, xeloda,carboplatin,navelbine), but still felt that there would be a good few alternatives for me. Surely there are more options for me-or am I really approaching my last few months? I know we deteriorate quickly and unexpectedly at times (far too often...). But overall, I don't feel to bad-low energy levels, pain pretty well controlled-but I'm far from spending long periods of time in bed-although I do need a sleep in the afternoons. I'm not in denial, I don't think, but am finding it very hard to accept that there are few options left for me. Dx 11/4/2007, 5cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

My point is that it makes sense (to me at least), not to lay the blame for everything that goes wrong,( emotionally or physically,) at cancer (or the necessary drugs) door. We lose so much to the disease (how often do we get threads about friends who disappear from our lives, for example?), I feel that we must try to hold on to what degree of normality we may have. This will vary from person to person-but it makes me sooooo happy when I can continue to have some aspects of life which I can cope with in the way I used to do so. Small thigs become so important, and almost like goals which we strive to achieve. How often too do we read here \"only you gals will understand\"-and of course that's the case-and is one of the reasons I would prefer for this section to be open only to stage 1V patients or their supporters-as with any other illness, only those who have lived it can really understand-no matter how much empathy may come from other people/friends, etc. But-and I agree, it's a contentious issue. Let's try and look at it from our partner's point of view. If everything which goes wrong  is due to illness or drugs-then it doesn't seem as if the underlying emotional carnage is being dealt with. Granted there will be drugs which cause depression-as will the illness itself-you are actually agreeing with me by saying that the disease will dominate our lives, if we let it-I couldn't agree more, which was the whole point of my contribution. If we choose to be in denial (and/or assuming for example, that chemo will cause depression) strikes me as not facing the issue-and allows the disease another victory. Again, another unpopular concept, isn't it-seeing our lives with cancer as a battle? My main point however was simply not to assume that the illness or the drugs causes all the problems in our lives. Surely there would be a measurable proportion of those diagnosed who would suffer from depression, even if cancer hadn't touched their lives. And our partners have enough to deal with knowing that we have such drastically reduced life expectancy-is it really fair to them to bring every problem we experience back to cancer? Guess this conversation could run indefinitely-but as you said, we have to deal with side effects (or additional problems as the case may be), otherwise we will just get stuck in an ever decreasing circle of hurt and resentment.",

I'm not sure why her docs are surprised-it happens quite often-a few of us here are in similair positions. I'm not sure that a third opinion would be necessary at this point. It sounds like the second onc has the most plausible theory. Why not press on with him-at least until you have the test resuls, when you'll be more able to make a reasoned decision?

It sounds as if your involvement is still quite small-altough I'm surprised that with minimal liver involvement you are feeling pain-I have 3 tumours in my liver, and only have an occasional twinge-although that too is becoming more regular. In short, there is no secret formula as to how we cope. Some will find comfort in their religion, some live in denial, some grasp at the hope that a cure will materialise in time to save us. Whatever works for you-and it may not be the same as works for me. I'm just a stubborn girl, trying to live as long as I can, with as little pain as possible-and causing as little distress as possible to my darling family. It breaks my heart that I won't live to anything like an old age-yet count my blessings that I've made it to my 50s, when I see how many young girls we have with us here. All I can say is try and take a day at a time-and don't worry about what Thursday will bring in the meantime-worrying won't change the outcome.

What bothers me more in your Mum's case, is the fact that the liver became involved.Bone involvement is a much less serious issue, and if the mets are contained in the bones is nowhere near as threatening as organ involvement. So to go from bone alone to organ involevement is a huge jump. In my case I had pleural involvement, so wasn't too surprised that there were other areas of concern. Your Mum might need to ask more direct questions-provided she wants the full picture. Some patients are happier living in denial, or some simply don't assimilate what they are being told. Perhaps at her next consult she could establish how much info she wants-I still am happy limiting the amount of info given (I don't know how many liver mets I have, for example!) I'm not in denial, as I fully understand all teh implications-but for the meantime I don't need to know every last detail-the overall picture suffices.",

Granted, the risk will be much smaller, but please don't think that surgery  would be a guarantee. I think if you persevere, you will convince them-it's just the way the system works in this country! (I'm in Devon-where are you?) In fairness they have to be very, very sure that the decision is the right one for you. If you can remain calm and focused, presenting the same arguments, then they will likley agree. If you have the genetic test done, and if it's positive, you will be able to enlist the help of  a genetic consultant, and that would possibly be enough to tip the balance. I think in fairness to the drs, they are probably not dismissing you as reacting on a whim-it's a huge decision to be made at any age. You're in a very vulnerable place at the moment, and with no evidence of a genetic misprint, and no family support, I feel they are trying to protect you rather than putting obstacles in your way.

On mets disagnosis, this was literally all I could do for four days...and then I decided that however long or short the rest of my life was going to be, I wasn't go to spend it staring at walls. This is not to say that you need to live every day like it's your last (a well meaning frined suggested that I should do so....hmmm, that would be pretty exhausting, don't you think?) But, I aim to get to the end of each day and reflect, \"I've done my best today\". If you don't want to hear what your onc has to say-then ask him not to give you too much information. You don't have to know every detail about your treatment or your prognosis (I've never asked for a prognosis, and doubt that I ever will). Staying rooted in the present is a strategy which works for me-I still plan ahead....just not too far ahead. As Robin said-so much can change so quickly-one day we feel great as we've had good scans-a few weeks later we find we aren't responding any more to the treatment which gave us these good scans... It's an emotional nightmare, and the best you can do is live with it to the best of your ability-and we'll be here to rejoice in the good times you have , and prop you up when the going gets tough. Both scenarios will happen, but for the mantime, it's early days, so concentrate on just taking a day at a time until you feel a little stronger.",
