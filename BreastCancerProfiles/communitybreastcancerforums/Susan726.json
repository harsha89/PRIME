I'm not feeling much fatigue, but I'm taking a day off every week so that I only have to work 4 days in a row. I start feeling tired around 3. A cup of coffee perks me up. My skin is starting to look really sunburned, but it isn't unbearable. It will help having the weekend to recover. I'm trying to keep it exposed while I'm home. Good luck everyone. We can get through this. ",

The last 3 times it has taken less than 10 minutes. I bought a jar of the CVS brand of Aquafor and I use it right after the treatment and at bedtime. I'm also using Tom's of Maine deodorant. I don't feel fresh or clean. I think I'll pick up some baby powder tomorrow and some aloe.",

I ordered a roll through the website with express shipping. I'm trying everything now to get relief - aloe, aquafor, benadryl, aleve, cortisone. The side effects weren't too bad unitl I hit #22. I have 4 more to go.",
