According to the Komen site (I stick with the good, reliable resources and stay away from Dr. Google), having ongoing isolated pain in one area of the breast means seeing the doc.  I have put this thing off for way longer than I should have.  Mainly because I think everything is OK, but lately that little voice in my head has been telling me to get it looked at and to be persistent.  Do you mind if I ask if you're going to get it removed?  Hoping for good results for both of us, as well. Share as much or as little as you'd like.  It feels better to have a person to talk to who really (unfortunately) understands each area of this process. H&P",

      "Content": "Mar 20, 2014 11:44AM - edited Mar 20, 2014 11:45AM by hopeandpeace I was totally going to write about what a big nerd I am in my previous post.  HAAAA!!!  NERDS UNITE!  We love our family game nights, too. Just had one on Tuesday! I have been staying busy here and there.  I own a small biz I run out of my home and have my son to keep me busy, so that's good.  Glad to hear you're staying busy, as well.  Any good books to recommend?  I am reading the Divergent series right now.  It's pretty interesting.  I like to look around Amazon and get good free finds, too.  Love to find an 'undiscovered' author.  I also like cheesy beach reads.  They make the time go by quickly, especially when I'm on the eliptical.  I am a multi-tasker at heart.  Not sure that's good all the time, but it works while I wait. :) Sorry to hear your procedure was canceled. The waiting is a total drag.  Do you have any idea about when they're going to set a new procedure up?  Maybe give them a ring and see where the heck they've been so you can get that lump out of there.  I'm sure it's scary being able to see the lump and all, too.  Let me know when you get something set up again, if you'd like.  I will be an ear to listen while you're waiting. I am creating a world where nothing shows up on my mammo; I am mentally crossing my fingers all will be clear and envisioning the boob squishing folks saying, \"OK, be on your way...see you next year, lady!\"  My lump/cyst is in a really weird spot and it's pretty small, like a little lima bean. And the pain is probably just me overreacting to sensitivity or something.  Not sure why the breast tissue feels so different, but maybe that's just the way they are.  I feel like an idiot sometimes.  That's why I don't want to tell my family.  I don't want to be an alarmist and freak them out.  I wonder if other folks feel this way, too.  I do get worried here and there, but then I think about the chances of it being something bad and it makes me feel better, as statistics are on our side for good results.  I go back and forth, just like I am here.  Worry, then I say there's nothing to worry about...then I worry again, then I tell myself there's nothing to worry about.  I am bananas, I know!  I think that's, along with the waiting, the most exhausting part for me.  How about you?   Thanks again for keeping the lines of communication open.  Having a friendly person to vent to is helping more than you know.  I'm here for you, too.  Vent or scream or cry or laugh!  I'm here. H&P",

      "Content": "Mar 21, 2014 07:49AM - edited Mar 21, 2014 07:50AM by hopeandpeace I have to say, I like that you gave it a formal title \"Lump\".  I think I'll call mine \"PIT-B\" (pain in the boob).   It's amazing how quickly these things show up. Like Lump.  All of a sudden, it just grabs your attention!  Dang it.   Let me know when you get everything scheduled.  Your primary doc sounds like a good advocate.  Glad she's making things happen, too.  The emotional roller coaster is normal.  Keeping yourself busy is good!   I haven't tried Minecraft yet, but I think I may give it a shot.  My son is still too little, I think, but he really surprises me!  He has some serious skills that I didn't have when I was his age...I don't think I have them even now! HAA!!  Let me know what you end up thinking about Mists of Avalon.  I've heard a lot about WWZ.  I'll have to check it out on Kindle. I feel pretty good today, but I also had a great night out with the ladies last night.  Every Thursday is 'Ladies Night'. We all live in the same apartment community so there's no driving.  We drink wine and blab and laugh, so that loosened me up a lot. Laughing for 5 hours does wonders for the noodle.   My husband is off for four days this weekend, so that'll be nice, too.  We'll stay busy and enjoy some weather that's not in the teens.  It's supposed to be a whole 47 degrees today and 34 degrees tomorrow!  WOOHOOO!!!!  That's pretty warm considering the winter we've had.  So, it'll be nice to be out and about.  You have any big plans for the weekend? Hope you have a good day and get some answers.  Write whenever you want!",

My heart drops when I read in this community that someone has gotten diagnosed.  I feel like we follow each other from the beginning and we pray and hope together and when someone receives the news, it does affect each of us, as we're connected through our individual experiences.   Will let you know when I find out more.  I am not too worried because the tech sounded pretty confident that all was fine.  I am running with that.

When I think realistically, I feel pretty good, as I am listening to the statistics and it's just not likely it's anything to worry about.  But, there's always that little voice in my head.  That one has me a bit shaky. Anywho, I wanted to let you know, I am experiencing a similar situation to yours.  I will be thinking lots of positive thoughts for you and your appointment tomorrow, as well. If you need to vent, I am happy to listen.  I have only been talking to the ladies on here about it.  Been keeping it hush hush from my family. Don't want them worrying about it, so I check this a couple of times a day.   I'm around if you need an ear! Sara",
