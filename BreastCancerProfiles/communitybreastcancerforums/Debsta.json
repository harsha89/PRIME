I'm estimating being done on September 20th. I'm lucky in that I was able to schedule my appts for 4:00 everyday (after work), and the hospital is 20 minutes from work, and 10 minutes from home. I finished my chemo on July 5th and had my mapping/tattoo session on July 27th. Yesterday I had my imaging session and as others have said it lasted about an hour. I have a question though, do any of you have to wear a breathing apparatus? My rads are on the left side, and I have to wear a breathing tube (similar to a snorkeling tube) and have my nose blocked during treatments. Per the technicians it lifts my chest wall further away from my heart. They did tell me if I really couldn't take it, there were other options, but both the tech and my dr said it made a big difference. I made it thru the 40 minute session ok, and am really glad the actual treatments will only be about 20 minutes or so. It is soooo uncomfortable though :(.... Good luck to everyone during this part of our journey, I hope we all get thru with minimal SEs Deb",

I've gotten a little pinker, and I have irritation in the crease under my breast. I think this may be due to my stubborness and wearing an underwire for the first 2 weeks - I've stopped now and use the Mepilex pads, which are definitely helping. My nurse if very flexible about creams etc, he gives me a bottle of aloe cream every week, and because of the added irritation he gave me a tube of aquafor to use where needed only. The rads treatments have been going really well, my center has a great team of technicians, the two main ones have a running competition on who is faster :) - which of course doesn't bother me at all.... I've gotten to the point now that I know exactly how long to hold my breath for each zap (they vary slightly)... I've also gotten used to the ABC (Active Breathing Coordinator) Breathing tube,and although its not exactly comfortable, at least I don't have a minor panic attack each time. I've also thought a lot about what will happen after the 19th (my last treatment). It will feel so odd not to have a dr's appointment at some point during a week. Since January, my longest time between appointments has been 2 weeks (after chemo-before radiation)... It will feel nice though to be back to a regular routine and hopefully the fatigue etc will start to fade quickly. Good luck to you all!",

The nurses told me i would only need tylenol, but I ended up using some of my left over pain pills from my lumpectomy. I wondered if the extra pain was due to already having a round of chemo and neulasta? but it's been a week and it is feeling better. I will say though that the pain from the placement is worth it. I worried throughout the week that something was wrong with the port, or that it hadn't healed properly etc, but was reassured that everything looked good when I went for my treatment. I did ask for a prescription for the numbing cream, and put it on an hour before my treatment, and did not feel any pain when they accessed it. Overall I feel pretty blessed that I had limited side effects after round 1. I was a little tired, and was achy on Neulasta day 2. I had a little bit of tenderness and one canker sore in my mouth (but went away after rinsing). My taste buds are off as well, and I find that even though I feel really hungry, I can only eat small portions, which is ok, I just tend to eat less, but more often. I think this strategy has helped keep the nauseau down as well. My hair is starting to fall out now though, but i'm getting it shaved pretty short tonight to eliminate some of the shedding. My husband made a comment about all the hats I've purchased recently (can't help myself, there are so many to choose from)... and my comment back was \"not everyone is lucky enough to wear hats everyday unless they are the queen\" so yes, i'm now comparing myself to royalty and with that Carry On and wishing good thoughts for all of you this week!",

I didn\u2019t expect to need Chemo, my surgeon was pretty certain it wouldn\u2019t be needed, but my medical oncologist and radiation oncologist both felt strongly it was needed. I\u2019ll be going thru 4 AC and 4 T every 2 weeks. Doc told me I didn\u2019t need a port - the nurses said I should get one since all blood draws and ivs need to be in my right arm. I also ended up with a flare and hives from the Adriamycin (it is fine now) but they don\u2019t want a repeat next time. Overall today I\u2019ve felt anxious, even with the adivan. I think it\u2019s more the waiting for things to happen. I did feel really tired when I first got home, took a nap, and then woke up feeling a little dizzy, made myself a smoothie and started to feel better. I did take an anti-nausea pill and considering Pepcid to get rid of the heartburn. Planning on getting to bed early and seeing what day 2 will bring. I\u2019m hoping to feel ok since I have a short paper to write - just 4 more weeks of my class and I get my MBA. Good luck to everyone going thru this journey Deb",

It wasn't too bad getting the IV in my arm, but the flare up was a little frightening, but that does not happen to everyone. Floffy, My first treatment lasted about 4 hours. I had lab work first, waited a 1/2 hour, met with the nurse and my doc for about 1/2 hour, then I went into the \"treatment room\" and picked a seat. It took the nurse about 15 minutes to set up the IV, and then they started a benedryl and steroid drip which took about 1/2 hour. The nurse then suited up and administered the Adriamycin directly into the IV (this took about 20 minutes), and finally they started the Cytoxan drip and saline which took about an hour. Overall I'm feeling ok. I was really tired when I got home on Friday, took an hour nap, and then rested for most of the day. Saturday I felt great, went for a walk, shopping/laundry etc, and then crashed around 6pm. Today has started out a lot slower, my energy level is not great, but I haven't been nauseous at all, just a bit of heartburn in the evenings. And still suffering from hives on my arm, I'm waiting for a call back from the Dr. It just makes me nervous, and want to make sure its nothing serious. ",

      "Content": "Apr 20, 2018 01:22AM - edited Apr 20, 2018 01:23AM by Debsta Hi everyone, just checking in... I'm on round 2 day 7. I think for the most part my symptoms/schedule were the same as round 1, but last night I got hit with my first real bout of nausea. I took my meds immediately and it subsided, but wow, I was just surprised how quickly it turned on. My tastebuds are also very messed up, its amazing how bland everything can taste. My hair is rapidly falling out now, I shaved it down last week took advice to do a #3 on the clipper to reduce some of the head pain - but I don't think it worked. I'm going to use my husband's clippers tonight to bring it down to nothing, as the shedding is driving me nuts. I'm looking forward to being on the upswing now and although it snowed again today, I'm really hoping the weather warms up so I can look forward to my walks. Found this quote today... \"Nothing is impossible, the word itself says 'I'm possible'!\" Audrey Hepburn",

I think I spent most of it waiting for side effects to happen, although for the most part the week went very well. Although my mouth is starting to get a little sore, and I'm noticing a difference in food taste. I had my Neulasta shot on Monday, and I think Wednesday was probably my worst day for this cycle. I just felt really tired, and my body wasn't exactly achy, but just tender when touched (not sure if that makes sense). I was able to work all three days though, I just ended up leaving early on Wednesday and working from home. Today I had my port placed. I'm really relieved that it will reduce the amount of needles in the future. This week I've had 5 total and I'm already done with them, can't imagine how I would feel by the end of the treatments. The port placement was super easy, and a really quick procedure. I was under conscious sedation, so awake throughout, but under enough pain meds throughout. The follow up pain is minimal, only using Tylenol, and I think the worst part of it is the sticky tape they use to cover it. I am considering getting a prescription for the lidocain cream though (not sure if anyone is familiar with it), because the nurse said there could be some discomfort when they access the port each time for the chemo. I'm looking forward to feeling better this week, and my next treatment is on the 12th. I'm getting my hair chopped on the 13th so it doesn't come out in clumps. For the most part, I think I'm ok with it, but I guess I have to be right? Leli, I'm glad everything went well for you today, hopefully you can rest. Prayers and good wishes for everyone starting this week. I'm happy to share my experiences with everyone, it makes it easier to know that I'm not alone during this journey.",
