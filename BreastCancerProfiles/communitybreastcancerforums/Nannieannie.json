I started my chemo on 6/15. Everything was going like clockwork until the 16 when I had my Nulasta injection and back to the surgeon for another drain. She had trouble getting any fluid out and had to find it with an ultrasound. Wednesday I was ok but by Thursday my breast site was swollen and infected. I was running a fever and really sleepy. I slept from 9 pm Wed to late Saturday morning only waking long enough to the bathroom. I was either constipated or had diahrea. I don't know if it was from the infection, chemo or Nulesta. I finally got ahold of the surgeon and got started on antibiotics and have an appointment to see her tomorrow. I am scared to death she is going to put me back in the hospital for IV antibiotics. I am supposed to leave for a weeks vacation on Sunday before I loose my hair. Anyone else had any thing close to this?
