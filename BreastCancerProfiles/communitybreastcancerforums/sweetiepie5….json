I saw where you had an appt. at Parkland Hospital where you live. How did everything go?  I am in Utah and here there is the Utah Cancer Program, and they are wonderful.  I have been able to have my screening mammograms, diagnostic mammograms, and now the biopsy with mammograms, at no cost to me.  This is avaliable to Women 50 and over.  I know how it feels to have money be the main concideration. In fact, when the radiologist that did my diagnostic mammogram asked if I had any questions, I said well, if there is going to be anymore medical care, I am going to have to save up for it, because I don't have insurance, so I didn't want them to order further tests, because I didn't have the money.  He was so nice.  He said that there would be ways to cover the expenses, because the Medical Center did provide for charitable needs. Here are a couple of websites if you might need them, that I found for People in TX.  www.texascancer.info apps:nccd.cdc.gov/dcpc_Programs/default.aspx?NPID=1&PID=60 One more thing I wanted to mention is, that if go through your local health department, this is where you will probably get linked up with the medical services that you need. This is what I did, and I now can use the Utah Cancer Program services. Good Luck to you in your efforts to get the needed medical services.",
