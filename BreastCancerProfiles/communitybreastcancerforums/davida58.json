I have RO appt tomorrow (she wanted to check the rash a week after rad was over with). so will see what she says. I'm still using the aquaphor and, as she suggested, hydrocortisone cream with Aloe in it. Does help with the itching some. But under my breast rash is spreading even more.  Carynbrit I'm also dreading tamoxifen. I see MO this week and have a laundry list of questions for him BEFORE starting tamoxifen. One such question comes to mind is side effect of headaches. I am a migraine sufferer - thankfully those are under control. But some meds trigger them and I am already on soooooo many meds for other conditions I am very reluctant to add another. Especially if it could ignite migraines again. I wasn't able to continue HRT post total hysterectomy (that was 15 yrs ago) because the estrogen ignited migraines terribly (10-15 migraines a month is a LOT)",

No mention was made of any impact on pectorals, but then I didn't think to ask about that part. I was given to understand that they were going to direct the beam as best as possible to minimize or avoid getting lung and heart. I know they have made three adjustments during treatment. I decided to risk it since I was getting preventative Rad rather than treatment rad - and I won't be getting a boost. But it's still scary when my treatments were half done and the tech said the total dose spread out over 16 treatments was 5,000 centigrays. I have no idea if that is considered low dose or high dose. Just sounds like a lot. I do think it's problematic when you feel you can't trust your RO. Can you speak with one of the others about your concerns? There's nothing wrong with doing that. I'd encourage you to do that actually.  ",

I finish my last treatment Monday, Jan 5th 2015. I have had atypical skin reaction that normally is not seen in a 16 treatment patient, from the very first treatment. Last Monday, RO suggested OTC hydrocortisone with aloe. I'd already been using Aquaphor. The steroid cream does seem to help the skin inflammation aspect, but I had to delay using it until after an ACTH stim test. I see RO again on Monday after treatment, so we'll see what she says about the reaction then, which has not alleviated and is actually much worse than it was last Monday.. The skin reaction has spread down below my breast onto abdomen (I was going to write trunk - but I'm not an elephant )...now it looks like someone tatooed red dots all over the treatment area and beyond. Half my armpit is tanned now (that is so funny actually - having half a tanned armpit) Now, those recommended tube tops - I had to ditch those. Affected breast with all the inflammation is um now larger than the other and the tube top was very irritating to me. I switched over instead to camisoles. RO has handled me as though I have scleroderma, even tho I have the cousin AI Sjogrens, so my treatments were spaced (thanks to the holidays) 3 treatments one week, 5 the next, three the next, 4 last week and of course the last this Monday. Initially, a lot of fatigue after treatments. But not after the last few treatments. I actually have gone hyPOthyroid since starting treatment which is weird. And really other than discomfort from the skin reaction, hasn't been that bad really. But I did not do well using the tube tops. Grossly uncomfortable. Maybe I got the wrong kind. But camisoles I found much more comfortable. I'll update after RO and treatment on Monday. The early and persistent skin reaction is disturbing. Other patients I spoke with at cancer center with many more treatments than me had minimal to no skin reactions even with 30+ treatments",

My lumpectomy is coming up this Friday and I am understanding that radiation doesn't start until 3 weeks post op. I'm concerned (who isn't?) as not only is it left breast, Rad Onc has advised it could cause scarring on top of left lung (left breast has the tumor). I already have reactive asthma - PFTs are good but I don't know about maybe ending up with scarring on the lung? And how do they work around the heart? She is aware I have Sjogrens, which is an autoimmune cousin to scleroderma. She basically assured me this some kind of beam radiation therapy? should not be problematic but she did confirm that its contraindicated for connective tissue AI. No dx of scleroderma (not tested for it but I do have connective tissue issues). Anyone with similar issue going thru or is after Radiation Therapy that wouldn't mind sharing the experience? I won't have time this week to call Rad Onc with my questions. Pre-op tomorrow, rest of week tied up with appts errands and surgery Friday. I suppose my real question, which may sound redundant or silly, if the risks outweigh the benefits - i.e. if radiation therapy would cause or exacerbate already existing medical issues (and I have a lot of them unfortunately), resulting in increased diminishing of quality of life - is it worth it? I should say I am also fully disabled with no caregiver. Thanks!! P.S. And yes I will call Rad Onc once I get through my surgery and ask a lot more questions.",

Thus far, my rad onc says the only risk is scarring on top of left lung. Not sure I like that part - but then it's all relative, isn't it? Risk vs benefit. I am supposed to hear from RO this week. Nurse Navigator saw me in hospital and she said RO will be doing 3D rad therapy? Is that better?

So many new faces on my medical team plus the nurse navigators for each part of this journey. Anyway, Stage 1 - Invasive Ductal Adenocarcinoma HER/2 was negative, but ER and PR were positive. I don't quite get the difference between carcinoma or adenocarcinoma. I thought they were both malignant - maybe not? Anyway, even with imaging it's a bit convoluted as to the size of the actual tumor. 7mm is what I was told, but between my finding the lump in the first place, gyn able to palpate it before all the diagnostics were ordered, and even surgeon can palpate this mass/lump that feels the size of a ping pong ball - it's measuring small on imaging. I've lost count of how many times I've had to explain how I found the lump in the first place. Well, duh - my breast has been on and off having weird pain that I'd dismissed as probably some of my other medical issues but when it started having burning zingers - figured I best check it. And voila there was this lump that wasn't there a few months ago. Surgeon recommendation lumpectomy (scheduled for this Friday), plus he will remove for certain a sentinal node and possibly an axillary node. Between all the imaging (diagnostic mammo, ultrasound, MRI w/contrast), different prominent lymph nodes are cropping up. One axillary node was fine needle biopsied via ultrasound guided same time they did core needle biopsy. Only came back \"reactive\", whatever that means. Anyway, recommendations at this point are of course the surgery as stated above, some kind of estrogen receptor blocker med (Unknown which one yet, as I don't see Med Onc until a couple of weeks after surgery) and radiation. Unless something changes via post op pathology, Rad Onc is recommending 13 treatments of some kind of external beam radiation? I am oddly more concerned about the radiation than I am the cancer. Rad Onc is aware I have a diagnosis of Sjogrens which is a cousin autoimmune to scleroderma, RA, etc. This modality of treatment is contraindicated for scleroderma. Never been tested for scleroderma but do have connective tissue issues. I'm also informed this radiation could result in scarring on top of left lung (left breast is the cancer one) and the more I read up on this treatment, it can also affect the heart???? Has anyone who has been through this radiation treatment chime in on their experience (straight up front pluses and munies - not sugar-coated ;) ) Factor in also that I have an extensively complicated medical situation.Â  They didn't do the DNA testing, as I have no first generation relative with breast cancer (that I know of anyway) I'll fret on the Med Onc recommendation when I get there. Lots of questions about that too. How on earth are they going to work around not only my current meds, but my extensive allergies? A couple a friend found that are commonly rx'd to get me started checking on contraindications, etc contain sulfate. I am allergic to sulfate. Do they all have sulfate in them?? I hope not. Would not be fun at all if the risks of treatment outweigh the cancer. Thankfully they are not recommending chemo.Â  Anyway, I guess emotionally it's more bothersome that not another collection of specialists and yet another condition to ad to my list and another surgery??Â  I'll get through next week, then call the nurse navigator for Rad Onc. I have more questions.Â  Thanks for listening Dx 9/23/2014, IDC, Stage IA, Grade 2, 0/1 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Surgery 10/23/2014 Lumpectomy: Left; Lymph node removal: Left, Sentinel Radiation Therapy 12/8/2014 Breast Log in to post a reply",
