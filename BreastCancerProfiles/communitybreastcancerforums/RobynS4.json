My Onc wants me to do the TCHP regimen however I have refused. I prefer the 12 weekly taxol treatments with herceptin for a year as from what I am told this is a much more tolerable treatment. Considering I am 63 years old, I don't feel that I could handle TCHP and all that comes with it. I realize that TCHP is standard of care for this type of BC however, studies have shown that the Taxol/Herceptin regimen is also very effective...to date 98% survival. Has anyone on this forum chosen Taxol/herceptin as opposed to TCHP with the same diagnosis?",
