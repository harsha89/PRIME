Things are going well. Also started Femara on1/1/10 and, again, I feel fine. We are fortunate that our prognosis is positive, but nevertheless, we need to stay on top of it all.  I am glad to have found this thread and already feel a connection. Will share more info another time as it is kind of late right now.",

Not too bad in intensity but I'm concerned how they are going to be when warmer weather comes our way. In one way I want the warm weather (I'm tired of being cold), but in another way I'm a little worried. OK, one day at a time. I'm on the Femara for 1.5 mos now.If this is all I get, I will live with it. I hope everyone is doing all right. Hugs to all. Chris",

No date has been set for my exchange yet, but he says anywhere from 2-3 months. Depends on progress. I'll be glad when that part has passed. One can only take this journey one step at a time. The fills weren't too bad as I only needed 3. Didn't want any Dolly Parton's--I'm a small person. His reply was I have a long way to go to get to that point!  Do you live in the Triangle area?",
