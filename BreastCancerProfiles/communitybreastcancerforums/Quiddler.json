(also eventually a hysterectomy due to massive fibroids.) I was considering a reconstruction (of left) with matching reduction (of right) but have decided against it. A few years ago I had to move almost 700 miles for my job, and so don't have much of a support network down here. I just can't see going through three surgeries requiring general anesthesia on my own. My sister has offered to fly out to help with my hysterectomy post-op, so that will be good. Hardest part for me is waiting: waiting for appointments, waiting for results, waiting for all the phone calls to schedule everything, and now waiting for surgery. Finding a support group is difficult as all the ones associated with my health care provider seem to take place during the day. (Sometimes wonder if cancer patients in North Carolina don't have day jobs...ha!) The stress has affected me to the point that I almost passed out on Saturday. Anyways, 9 more days until Step 1 of many. Just keeping fingers crossed for clean margins, etc etc etc.",

I've been really tired but that can be attributed to (a) getting up at 6 am to go to rads (not a morning person, but better to go before work than call attention to myself by leaving work early every day) and (b) this was also my first week back at work after my hysterectomy, so getting used to being upright all day again. The center where I'm having my rads done has two changing areas for patients. There are four, large lockers in each, with an adjacent cabinet holding gowns to change into. The lockers have keys in them attached to wrist bands so that you can simply slip it on your arms. Each room also has a bottle of lubriderm for patients to use. My scheduled time is 7:40, and there is another patient before me at 7:30. We've both been getting there early, so they've been taking her at 7:20 and me at 7:30. I'm outta there in 10 minutes and able to get to work just a little after 8. (We spoke briefly as we crossed paths and yesterday was treatment 10 for her and 3 for me so she's a week ahead of me.) I've put some of the Radiaplex in a travel-sized bottle in my purse along with a stick of Tom's of Maine deodorant, and just wait to apply both until after my treatment. One note: the nurse who did my 'education' said that I could use regular deodorant. I mentioned that I'd read online that the aluminum in deodorant could interfere with rads, but she said no, not an issue. I'm applying the RadiaPlex 3xday as instructed and taking my usual supplements (collagen, flaxseed oil, calcium, and magnesium citrate). Also bought a Clever (yes, that's the brand name) coffee cone to brew coffee at work.",

Mine are 11 seconds for the first one (machine is over my right breast pointed down to zap me downwards through the left breast). Second zap is 7 seconds (pointed upward from below my left breast) and third zap is 4 seconds from same position as 2nd, but the machine makes a lower-toned sound for this one. I've never asked the techs why the third one sounds different...honestly don't really care. Time on the table is 5-10 minutes in the prone position with my arms over my head. I haven't had any issues with shoulder pain, probably because I started taking yoga classes right around the time I began rads. I told the doctor that Downward Facing Dog was harder on my shoulders than lying on the table. heh. I see the doctor every Monday after treatment, and the tech take new pictures after every 5th treatment to make sure they're still zapping me in the right places. They usually re-do at least 2 or 3 of my 5 markers after one of these sessions. Skin began getting noticeably pink last week. This week there is swelling and the skin is getting red. My left breast can be itchy and tender at times, but overall isn't too bad. I'm putting RadiaPlex lotion on 3-4 x day. No coughing, no throat problems, so that's good. Though, I did switch to a very lightweight bra today to be more comfortable. (It's so lightweight it's practically a cutoff tank top!) I had a lot of nipplage because of this (hee!) but just wore a scarf to try and minimize it a bit. Oh well. My coworkers will just have to deal with that for the next couple of weeks. I haven't seen a bell in the office I'm being treated at, and actually hope there isn't one, because it will be awkward when they tell me to ring it and I say 'no'.",

Thankfully there was no bell to ring, but one of the techs did give me a certificate after I was finished. The fatigue had hit me hard during the past week so I didn't have the energy to be very excited. \"Don't worry,\" I told her, \"I'll be excited tomorrow when I have a chance to get more sleep.\" The RO saw me after last visit just to check out my skin and said it was doing really well. I go back in a month for a follow-up, but he told me to call them if I had any issues in the meantime. He said to continue to use the Radiaplex for another week or two, then switch to cocobutter. Afterwards I drove to my favorite donut place and enjoyed one before heading in to work. The fatigue was so bad that I ended up going home at 2 pm. Haven't had any soreness in my shoulder or incision areas. I attribute that to yoga; started going to classes around the same time I started rads. All the stretching apparently did some good! I've only had one small spot of 'weepiness' in the boost area that just opened up today. I'm going to keep an eye on it but am not too worried about it at the moment. The thing I'm happiest about is getting to sleep later again. I normally wake up around 7 am, but had to reset to 6 am for the radiation treatments. I am NOT a morning person in any sense of the word, so getting to 'sleep in' again for an extra hour is what I a looking forward to the most.",

In fact, I started yoga at the same time as rads and even with all of the stretching movements there was never an issue with the stickies They never itched, and the techs replaced them whenever they started to loosen up. (I made sure to keep an eye on them and let them know if I saw one starting to come off.) Couple of other things I did: shower with my back to the shower head, didn't use extremely hot water, and used a bath sponge to lather up the soap, but then applied just the lather to my torso to prevent rubbing the stickies off. Also be sure to pat yourself dry afterwards, not rub with the towel.",

Based on the initial scans they said they will be doing the 'hold your breath' version during rads. The nurse used paint markers to draw various reference points on my ribs, chest, and breasts while they took the scans, then covered some of them with clear tape/stickers. She explained that they will be using these as reference markers and so I will not need tattoos. Next Tuesday (the 12th) I go back for 1/2 hour 'patient education' session with the nurses followed by a dry-run to make sure everything is set up correctly. Treatments are scheduled to start the following morning on Wednesday, Jan 13th. I will be going M-F at 7:40 am for 5-6 weeks, and will see the RO every Monday after my treatment. That's gonna suck a little, because I am NOT a morning person by any stretch of the imagination, but I chose an early time because it will be less disruptive to simply be able to show up to work at 8:30 every day rather than call attention to myself by leaving at 3:30 for 6 weeks. (None of my coworkers know, and I don't plan on telling them.) Also, I figured I could wait to apply deodorant and lotion in the morning until after my treatment, which will be easier than having to wipe it off before treatment at the end of the day. They gave me a prescription for RadiaPlex lotion that they want me to apply 3 x day. Based upon the recommendations in the message boards I've also already purchased a couple of tank tops, Dove Body Soap, and Tom's of Maine deodorant. I'll probably also get some Aloe Vera and other stuff next week.",
