I have a question about skin; I've read that some chemo drugs can have an effect on skin and actually interact (I hesitate to say destroy) with pre-cancerous lesions.  I didn't think much about it, but I am now actually seeing some skin changes.  Wish I would have taken photos of before and after.  I go to the dermatologist next week for my quarterly visit and will be interested to see what she says.  My skin actually feels better post-chemo.  It would be nice to have one positive SE. Anyone else notice skin changes?",

I haven't told a lot of people about my bc - I didn't care if people knew, just didn't want to make a big deal. I've been much more open here than anywhere else. I finally \"announced\" it on Facebook today, since I'd told my close friends.  Here's how I did it: ______________________ Last month was the \"Post a no-makeup selfie\" campaign for breast cancer awareness. Since I don't wear makeup, I was going to post this photo (made by the grandkids on their iPad). I got sidetracked, and was diagnosed with breast cancer instead. I hesitated to announce this in Facebook, but I would share if I broke my leg or my arm. Breast cancer is nothing to be ashamed of, so I'm putting it out there. The other reason I am sharing is because a special friend posted about her diagnosis on FB, and she was the first one I reached out to when I found out. Thank you, M !!! I am doing really well, so there's no need for panic. Please make sure you keep on top of your check-ups. And, feel free to message me if you have any questions or concerns.   Still not sure this was the right thing to do, but perhaps there is no right or wrong way. ",

About the hives and itching - I've had 3 tx and had bad rash/ itching after each.  Usually stats Day 5 and is mostly concentrated around chest, neck, back area.  Haven't really had any large hives, so it may be different.  Dermatologist gave me a prescription cortisone cream and recommended Aveeno Rash/iItch relief oil that you put in your bath or use in the shower.  These things helped.",

A question - is it common practice to get an introduction to your chemo treatment before it starts?  So far, I've been given a time and date of when to show up, and a print out with possible side effects from Cytoxin and Taxotere.  And a prescription for steroids and anti-nausea meds. Better than nothing, but no info on things like making dental appointments beforehand, laxatives and other meds to have on hand, etc.  No discussion of a port, and so on.  I've learned a lot here, just wondering how it works for the rest of of you as far as pre-chemo info.",

Dr. told me to skip my PM Decadron dose because I didn't sleep last night,  she also said to take it earlier in the afternoon today.   I have zofran and compazine to choose from, but holding off until day 3 or 4 as long as I have no real nausea.   Anybody else have the heartburn, burpy issue?

As for stuff that helps with the chemo SE, there is a lot of info in the Info Thread, but you don't need everything.  Some life savers for me have been - Biotene Tooth Paste and Mouthwash plus kids soft tooth brush - salt and baking soda mouth rinse to supplement the Biotene mouthwash - Prilosec or other OTC antacid (check with your oncologist or nurses) - disposable bottom wipes with aloe  :) - sennecot and colace in case you get constipated This stuff, along with the meds given by the doctor, have made life bearable so far. ",

I made a couple of insensitive comments to friends who were helping me sort through early stages of my diagnosis.  Makes me cringe now, but also helps me to realize how someone unfamiliar could easily say the wrong thing.  Doesn't excuse the just rude comments like \"how long do you have?\" or \"what did you do to get breast cancer?\" ... Timbuktu - I don't wear makeup and don't intend to.  People can take me as I am - or not. I like Brigadoon's comeback and Footballnut's idea of the Kiss makeup.",

With frequent precautionary trips to the bathroom. Picture Husband coming in the house and announcing, \"we have a broken water pipe, had to shut off all water to the house.\"  We are now hoping to get a plumber out Sunday, but who knows?  Until then, we will have to haul buckets of water in from the swamp to facilitate flushing.  My luck, I'll get eaten by an alligator.

Timbuktu - it's so unfair that you have to go through this.  Whatever you decide, I hope you demand to talk to your MO and have her explain her cryptic comments, and have her tell you what she's going to do about easing your mind.  The worst part of this whole experience (at least for me) was all the unknown at the beginning.  Your MO seems to be continuously putting you through this all over again - even if she means well. Adding, Congrats on No. 10, Jaimieh.  Hey, at least you are beautiful with no hair!",

I do think it's definitely an effect from the chemo drugs and the overall situation, and you are not crazy. For example - I haven't shed a tear over diagnosis or treatment (feel very lucky how it's all turned out so far).  BUT, I find myself crying when the heroine gets the guy in a silly romance novel.  I knew something wasn't quite right when I started tearing up because a couple got their dream house on Property Brothers.  So, either I am just a batsh!t old lady, or these drugs are affecting emotions ...",

This update is coming to you from the Chair, as I finish up my Cytoxan.  So far, so good. I don't have a port, so it took two tries to get the IV in - not so much a vein issue as perhaps a user issue.  But the second one is working fine.   Started with saline, the decadron and aloxi, then taxotare for an hour.  More saline and then the cytoxin. So far no bad reactions.  Nurses are very nice.  Pretty basic infusion center - no snacks, drinks, or ice so I will know to bring my own next time. No plans for neulasta shot, just told to monitor temp and other side effects.  Everyone has a different experience, so I guess this is one more anecdotal data point.  We will see how the next week goes.",

Footballnut - I woke up with a clammy head.  I still have quite a bit of hair on the back of my head which is also weird. Lilyrose - good luck clearing up your UTI. Mompv - I've never given myself a shot, but would learn to do so for the savings in $ and miles. Or maybe you have a neighbor or friend who can help you?",

Zapped 3 areas with liquid nitrogen, and sent me off with a prescription for a steroid cream in case itching gets worse.  Also recommended keeping well moisturized with something like Aveeno. So far I seem to be avoiding issues from being in the neutropenic zone - which reminds me of hydroponic - which reminds me of bodies floating in suspension like in the movie Coma.  Maybe I haven't avoided issues after all ...

After suffering with this (and it is painful) after my first tx, I started with ducolax and sennecot the day before chemo, and continued for 4-5 days after.  It helped a lot.  At first, I went too far and the fun D got me.  But, one dose of Imodium sorted me out.  I know it's different for everyone, but I do think we have to be willing to take more meds than ever - sucks, doesn't it? Hope you feel better soon.",

Your positive attitude is amazing. MJ - welcome.  This is the place to vent.  Hoping things improve for you. Congrats on your last chemo today, Cold!!! Lilyrose - I hear you on the fatigue and weird nail feeling ... Life is so odd these days. Brigadoon - thinking of you as you await your scans, and also picturing you frolicking with two Great Dane puppies. Longisland - I like that: there is no room for drama!",

I guess I should make a 6 month follow up visit with my surgeon (although I can't recall if he said 6 months or a year).  ",
