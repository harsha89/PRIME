I was blessed with a great physical therapist who basically spent a year helping me with stretches and exercises that significantly improved my range of motion. I would encourage you to try that in addition to the medical marijuana. I am a federal employee, therefore cannot take that, but that would be my choice over any other pain med. It's natural with less side affects. Best of luck in your recovery. Keep trying to gently stretch every day and massage the areas as well.",
