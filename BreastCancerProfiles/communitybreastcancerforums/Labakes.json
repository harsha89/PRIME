I didn't have the best experience with the hospital where I had my operation and chemo lots of mistakes made and the way I was dealt with and talked to has left me with little faith and respect for them departments in the hospital. I had my last treatment at another hospital which was lovely and lots of understanding health care workers that made me feel like a person and not just another number. I have been seen at the hospital which I had my first lot of treatment first time around when I had cancer last time but a different surgeon,im currently recovering from a breast reduction and lump removed,my next step in treatment is chemo and I had requested to go to a different hospital for this treatment and was refused this by my surgeon because she doesn't like dealing with this particular hospital and told if I need radio again then it will be again not the hospital of my choice. this has made me feel very angry as I feel that I should be able to make this choice myself and know from my last experience how much better my care was at my requested hospital,plus they are a hospital with more specialist people that deal with cancer patients. at the moment as well I'm unsure if I want to put my body through chemo I'm worried about the health effects in the future that I will have if I have chemo a second time round. is there anyone I can chat to that has been in a similar postionn to me. feeling very alone,confused and unsure if I should get second op on my care and how to go about it.  Log in to post a reply",
