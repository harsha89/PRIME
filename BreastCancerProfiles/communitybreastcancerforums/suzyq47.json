My sister just turned 50 on March 2, and then spent 13 days in the hospital recovering from the side effects of Xeloda, while we were hoping for a miracle that she could continue taking the very drug that made her so sick (because we knew it really works and could maybe prolong her life).

I ask onc about doing a liver bio also, he said it wasn't necessary at this time. The onc we went to for a second opinion had said the only difference in her treatment plan is that he would have done a liver bio, repeat tumor markers, and he pushes the limits on giving chemo at a lower rates when other Dr. wait for levels to recover. Our second opinion onc is at a research hospital in a bigger hospital where as our local onc is more cautious about lowering the counts to much. I take comfort in the fact that they are working together, since they have 2 different opinions, but still worry that an agressive cancer needs aggressive treatment. Our local onc is cautious about her physical and mental ability to handle the treatments since she is handicapped. I hope that the chemo works this time, it is scary to think of the outcome if her tumors continue to grow out of control for another 3 months.... praying for the best..and hoping for remission.. for everyone that this diease affects. I have two girls, so I worry that I may pass the BC gene onto to them, since my sister was dx before 50.",

She lives and hr away with my oldest brother, 82 year old dad, and mom  who has dementia.

We started using Bag Balm (and it has helped her hands alot, they don't hurt, but they looked like they have been scalded and the skin peeled off). Our biggest concern now is diarrhea and vomiting even with compazine and anti-diarr meds so we tried Zofran today, for 2 doses, but she almost fainted and was shivering.So we held her PM dose of Xeloda and will take her to see ONC tomorrow, we hope he stops for a couple days and then lowers the dose, she weighs about 115 so we are  hoping if they lower the dose she can still take it. We really want her to continue on this if possible. She has done great on Ixempra no SE, Xeloda was going really well until starting the 3rd set of 14 day treatment. Her hair has even grown back and is about 1/2 long now. Today was her 50th birthday, even though she couldn't enjoy her ice cream cake or eat anything, she had a great day. Hopefully tomorrow the onc can come up with a plan to save her treatment of Xeloda. She does have to have a port put in and time to heal before her next chemo infusion on March 16, so we hope things improve and she can get good news on her PET Scan after 2 more Ixempra infusions. God Bless you, keep fighting, thank you for always being there !!! You are all amazing people!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

My sister had her 4th Ixempra infusion on 2-23-11, and we started Xeloda for her 3rd round of 3000 mg a day, but only finished 8 days out of 14. The diarr, vomiting, and hand and foot syndrome were to much, by 3-3-11 she was admitted to the hospital for severe dehydration; low counts, low bp; nausea and vomiting. We endured a 13 day stay before she was released, I had to stay with her 24/7 because she had to have someone sitting by her side the whole time, except for 2 nights when my sister in law stayed with her. At one point she had 19 bouts of diarr in 1 day ..next day was 9.... it took alot of meds and trial and error to control all the medical issues.  It was surreal to see how bad and how long it took for her to recover from Xeloda side effects.We were really hoping she could take it and let it do it's magic, but it was to much for her. She did receive the Sub Q Port while she was an inpatient, since her veins where blowing in her right hand and her left hand was still trying to recover from Ixempra chemo burn! So the last month has sucked for her !!! I know Xeloda is a great chemo drug, and really wish she could have continued on it, but due to many factors, the side effects got out of control very quickly. So I hope that by posting our experience, Xeloda users will make sure, they call their Onc, as soon as diarr or vomiting occurs, and stop taking Xeloda until side effects go away, we tried to treat the side effects and continue Xeloda .... that didn't work for my sister... hind sight ...we should stopped Xeloda as soon as she was throwing up and had diarr at the same time, and I also recommend Ativan (for nasuea ) and to never take compazine which caused major hand tremors that lasted for days !!!!!  Now we have to face a PET Scan in a couple months and are praying that the hell she went threw from Xeloda at least helped her mets and Onc will have to come up with another drug to use??? ",

Fighting BC is bad enough let alone the nightmare of protecting her from medical mistakes as well. I agree with the other post that suggest you try and find a new local onc and have the long distance onc consult on treatments. I have a handicapped sister that is being treated in a small cancer center (that only has 2 cancer Dr.'s) but we took her to WVU Hospital in Morgantown (2 hours away) and met with the top cancer onc there and  the onc consult on her case by phone. We are fortunate that my sisters local onc is excellent, but we still needed that second opinion.  Best wishes to you both, I pray that you find a new Onc that you can trust and a treatment that works with great success!",

So she has seen some important, but some areas are a lot worse. So the onc is reviewing with her consultant physician to determine which chemo drugs to try next. So they sent us home today, and we wait until next Tuesday to start a new drug therapy. My sister's breast cancer dx of stage IV is a result of not doing routine mammograms. We can kick ourselves over and over, but we are another statistic proving the need for yearly exams. She looks an acts perfectly healthily, but has so much going on inside. So now we wait a week for a new plan and pray that this plan works on all the tumors.",

Today was day 14 on Xeloda, since her counts are down he said skip the last evening dose this evening. Onc started her on antibiotic because of  WBC is down as a precaution, but my sister says that she still feels really good, except she is tired. We thank God for that blessing. My sister is HER2 neg., and Estrogen receptor pos, I may have posted those wrong in the beginning-- if I did I will try to correct them. I really hope and pray that you ladies stay strong and live well, I pray for all of my sisters on here! God bless you all.",
