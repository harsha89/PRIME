I am starting to feel more normal now almost two weeks out. Day 17 and haven't lost my hair yet but I can tell it will happen soon. My hair is very dry like a plant that hasn't been watered only a matter of time before it \"releases\" . I guess I am in denial haven't gotten a wig they couldn't fit my for one because I have too much hair and it looked very weird when I tried it on. I got very hyper from the steroids they give you so the day before and the day after I was actually cleaning my closets and selling things on ebay! DId this happen to anyone else? Next time I will definitely have the cut the dose! What goes up of course must come down and I crashed pretty hard day 4 and 5. Couldn't get out of bed and then sleeping hours during the day and still at night for a while. I also had horrible constipation and my IBS came back with a vengence which I will not elaborate on but I had bad cramps and didn't want to eat for a while. Protein drinks got me through until I started to eat bland things like toast and cereal with rice milk. Now I am feeling better have been running when I can and seem to do well especially if I sneak a nap in the middle of the day",
