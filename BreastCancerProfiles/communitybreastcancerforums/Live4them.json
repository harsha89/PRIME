I only ask because I also have IDC and Invasive lobular carcinoma , but clean margins and also clean nodes and since I had a masectomy they told me no radiation. I go to the oncologist on Monday and my BS thinks he probably won't recommend chemo either... What should I ask when I go? I have already decided I want that oncotype DX test done ... But are there at her things I should have them look at before sending me on my way with no chemo or radiation? That is what I'm worried about üòÅ I'm. Not sure if you ladies had lumpectomies or mastectomies I guess that would make difference also ... Wish we all had a crystal ball !",

At 1 week post op I would take my Vicodin ( I don't tolerate Percocet well ) in the morning and late at night for bedtime , through out the day I would take regular extra strength Tylenol 2 of them or Motirin 800 mg .. I varied depending if the pain was tightness ( Motrin ) sharp pains I would take Tylenol.. But don't allow the pain to get to bad , maybe cut the oxcodone in half if you don't want the full amount .. If you're in pain you won't be moving around and stretching as much and I think it'll cause more pain at the end .. Again I'm not a doctor just speaking from my experience .. You'll feel so much better when they start removing your drains . And lucky you for having home health and a fab husband. Hope your feeling better with each passing day",

I had just sold my house in Florida in Aug and had moved to NC in a vacation home we had up there . I was ready to start my life in my mountains .... I came down to Florida for a vacation with my kids and decided to get my mammogram done ( I was late by a few months ) and then bingo !! Diagnosed with BC .. So the hubby and I decided to stay in Florida for surgery and any follow ups. So I had to rent an apartment furnished and feel so NOT AT HOME ... Have been trying to nest to make me feel calmer but it's not working ... Just want this surgery behind me , am also curious as to how quick I will recover . Luckily I'm not working now ! I will be praying for all of us!",

He really is so relaxed and calming . He told me this was not an infection ( although he told me to continue taking the clinadmyacin since I had started it ) he says its normal healing process just like a bad scrape when you hurt yourself. It's the layers of skin coming off and of course it's oozing lower layers of skin until the final layer will remain . He didn't tell me if my areola tissue will be smaller or not at this point I could care less lol .. I just want to stop feeling like a character from the walking dead with flesh falling off lol. I did get my second drain removed and honestly I feel so liberated I ran to shower without all my contraptions .  Mominator I hope you're feeling well after your procedure !!!! TallnTerrific thank you for the excercise hints . I think my back has been hurting so bad from walking with such bad posture .
