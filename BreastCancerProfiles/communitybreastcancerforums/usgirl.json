    "Content": "usgirl wrote: Last week my Mom was called back from her screening mammogram for architectural distortion. On the spot images the distortion persisted and didn\u2019t press out. We proceded with ultrasound and their was a small area with distortion and a little shadowing. We saw a breast surgeon who biopsied the area. We were suppose to go in the morning for results but the office just called my mom and told her to call before she comes to make sure they have the reports because they have not received them yet. The waiting and worrying is killing me. I am an ultrasound tech and do breast imaging daily, this has made the wait and worrying immensely greater for me. I have saw way to many breast cancers and know way to much for this situation. The area is so questionable and thats what makes it so much worse, it could be cancer or it could just be her tissue. We do have a family history of breast cancer which makes me worry even more Log in to post a reply",
