I will be starting Taxotere, carboplatin, herceptin at the end of August.    Ninjamom:  Why did they switch you off of  TCH?  What do you mean it didn't work very well?  And the proverbial question... did you loose your hair?  So not looking forward to that.   And what is the \"cold cap\" tx?  Wonder if it would work for the TCH protocol?I will ask tomorrow.

Just had a radical mastectomy with latissimus dorsi reconstruction.  Results show ErPr+ and Her2 Nu +.  All lymph nodes were clean!  Is there anyone around my age that has this? I was wondering if you had to have chemo. My surgeon said I would but is waiting for 3 weeks after surgery to refer me to a oncologist.  I didn't know what type of chemo they will recommend?  I have 2 young kids and no family in the area.  Questioning if I had to have to hard stuff or mild???
