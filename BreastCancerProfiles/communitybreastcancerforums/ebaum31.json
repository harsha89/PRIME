Today while I was rubbing the upper, outer part of my breast I noticed a deep, hard, bb sized lump and the area it's at hurts. I had my sister feel just to double check. I've already had a breast biopsy on my right breast in 2005 which was normal. My grandma (mom's side) found a lump when she was in her 30's and never went to the doctor, the cancer eventually spread and she died from breast, lung, and bone cancer. My mom says go to the Doctor, my husband says I'm being a wimp. Is this something I should be worried about? It's at the upper part of my breast by the armpit. Log in to post a reply",
