Was negative, which obviously is good news.  This last biopsy, while painful was not has horrible as some others I've had, but I still have a cold dread of having yet another.  Therefore, I am still considering the mastectomy option, and not (as Twiddles thinks) just because of ADH.  I know that is a benign finding.   But after all this \"high-risk\" monitoring, all I have left is a very small, badly beaten, scarred and very painful breast. Since my other breast is fine, and this biopsy was negative, I am having some second thoughts about having a bilateral, since they tell me I should since the risk factor in each breast is equal and it makes reconstruction easier for them to \"match\".  Mine don't match anyway, so I don't really care about the latter reason. It's always the one side that has problems (9 biopsies on one side, 1 on the other).  Anyone have a bunch of biopsies (say >5)  and finally ended up with a diagnosis of BC?  I know the risk stuff is lifetime, but the idea of doing this every 6 months for the rest of my life is just awful.  For those of you who had prophylactic mastectomies - how much screening do you have to have after it's done, and has anyone had to have a biopsy AFTER the surgery? ",
