I underwent manual pumping with the PT 2times a week for 6 weeks.  I know how to do the manual draining myself.  My surgeon advised that I wear a compression sleeve when I work out and when I fly.  I've been fortunate in being able to manage and had a 3 month check up with my PT last month and my left arm is only 2% larger than my right (vs 14% the 1st measurement and 7% after 6 weeks of pt). I feel somewhat positive but am also aware that I'm still very much in the early stage of this LE stuff.  I see my surgeon on the 18th for the first time since January and am looking forward to/interested in if she changes her view.  I do not have any pain associated with this, so far.   The prior posts surprisingly validates that the surgeons really don't have a full understanding of LE.  Thank goodness for all of the PTs out there. ",
