I figure you all will be in a better position to know the answer to this question.  I'm wondering what drain output measurement the docs look for to determine when the drain can be removed?  Tomorrow I'll be 7 days out from my MX with TE.  I have one drain that I notice has slowed substantially in the last 24 hours, so much so that it really only needs looking after once a day.  I'm not scheduled to see my surgeon until Thursday, but I wonder if my reduced drain output might make me eligible to have it removed before then.  I'd LOVE to get rid of this thing sooner than later!",

Best of luck to all of you recovering from, and undergoing surgery.  Here\u2019s to a speedy recovery, with excellent pain management tools.  Good luck, and thanks for sharing any words of wisdom that come to mind!",

So inspiring to read all your posts.  Hope I can be so optimistic and strong when the time comes.  Best of luck to you all.",
