She said I should go ahead and get a baseline mammogram now instead of waiting until 35. There was one lump she focused on on the upper left breast. She gave me the sheet with the number to call and make an appointment. I can't get in until the 10th of March. Should I be worried? The lump is hard, slightly rolling feel to it (moves back and forth), long oval shaped. Pain in my breasts comes and goes. It doesn't hurt all the time.  Log in to post a reply",
