I'm not sure exactly how I feel about all of this, I do know that I have cried and screamed and even gotten angry. Well all of you that have gone through this it makes me feel really crappy that I sat in my bathroom floor crying and screaming \"WHY ME, IT'S NOT FAIR\" I am sure that all of you have felt the same way. Its very hard to talk to my family about all of this, its as though they really don't seem to understand the seriousness of the whole BC situtation. The doctors have told me that it is Stage 1 IDC, Grade 3, 0/3 nodes, ER-/PR- and its aggresive. They wanted me to take part in a clinical trial of a medication that they are trying to get FDA approved for breast cancer, but I already feel so overwhelmed with what they are going to give me as treatments already that I decided not to do the trial. Is that a mistake? I want to do whatever it takes to get a better assurance of the cancer not returning, but I am scared all at the same time. Over the next 5 months I will have 16 treatments, they are telling me that the first two months will be the hardest because of the strength of the treatment they are giving to me. But that the last 12 weeks won't be as bad. I really don't know what to think about all of this, they tell me to join a support group, but I am not usually very good with crowds of people that I don't know.",
