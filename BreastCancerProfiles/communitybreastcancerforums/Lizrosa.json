Clear margins 25 mm tumour Grade 3 No nodes affected. ER + pr - Her2 - I am now waiting to see the oncologist. My surgeon told me that definitely I will be offered chemo, rads and hormone therapy . Please can you assure me with an answer to this question. Is my cancer gone and all that is left is to \"mopup\" the mess and ensure with these preventive treatments that reoccurace will be less and if any microscopic cells have escaped into the blood stream,they will be eradicted with the chemo? My husband is jumping up and down for joy saying its the best result we could of received in this horrible situation . However for me the journey is just beginning and I am still so scared that there is some still in there and I have to hurry up and mopup given the grade of the cancer. If any microscopic cells escaped into the blood stream and because the are grade 3 , will they grow really fast and do i have to take fast action with the chemo treatment now. Would love any advice.
