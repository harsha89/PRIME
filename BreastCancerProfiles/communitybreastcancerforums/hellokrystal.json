She was stage 3C and we were so glad it wasn't stage 4. In this beginning of this year of 2017, however, my family began to get worried when my mom began to complain that one of her feet felt numb. The numbness just wouldn't go away. After a month or two trying to get answers, and not to mention, my mom's balance deteriorating, we finally were able to get an MRI to see what was going on. By the time that happened, my mom needed assistance when she walked. It went from numbness, to falling down and losing balance occasionally on her own, to needing complete assistance. She was then officially diagnosed with Stage 4 breast cancer, which metastasized to her liver, lungs, bones (her upper spine), and a tumor in her head which is believed to be the cause of her losing her balance. Fortunately, she just has a few spots (about 1 or 2) in her liver and lungs, it seems that there is quite a bit on her back, however. I am only 19, and the youngest of 3. My brother and sister are already married and have their own families, and so sometimes I feel like if anything happens to my mom, I will be the one that will suffer the most since I am so close to my mom and am constantly with her. I was wondering if there were any women out there with a similar situation? Or perhaps any long term survivors that can bring me hope? Thank you so much anything helps!!! Log in to post a reply",
