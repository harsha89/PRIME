It could be a rash from something and now your probably touching it too much. Have your mom take a look. Maybe you need a dermatologist who can tell you if it's a skin issue. If not see your GP to write you a script for some imaging tests. But I bet it's nothing",

If your confused in any way( although I have to admit I'm blown away by the information that some of these women provide! Some more than others you can tell have done their research and are VERY informative) but don't be shy, reach back out to the radiologist and ask him to explain things in a simple way that you can understand. This is new to you and you are scared I have been bringing my boyfriend to my appointments incase there is something beyond simple they need to explain. He is much more calmer, and I know I'm too nervous in the moment to really hear what they are saying. I THINK birads one is no findings. And birads two is benign. I hope someone else chimes in here for you. But don't be scared to ask the radiologist or surgeon again. Maybe have someone else listen in as well keep us posted.",

Everything is done perfectly and cleaned on shift. This and cleaning my house are the only times I am focused and can pay attention! I NEED to be on my feet an very busy physically. So, am I ADD? I don't know? I'm trying to find out. So I'm not by any means knocking or judging ADD. That's just how I feel. PLEASE! I wish you all only the best health!!!!

I didn't know it was a warning sign... Then I decided to look it up. I'm glad I did. Because it got me to the doctor. That wait was a week. Mammo was already done. Negative with heterogeneous dense tissue. Very common for us women in our 40's. But makes things more difficult to see. Then I waited another two weeks for ultra sound. Again. Negative. Nothing. She even went over the area again and again. Still my GP always advises to see a specialist. A second set of eyes looking things over and I don't know... Maybe more testing or hopefully a benign explanation. We shall see. The good thing is you are doing everything I a single day! I'm a little more calm now. But I get it. I couldn't eat sleep think or function. I can tell you this... STAY OFF GOOGLE! You don't know what type of info you are getting. It could be unreliable or out dated. It will only scare you. Remember most women that write about their anomalies are diagnosed. The benign situations don't tend to stick around to write about them. Although there are several women on this site with benign indents. It could be a benign tumor, a cyst(which is known to be painful), a fibrodenoma and there is a woman in here with a dent from ductal estasia. It can be an array of things. You will only know through testing and a good breast specialist. I will be thinking of you! Stay calm and stay off the internet",
