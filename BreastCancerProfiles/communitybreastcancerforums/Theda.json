My story: I am 36, found a lump last summer, had a mammo in September, very small dense breast, they missed it and just noted a lot of micro-calcifications in both breasts. I didn't follow up until the lump grew a lot ( 3 cm) till January when I mentioned it to my gyn who sent me to a breast specialist. An ultrasound was followed by a core biopsy that showed fibrosis, adenosis and multifocal atypical hyperplasia. Before going for an excisional biopsy, my doctor asked for further immunohistochemistry testing. Results were inconclusive and resection of the entire lump was recommended. Doc decided on a quadrantectomy(removing 1/4 of the breast) with clear margins, so he would not have to go back in in case the results are DCIS. Pathology results were again inconclusive (by then I was banging my head on the wall), and now I am waiting for the immuno results again. Basically, pathology says it seems to be only ADH but they are not 100% sure and the multi-focal part (3 different spots) seems not to be so good. After doing my research, I realized that I may not be in the best position : under 45, multifocal ADH, micro-calcifications in both breasts. The good news : no cancer history in the family, at all. I am healing from the surgery, at least the doc did an awesome job and after warning me the results could be ugly, he went in through the nipple and did an immediate reconstruction. Looks almost as good as new :) Now, the questions: if it was DCIS, they would have seen it in the biopsy of the lump? The inconclusive results make me crazy because no black or white here. Now I am thinking of all the options, the constant monitoring, the Tamoxifen and the drastic option, double mastectomy. I really agree with the ticking bomb metaphore, ADH is a limbo, not cancer but not normal either.",
