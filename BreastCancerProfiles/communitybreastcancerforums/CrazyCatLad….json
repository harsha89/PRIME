I finished Monday.  Now I just want to hibernate.  All I seem to do is put Xclair on my boob.  It is better today--Wed. I have never been through an experience like this before and hope to never again.  I am so tired. Good luck and HUGS to all.  Verna",

I did.  I think we will be going along about the same pace.  I hope you don't have to wait as long as I do.  I wait from 30 to 1hr and 45 min for my treatments, this is after I drive for an hour to get to the rad.  I don't know about ya'll, but I've lost count fo the number of people who have seen my boobs.  I no longer have any sense of modesty. Our dressing room is out of order, so I just go in, hop on the table and wait to get zapped. Let me know.  Verna.................Arkansas",
