It was a bunch of big words that were on the report but from what I gathered it read about a solid or simple cyst possible subacous cyst and I have two options... To try antibiotics and follow up with ultrasound to see if it treats it or to go ahead with an excisional biopsy to be sure it's not cancerous... I'm trying the antibiotics but still worried",

He said if for some reason it gets bigger then of course we'd go ahead and remove it... He said if I were older and had family history of bc then he'd be wanting a biopsy more but I'm young and chances of bc are highly unlikely... Then of course he throws it at me that it's always my choice if I want it removed because since we are trying to get pregnant my hormones could make it grow and cause issues with stressing while pregnant...",

I think it's benign whatever it may be the only doubts that I have is that it doesn't have a \"head\" that I've seen on sebaceous cysts where the junk builds up and that I can also pinch the skin on top of the lump... I feel if it was a cysts due to build up that you wouldn't be able to pinch the skin on it and that the lump would be RIGHT there... I've picked up a copy of my ultrasound report today and this is what it says",

He said since I'll be ttc and breastfeeding he worries it could become painful so would like it removed before I get pregnant that will ease ny mind",
