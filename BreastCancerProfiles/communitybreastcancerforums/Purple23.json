The surgeon said he is pretty sure this will be benign based on the mammogram, but they are being over cautious because of my cancer history. The tech showed me my mammogram films too. They showed a lot of scattered calcificatons, and one grouping which is where they took the biopsy. Because of the holiday I won't get my results back for a week!",

      "Content": "Purple23 wrote: Hi all I am new to the forum. I had my first mammogram 7 years ago at age 36. My doctor had ordered because my grandmother had breastcancer (but she was diagnosed in her 90s and ended up dying from unrelated pneumonia at age 104). So I thought I didn't really need the mammogram so young but had it anyway. I'm not really sure what the findings were but it was recommended I come back for another mammogram in 6 months. My primary doctor didn't seem very concerned. I remember her saying it could have just been dust on the machine. When the imaging center called me back in six months I was pregnant, so I cancelled the appt. Long story short, I stupidly blew off having another mammogram for 7 years- until last week. Stupid I know. I'm now 43 years old. I had vulva cancer last year- that was a small spot surgically removed and no other treatment needed. I am seeing a gun oncologist every 3 months. I have a new doctor now and she scheduled me for a diagnostic mammogram. After that last week I was called back for another mammogram because there were micro calcification groupings. Today after the second mammogram the radiologist told me it was indetermanate calcifications and they scheduled a biopsy for Dec 30. I feel like an idiot for putting off my health for so long. I'm so nervous about the results of the biopsy. I know most of them end up benign but since I had the vulva cancer last year I am extra worried. I have had 2 PET scans this year for the other cancer, both were clear. Log in to post a reply",
