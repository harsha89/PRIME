The worst part BY FAR was being in the hospital getting poked and prodded and monitored every 10 minutes. Now that I'm home I'm starting to feel human again. I have 4 tubes and 2 pumps. PS will remove a tube from each side and the pumps next Monday. Then I'll only have one tube on each side left. Yay! Hoping the worst is behind me. Although I can't imagine it will feel good to have those tubes pulled out. Anyone with experience that can share?",

I'm not looking forward to the procedure, but certainly looking forward to getting these out! I do have a little leakage of one tube on the white bra they have me in. I wonder if that's normal.

I found out they were giving me Zofran for nausea (the anaesthesiologist said MX surgery is more succeptible to nausea for some reason) and Zofran actually gives me horrible headaches, which made me nauseous, which was a horrible cycle! Once I got home and off the Zofran it's actually totally tolerable. The drain tubes are a huge hassle, but should get two removed and the two pumps removed Monday so I'll only have 2 tubes left to deal with. Phew! We got this ladies. We aren't the first to go it and if the women before us can do it and thrive - so can we!!",

And I hadn't had a cold even. My doctor ordered a chest X-ray, then I had my echo (which was scheduled due to herceptin anyway) then a CT on my abdomen and chest. All came back negative! (I told them they should change that word for those of us that aren't in the medical field and are hoping for \"positive\" results.) At the end of the day we think the changes in hormones (tamoxafin) might have wreaked havoc on my body causing a feeling of shortness of breath and at some point I just got inside my own head and it probably became anxiety related. Just thought I'd share since it was so terrifying but in the end, all was well and my breathing is back to normal. Hoping for the same relief for you!",

I'm freaking out because I understand this is a form of neuropathy and it's so early in treatment that if I continue it will only get worse and be permanent. I can't find much on facial neuropathy.

My oncologist and her nurse, very experienced, have never had a patient experience this form of neuropathy! Unfortunately she asked me to sit this week's Taxol out. Pretty devastating for me. If it doesn't get worse, we'll resume next week at a reduced dose (85%) for the remaining 10 infusions. Lonestar: sorry about all your symptoms! It's great you got 10 treatments under your belt - I'm hoping for that myself. Did your doctor ever try reducing your dose to see if the SE's were lessened? Maya: did your face numbness go away between those first three treatments? It's so weird but mine isn't getting any better and it's the area all the way around my mouth - my chin, the skin between my nose and upper lip, and my cheeks all the way up to my cheek bones. Today is day 8 with it. If it even lessened a bit I'd feel better about it. Was your doctor worried about it? Did they suggest that it could get worse or be permanent? It's so encouraging that you experienced it early on too, and that it went away!! Thanks again for all the responses. It helps to know I'm not alone with such a rare SE",

I did resume treatment at 85%, after postponing the third dose by one week. The numbness hadn't gotten better, but it hadn't gotten any worse either. I have now completed my 9th treatment, and the facial numbness is nearly completely resolved. I would say there is some residual numbness, residual in that I would probably never have noticed it if I wasn't paying so much attention to my face. However, at this point it's all a head game and it could be completely resolved and I just THINK it's still a little numb. Who knows. Either way, I can now feel my sons face when he rubs it against my cheek! Yay!! That's all. Just good news.",

My nurse said something about maybe reducing amount and I'm worried about that because I want to hit this with everything I have. So yours didn't get worse with each treatment? Did you get the finger/toe neuropathy at the same time? No signs of tat yet for me. I'm on the Glutamine powder but haven't taken any B6 yet. Will definitely start that. Did your doc say anything about changing your course of treatment from it",
