When it came back positive, it was a very difficult decision to remove \"perfectly healthy\" breasts. After surgery, lab results showed cancer had begun to form in my left breast. If not for the \"perfectly healthy\" decision, we would be having a different discussion right now. I think genetic testing is confusing and only you can make the right decision for yourself - but I'm thankful every day I made the one I did",
