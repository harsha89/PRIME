Lost my hair, get bone cramps, reflux and tiredness, sore mouth, but for the most part in last about seven days and it is tolerable.  I also get the neulasta shot.  If it can kick cancer butt, I am willing to put up with it. It sucked losing my hair, but looking at the big picture made it easier to deal with. Good luck to you. ",
