      "Content": "mom2kk2001 wrote: I had my first mammogram on June 26, called back for a biopsy on the left side for a suspicious lump and for a second mammogram on the right for a group of calcifications. The lump freaked me out, particularly when I was laying there and they were measuring it...it just became so real. So I was sooooo relieved when they told me it was a cyst, but would watch it closely. Then the bomb--the calcifications, which I wasn't worried about, are suspicious for malignancy, BIRADS 4, have to have a stereotactic biopsy. I am having it and a galactography this friday the 14th. I know the percentage is on my side, but that is not all to my story. About a month and a half ago, I had genetic testing, which I tested positive for the MSH6 gene and was diagnosed with Lynch Syndrome. (My mom is currently undergoing treatment for Stage III ovarian cancer). For those who don't know what this means, essentially I have a higher rate of cancer occurrence in my colon, digestive system, uterus and ovaries. So testing positive means a whole host of tests at 41--colonoscopy, pelvic ultrasounds, endoscopy, etc. So we threw in the mammogram, \"just to be safe\". I was prepared for the other stuff, well sort of, but not for this at all. My pelvic ultrasound I had around the same time revealed a problematic complex cyst so I am scheduled to have my ovaries removed on the 8th of August (had a hysterectomy a couple years ago). So right now, I have to get ready for all that entails--at best a surgery and recovery, at worst, a cancer diagnosis, plus I have to go through a endoscopy and colonoscopy in 2 weeks. Like I said, I know the odds are in my favor, 80% being benign, but I just feel like I opened Pandora's box and no matter what I do, I am just waiting for \"what's next?\" This biopsy has me so I am crying, telling myself not to worry, crying more, completely not able to concentrate, moody, you name it.....I have a great support system, I really do, but they just don't understand that even though there is a good chance it is benign, there is STILL a part of me that says \"what if\". If the biopsy comes back positive for something, then I am dealing with that AND ovarian issues AND digestive issues. I know in my head that things will all work out the way they are supposed to and one day I will likely look back on this and say, wow, that was tough, but I got through it, but my emotions are all over the place. I guess I am just looking for support, it seems like friday will never get here and I am a mess. I am trying to take it day by day, but it is hard. I know you have all been here in some way and I am hoping that being here will help since you can relate. Log in to post a reply",

I am so all over the place right now, it is difficult to know where to turn. Two more days until the biopsy. I will definitely keep you posted. I just really appreciate the support here, just really appreciate it.",

I know I can do this, I am not alone and I can do this. The nurse that will be working with me on friday called a bit ago to go over instructions and how the procedure will work. That actually was calming because for me, the unknown is the worst. I need to be able to plan ahead and account for the outcome. I have just been so taken aback by all this that I can wrap my head around what I will do if it isn't benign and that scares the bejeezies out of me. With the ovaries, I had a little time to process that, go over it in my head, develop a plan, but with this, I am just not there yet. I will keep you updated as things progress. Thank you again.",
