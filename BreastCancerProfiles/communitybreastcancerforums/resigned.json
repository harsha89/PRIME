But then they told other people and now everyone in our small town seems to know. Everyone says \"i can't believe YOU of all people have cancer!\" because I'm so healthy. I'm so tired of people I haven't told trying to talk to me about it. I don't want to talk about it I just want to deal with it and I'm the only person who has to do that so just leave me alone! That's pretty much my feeling right now. I think you should be very careful who you tell. Tell them if you want them to keep it to themselves otherwise everyone will know. ",

      "Content": "Sep 12, 2014 09:16AM - edited Sep 12, 2014 09:20AM by resigned I'm pretty new here and I guess I just want to vent. I spent time after my diagnosis exploring all my options and as much as I hate it I'm going to have to do surgery and chemo. I hoped that I would be able to use alternative therapies, I even switched doctors but they both said the same thing that without chemo my odds are not great. I'll use natural therapies to help me deal with the chemo. Here's what frustrates me, my new doctor made it sound like the couple of months I've spent figuring things out were a mistake. He said that if he'd been my first doctor, he would have insisted on the mastectomy and node removal immediately. The first appointment I could get including the plastic surgeon is in late October. Now I'm more than scared than ever. Anybody else go several months after diagnosis before starting treatment? ",

Many of you have similar stats to me but started treatment right away. I just felt like the doctors were using scare tactics to rush me into a decision to make it easier to fill their schedule and I really didn't like the first few doctors I met. I'm hoping to schedule surgery in the next several weeks after I meet with my plastic surgeon at the end fo the month. ",

I guess some people could say I'm being selfish for taking these past four months to look at the alternative route first. My mother won't stop implying how selfish I'm being. She says if I really loved my daughter I'd have done the surgery and chemo in July like the first oncologist wanted. I just didn't want to be pressured into something that i don't believe in. I don't automatically view these doctors as gods with all the answers. I know my body better than they do and i believe in natural treatments. But now that i've agreed to surgery and chemo I guess it's time. I appreciate all the feedback. ",
