Everyone keeps asking me why I did not have them both taken off the first time. If I knew that this was going to happen again, I would have. I am also thinking of having my ovaries out. My mom died of ovarian cancer. People think that I am crazy for wanting everything done at once! I will see the BS next week, so I will see what she says. I am wondering how long to be off work. I am a nurse and work in the hospital. I am thinking 8-10 weeks, giving me 2 weeks off for when I get the final implants and TE removed.",

You need to feel comfortable with your team. I had to jump through hoops and see military MD and then say I wanted second opinion. They would have been my \"if I have to\" doctors. I really like my new team. I also am very anxious abt upcoming surgery....Oct 11th..  D",
