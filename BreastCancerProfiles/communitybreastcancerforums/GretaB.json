In this manner you can monitor the functioning and catch any problem at the start which should give you peace of mind. I was on Zometa for over 4 years and was switched to Aredia which is supposadly kinder to the kidneys, My kidney problem was exacerbated due to high blood pressure so it is hard to be sure Zometa was at fault. I am not medically trained however I have read that some medical people including my nephrologist believe that the length of time used to infuse Zometa, usually 20 to 30 minutes is more the problem than the drug itself. Aredia, an older medication, is infused for a 2 hour period. Greta",

They recommended reducing the frequency the Aredia and going to every six months to avoid further kidney damage. So I guess it is a balancing act - solve one problem and another crops up! Greta",
