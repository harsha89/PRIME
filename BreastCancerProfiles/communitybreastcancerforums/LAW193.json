I was a little dizzy after but probably from all the deep breaths that I had to redo because they were either too deep or not deep enough (to keep my heart out of the way - my radiation is on the left). Maybe I will get it right by the end. They can see where my heart is the whole time so they can shut off the beam if I accidentally unhold my breath while I'm supposed to be holding it.

It is a higher dose but not fully double, so the overall amount of radiation is actually slightly smaller with the shorter period which leads to fewer side effects. The side effects are cumulative and seem to have more to do with how much radiation you've had total than how much you have per day -I felt nothing at all the first week. I finished on Friday and by the time I finished I was slightly red, slightly itchy, and the skin is a little sensitive. I've been getting pangs in the scar area but maybe that's still from the surgery, I don't know.

Now that I am done it looks pretty red with some dark spots that I guess were freckles I didn't know I had. I shaved under my arm for the first time in a month and found a weird birthmark type of mark that definitely was not there before radiation so that was a little weird. It is still itchy and the skin is still sensitive especially around the nipple. But all in all it isn't too bad and I definitely am happy with my lumpectomy/radiation decision over the mastectomy. I don't think my breast is any smaller (from radiation) which is one thing I was worried about. Unless that takes time to show (I do still have fluid from surgery).",

I had something on my right side that they thought looked benign but because the left was malignant, they wanted a biopsy. Also the first surgeon I went to wanted me to get an MRI, so I did, and that gave them two more things to biopsy. So this morning I had two MRI biopsies on the left and one ultrasound biopsy on the right and now I'm sitting around with ice packs. I was hoping to just do a lumpectomy but it really will depend on the results from today. Anyway I came on here mostly to try and find out if I really had to go off my birth control because I wasn't happy about that, so I clicked on this 30s forum to see if anyone had talked about it. But since it's a newish thread, I thought I would introduce myself.",

I am 34 at diagnosis but I tested negative for the full panel of possible genes so it isn't genetic unless it's a gene mutation they don't know about yet. I think only like 10% of the time breast cancer is genetic",
