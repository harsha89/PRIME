It's a radial scar/hyperplasia which I never heard of til now, and I as I understand it, the surgery is to make sure no cancerous cells are hiding in there. Consultation is scheduled with the surgeon. Thanks for the support ladies!",

I think going in for these tests makes everything seem like a bigger deal and produces anxiety just by going to them.  I'm so sorry about what you are going through. Of course I give my best wishes that you will be surprised and it will turn out benign, but if not, best wishes for your journey through this.  ",

      "Content": "blueberry89 wrote: Hi everyone! I'm just trying to relieve a little anxiety.. I had my yearly physical in late May & the nurse practitioner found a small lump on the bottom left of my left breast. It hurt when she pressed on it. It made me think and realize I had been getting pain in that breast lately but just didn't think anything of it. She had me wait to see if it would go away at a different part of my menstrual cycle. It didn't, and I had an ultrasound on July 6th. The radiologist ended up having me do a mammogram as well, on the spot. I haven't been told much about what it looks like-he just said the tissue looks different than the tissue around it.The breast specialist talked to me afterward and said it was highly unlikely to be cancerous but it was best to be sure. I wish I had thought to ask if she said that because of the way it appeared or because of my age ( 28). So I went in for the biopsy this morning and it went smoothly-the doctor was great but she told me she couldn't tell anything until the biopsy results were ready. But my arms have felt weak all day! Now the waiting begins. I wasn't too nervous at first, but then again I went in for my ultrasound honestly thinking I'd be told I had a cyst and then sent on my way. I'm still not freaking out, but there is an odd sort of feeling there. I'm just hoping to get insight as to what this painful lump is even if it's not the ultimate worst thing. I also read online that most cancerous breast lumps are painless so that was another reason I wasn't very worried..but now that the test has been done and it's all become real, I'm just anxious to get that phone call and (hopefully) move on from all this!

I was so happy to hear it was benign, but yesterday my primary care RN called to catch up and this time she used the word \"precancerous\". Not a word I like to hear. I won't be skipping the self breast exams anymore, that's for sure. I'm hoping against hope that once this excision is over, I won't have any more breast issues in a long, long time. =\\",
