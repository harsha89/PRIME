The surgeon's opinion may be based on that, combined with his experience.\" Yes, this is the type of information I was wondering about.  \"Perhaps the surgeon is concerned that because you are so very optimistic that the findings are going to be benign, that if indeed, a malignancy is found, you will find it especially difficult to absorb and to be able to cope. So even though he was a bit abrupt, he has planted a seed in your mind, that you might indeed have BC.\" This also crossed my mind.",

Last week they gave me a tube of Aquaphor which I'm to use at bedtime. So I guess I'm fortunate, tho' not expecting to escape completely unscathed. I missed an early November appt. with my medical oncologist (chemo brain I guess\u2014must not have written it into my appt. book) who I won't see till next week. My main complaint has to do with my post chemo condition\u2014still have little taste ability, and despite a course and then doubling of gabapentin my neuropathy in fingers and toes continues. The tastebud thing has enabled me to lose another 5 lbs.\u2014that's a total of 25 lbs. well gone. Don't know whether I actually want the taste problem resolved or not, 'cause I could easily use to lose another 20! But it does make it hard for my husband as I have very little enthusiasm for planning or cooking dinner. So, no complaints yet about rads.",

I'm just beginning to settle in to the idea that my condition is not going to be as cut and dried as I had imagined. Now all I want to do is get on with it. I am now holding my breath regarding the results of the MRI which I'm having today (Thu). Come to think of it, I guess holding my breath is good practice for that test.",
