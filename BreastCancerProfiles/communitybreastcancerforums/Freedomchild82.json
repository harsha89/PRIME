I came in because I was sick with several different things and am still here because of very high liver enzymes as well as extremely high levels of Iron. I have no clue what either of those mean but the liver doctor and oncologist seem very concerned about it. I wrote about being in the hospital the last two entries of my personal blog... if you are interested in reading it. I am a little bit frustrated by all this since I have only had 1 Chemo treatment and was told today they can't give me another until they get both the liver and Iron labs into normal numbers. :-/ If the Chemo caused this they will have to change Chemos and it's just to early to already have to scratch two Chemo treatments off the list. I am staying positive but I have to admit I am concerned. Anyone else get high liver enzymes or high iron after first dose of Chemo? Here is my blog link if you want to read about it.

I was diagnosed as Invasive ductal.. grade 3.. spread to lymph nodes. After a bone Scan, MRI and pet Scan, they called it stage 4 spread to the bones. I don't get the official biopsy of the bone until Tuesday the 29th but they are 99% sure it's in the bone because of those 3 test results... I start Chemo on the 31st. It's been a long month. I am scared, mad and just in shock. I started a website and blog right away when diagnosed because I want to document the journey for others but sometimes feel I can't fully express my feelings there because my family reads it and I don't want to upset them.
