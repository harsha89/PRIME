So he sent me over to the imaging center to have a core needle biopsy done.  And while they were doing that......they did a fine needle aspiration of the lymph node too.   I'm in some pain right now....which he said I would be simply because of the areas that he biopsied.  I took something for pain....so I'm gonna lay down.   Oh yea....ya know how the other surgeon said I had lobular?  This surgeons says it is UNLIKELY that it is lobular.  He said and I quote \"I don't CARE which kind of cancer it is......we need to get started with the treatmens because you have gone long enough without anything being done\"   And after we get the biopsy back we will KNOW for sure WHICH kind it is.  He seemed very concerned and was also aggravated because the other surgeon had me playing the waiting game. So that's where it stands right now........naptime for me!   lol Hugs to you.......love you all The 11th Commandment.......THOU SHALT LAUGH........F.R.O.G!
