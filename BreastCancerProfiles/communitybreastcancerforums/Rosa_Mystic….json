Similar to the poster above, I have a scar and a small indent in my breast as a result of the surgery. This is right next to my armput.   Overall, I am very pleased with my surgeon's work.  As for how the breast feels, I've noticed that I've gone through stages of healing - in the weeks following surgery the area felt hard, and later it felt like there was tissue missing - this feeling is somewhat hard to explain in words but it was a noticeable feeling. However, in the past month I've noticed that my breast is starting to feel more like it was prior to the excisional surgery.  I still get occasional pain in the area, but it is manageable.   If I can offer some advice, given that you're young and concerned about breast appearance I'd recommend you see a breast surgeon to remove the fibroadenomas, instead of a general surgeon. Breast surgeons do this type of surgery all the time and the cosmetic outcome is likely to be better. If this means traveling a farther distance than your local hospital to get the surgery done I would try to do that.  ",
