So ensure that you do your homework on the plastic surgeon. Ask to see a portfolio. Ask him for references if it makes you feel better but do your homework and find one that is reputable and able to supply you with what you request. Contact the breast cancer society near you and ask for the name of a plastic surgeon who can help. Interview several before you final decide which one you want to do the job. I had a second surgeon change the implants for the 3rd time and he put in the wrong ones so after a year i am still looking for another reputable surgeon and will only trust other breast cancer survivors or the society when choosing one now",
