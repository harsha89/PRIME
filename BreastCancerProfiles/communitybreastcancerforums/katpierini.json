I was so pessimistic and almost certain that it was cancer and that it had spread everywhere. I had pain in my ribs, shoulders and groin lymph nodes. I was so very luck to be benign and I wish you the same. Should you not be, this is the place to be. I am still coming here, to remind myself how many women are dealing with this and how great the support is. Hugs",
