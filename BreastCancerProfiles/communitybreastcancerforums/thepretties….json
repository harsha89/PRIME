The only infusion I DIDN'T drive myself to was the first one, because no one knew how I was going to react to the myriad of drugs that would be used! I had Benadryl in each of my 15 infusions, and if I can offer you one bit of advice: TAKE THE NAP!! I didn't fight it while I was hooked up, and it was the most wonderful 3 hour nap! By the time I was ready to be flushed, I was wide awake from the steroids! In my particular chemo \"cocktail\", I was given Tagamet and Benadryl via IV, and a push of Aloxi, which is an anti-nausea medication. I also had a prescription for Emend, which I took one hour prior to my appointment and one each day after for the next two days. I had prescriptions for Zofran and phenergan to combat any nausea afterward, but I didn't ever have any. Don't look at chemo as poison. Look at it as medicine that's working hard to make you well! Get friendly with your oncology nurses. I think that the average length of time for infusions is around 3-3 1/2 hours, plus any exam you might have. When you get home, do yourself a favor and rest, if your body is telling you to. You'll recover so much better if you don't fight yourself! Good Luck! Robin ",

I finished 4 FAC and 12 Taxol mid Feb and I wanted to tell you all some things that you cannot buy that will help you get through chemo.  Positive attitude is EVERYTHING. SMILE!! Yes, you may feel nauseous...that's why your onc gave you prescriptions for Emend (take it!), Zofran (take it!) and Phenergan (take it!) to GET AHEAD of any potential nausea. Don't think of chemo as \"poison\"...think of it as \"medicine\". Make friends with those that are sitting next to you while you're getting your infusion...Make friends with the onc nurses, too!  It makes the time go by faster.  Don't be afraid to speak up if something feels funky. Don't be afraid to ask for an anti-depressant or an anti-anxiety medication to help you get through it...you're human. Everyone will react (or not) to treatment differently. Not everyone will lose their hair or have their fingernails/toenails turning black and fall off.  Remember that you're still beautiful, even though your hair is falling out in clumps, your brows and lashes fall out, your bones hurt, and your sense of taste has taken a six month vacation.  We are amazing creatures, ladies. Every week, we get potentially lethal doses of toxic chemicals pumped into our bodies, and we are still standing, walking, loving, and fighting!! YOU CAN DO THIS!!! Remember that the ones that really understand what you're going through, the women (and men) you meet HERE will be the ones you go to on a daily basis. Lean on them. Love them. Pray with and for them. They are your sisters. Find a church, and if you have one, let them know that you have breast cancer. The support that will flow out of there will astonish you. Pray.  Sing. Accept help when it's offered. Say \"No\" if you can't do something...and know that it's ok. Don't wallow in self pity...it's not pretty, and it won't get you anywhere! You're in for the fight of your life...you are going to beat this beast, and come out on top!  Remind yourself every day, in the mirror, in your car...I AM A WARRIOR!! Breathe it. LIVE it.  Know that we're all here for you, to pray with you, cry with you, love you, and kick you in the panties when you're feeling sorry for yourself. All you need to do is reach out. We'll be there. Loving each of you... Robin",
