To my surprise, she's totally fine and is rockin it, which in turn has given me more confidence. As for scalp tenderness, it was quite painful, which I did not expect, for a couple days.

MY MO who I saw yesterday said I should just go with the implants as recovery is easier and put the DEIP out of my mind. Has anyone on here been faced with the same decision?  ",

Also to take a Clariton the day before as well and continue to take after. SO far I have my days for chemo treatments booked every two weeks with a visit in between to check my WBC. I have read on other threads about cold mittens. Does anyone have an idea what that's about? Thanks - Sherrie",
