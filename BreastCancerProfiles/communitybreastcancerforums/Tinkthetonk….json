I also ordered a tee shirt and hoodie that had inner pockets to hold the drain tubes. I also liked Amoena camisoles (with inner pockets) that had a zipper up the front, it was soft and kept me warm. I've followed the exercises listed in the booklet I was given and have my full range of motion back. On those first days though, I appreciated hoodies and shirts with buttons, as I wasn't reaching very high or stretching too far. I've been told to wait until after radiation, at least six months or a year before getting reconstruction. I'm currently liking the flat look and don't pay any attention to the looks I receive. I could change my mind about reconstruction, I do worry about foreign objects in my body and am not sure I want more surgery. I really hope your surgery goes well, feel free to message me directly.",

As long as you're stripping the drain you should be fine and when you have your follow up appointment with your doctor, you will probably get the tube removed. I can totally relate to the blob hanging under your arm. I even asked my doctor if she'd remove that surplus under my arm, but claimed it wasn't breast tissue and was \"just how your body is made up.\" I don't know if I fully believe that, but maybe during reconstruction the blob can be adapted into the breast area. I try to tell myself I have a swimmer's back, so I won't feel mad about my body.",
