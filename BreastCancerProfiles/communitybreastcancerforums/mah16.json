Two weeks after my annual GYN appt. I thought it might have been from shaving and I figured it would go away. Even then I did note that there was no redness and I had no nicks or ingrown hairs that would usually happen. The lump got a little bigger over the next few weeks and I began to experience a shooting pain into the side of my right breast. The lump itself does not hurt. I had my routine mammogram scheduled in the beginning of January so I mentioned to the lump to the technician. By this time I had developed quite a bit of swelling in my armpit as well. The technician had the radiologist review my mammogram right there and I was told that the lump did not appear to be part of the breast tissue but I should have it looked at by my GP. I went to the GP two weeks ago and was given antibiotics as a \"just-in-case\" and a blood test to check for infection. The blood test was normal and I am done with the antibitics and there is absolutely no change in the lump or swelling - or the shooting pain into my breast. The doc didn't think it was a lymph node and asked me several times if my gyn had done a thorough breast exam at my last appointment. I have a follow up in two weeks but I am getting pretty nervous about this. I am closing in on my 40th birthday, my aunt and maternal grandmother both had breast cancer. I am trying to remain calm about this but these past few weeks I have also been getting more tired than usual and am not able to exercise nearly as much as I had a few months ago - I get exhausted after my shorter workouts and end up with a sore throat and cold/flu-like feeling for the following 24hrs. I just feel like I am dragging. Is this something that could be breast cancer or am I worried for nothing? Log in to post a reply",
