I've had two separate opinions from doctors on what's going on... according to ultrasound and mammogram I have multifocal disease that shows 3 well differentiated tumors with a calcification behind the nipple. (I noticed the lumps as more of an all over thickening than a lump). Both doctors agree I need a mastectomy so I'm doing that for sure, but what I'm struggling with is one doctor thinks the three lumps/calcification are actually one cancer. This would make the cancer larger than I originally thought. They other doctor feels like it is 3 cancers that are all related. Does anyone have experience with this? It would just make a difference in the stage of my cancer (a stage 1 or2 vs a stage 3)",

I was diagnosed Monday with invasive ductal carcinoma. It is only in my left breast, but it is multifocal (3 tumors) all around the same size of 1.6 cm... the largest measurment was figured on ultrasound and it was a 1.9x1.4cm . My bone scan is clear and my CT shows no enlarged lymph nodes... wondering what all of this means. It seems good to me, but I am nervous the cancer is there and we just can't see it. Does anyone have any idea what my course of treatment will be like after a mastectomy? I'm trying to prepare myself so I will know what to expect.  Due to there being 3 tumors the surgeon told me mastectomy is pretty much the only option. He gave me the choice of having the single mastectomy or a double. I'm feeling like maybe the double is the best thing to do? I just have no idea...  I'm only 31 and the dr.'s have told me I have greater chance of developing cancer the the other breast because every year my risk increases more because of what they have found already. Any advice at all would be greatly appreciated.  Dx 3/17/2014, IDC, 1cm, Stage II, Grade 2, 1/23 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Surgery 3/31/2014 Mastectomy: Left, Right; Reconstruction (left): Latissimus dorsi flap, Tissue expander placement; Reconstruction (right): Latissimus dorsi flap, Tissue expander placement Surgery 4/7/2014 Lymph node removal: Left, Underarm/Axillary Log in to post a reply",

It has only been a week since I was told I had cancer and I feel like its been so much longer than that. I can't believe all of the decisions I'm having to make and the opinions of doctors for the most part have been the same, but it's just hard to make final decisions. I feel good about my choice though and I really appreciate all of your support and advice. My husband and I have 3 little boys so I feel so grateful that I was already able to nurse my babies. My heart goes out to all of you and I can now say I truly understand how hard this process it. Please keep the advice coming. What to expect after surgery for those who have had a double mastectomy and what to expect going into chemo. xoxo",
