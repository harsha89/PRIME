I need to call the imaging center and get a copy of my report but I haven't gotten to it yet. I live 5 hours from the hospital so trying to figure out next steps (without knowing anything yet) is driving me crazy!! One foot in front of the other, right?? It's good to hear that your biopsy sites don't hurt today!Â ",
