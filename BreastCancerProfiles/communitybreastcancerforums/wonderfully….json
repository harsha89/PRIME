There are many types of breast infections and other breast conditions that can cause your symptoms that are not cancer, as flash stated. I am very happy to know that you are getting check out soon so that you can be treated and know what you are dealing with. It is still likely to be a b9 breast condition, so take a deep breathe and work throught the process! More ((HUGS)) to you!!!",

I will be celebrating the first anniversary of the non for profit that I co founded for mommies with kiddos who are affected by autism Friday night and I pray to have much more to celebrate as well. Regardless of the outcome I trust that God will give me abundant strength to get through this season of worry. When my mom, dad, and gma passed away this summer within just 12 sort weeks of oneanother, I felt tired and emotionally spent at times, yet He continued to sustain me through every moment of trial and wiped every tear. I gained an amazing percpective on life and cherish each and every moment now. It is amazing how much we can learn through suffering if we chose to allow it. I feel I am a better person having suffered through cancer with them all. If I am forced to battle the beast, I know He will give me armor, and you all will suit up with me! I will be praying for you tomorrow and will check in! xoxoxox",

I am 36 and am waiting for my biopsy results that will be in on Wed. Because of my intense family history of bc in both my mom and gma, along with my dad's pancreatic cancer and my younger brother's stuggle with colon cancer, my risk of developing bc or ovarian cancer is over 30% even without the gene. I will also know if I am brca + wed as well. I can tell you that if the pathology even shows precancerous cells, or if the gene is +. I will be having a double mx. I just rather not go through the endless cycle of sweating it out every six months as I waiting for my mri results. I personally dont want to keep having biopsy after biopsy because every abnormality will be taken very seriously with my risk factors. Also, my gma had a lumpectomy at 55 when the found a small 8mm mass. It was IDC but had not advanced stage 1. She had two reoccurences that later became bone and lung mets. She chose to use breast conservation measures. All of that said, I do also believe that this is such a very personal decision and the right answer is what YOU feel is right for you! Find a specialist that can help you gather information that will lead you to make an informed decision. I have done that and feel very supported that my decision will be carried out and supported. Also, having lost my mom, dad, and grandmother to cancer, I have felt the pain of losing a loved one to cancer and want to pass along my dearest symapthy to you for the loss of your husband! May God grant you the peace of mind and insight you so need as you go through this journey of discovery. Remember that 80% of these masses come back b9. B9 thoughts for you!",

I have my biopsies scheduled this Friday. I lost both of my parents to cancer within a week of oneanother and had the pleasure of overseeing their hospice and caring for them until they were called home. I must say, I have no experience battling cancer personally, but know how to face struggles head on. I am a mother of two little boys with autism. I think the word journey is very appropriate for this disease. At least that what I witnessed with my mom. Some days she seemed low, in a valley, at times the road seemed bumpy, and other times smooth going. Sometimes it appeared as she was struggling to get up hill and others she was just cruising along. Like all journeys they lead somewhere and each path will be unique for you! You decide what path to take! I see you have found some strong loving and supportive ladies on here and am sure you have many in your life as well. Go ahead and flopped your butt into bed and cry. I certainly would do the same if I were in your shoes. I would also be tempted to slap the next person for you! I am not sure where this journey will lead me. Mom said she learned so much about how to live through her suffering. I can say that I certainly learned a ton! I do know that already my journey has been full of many blessings. I have now a community of lovely ladies that support me:) Truly. I pray that God sustain you with strength and surround you with loving supportive people while you take this journey! Bless you!",

I am 37 and have two small boys and just had a very similar issue but I have a high risk. I will let you know that I was freaking out but found comfort here and my lump turned out to be a fibroadenoma, b9!! Most of these things are b9. Imaging is not very reliable at our young age so push for all of it! I am thrilled to know that you have an appointment to get going on the diagnosis of this lump! Check in and let us know how you are doing while in this time of discovery. We are all here for you and have been right where you are right now. Please take time to enjoy those hotwheels and spongebob with your little guy, whatever it is will still be there, so why not still play! Easier said than done, I know but try! Hugs!!!",

Planned Parent Hood has knowledgable nurse practitioners that can examine you and get tests going for you. You can contact susan g komen from your home and they will have some solutions for you as well. What city are you in? I can help research if you feel comfortable disclosing that info. It is so very hard to manage your own care when all of your loved ones need you. My dad, mom, and gma all died within twelve week of another this summer of cancer and I have two boys with autism, believe me I know where you are! There is a ton of help out there. This will be ok. Oooh, you can contact the local health department and disclose your concern and see if there is a program to help. Many research hospital have financial aid for treatment and screening as well...one step at a time. You need a doc to examine and order imaging first. hugs!!!",

Because of my family history of breast cancer, colon cancer, and pancreatic cancer, and symptoms, she sent me for a mammo the same day! I am 36 with two young boys with autism. My health care general is neglected for their's is so very intense! I was asked to have an ultrasound to look at a spot. The birads4 as well. I went on to see a genetic counselor and am waiting for my BRCA report. While waiting for that, went to see breast surgeon and he sent me for a breast mri. This took a week to get the insurance company to pay for it. I have very dense breasts and the images are just not clear. I have a mass, calcifications, and thickening tissue on my left breast. I went back to see him on Monday. He scheduled a core needle biopsy and punch biopsy for this Friday, but I had to reschedule because my youngest son has surgery the same day. I will be having my biospies on the 25th. Sending you prayers of healing and grace to keep you calm through this!",

I have my biopsies scheduled for this Friday morning and will be seeing the team for pathology reports on Wed morning. I feel good knowing that they already have the followup scheduled! I keep using a positive affirmation, 80% are b9...805 are b9. My screen name is wonderfully made because of two reasons...Psalms 139 says that we are! Also my mother, rest in peace, said to me when I had just realized that I was a mother of not just one son with autism , but two, \" Carrie, my real name, they are both wonderfuly made, they are absolutely perfect, the way God intented, and their exceptionalities are a gift to them and you that indeed will give your life more purpose than you ever imagined.\" She was absolutely right! As she was dying this June at 61, she reminded me, \" Don't forget, yu too, are Wonderfully made!\" Whatever the outcome maybe, I know that this too is an experience that I will learn from and will share my knowledge gain throught this journey to hopefully bless others. I will be praying for you Julie, that you are blessed with serenity as you anxiously wait for your results. Keep us posted! B9 thoughts to you!",

Reading these last few posts brings me much hope my biopsies will prove to be that of b9 tissue. I have the same birad rating and have two biopsies scheduled for this Friday. I have a mass that is hard to characterize due to my dense tissue and a thickening on MRI that may or may not be that of fribroglandular tissue. It is asymmetrical with focal density that is low grade persistant. Pray to God it isn't ILC! My mom's was and she passed at 61 this year. Your story bring me much hope. Thanks for sharing! Carrie",

This journey started feb 8th for me. I am so trying to remain patient, but I find it so very had. You, my darling, will be in my thoughts and prayers.
