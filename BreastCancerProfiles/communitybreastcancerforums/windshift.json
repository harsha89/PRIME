My suregeon told me it would take 4-5 days to get the biopsy results but actually the biopsy was performed on a Thursday and I didn't receive his call until the following Wednesday afternoon.   Prior to the biopsy the surgeon seemed to downplay the whole thing but I wonder if it was to quell my fears.  My advice to you is to keep yourself busy until you get the results - the more free time I had the more I'd tend to obsess about it.  Good luck, we'll all keep our fingers crossed for you.",

I had #11 today and am now 1/3 through with the process. I have just started getting a little redness, oddly enough it seemed to occur directly after today's session (either that or I'm just not that observant). My Rad Onc gave me several small tubes of Aquafor and said a \"little goes a long way.\" She said that the 2 tiny tubes could probably last through the remainder of the rads.  I find that if I put in on while damp it seems to work pretty well. (It actually makes a pretty nice handcream.) Q - Does anyone still have a Seroma, and if so have you been told that you will probably need an additional Sim?  Also, I'm almost embarrassed to admit it but  I don't really understand the bra thing. I have been wearing my regular bra which is not an underwire but should I expect to have a problem with it.",
