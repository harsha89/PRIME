It was so reassuring to read the above comments and know definitively that not only am I not alone, but that there are many folks out there who have been given a similar choice and chose to go without the chemo.  That has been the biggest struggle for me...trying to determine if my fear of the unknown (what if I don't take chemo and it comes back?) outweighs the benefits of not having chemo. Clearly it is a personal decision for everyone.  I really think my decision now is to participate in the research or not--and give up the final choice in the matter of whether to do chemo or not. Anyway...mostly I just wanted to say thanks to those who have gone through this and shared their experience.  It has been very helpful. Jolene",
