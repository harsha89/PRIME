I am scheduled to start chemo on Thurs Apr 25. Meeting with oncologist tomorrow - does that mean this is my \"chemo class?\" Still haven't settled on a regimen -- choices are AC x 4 + Taxol X 4 every two weeks, AC x 4 + Taxotere x4 every 3 weeks, CT every 3 weeks, or ACT (my onco says if I do this, she \"won't want me out of her sight.\") Will know much more tomorrow. Options are mind-boggling and are costing me some sleep.",
