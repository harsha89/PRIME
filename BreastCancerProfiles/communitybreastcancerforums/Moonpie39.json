Then the MRI showed another tumor in the same breast which was close to my chest wall. Waiting on the surgery was the hardest part. Originally I had viewed a mastectomy as the \"lopping off\" of a breast but the more I investigated the more I came to see it as removal of breast tissue. I currently have tissue expanders in and it's amazing how much they look real breasts. Because mine was skin-sparing I even have the same little mole in the same spot I did before. It is strange though to not have nipples! Whatever you decide, if you would like to speak to someone about your fears of surgery don't hesitate to private message me and I'll give you my phone number. I had never been under before and the whole thing really scared me, too. But the surgery was not bad. Dealing with the dilemnas that follow--reconstruction, radiation, chemo, etc are the harder parts, in my opinion.",

A lot of research and talking to docs, surfing these message boards, etc helped me make my decision. I don't really know the bottom line was for me. Certainly a positive node or Onc score over 34 and I would have done chemo. But, in my case, I just did not feel that the benefits outweighed the side efffects. Also, it seems counter-intuitive to flood my body right now with toxins when I still feel weakened by the surgery. I take tons of supplements recommended by a UVa pathology researcher to prevent recurrence. Also, my oncologist does think there is some benefit to the WINS trial diet (google it) and taking baby aspirin 5 days per week. He set me up with a dietician to learn more about the diet. I have so much more energy now. Back to work--yay! I would have started chemo yesterday, and I have no regrets about skipping the drip! You guys take care. So happy for all your low scores--whether you do chemo or not, a low score is GREAT NEWS!!",
