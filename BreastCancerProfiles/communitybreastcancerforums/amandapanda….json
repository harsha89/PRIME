One thing I have been seeing over and over again is that ladies in my age group (20's) keep getting told they are too young. However, I haven't been told that, ever since the mass came back as abnormal on an ultrasound. Makes me wonder...and worry. Are doctors seeing something concerning? I have a \"Multilobular nodule,(2.31cm long) on right breast with FINDINGS NOT CONSIDERED BENIGN BY ULTRASOUND\".  I even got a second opinion and was still a Bi-Rads 4. What does that mean?!  I was given a Bi-Rads 4 because it is irregular in shape with some angular margins branching out...and went in for my biopsy yesterday.  Time to play the waiting game now.  Can anyone offer any advice on what the radiologist meant, by 'not considered benign by ultrasound?' I am trying to be as patient as a 22 year old who could possibly have cancer could be  Log in to post a reply",

She gladly printed one out for me and I said \"thank you. it looks like a breast baby sonogram :-)\" I am being trying to stay positive about the whole situation because honestly, there is nothing that can be done at this point...the lump IS what it IS.

      "Content": "Mar 4, 2011 05:33PM - edited Mar 4, 2011 05:35PM by amandapanda Had a horrible dream last night that my results came back in positive. I was (naturally) so distressed and numbed by the results that i decided to sleep on it. I woke up (in real world) around 6am totally convinced that \"yesterday was one of the worst days of my life\" and  I got up to look at all my paperwork to find the pathology report that said IDC, but couldnt find it. Thats when I realized it was all a terrible frightening dream.  I am so in tuned with my body that i often dream about getting my period or having an infection the night before i discover it, with 100% accuracy. This is taking its toll on me and lets just hope this dream is nothing more than that. In my culture we say to share nightmares so they won't come true. SO there. I've shared it!  Still no results from biopsy but will keep updating ...the Titans are still at war in my head. Patience took a horrible blow from Worry today.",
