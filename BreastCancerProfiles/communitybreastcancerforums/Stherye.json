Maybe it is adh. Anyway, if they catch something it will be very very early.",

I had two benign papillomas removed (one with small flat epithelial atypia and the other completely benign) Good luck",

I read another woman in this forum that she had mx in one breast, and two years later her new gyn couldnt distinguish wich one was the mx. I hope this helps",

I am 42 yo, with twins ( boy and girl) they are 6 years old, and married to a wonderful man. I never thought to be here, as probably many of you. I dont have family history, not a single case of any type. Everything began in February. Well, to be honest, everything began in 2016. Suddenly I noticed my axilla was swollen. But I had two ultrasounds and they told me not to worry. But I changed my private insurance, and my new gyn told me I should have a mamo and ultrasounds, but for the brest. The result was an atypical papilloma (with mild focal flat epithelia atypia) I didnt know what it is and I spent hours and hours searching about FEA. Mayo last report says that pure FEA is not a high risk factor, other places they say is din1a. Others say it is less worrisome than ADH. I wrote to Jopkins and they say the risk is similar to ADH, more or less 30% in life time. After four mounths I was still worried about my axilla, and I went to Anderson in Madrid. They told me my axilla is ok, but they found another papilloma. This time I got a MRI, it says probably benign papilloma and it needs to be excised. But now I have decided for a pbmx. It is not recommended in my situation and I will need to pay for it, but peace of mind is extremely important to me. Of course I am scared, many days I am thinking..am I doing the right thing? I am crazy as my gyn thinks because if my pbmx only for FEA? I am not very scared about the results as I know my surgeon and he is amazing. But I am scared for any possible side effectsÂ¿? My surgery will be the next 25th of September. I hope the best luck on your procedures, and I really hope the best results with no side effects.",
