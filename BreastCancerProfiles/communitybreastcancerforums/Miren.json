Just after the surgery they place like an elastic fabric covering both breasts and I think I had it for at least one day. The expander has already some volume so you won´t get the sensation of flatness. I personally didn´t use any bra for a couple of weeks or so but then a friend got me one of those very soft and elastic bras you can use for practicing sports and I have to say they´re very comfortable. Now I even found some similar ones with a shaping pad that makes both my breast look very similar. I got them on larger size so they don´t compress the breast. I had the surgery at the Baylor Grapevine with Dr Clifford for the mastectomy and Dr Bledsoe for the reconstruction. Some nurses told me how good the scar looked and asked me who had done it. But 2 weeks later after removal of first drain it got infected and I´ve been with IV antibiotics until today! I also got the second drain removed today. Wish you the best on your surgery, contact me if you want to talk Hugs",
