I had 4 lymph nodes removed in February 2016 in the left axillary and 4 months after surgery developed an abscess that has since ruptured twice just as it was healing up (I am now at 8 weeks of packing this dreadful wound and it's getting bigger). I believe the reason for it not healing is because there are clips coming out of the wound. So far there have been 5 that have worked their way to the opening of the wound. I asked my surgeon if there was a concern and of course her response was \"no\". She has not ordered x-rays or offered resolution. In the meantime I am constantly leaking lymph fluid from the wound. I am hoping someone on this forum has had a similar problem and can tell me how it was resolved. I have an appt on Thursday with another surgeon for a second opinion.",
