      "Content": "peachoc wrote: I am so glad to find this forum, because I need to share some feelings.   Last week I found a lump.   I have always done self-exams (though not always on the exact schedule).   I have never gotten a screening mammogram, though (I am 41 - really planned to when I turned 40, but time got away, so had it on my schedule for this summer).    A week before last I had notice a very small bump on the same breast but in a different place - when I looked, I realized it appeared to look almost pimple like, so I checked daily (and it has shrunk to almost nothing now).   I never noticed another lump during this time, which seems odd to me.   I actually noticed it by rubbing my chest - and now have no idea how it could have been there without me noticing it.   It feels to be quite large to me (maybe 3 cm), and was not painful, though now it aches a bit sometimes.   That could just be from the fact that I keep feeling it to see if it's getting bigger, shrinking, etc.   I called my doctor the next day, and after a few questions they scheduled a diagnostic mammography, and said an ultrasound may also be done if necessary.   This is scheduled for Thursday afternoon.   The only person that knows is my husband.   I have chosen to remain quiet until after this test for a few reasons.   One reason is that this coming weekend is a special weekend for our family (a championship sporting event for my youngest child).   I want him to be able to totally enjoy it and compete without worrying.   My mother and inlaws will also be there, and I think it would be hard for them to remain totally carefree if this is hanging over us all.   I am also very concerned about worrying my mom at this point - my father died of cancer and she had her own health scare last year.   I also know that this decision has made it harder on my husband and myself, because we are going about our everyday life like everything is fine, while being worried.   On the other hand, being around others just blissfully living life helps distract me at times...but as Thursday is approaching...I am having a harder time putting it aside.    The doctor's office said they would let me know results when they had them.   I am both afraid it will come Friday and afraid it will not.   Obviously bad news would be very hard - especially considering I will be with extended family with very little privacy all weekend.   Good news would take the weight of the world off.   I have seen the odds and know they seems to be in my favor - but then I think the lump feels more firm, it's after my cycle not before...those do not seem good.   I also know worrying will not help, but I have a hard time letting go.   I cry just thinking about breaking bad news to my family.   I cry thinking that it could be more advanced (why does it seem so large and how did I not notice it?) and that I may not be there for my children.  I want to make plans and not wonder if my health is going to interfere.   I know I am rambling, but I needed to say these words to someone.   In the last few years our family has experienced many sides of cancer.   My father-in-law is a colon-cancer surviver and my mother-in-law is a breast cancer survivor.   My father died of prostrate cancer that was advanced by the time it was diagnosed (and this is where my real fears keep going back to - that moment we were told).   My mother had a bladder tumor removed that was benign.   I have always known that cancer would be a very real possibility, but I did not think I would have this worry now.   I pray that I get good news - and I pray that no matter what I can just relax and enjoy my weekend.   Once again - thank you for letting me ramble.   Log in to post a reply",
