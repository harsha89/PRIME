I asked my BS about this and was told this was very common in order to get the breast tissue. Is this common or malpractice? I am now heading to NOLA to re-open breast and try to correct fold. Has anyone had to do this and was the look pleasing? Dx 5/24/2010, DCIS, 4cm, Stage 0, Grade 3, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR+ Log in to post a reply",
