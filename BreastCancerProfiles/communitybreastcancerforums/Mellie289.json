I can't wait to get this thing out! I've been taking more of the Norco these last few days than the first few days, especially to help me sleep. I can't imagine 3 weeks with a drain - 10 days seems to be about as much as I can bear.",

Last night and today, the pain is much less, but my underarm going up to the start of my arm has a burning feeling, almost like the skin has been abraded off although it looks perfectly fine. I hope another day of healing will see a similar reduction in pain from when I got it out. I've had enough of this.",

      "Content": "Sep 3, 2013 04:45PM - edited Sep 3, 2013 04:48PM by Mellie289 I'm \"fasting\" now for my next chemo on Thursday. By fasting, I mean 500 calories/day two days before, day of and day after - definitely not water only. I'll also include some vitamins and supplements for the nutritional deficit. I wouldn't do a water only fast without doctor's supervision and my MO isn't keen on it. I did this last time for round 2 and it really alleviated the bloating, constipation and gas I suffered in my first round of chemo - my SO was poking at my belly telling me I looked like I was pregnant, it was so bad a couple nights. My fatigue wasn't any better, but I'm doing the fasting again to reduce the digestive tract effects. All in all, my second round was no worse than first in regards to fatigue, so no cumulative effects, and the digestive tract SEs were so much better. Neulasta pain was about the same. I don't know about nausea because I'm taking the meds preventatively throughout the first week since I threw up once 7 days out the first round after taking my Zofran too late to help. My big change this time compared to the last round is I'm going to try to have all 500 calories in one meal each day so it is a 24 hour fast between eating. Last time, I spread it over the day as very small breakfast, lunch and dinner meals. Food is going to be some protein (chicken breast) and the rest all veggies and fruit - no grains (too calorie dense). Edit to add: I can't tell from the thread link from SpecialK when in the chemo cycle TonLee was fasting. Sounds like in the week following treatment. That isn't what the pro-fasting research is suggesting! I think you do neet to nourish your body after chemo. Fasting before and during chemo is what has shown a protective effect in mice.",

I feel lucky to have a great guy who is stepping up during this time when I've seen posts of others whose SOs have left after the cancer diagnosis. It's hard for me to be all doom and gloom about this when I'm around him laughing. Yesterday, he was telling me how he plans on giving me a mohawk for a day before he'll clip my entire head down and he has some temporary orange hair dye for it from an old Halloween costume. He knows I'm upset about my hair falling out and is already lightening my mood about it. I think it's going to be a good day.  One of my friends at work yesterday said it's hard to believe all this because I look so healthy. She didn't see me when I was really suffering after the surgery, mind you. I do feel really good right now  (finally!!! 4 weeks later, ALND has healed enough!!!) and I am probably the healthiest (other than cancer) that I have been as an adult since I worked hard the last 2 years to lose weight and be healthy. It is a strange thing to feel so good and know that I'm going to be pumping poisons into my body soon... but no more thinking about that today! ",

I got news of my FISH result on Friday that my Her2 is not amplified. I'm so happy I'm not going to have a year of herceptin! Lymphedema clinic tomorrow to get my arm measured and some info finally, but I don't see my onc until next Tuesday, so no date yet to start. She was waiting on the FISH results from my first oncologist to decide on treatment course, so I'm going to call today to make sure she got the faxed results and can order the chemo meds so I can ASAP. I'm sorry to hear about the SE those of you who started are suffering. It's making me very nervous and I'm seriously considering fasting before my chemo as I've seen on here per the Valter Longo studies. My first oncologist thought it couldn't hurt. The second one thought it wasn't a good idea because people doing clinical trials with fasting would have a lot of support. I might do it anyway, although I don't know that I can go 4 days without food because I like to eat too much! LOL! Tea - sorry you are feeling so alone. I know how you feel! A couple weeks after my surgery, things were shaky with my boyfriend for a bit and I wasn't sure that he'd be here with me through this. My family lives about 3000 miles away and I don't have a lot of close friends nearby, having moved to this area for work 5 years ago. I was feeling really isolated and devastated by the idea of facing chemo alone.  We're here for emotional support, but there might be some local support available to you to help you get through chemo. Depending where you are, there are volunteers with the American Cancer Society that can drive you to and from treatment if you sign up for their transportation program. You might also be able to get your home cleaned while you're going through chemo through Cleaning for a Reason. I hope your onocologist will put you in touch with a local support group.  ",

I hope the next phase will be easier, as some say. Hannariggs - I can't remember from pages back - are you icing your mouth during chemo? Could it be the cold causing contraction of the metal in your filling and cap if there's any metal? I was told by a dentist a few years ago that I developed a crack in a tooth because of a filling expanding and contracting from hot/cold foods and drinks over time. I think that's how they can fall out too. From what I see, the tooth problems with chemo are usually decay caused by long term dry mouth (hence, the Biotene and related products to simulate saliva). zimmy - I think this link from the Mayo Clinic is informative about neuropathy. I also see people use lipoic acid (alpha or R-) to help with neuropathy. I plant to take R-lipoic acid supplements along with methyl B12 (better uptake than the standard B12) and L-glutamine. http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/chemotherapy-neuropathy/MY01327 It seems like the neuropathy could be temporary, although I don't think that is the case for everyone (probably depending on pre-existing factors).",

I asked the medical assistant who took my BP and temp if I could take Tylenol or ibuprofen (brought both) and she said the nurse would be bringing me Tylenol anyway. Didn't see a nurse for another 20, so my boyfriend went looking for one to get me my Tylenol! I can't believe I was left suffering that long without some stupid Tylenol - I could have taken my own if I knew they didn't have time to get me started around my 10:30 AM appointment time. The infusion itself was fine - no adverse reactions - but I was left groggy from the Bendadryl. I'm not sure I'd be able to drive myself home afterward, so I hope I'll have someone to go with me each time. I've very happy that the nurse very easily got into a vein with the IV. Only five more to go, so I'm sure I don't need a port. I've been trying to hydrate and get lots of fiber in the last day, but I think I'll start on the stool softeners preemptively too from what I'm reading above... and maybe some pruins tonight! ",

I definitely feel like I got off lucky this first round compared to some of you ladies. JeriGrace - I hope you're back in the comfort of your home.  I should be in nadir now and I'll get blood drawn tomorrow and see my onc Thursday for my WBC and followup. Regarding wigs - I got a script from my onc for a cranial prosthesis, but called my insurance to check up on it. They have a list of acceptable providers for prosthetics and orthotics for whom they will reimburse up to $350 (I have to pay 20% with my plan). The list they gave me has hardly any providers for wigs (mostly limbs, etc.) and none of them are very close to home. It's like they are trying to make it difficult to get the wig. I would definitely check with your insurance rules before going out and getting the wig with the onc's prescription so they don't refuse reimbursement if you go to a shop that isn't approved.",

I learned about the B12 differences a few months back when I was researching my SO's cat. She has diabetic neuropathy. There are some reports of methyl B12 helping to reverse some of the symptoms. I figure it can't hurt since it's a water soluble vitamin and I'll just pee out any excess! Same for some other vitamins and a daily fish oil.  I've also got lipoic acid and acetyl L-carnitine. I'm not taking these daily though. There was a recent study published (last month) saying that acetyl carnitine could make chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy worse over 24 weeks (although it was better after 12 weeks). Lipoic acid is another one that has been tested a bit for relieving symptoms of neuropathy. I'm not endorsing anyone to take these. The evidence so far doesn't show any protective effects of supplements in onset of neuropathy. I think the real benefits have been seen in the improvements of other neuropathies (not caused by chemo). I'll quote from a review on various studies:  \"In summary, clinical evidence for the efficacy of these drugs is sparse. Consequently, no explicit recommendations on neuroprotective strategies can be given yet except for the importance of identifying high-risk patients before starting chemotherapy. In the future, trials concerning neuroprotective agents should continue. Meanwhile, alternative dosing regimes, early detection and treatment modification schemes are necessary to limit CIPN.\" I guess I feel like I need to try to do something to prevent it. I'm happy with my MO's choice of docataxel versus paclitaxel after reading this too: \"The incidence of docetaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy is much lower than that of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (1-9% versus 30%). The symptoms are similar, but they are usually mild and disappear spontaneously after discontinuation.\"",

I can understand your frustration with not moving forward. Hang in there! {{{HUGS}}} HVV - I hope you get some relief soon. That's so not fun. Next cycle, I'm going to try senna too. I was going with the stool softeners, lots of water and fiber, but it wasn't quite enough to manage the bloat and discomfort. Yoga sounds like an interesting addition too. Lana and Sweetheart- how are you feeling today? I hope you beat that cold, Sweetheart! Daisy - how are things going this time with your IV fluids? You're probably in the worst of SEs right now. I hope you're feeling okay and the lower dose is working out better. NC - glad your day 5 is doing better too! We have the same chemo and it was still knocking me down at day 5 with cycle 1.  Karkar - I'm really glad to hear that your second infusion is going better with no hand and foot syndrome returning yet. Fingers crossed that it doesn't happen! ckmoss - I didn't have kidney cramps/pains, but I had back spasms, which my onc said she's never heard of as a symptom. I agree with you on not suffering the effects of radiation if that is overkill. So many doctors are recognizing that there has been a lot of overtreatment for BC in the past and they're weighing the benefits/risks much more these days. If I were you, I'd seek a second opinion, if possible, just to ease my mind, but it sounds like you're making the right decision. The advice given to me for a grade 3 tumor similar in size to yours was I would need chemo, but if I opted for mastectomy, I wouldn't need radiation. option - have you talked to you onc about sleep problems? Mine gave me Ambien CR and Ativan (I don't use them together). The Ambien helps me sleep when I'm wired from the steroids. The Ativan has helped the last few days when I've been very stressed about losing my hair. I don't like the idea of being medicated to sleep, but I feel so pumped up with meds now anyway, I think it's worth adding one more for a good night's sleep. puppymama - how did it go with shaving your head? Do you feel better?  I was really freaking out yesterday about my hair and decided last minute to ditch work and drive 3 hours round trip to get my \"cranial prosthesis\". I'm not ready to buzz my head yet. I'm day 13 and there has been more shedding, but not enough yet to push me to do it. I'll see how much hair comes out today. I feel a little less crazy now that I have a wig I'm okay about wearing to work when the inevitable happens. It has a SmartLace front (Jon Renau) that needs trimming - I'm kind of scared about cutting it and ruining the wig. Can't wait for the fun part of trying to get my insurance to reimburse me now. Today, I had a nasty nosebleed (3 on Sunday as well) - I'm not sure if it's from the Nasonex my onc prescribed, the chemo or both. They are certainly bleeding much more than a typical nosebleed for me, which I think is a symptom of my platelet count being off. I need to talk to my MO later about yesterday's blood draw for my WBC count. Crossing my fingers it went up. Anyone else getting bloody noses?",

I'm trying so hard not to think about my hair today as my scalp is tingling (not sure if it's itchy or stinging at times) and strands continue to come out. I think I can get through one more day without buzzing it to finish out the work week (fingers crossed and holding my breath). It sounds to me like most of you still have quite a bit of hair hanging around at the day 16 buzzing stage? I'm hoping there will still be enough to look okay if I have it tied up, or with a baseball cap. My ponytail has thinned to about half its former volume. I'm wondering if my BF's cats will be as perplexed by my soon-to-be bald head as it sounds like some of your dogs have been. I had a big cry last night as I was deciding to put off the clippers at least one more night. Probably more tears scheduled for tonight and tomorrow night. I never imagined that this would hit me so hard. It has made me realize that I am a \"hair girl\" after all.  I think it's going to be another Ativan night. This whole process has driven me to moments of self-pity and self-absorption that I don't think are typical of my personality (I hope). It makes me feel so vain to be thinking so much about me, me, me and my hair, of all things, when some of you have gone for another infusion this week and are suffering SEs and Momx2, I am so sorry for you. How can I feel so awful for losing hair that will grow back in comparison to losing a mother? I do wish you all an easy time this cycle. Glad to see you back, RealityCheck, but sorry about the bronchitis! That sounds miserable. I'm also taking Prilosec for acid reflux, since that's my usual state of being. Pepcid doesn't work for me. Prilosec works, but not right away (next day relief really) if anyone runs into the same problem. I have had some breakthrough GERD with Prilosec in the first week following TC. I'm thinking of doubling my dose next round. {{{HUGS}}} to all and I wish you a relaxing and comfortable Thursday evening.",

I wanted to join the trial, but TC wasn't one of the regimens on the list. I've seen a few people posting here about fasting in past threads, so I thought I would give it a try this cycle - at minimum, I would think it would help with the initial constipation if I don't have a lot of food in me. I can't go without food for 4 days, so I'm doing 2 days before chemo, day of and day after with a maximum of 500 calories (I'm keeping track on myfitnesspal, which I've used extensively in the past to track calories to lose weight). The idea behind the research is to fast beginning before chemo to protect the normal cells from the effects of chemo while sensitizing the cancer cells to the drug toxicity. It's still early days for this research, but it seems to help people (anecdotally) with SEs and I'm willing to try it and provide another anecdote of how it went.  http://www.cancer.gov/ncicancerbulletin/071012/page5 On a different subject, I don't think your WBC count reflects how you feel - or at least didn't for me last cycle. I felt pretty good when my counts were low last cycle and pretty awful in the days before they should have dropped. It's a funny thing (not meant in a humerous way).",

I was trying not to take too many meds and waited on my nausea pills (Zofran) - by the time I realized it was getting worse, it was too late and I was throwing up. This was 7 days after chemo when I figured I should be getting better and not be so wimpy about taking meds. My second cycle, I just took the pills for the week after chemo (day 2-9) and didn't have any problems. I also was more proactive with the stool softeners and laxatives (plus paying close attention to amount of food before, during and right after chemo) and I didn't have the discomfort of the bloat and constipation in cycle 1. I consider taking the meds as part of the necessary evil that is chemo. They aren't separate! The meds are there to get you through so you can be well enough to care for your parents. I'm sorry about your hair. I can't imagine how long it took you to grow it that long. Starting Decadron today for chemo #3 tomorrow. I'll be happy to say that I'm half way through soon. I don't think I'll consider it half way tomorrow when the infusion is done - more like when the symptoms from this round passes and I'm ready for #4. I woke up last night around 1 AM and couldn't fall back to sleep without help - I think I'm stressing, but I haven't really slept well since my diagnosis. I thought things would change by now. I hope when this is all over, I can sleep through the night again. Good luck to those getting treatment today - Rambo with the last AC and angelanature with taxol!

I'm sure your generosity will be truly appreciated by the people receiving your hats and scarves or benefiting from your fundraiser! I had a bit of a sore throat at the start and some dry mouth. I found that the Oasis dry mouth moisturizing spray helped to alleviate some of the discomfort. Have you tried that? It didn't make it go away entirely, but gave me a little bit of relief. Good luck tomorrow on your final taxol, Angela. You've had such a rough go of it - I hope this round will be gentle on you. Grace - how horrible for you! I know we will either end up fighting constipation or diarrhea with taxotere, but I hope your MO is now giving you meds to fight nausea and vomiting better! I threw up once my first cycle because I was waiting on some queasiness to go away (nibbled some crackers) 1 week after my infusion - by the time I realized I was going into full blown nausea, I took my anti-emetic too late. My MO told me to just take my Zofran throughout the first week without waiting for nausea to hit since I seem to be sensitive. I usually end up taking that first thing in the morning without waiting for nausea. I have a problem that my insurance company won't fill my whole Zofran prescription (only 12 pills every 15 days) so I also have Compazine and switch to that when I'm running out (and further away from infusion), but I'm still taking it preemptively until day 8 or 9. The downside is those cause constipation, although it sounds like that might not be an issue for you. I hope you and your MO get something sorted for the next cycle to prevent that from happening.",

I'm going to try to find as much info on this as I can before I see him again and meet with the second MO at the cancer center later that day. I know dose-dense might be tougher, but I'll tough it out for better odds of this not coming back. kickinitgood - I'm also staying up late researching, but then I wake up early too because there's just so much to think and worry about.

She was pretty surprised that the surgeon who performed my lumpectomy didn't do a needle biopsy first so we could make decisions and very surprised that he performed lymph node dissection while I was out without my prior approval. I told her how that left me shocked and feeling very unprepared to handle the diagnosis when I was woken from the surgery. It was impossible not to be a bit tearful in her office, but she had a well positioned box of tissues, so I'm sure I'm not the only one. My MRI results weren't there as they were supposed to be. She said I don't need any more surgery unless the MRI shows otherwise, so we'll see about that soon, I guess. I also got a referral for lymphedema risk assessment - something the original surgeon (an old guy!) just brushed off when I asked about it.  TwoHobbies - I got a referral for genetic counselling from the surgeon this morning because of my age at diagnosis (42) and history of a grandmother with breast cancer around perimenopause. I called to book the appointment and they will mail me a packet to document family history and I will meet with a genetic counsellor who will review that material decided if I should get testing or not. I'm not sure if it would work the same for you, but it seems like it wasn't a case of just booking the test like it has been for the other things like MRI and CT scan. The office told me that they would take blood at the end of the appointment if the genetic counsellor decides it's important to do, which I'm guessing means that I meet the criteria for insurance coverage. The surgeon I met today thought that I should be tested for BRCA, so we'll see what the genetic counsellor says. lesmdes - my sympathies to you about your mother. As if this isn't hard enough for us to go through without a sad anniversary.   Pattysmiles - thanks for the info!

I saw the new oncologist Tuesday and she really wants my FISH results before deciding on a treatment but is aiming for 6 x TC every three weeks. I like the place and will probably do that. She also wants me to do a PET scan now, as if I haven't had enough tests yet. More delays!!! I hate waiting. It's 5 weeks to the day since my surgery now. Bad news with her is she wants me to get a port, which I'm against if there are only 6 infusions. If the FISH is positive and I need herceptin for a year, I would be in favor of it, but not for only 6 infusions. The other oncologist said I could go without it for 8 infusions.  soriya, I'm near you!!! I'm in Placentia!  I'll be back later this afternoon if I can or tomorrow morning to catch up.

You don't have to drink pure water to stay hydrated. Anything with water in it is going to hydrate you, like fruit juices, milk or lemonade. I haven't started chemo yet, so maybe there will be different guidelines when it comes to flushing the chemo out of your system, but certainly for hydrating yourself going into the treatment, you should be able to drink other things. ",

Not one of seen listed places. I would think based on the suggestions for lymphedema you should be careful about having a hot bath to try to ease that. She told me to avoid hot tubs and hot baths because heating up the body core means that fluid could move to the periphery (arms and legs) trying to cool down the body. Again, this was for lymphedema, so I'm extrapolating here, but I think the advice might apply.",

I was toying with the idea of taking a Zofran already since I felt a tinge of queeziness, but I don't want to prematurely (I'm still on Decadron today, so it might just be more anxious stomach).

Now it's all really starting to feel real. It's so nice to read of the support of loved ones shaving their heads right along. I'm sure my boyfriend would do the same thing but he doesn't have much to remove to start with. We went the other way and he tried my wig on. It was pretty amusing to actually see him with hair.

I started getting a rash yesterday like some of you and it seems to be much worse today. Mine is on my neck. Anti-itch allergy cream last night and this morning helps to calm the crazy itchiness, but it still spread. I also woke up with some nausea today. I have two prescriptions I'm supposed to take an hour before eating that I take when I wake up. I couldn't wait an hour before I had to try eating some crackers. That helped for a little bit, then it got worse and I went for the Zofran. I thought Zofran was for days around chemo, not this far out, so I was holding off on it. Well, I only the tablet down about a whole minute before I was throwing up. My stomach has settled back down at least now. I'm wondering if this might be a reaction to one of the scripts (an antibiotic). Anyone else having nausea this far past chemo days?  blasu - thanks for much for your posts and all the info. I opted against the port and after my first IV, I'm glad I did. I have good, big veins and went without a hitch. Unless something changes in the future, I'm good with keeping it that way since I only have 6 infusions. My LE PT said I could use my bad arm for blood draws, so I don't have to worry about all the needle pokes going in my chemo arm, so I'll dedicate that arm to only the IV lines. Neuropathy is definitely something I'm worried about and I'm taking some supplements to try to minimize it. I am also slated for 6 1/2 weeks of radiation when I'm done with TC. Good luck today with round 2, Lynn! Sorry if I've missed someone else going in today.",

I left the cancer center with my usual grogginess from the ativan and benadryl they pushed at the start. My mother arrived yesterday from Canada to be with me through this cycle (the first two weeks) and it's nice to spend time together too. Fasting has been tough, but doable. 3 hungry days over and only one more to go before I return to my regular eating habits. If I find this helps with SEs, even if just constipation, I'll do it again.

Looks like we made it to September!  I spent the long weekend trying to enjoy my good week before round 3 on Thursday. Did a little swimming in the pool Saturday and went snorkeling for the first time in my life on Sunday. It was a lot of fun. I can't stand the feel of sunscreen, but I don't leave any skin exposed, especially now that I know I'm more sensitive. Saturday night was the one year anniversary of my first date with my SO and we went back to the place we met for dinner - it made me feel so lucky to have him. He looked me in the eye yesterday and told me to remember that he's with me through this and to let him know when I need him since we're only a few days from the next go. Glad to see you back from surgery, Lynn. I hope everything is fixed for good. I would doubt that a delay for one treatment would significantly impact the effectiveness. I hope not. Lana - I admire you for your comfort going without a wig or scarf at work. I refuse to go to work without a wig. I lock myself in my office to eat lunch and do other things so I can take it off for a break. It's so hot and uncomfortable at times, but I would have much more emotional discomfort to walk around without it. Personally, I would have to wear the wig to a conference because I want people to not look at and talk about my hair although with the wig on, I do occasionaly get comments (even compliments) about my \"hair\", especially as the wig I liked and wear to work was one I got last minute in a much darker color than my hair was when it came out. The one closest to my hair's tone was on back order. I put a wig on to grocery shop or whatever. I feel like people ignore me when I walk around with \"hair\" but if I went out bald or wore a headcover, they would look at me and that makes me uncomfortable. I know it's my issue that I worry too much about what people think! I did wear a headcover to Urgent Care last week though when I went for my nosebleeds. I wore a headcover once to get takeout with my mother and saw some people I knew there - I just hoped they didn't recognize me, kept my sunglasses on and my distance. Eyebrows are hanging in still, but I've lost a few hairs in the ends nearest my nose. I know some people don't lose them - I wish I knew what the stats were for Cytoxan/Taxotere. I normally don't wear makeup but might have to start if I need to draw in brows. Does anyone have any idea how many people lose vs. keep their brows? So far, I've had no signs of neuropathy. I also wish I knew more about that. I'm assuming that is one that gets worse with each round, that I might get hit with it later. My MO told me I would get neuropathy so I guess I'm just lucky it hasn't showed it's ugly face yet, but I'm only going into #3 of 6 this week. *sigh* Today is the start of my fasting. That really helped last time with the symptoms in my digestive tract (bloating, constipation, discomfort). I'm going to do the same thing: 500 calories diet restriction starting two days before chemo and continuing until the day after chemo. Two days after chemo, I'll go back to normal eating. This time, I'm trying for one big meal with all 500 calories rather than spreading it throughout the day after watching \"Eat, Fast and Live Longer\" a couple weeks ago and hearing that it might have more benefits. I'm also going to get some frozen things ready - ice cubes and pops that are sugar-free (for my fast). My mouth was better last round, I think because I iced it throughout the infusion. The first time, I iced some of the time, but also ate lunch. I might also keep sucking on some ice pops for an hour or two afterward this time to see if that might help even more. I haven't had any mouth sores yet - just the feeling that my whole mouth got burnt on hot soup and weird tastes, but it has resolved by day 10 both cycles now.  Congratulations to those of you who finished with AC! I hope it's easier from here on out with the taxol.",

Woke up to pee around 1:30 AM and all the sleepy meds had worn off and I was just feeling the steroids. No more sleep the rest of the night. Decadron again today, but I'm definitely taking an Ambien tonight or I will be staring at my ceiling all night. To me, insomnia doesn't help the healing process so I'm going to medicate it! I'm glad to see the taxols have started for some of you - lark, hannariggs and Cherri. Good luck today, honeybunny! soriya - I hope the B vitamins help. I'm scared to death about neuropathy. I hope it stays mild and is just a temporary thing. Sorry about the muscle aches, angelanature. I have a few days of the with the taxotere, so maybe similar to your taxol symptoms. My first cycle, I didn't sleep the night between day 5 and 6 because I was so uncomfortable and achey. I was feeling it all over, but especially in my lower back which is already prone to some muscular pain. Last cycle, I used the dilaudid prescribed to me for the neulasta bone pain and it helped a lot. I'm not sure how similar that is to oxycodone, but (as I've said before) it helped to take the edge off so I could function and sleep with help from Ambien too. Definitely didn't completely relieve the symptoms and I just had to ride it out a couple days. I hope this passes in a day or two for you too. {{{hugs}}} I haven't had the stabbing pain from my lumpectomy this time yet, but I did my last one over a decade ago - when the nerves started regenerating. I now have some sensation again in the area. My BC surgical site and armpit are completely numb still. I hope I get some feeling back at least in the armpit so I can feel my razor or deodorant when I 'm putting it on.",

That's scary, especially considering that it's in a region likely not included in screening, like a mammo. Cherri - I'm not doing AC + T as I originally stated in the OP. I changed MO's and I'm doing 6 cycles of cytoxan + taxotere. Sorry all you Taxol ladies are suffering SEs and it's not easy like we were led to believe. It sounds like a lot of the pains and aches are very similar to mine, so I have to think it's the Taxotere causing most of it. I'm two weeks post-infusion for #3 and I'm still suffering muscle fatigue. I hope it doesn't continue to get much worse with my last 3 rounds. I have been taking the Dilaudid prescribed to me by my MO for those pains and the Neulasta bone pains, which overlap. My pains have been the worst night 4 going into day 5 and I need to take the pain killers to get any sleep, although 2 out of 3 cycles, I've had close to zero sleep that night, with or without the pain killers. I will also check with the MO about trying ibuprofen. I have a new MO next time out substituting for mine who is out on maternity leave for my next two cycles. I hope I like her.",

I've also had some neuropathy kick in after round 4 of TC. I'm scare to death of the remaining two cycles now, that this will get far worse. I will meet with the MO right before my next infusion but I'm wondering if I should try to see her this week also - to discuss changing anything or to be advised what I can do to minimize worsening neuropathy. I see so many mixed opinions here on icing, supplements, etc. or possibly by next taxotere dosage could be reduced. I just have mild tingling, numbness and aching in my left hand right now.

I saw my surgeon yesterday and she thinks it's just lymphatic congestion. I met the radiation oncologist yesterday for the first time and she's saying 6.5 weeks treatment. I'm gutted! That makes me stuck here, 3000 miles away from my family, for the Christmas holidays. I thought it was bad enough to cancel my August trip back home.  My MO is very poor at communicating what's going on. I haven't been told much of anything apart from given the prescriptions. I'm hoping there will be some orientation when I go for the first infusion tomorrow. I see others are getting info like avoid salad bars and buffets. From what you've said, Carol, maybe they're okay if I get my boyfriend to make up the plate for me and I don't touch the serving utensils!

I have some melatonin around here too - maybe I'll give that a shot tonight. I can't believe I woke up feeling like I got some rest and a little better, and Tylenol has dealt somewhat with my headache. I feel pretty good as long as I'm sitting perfectly still - walk up the stairs and the fatigue hits so hard in my leg muscles. I want a break from all the meds, but I definitely have some queasiness still the morning and needed to popped a Zofran. raynaj - that's very scary about your allergic reaction! I was relieved at my infusion that I didn't have any reactions, but the nurse said allergic reactions could happen at any time, so that's always still a possibility. I hope they'll be better ready to deal with your allergic reaction next time so you don't suffer.",

To me, it made more sense to have the PET scan in a year or so to make sure there wasn't anything coming back rather than now, when it wasn't going to change the course of my treatment and there was nothing big enough to see with the other scans that were done already at significantly less cost.",

      "Content": "Aug 28, 2013 03:42PM - edited Aug 28, 2013 03:43PM by Mellie289 Good morning, Firecrackers! I've been off spending time with my mother but I brought her to the airport this AM and my guy is back to resume his nursing duties. Once again this cycle, days 10-12.... nosebleeds, nosebleeds, nosebleeds. The worst of my life and far worse than my first cycle. I almost went to emergency Monday night when it wouldn't stop for over an hour. Called my MO yesterday morning and didn't hear back from them all day - I ended up calling again to  find out if there was anything wrong with my platelet cound from Monday's blood draw. It was fine, but I'm getting pretty ticked off that they aren't returning my calls when I am asking for my blood test results after one with a low WBC count also in a message asking on nosebleeds that had been going on for two days. We did make a little trip to urgent care last night after another one that went on for an hour and a half by that time. Since it wasn't a posterior bleed, it's just compression and suffering through it, I guess. Anyone else having nosebleeds and getting advice from their MO? I keep thinking of someone here saying earlier that chemo seems to attack our weeknesses and I had lots of nosebleeds when I was younger and living with dry heat during winter time in Canada. Sorry for the post being strictly self-focused. I'm so far behind here and have 5 pages of reading to catch up on - I'll be doing that later today to see how you all are fairing. I really need to get showered and to work right now though. ",

I hope I'm not going thave the same thing in my next 4 cycles. I'm going to try moisturizing with saline in preparation and maybe make an appointment with an ENT to have a look.",

I think it's sometimes in my nature to be like a turtle pulling into my shell. Third TC cycle was definitely worse for fatigue and I had my worst bad day yet (day 5). I hope it doesn't escalate much more with my remaining three cycles. Right now, I'm in the period that was major nosebleeds my first two cycles. I've been religiously spraying saline since Saturday and I've managed to forego them this time out. I feel like I learn something each cycle about how to manage the SEs better, which is a good thing since they could be getting worse like the fatigue, which has lasted two days longer than previously. I think I also feel those zingers for a few days, especially on my bad day. I've compared it to my body feeling like the sky when fireworks are going off - random explosions in unpredictable places, although I also have achey joints and bone pain from the neulasta. I have had two days the last couple cycles that I've needed the narcotics to ease those pains and to feel comfortable just sitting or laying down. Welcome to Donna and Girlstrong! I hope you'll find the support you need here if you don't have it elsewhere. Donna - I'm curious as to how they found lymph node involvement after 5 months? I had a positive lymph node and I'm worried about more in future. Was that a CT scan? I'm so sorry you have to go through this for a second round! Once is beyond bad enough. Congratulations to TwoHobbies and NC for finishing! I've been envious of those of you on the dose dense plan. I asked my MO last visit if we could speed things up and do every two weeks with my remaining TC since my WBC was good with Neulasta after two weeks but she said no. There's a DD clinical trial with TC I found online, but the results aren't published yet, so too bad for me. I've missed too much to address everyone individually, but I'm sorry to see that the Taxol is so tough on some of you! My first MO, who was pitching AC - T for me said T was easier, but I guess everyone reacts a little differently. Lark - is it possible that the rash is an allergic reaction? If so, Claritin could help if you aren't taking it daily, or possibly an OTC allergy or hydrocortisone cream. I got a rash my first cycle on my neck from TC. The allergy cream stopped the itch, but it kept spreading. The hydrocortisone cream made it go away. I have to say that like the term warriors much better than survivors too. Let's get through this, sister Warriors!",

This cycle was better than the last one, my worst so far. I think this was because I fasted 48 hours (no food, only 20 calories of broth in that time). My main issues this cycle have been just the Neulasta bone pain and fighting constipation, but my mouth and the fatigue haven't been as bad. I wasn't staying on top of things well enough and ended up suffering from needing senna and stool softeners yesterday, but I'm feeling almost back in balance today. I'm going to try to enjoy relaxing today at home before I'm back to work first thing tomorrow morning. I hope everyone is enjoying an SE free day!",

I do like some creamy things when my mouth is bad though, like ice cream, but I think that might be more for the texture soothing that burnt mouth feeling rather than anything to do with taste. My MO also reduced my taxotere by 20% yesterday because of the peripheral neuropathy I had getting worse last cycle. I wish there was some concrete data comparing the dosing.",

I feel happy to be joining the ranks of those who are done chemo and onto the next phase, but I won't count myself done until the week of bad SEs passes this round. Last cycle (#5) was a little better with my Taxotere reduced 20% and the MO kept that dosage this time, but I had one day of terrible peripheral neuropathy in my feet at day 7 (new symptom). My hands had similar symptoms to the previous cycle. I'm hoping it won't get much worse this last time or it will pass pretty quickly like for the feet this last go. I hope I'll find some time to catch up on you all later this week. It has been so crazy busy at work and I have constant muscle fatigue all the time that just exhausts me. I glanced through quickly and I envy those of you who have hair growing back in! I really can't wait to get to that point.",

I can tell right now that the cami isn't going to work for me at all when the semester starts and I'm standing in front of the classroom with 30 pairs of eyes on me. Jan - $90 and you needed help getting it on and off? I would definitely need help too as my arm on the surgical side is so weak now. I live in southern California and it's summer time so I can't imagine wearing a full T-shirt under my tank tops, etc. I'll keep that in mind if I need something going into Fall and when my partner is back from his travels so I'd have help dressing! That can't be nearly as bad as when I needed help washing when I had the drain in after surgery. Thanks for the suggestion. Glennie - I have the opposite that my swollen side is bigger than the non-surgical side, so that shouldn't be an issue, I guess. I hadn't heard of Swell Spots before. Thanks for your post.",

My summer has been ruined by the surgery and diagnosis, and the chemo starting soon, so I plan to defer a year but I must take sick leave in the fall for at least two weeks to do that. I think that will work out okay since that should be me getting through the AC portion of my treatment and resuming during the weekly taxol, which seems to be an easier ride from what I've seen (hoping I have that reaction!).  I'm full-time faculty, so the department will hold my class for me and find someone to substitute in, but it means planning ahead a bit. I will meet with my dept. chair after I start to figure out how I'm handling the treatments though. It sounds like you're part-time, so that's a tough situation. I hope you're getting time to make that decision so you can see how your treatments go before needing to commit or not. My dept. chair has pointed out though that later cycles could be harder than the first one as the chemo takes its toll. I'm glad you have a spouse with medical benefits! I'm single so extremely thankful for my full-time position benefits right now.  aaoaao - I admire your attitude! I'm trying not to worry too much about the future. It's more that I'm considering all the possibilities so my treatment will be as aggressive as possible so it won't come back. As soon as I know what's going on for my treatment, I'm going to book a mani/pedi and a hair cut to do something nice for myself before I start poisoning myself. ",

Seems to me it would be better to do this post-treatment to make sure I'm all clear. My onc hasn't called me back. I actually left a message for her to call me Tuesday when I dropped off my tumor pathology slides and the Her2 FISH results. I kept my cell phone by my side all afternoon yesterday waiting. I'm not happy that I haven't gotten a resonse from her. I wanted to get the chemo ordered so I can maybe start next week, as well as discuss the port placement to change it to arm instead of chest... and now I need to talk about the PET scan! I was a stress ball yesterday afternoon when I got that call AND I found out from my PPO that the deductible isn't included in the maximum yearly out-of-pocket, so my maximum is $500 more than I thought PLUS all my $20 copays for office visits (now approaching $200).

We went dolphin and whale watching and out for dinner a couple nights. I have been getting more and more emotional lately as my hair's days are numbered. My BF surprised me Saturday morning by shaving his head to be bald with me! I was so surprised and touched! It was like he gave me the best present of all on his own birthday. At least, through all this, I feel really loved and supported. I had horrible back spasms Thursday and my onc gave me some flexeril and ativan, as she thinks I'm taking the stress in my muscles. That made me realize Friday that I've been much more stressed about losing my hair than I thought. Saturday was the last morning I needed the Zofran (so far) and yesterday was a pretty good day apart from three nose bleeeds and some vertigo (I feel like I have new symptoms every day!) I'm hoping that's it for cycle 1 meds and SEs except for the hair now. A few more came out this morning than the usual - I'm day 12. I think I have a couple more days.  My WBC count came in low on Thursday and I'm going again for another blood draw this afternoon. My onc wanted to give me another shot of neulasta, but the insurance wouldn't cover it. If it drops below some level, I think they'll cover it, but I'm hoping the first neulasta shot is doing something and the count will be back up when I get the results tomorrow. I've been pretty worried about getting sick since I got that news, but I was on antibiotics until yesterday, so feeling a little protected. Now, I need to be even more careful, I think. Does anybody know at what point the WBC count goes from low to dangerously low? hannariggs - I had a pretty raw throat for a while last week. I found that the Oasis Dry Mouth Moisturing Spray helped to ease the discomfort some. For blurred vision - I haven't had that myself, but I did have some issues like that years ago from dry eyes when I had lasik eye surgery. If it's dry eye causing the blurriness, some artificial tears should help. I've seen that dry eyes is a SE (although I know you ladies might be suffering something else causing the blurriness with these poisons). My rash was spreading when I tried the benadryl allergy cream, but went away in a day with the cortisone cream, so I'm glad I know what to do about that for next cycle. Cycle 1 is the learning cycle, I think! momx2 - I'm so sorry for the loss of your mother! I can't imagine how you feel right now. My heart aches for you.  Welcome, Karkar! Glad you found us! Have you gotten any advice on preventing your hand and foot syndrome again? I recall seeing something suggesting that you shouldn't use them in any vigorous activities within the first couple days post-chemo to try to prevent that from happening. (I'm not sure if that is a helpful suggestion for what you experienced.) Vilia - I love the idea of us being extras in a zombie flick. That really made me chuckle after the days I felt so bloated, lopsided and with ugly skin rashes. Cycle 2, I'm sure I'll have all that with no hair, so ready for the part with no makeup necessary! daisy - I'm glad you got your nerve medication! I have been very stressed since my surgery and was beginning to get a bit weepy all the time - the ativan I got Thursday has really helped me to finally sleep all the way through the night and not wake up thinking about cancer and chemo. My BF said it was good to see me back to smiling and laughing yesterday finally. 2bluestars - I know what you mean about the wig making you feel ridiculous because it's too perfect. I feel the same about the wigs I've bought (I have two that were pretty cheap). I'm looking at a more expensive one that is much more like my own hair now that I didn't want to spend the money on until I could try on a wig and feel like I could keep it on comfortably (not too hot or itchy). I'm still trying to find a place contracted by my insurance to get one under my cranial prosthesis prescription, but that isn't proving easy here. I'll have to drive an hour or two to one of only two places in Southern California on their approved list of providers, but I'm trying to find out on the phone which one will be a better place to help me get what I want before I make the trip. Of course, these places are only open weekdays 10-5 PM.  I'm sending positive vibes to all of you currently going through your 2nd and 3rd cycles now. Sorry for all the fatigue and SEs setting in and for those of us in the process of losing our hair. It's so good to have sisters to do this together (I love the name BreastBook!) (Sorry I was so long winded - I was away too long! LOL!)",

No tears, but I had a bit of a hangover headache on Saturday. My BF did his orange mohawk first, but now it's down to about 1/4 inch. I wish I had known it would be so prickly - I would have left a bit longer. Seems to be falling out much slower now though. It's funny that now that my hair has gone, the stress of it seems to have eased up so much. I've been out a few times with a wig, but went to the beach and kayaking (for the first time) yesterday with just my buzz cut and a hat (and SPF 50, of course). I was having a bit of a pity party about my hair, but I never, for a second, think about stop chemo. I want to survive this! I will do what it takes! Sometimes, I just need to wallow a bit in my misery and cry and scream at the world though just to let it all out. Thank you ladies for listening and even more so for understanding. I'm finding my SO is very supportive, but he just doesn't understand what losing the hair means to me. Vilia - I also had antibiotics for prescribed for redness in my surgical breast starting right before my first cycle - it's still red after the course of antibiotics and nearly 3 weeks. My surgeon thought it was probably congestions from the lymphatics, but the radiation oncologist gave me the antibiotics just in case (I guess it couldn't hurt). puppymama -good news on the BRCA testing. I got the call on Friday too! That was definitely some welcome news!  honeybunny - how are you feeling today? I hope you got some sleep. I'm thinking you're probably still in the worst phase of the post-infusion SEs, so wishing you an easy day. Sorry you're having a tougher time this cycle too, angela. I hope you are feeling better by now - I'm definitely going to take the constipation SE very seriously after hearing your story. I was lucky the first time out (although very bloated and uncomfortable), but should have done more. KTLe - welcome to our little group and thanks for sharing your hair story. I'm glad to hear that you're rocking the bald head and hope that acne clears up soon. I didn't get a port. Sorry about your Neulasta bone pain - they really should have had you ready with some meds or be able to respond quickly. I hope they gave you something good in case it happens again. My MO gave me dilaudid just in case - fortunately I didn't need to use it the first cycle. Stonel - welcome and I hope you are feeling better by today. For me, day 5 was when my upswing began. {{{hugs}}} GraceB1 - I'm glad you're taking care of yourself and seeing the doctor. Also, could be low blood pressure? I hope you get some answers today. Good luck today, JeriGrace! I'm off to work today for the first time with \"new hair\". I got a different wig online that showed up Saturday that I just love, love, love, but it's too long right now and I need to get it styled. I will wear the one I got last week until the long one is chopped to my former hair's length. It's going to be funny for people to see me with a shorter, very highlighted wig, then for me to go back to a longer, darker one in about a week. ",

      "Content": "Aug 13, 2013 10:51AM - edited Aug 13, 2013 11:00AM by Mellie289 Good morning, Firecrackers! I hope you're off having a good day if you're not here posting. RealityCheck - sounds like you are having an unpleasant day, but let's hope day 5 is the last end this cycle for you! I also had a small bout of vertigo my first cycle, Grace. Not nearly as bad as yours, by the sounds of it. I hope that's not going to be a recurring problem for both of us.  I know what you mean about the scan results, NC! I picked up a copy of my results to bring to my new oncologist (they were ordered by my original onc and I hadn't met him to get results at that point) - I opened the envelope to look at them and my heart was in my throat! What a relief to see negative scans! Phew! My man left for Canada today for business and to visit his family and friends. He is meeting my parents (for the first time!) tonight. We were supposed to be together, but I had to cancel for obvious reasons. It's a little weird for him to be meeting my parents without me. LOL! My mother is flying out here tomorrow to fill in for him for my next cycle - infusion is Thursday. This time, I'm trying a little fasting for the cycle. We'll see how it goes, but I'm limiting myself to 500 calories a day starting today and ending Friday. I woke up today starving, of course! LOL! I'm hoping this will help with the SEs, particularly with the constipation. I was going to try to get in a trial using fasting at USC, but my chemo regimen wasn't on the eligibility list so I'm winging it.  I got through yesterday with my wig on at work and it was okay but I got some strange looks from people who saw me for the first time - I think my \"hair\" looked way too full for my usual and too perfect. I had two compliments that my hair looked nice though. It seemed like my real hair had stopped falling out since I buzzed it Friday, but last night it started up again in the shower. I think I'm going to be having that post-haircut prickly neck feeling as the rest comes out this week. I hope it's done soon. I think some of you eventually shaved your heads because of that. Is that a good idea or did it make more/worse scalp issues? Have a great Tuesday everyone! Someone eat something for me. ",

I had only coffee all day (kept myself very busy!) and had a dinner tonight under 400 calories with quite a bit of fiber (celery and some other veggies with a bit of chicken and broth). I've been hungry all day and I'm still hungry though, but I'm willing to be hungry to try for fewer SEs. angela - I plan to fight the constipation with a stool softerner and lots of hydration as well. I've got my senna laxative ready at the first signs of being slowed up this cycle.  peace - with TC, my hair started shedding at day 14 and was coming out late day 15 and all through day 16 so much so that I was worried about getting through the work day on day 16 (a Friday) with a full looking head of hair. Buzzed it that night and the shedding slowed, but it was already thinned to about 1/3 of my former hair. Last night (day 20), a whole bunch more came out that it is super thin now although still not bald. One of the things I did today in my keeping busy was a trip to the hair salon to get my new wig trimmed. It's called Brandi from Amore and I think it's beautiful, but too long and very full head of hair. I got it trimmed up to my former hair length (and blended with some new layering) and it's almost like I see myself again in the mirror! This is going to be my main wig starting next week. I want to finish out the week with the one I started so I can disappear for a few days with the weekend and my round 2 recovery before I come back with a different look. I have to say I also love this wig for comfort. My head is very uncomfortable still with the remaining hair, but this Amore one feels better than my Jon Renau lace front with it's double monofilament top (in case anyone is interested).",

I'm so sorry for you ladies suffering from hemorrhoids. I have mild ones and have had some very brief sharp pains since starting the chemo, but I can't imagine that being constant. It would be debilitating! Lynn - how are you doing? I hope your surgery went smoothly and you're mending well. RealityCheck - I have suffered a little incontinence occasionally in the past from coughing or sneezing while having a really full bladder. I've found that is a little worse now since starting chemo. I haven't had an embarassing incident like you (sorry that happened to you), but I've felt like I've been close a couple times. I'm making sure I don't wait too long to empty my bladder! It doesn't help that I have been drinking so much to hydrate before chemo and to fend off constipation afterward. Sue -  I haven't felt swollen lymph nodes myself (maybe that's ahead for me since I've only done two rounds of TC) but the first thing that would pop into my head is that I possibly have an infection since day 8 should be the nadir period. I hope it's nothing serious. Welcome to our group, Cheryl! I'm glad you found us before you started your weekly taxol. I hope it will be easier on you than the AC has been. Sorry you can't pick up your baby girl.",

I'm going to see the sub again next week though and my own onc for the final treatment. I feel like other people here are communicating with their onc's better, like they are being asked the right questions. I sometimes feel like I'm going through this pretty blindly and I wouldn't know what the heck was going on if it wasn't for this website and reading all these threads.",

I guess we can now finally give up on it resolving on its own any time in the near future. My left breast is swollen to a C/D cup while my right is a B. The LE PT sshowed me some massage and I will go to her for some sessions in August (I have a trip coming up and she's booked up until then). In the meantime, she said I should get a compression cami like by Spanx. I have a sleeve and gauntlet already from a specialty shop that I bought last year. She advised me to start wearing those again, at least for the next month or so - I have never had LE in the arm, just some readings on the L-DEX trending upward (again now), but still in the normal range. I had a look at Target yesterday and can't really find something appropriate - the camisole-style slimmers all seem to be targeting the waste. Does anyone have a specific tank top or camisole that is suitable for breast compression that you can suggest to me? Where did you find it? I was thinking of trying Macy's today. If you bought something online, do you have a link? I'd really appreciate some suggestions!  Thanks! Melanie.

I also agree on the cold caps! Why are they so expensive? I decided to not spend that money - it is something I could do, but it would really hurt and I don't think keeping your hair is guaranteed. I'm trying to think of it as fun to see what I would look like bald. I have a feeling it will be bad because I don't have a good head shape for it. Reading this thread has left me with more concerns! I didn't realize that the chemo brain fog could last once it's over! That's a terrifying thought. I need my brain for work! I've been forgetful enough as it is because of the stress this has put me under.  Why didn't I hear about these potential side effects?  I also see more people getting dose-dense AC here. I don't understand why my MO said I don't need that. I can't wait to hear a second opinion next week. I still have my MRI to do tomorrow. I'm not sure how good it will be since I'm still pretty swollen from surgery, although it seems to finally be going down. Now, some of the itching, crawling under the skin sensations have started. Sorry, Annie. {{{Hugs}} Sounds like they are worried that the adriamycin will damage your heart. That would be upsetting and frustrating to me too! I think the oncologist should have called you. I hope they will be able to offer you something else effective and safer. On the plus side, I think we are lucky that we're in the group going through this that get an echocardiogram done because they already know about the potential cardiac side effcts.  Glad your first treatment went well, scribblinhanna. I hope you don't feel too bad in the next couple of days.",

      "Content": "Jul 7, 2013 04:20PM - edited Jul 7, 2013 04:22PM by Mellie289 aaoaao - sorry to see you hear with bone mets. Your diagnosis is particularly scary to me as it sounds like your primary tumor is the same as mine. I hope so much that you can beat this once and for all this time! pstamant - it's good to hear that your chemo is going well and nausea is in control, but sorry about the bone pain. I've read on here that some people take Claritin to help with bone pain. I think that might be specific for the bone pain caused by neulasta. Are you taking that as well? It might not hurt to try the Claritin if the Tylenol isn't cutting it all the time. It's a big week for me. Tomorrow I meet my new surgeon to review my lumpectomy/ALND and Tuesday I meet my oncologist to go over test results in the morning and I see my new oncologist in the afternoon for a second opinion. I need to spend time today making a list of questions - one of which will be about having a port placed in my arm. I can get on board with that but I do not want one in my chest. Have all of you discussed time off with your doctors? I will need to have a form signed for absences at my job nd I'm wondering how willing they are to do it since it seems many carry on to work as usual. I have almost 60 days of sick time accrued and intend to take some of it when going through the AC cycles but I'm not sure if the oncs automatically endorse sick time during chemo or if you have to be one of the poor ones suffering. I guess I'll be discussing that Tuesday, but I was curious but others' experiences. It's my birthday Wednesday and my boyfriend is taking me out for a surprise tonight. He's pretty good at cheering me up through this so far. He says his job is to make sure I don't cry. I have lots to do today to try to make space for his stuff since he's moving in on Saturday. It's all pretty overwhelming at times, but I'm going to feel so much better once he's moved in here. ",

      "Content": "Aug 20, 2013 11:35AM - edited Aug 20, 2013 11:36AM by Mellie289 Good morning, Firecrackers! I've just been lurking a bit while going through my bad days of cycle 2. I'm finally on the upswing today after my infusion Thursday but still needed to start the day off with Zofran.  Fasting this time made a huge difference to me for all the digestive issues - I definitely had an easier time. The chemo farts talk made me laugh - my SO is happy to be away this cycle to miss out on those, I think, but also they weren't as bad this time. More bone and joint pain though, probably from the neulasta. Dilaudid helped me sleep through my worst night (two nights ago), but last night, it didn't seem to stop the random shooting pains. As of this morning, the pain has eased up immensely and I'm just on some extra strength Tylenol for a headache. Happy birthday, Melissa! momx2 - you continue to be in my thoughts. My mother is here for another week and it has been so wonderful to have her here with me for this cycle. I can't imagine what you are going through and I'm so thankful not have faced this cycle all alone. Sorry you've got your period going on at the same time. I had mine through the worst days of cycle #1, and as miserable as that was, I'm actually worried I'm not going to see mine again and I'll be going into chemopause. That might sound ridiculous, but having my period is something I can see a bright side to, despite the added layer of discomfort and misery, if that makes any sense. I hope you're feeling better.  JeriGrace - I'm glad to hear that your WBC count stayed up enough for you to go home. I'm so sorry you've had such a rough time. soriya - I'm also just doing TC (without the H), not AC plus T like most of the others here.  I probably could go into work today, but I'm going to take some rest still and spend time with my mother while she's here. I don't feel motivated to push myself to go to work since I can afford to take the time off (technically, since it's summer break, I'm not paid to go in right now anyway). Semester starts on Friday and I'll go in then, but possibly only briefly if my WBC count is low to minimize my contact with people (blood draw tomorrow). Good luck to all of those having a treatment this week. I'll be happy to see those AC treatments ending soon for all of you facing the red devil.",

I just did my fourth yesterday but have two more, unfortunately, so I'm not joining you and the other ladies who are done for rads for a while yet. Yesterday's infusion was done by a nurse who seemed like it was her first day, she was making so many mistakes. First, she blew my vein, a really, really good one! She shoved the needle in way too deep (and it really hurt) - no wonder she went through to the other side of it. She got me set up okay on another vein and started me up on the pre-meds okay, but then she included Decadron, even though I already told her I took it at home and didn't need it. She forgot to give me the ativan until halfway through the last bag (taxotere) and in between all that, she hooked up my cytoxan bag but didn't get the drip going. The worst, in my mind, was that she let one of the bags (decadron I think) run way out that I had a nice air bubble coursing through the line for a bit until blood started backing out of the needle. I ended up beeping for someone to come and look at the set-up at least 4 or 5 times with these things going on. Apparently, the finished bag was while she was off on her lunch break, so maybe it was someone else's fault too. I wasn't instilled with a lot of confidence yesterday and I hope I get one of my previous nurses for the last two treatments. They knew what they were doing! momx2 - I need to join you on the treadmill! My fatique was bad last time and I think I'm not getting enough exercise to combat it. I was doing some swimming, but it got too cold and I wasn't getting out there often enough. 2bluestars - that is terrific news about your tumor shrinking! I'm so happy for you! It's kind of nice that you can see the progress. I'm so sorry for you taxol ladies suffering so much. Hang in there! I'm still terrified of getting neuropathy from the taxotere. I really feel for you, angelanature and hannariggs. My fingers are crossed that this shall pass soon when the treatments are over. I'm off to work for a short day since I need to leave early for my Neulasta shot at the cancer center. Hoping I can make it through most of Friday at work too until the SEs start to kick in in the afternoon so I'm mostly down on the weekend this time out, and maybe off just Monday and Tuesday if necessary. I'm sick of sitting at home alone during the week. I'm planning to go out Saturday night (day 4) briefly for the coming of age party of one of my BF's employee's daughters. I really don't know how long I'll last, but as long as it's mostly just sitting down, I can make it through dinner and a little socializing. I might be canceling last minute though since day 4 is usually a little tough. Good news here is that the weather has cooled down enough that it isn't horribly hot and sweaty to wear a wig outside most of the day.",

I posted on my FB page about missing out on a great Uncle Fester costume this year since I didn't dress up for Halloween. That is such a fun picture! My hair has started growing - 4 weeks since the last infusion. I have a soft fuzz that is a bit patchy, but mostly pretty dark except for the white that I had before it all fell out. I'll probably have it all grow back in the same - fine, limp and perfectly straight. I'm hoping for some curls or waviness though. My eyebrows and lashes have mostly hung on, but the little blank spots in my brows now have signs of regrowth too. I have been religiously applying brow and lash conditioner from day one except for one week in the middle of chemo when I ran out of conditioner - that's when I had some losses. I'm so happy to be half way through radiation now. So far, it's much easier than chemo, but I still have awful muscle exhaustion hanging on from the chemo. It hasn't really gotten any better. It's so depressing sometimes to think that I've had these sore, fatigued muscles for over two months straight now, especially my thighs. It kills me to walk up the stairs at night to go to bed sometimes. I just keep wondering when it's going to get better and I can start getting back in shape again. angela - sorry you have having such a rough go with the radiation. I really pushed my RO to let me do the 4 week protocol instead of the 6.5 week one because I would have been utterly depressed to do that into the new year and miss Christmas with my family, but also 33 treatments would have grinded me down too much with all the driving. I can't imagine a 2 hour drive for it. I wish your family were more sympathetic. In my case, the radiation so far has been pretty much nothing, but my BF keeps asking me every day how it went and how I'm doing. My RO seemed to think Ativan would be good to take during radiation therapy and asked me if I wanted a prescription. I'm not interested because I wouldn't be able to drive myself to radiation on it since it knocked me down, but my RO said it sounds like I'm a lightweight when it comes to Ativan. 2bluestars and soriya - my best thoughts and wishes for your surgeries! Hugs, Firecrackers! We're getting there. I'm off for zap #11 now and I'll be thinking of you all.",

I think of a person as a complainer when they do it all the time for no reason. We are venting about our pain and frustration here and you certainly have had MORE than your share during your treatment from what I've read. I have gone through this saying relatively little because I see others like you suffering so much more, but we've all had our reasons to vent, scream and cry at some time or another through this. We are all different. Radiation hasn't had the same effect on me of facing breast cancer every day - I mostly just stress over the horrible traffic to get there and back (the main reason why I bought a townhouse within walking distance of work) - but I understand what you are feeling. This is what has kept me from joining a support group or taking up kind offers by people to introduce me to family or friends who have been through this already. I don't want to be around more cancer than I need to be to get through my treatment at this point. I'll consider that later, but for now, I'm doing just I what I need to do for me to get through this. Radiation is hard because of the daily grind of it. I hate that I am having to wear a sticker over a big X near my nipple all the time on a very swollen breast that is starting to get red and sore because one of the tattoo positions needed to be moved after the CT scans were examined by my RO in her planning. I already feel like I look mutilated enough from the surgery scars. I can deal with it because it will be over soon and I've got my SO's support and care. It sounds like you have a much further drive than I do and I can't fathom doing that for 6 weeks. I can see why this is so emotionally horrible for you, especially if you've lost the sympathy and support at home now. It's good that you can concentrate on someone else at work as a distraction from cancer for a while. I hope your treatment will be shorter - my first day was laying still for about 45 minutes, but now they are usually pretty quick. I'm in and out in about 15 minutes except on the days that I have X-rays that are a little longer or meet with the RO or her nurse practitioner afterwards. Those longer days don't seem as bad as the simulation day or the first day when they were checking everything with X-rays.",

Walking up many time meant sitting on the stairs for a rest at the top or getting to my bed and flopping down for a rest. I have been complaining about this muscle weakness and fatigue so much lately, but I have to say that today I felt an increment of improvement now in my 4th week after the final chemo. I hope I'm finally going to start getting better now. For me, the muscle problems are the only chemo side effects I've got lingering and I wouldn't be hindered from having a surgery how I feel right now. Good luck tomorrow and I hope you'll bounce back from it by your surgery. Glad to hear your surgeries went well, 2bluestars and soriya.

I saw so many people say it didn't hurt to have it pulled out. Mine was a misery for 10 days and I almost went through the ceiling when the surgeon pulled it out. Congrats on your massive clear margins and nodes! Rambo - thinking of you and I hope you are recovering well. JeriGrace - \"Cut . . . Poisoned . . . Burned . . . DONE!!!\" Love it! That will be my battle cry on Tuesday! {{{Angela}}} Hang in there, dear! Have a good cry - that helped me get things out and get a little strength back to go forward with my last two chemo cycles. You have come so far and been through so much already. You can make it to the end! My hair and eyebrows are growing in like crazy. I am eating loads of protein every day for my rads, but I bet that's helping the hair growth too. I saved most of my brows and lashes throughout. I don't know if I was just lucky or if it was the Brian Joseph's conditioner - I think it was the conditioner because I ran out of it half way through and that's when I lost some lashes and brow hairs and the fallout stopped when I started up again with a new vial. Now that I'm done chemo, I switched to a brow growth accelerator and a lash serum I bought from Amazon for way cheaper. I'll need to get my brows shaped again soon as they are now very thick (becoming Brooke Shields!). I have some lingering neuropathy as well. Occasionally, I feel it in my toes and hands, but the thing that bothers me is my left hand - I've had some limitation in the movement and my grip. My RO gave me the okay yesterday on taking the B vitamins recommended by my MO for this (my MO said I could take them when I'm done rads, but my RO said I don't have to wait - I can't take vitamins that aren't an antioxidant). I feel lucky it's not worse like some of you have. This last week, I've finally felt some real progress in recovering from the muscle weakness and pain from chemo. Not really near normal yet, but I feel positive finally that things are going in the right way. If things keep going at this rate, I'm hoping I'll be able to get back to normal in time for some New Year's resolutions involving diet and exercise. My RO nurse suggested I check with the LE physical therapist I'm seeing on Monday about physical therapy to regain my strength. Is anyone doing physical therapy or joining exercise classes/groups for people finishing cancer therapies?",

I had considered joining but didn't meet the eligibility (Histologically confirmed malignancy for which platinum-based chemotherapy on a 21 day cycle or 14 day cycle is being recommended).  He also copied in the email some general information I hope he is okay with me sharing here.  \"If the oncologist agrees, the patient can fast for 3 days before and 1 day after chemo.  Depending on what type of chemo is being administered and at what intervals this could change. Patients should avoid re-feeding (resuming their regular diet) until the chemotherapy is below toxic blood levels (usually 24-48 hours after administration). Although we have seen a few negative side effects caused by fasting (high liver toxicity markers in 1 patient fasting and receiving a chemo cocktail) there are some potential risks so keep that in mind. For example, an early re-feeding immediately after the chemo could cause liver damage, because of the combination of hepatotoxic drugs with the proliferation of the liver caused by fasting. Also, several patients have fainted while taking hot showers after several days of fasting probably because of the major reduction in blood pressure and glucose levels after day 1 of fasting. The patient should also not drive or operate machinery and sho uld be preferably accompanied by someone during the fasting period. Most people can drive while they are fasting but for a few this could be a problem. Starting 24 hours after the chemotherapy, the patient should only eat rice or a similar source of carbohydrates + soups + fruit juices for a period of 24 hours. Then, a normal diet can be resumed, paying particular attention to nourishment (vitamins, minerals, proteins, essential fats). The patient should also try to return to within 2-3% of their body weight before doing another fasting cycle. Obese patients should consult their doctors on whether some of the weight loss caused by fasting is advisable and whether they should try to remain at the lower body weight. Diabetic patients should not undergo fasting unless this is approved by their diabetologist. Subjects on hypertension medication should also talk to their doctor about the blood pressure drop caused by fasting and the risk of combining it with medications. Until cli nical trials are completed fasting will remain an experimental procedure and should only be considered with the approval of the oncologist and when other viable options are not available or are known to be ineffective.\" The liver toxicity frightened me! That's why I opted to just do a reduction to 500 calories to just lighten up my food intake and alleviate some of the slow digestive tract issues.",
