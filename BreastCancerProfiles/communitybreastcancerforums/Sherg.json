Speaking of which, my sleeping pattern has changed from my usual 4hrs/ night to a whopping 14-15 hrs since July /Aug.  If I go to the grocery store and return home I need to sleep! My thyroid levels are normal. I don't think cancer does that so I really don't know what's going on.  I will call back the breast centre again next week.   I just need logical answers from these medical people. Thanks again ladies. ",

      "Content": "Sherg wrote: I found a large lump in my right breast in May. I mentioned it to my doc after they repeatedly called me in for abnormalities in my blood and urine results. One of the abnormalities was high white blood cells in the urine. They did urine culture and there were no bladder infections. My doctor felt the lump and said it was about 3cm and sent me to do an ultrasound and mammogram. The mammogram tech saw abnormalities and scheduled me for the ultrasound (US). The US tech said she needed to discuss the result with the radiologist. They discussed, then the tech took more mammo pics. This repeated three more times. I told her I had another appointment that I need to attend to, so she let me go. My doc mailed me today (three weeks later). In the letter although the results are NORMAL for both the last set of mammo and US which were done by the same tech, my doc has referred me to a breast specialist for a second opinion because she said the lump is large and easily palpable.  All kinds of cancers run in my family, on both  sides. My paternal grand mother and all her sisters, my paternal aunt and her daughter, my mom, and in May my sister. Of them all, only my little cousin survived (She had leukemia at 9). Last night when I finally mentioned my situation to my sister she said she too found a small lump a few years ago, but it turned out to be B9. But it did show up on the imaging. She suggested that I ask to do an MRI because she had many patients whose cancer didn't show up on ultrasound.  I am confused because I don't know why it would show up on the first mammo, but the last mammo and US results were normal and the lump never went away. What's the use getting an MRI anyways. Getting a normal result is great but that's only when they actually see the lump and find that it's B9. But when the large palpable lump doesn't show up on imaging that doesn't remedy situation.    Please provide some feedback. Log in to post a reply",
