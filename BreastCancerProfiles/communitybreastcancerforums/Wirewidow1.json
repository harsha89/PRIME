But, one year ago my mammogram was not perfect , and I also have had 3 markers placed in 2007 for calcification a which were benign. My report from 2011 states I have dense breasts, no kidding and radiologist suggested a US , neither the hospital or the breast surgeon chose to offer me additional screening and what do you think? One year later to the day, the radiologist rates me Birads 5 and wants a diagnostic mammogram and a US and a biopsy of the exact spot from 2011! I'm devastated at the neglect and I'm considering filing a medical malpractice against both the radiologist and the breast surgeon. A dentist could have read my report for all it's worth I'm presently taking 5 year plan of Tamoxifen and doing 33 rounds of whole breast radiation ! Tell me if anyone else has had similar issue Thanks",
