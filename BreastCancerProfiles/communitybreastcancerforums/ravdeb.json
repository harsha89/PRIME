She also had spots that were in the brain inself and it turned out she had it in her spinal fluid. Very hard to diagnose the latter. I was told by somebody at some point through this that it was 1) important to do the wbr or targeted rads quickyÂ  2) high doses of steroids are the standard procedure...must keep the swelling down..and these doses go on for a loooong time and 3) Not sure if this is fact but the wbr (perhaps targeted also?) opens up the barrier for chemos such as xeloda. My girlfriend started xeloda after the rads. I am no doctor and this is what we learned as she went through her treatments.I'm sure each patient is different but you seem to have gotten the runaround and that needs to stop! Can you get somebody in there to be your advocate? You need to get treated. JMO Thinking of you, Steph.",

      "Content": "Sep 20, 2007 11:00PM - edited Sep 20, 2007 11:03PM by ravdeb Laura.... I agree with you on a certain level. It's all about how one markets something. I was getting the feeling when I was in the States that it was actually a \"cool\" thing to have bc as opposed to a scary thing. It's now very in to wear necklaces with bc ribbons on them. I was given one by a woman who had bc and is now making them. And I love it and have worn it. But, it's popular to have bc now. I mean..it's prevalant but it's also a \"popular\" thing and the \"in\" thing. In some ways this is good for those who are suffering with it. It almost puts us in a fairy tale existence while we go through chemo. It's like it's okay...even good to have it. And that's where I stop. It is NOT good. It's deadly. It's NOT pink. And in fact, it's not a woman's disease. My uncle died of breast cancer. I didn't know this until this summer. (he was not a blood relative of mine). I agree...people need to be aware of it and get early detection. People need to help us find a cure. I agree. I think the walks are a terrific way of raising funds, meeting others with bc or those who are friends and families or just supporters for the cause. And I think that the fact there are so many walks across America, there is lots of awareness. I think the talks that people give like Tracy is doing and her work with ACS is terrific. Over our Rosh HaShana holiday a rabbi in Illinois gave her sermon about awareness of BRACA after a congregant died of ovarian cancer. I'm all for that. I'm not for the pink (pink is one of my fav colors but I won't admit to it! I do like purple when I'm not into pink!) that is everywhere and every little thing you buy has something about giving to breast cancer. I AM for teaching others about it and making them more aware. I don't even trust those companies and wonder if my money is really going there. Okay..I'm off my soap box. My mom is out of surgery. She had a knee replacement. Just spoke to my dad. I wish I was there. I had my flight arrangements before I knew she needed surgery. I wanted to stay but I needed to get home. My dad is well equipped to care for her. Still....she's in pain but in good spirits and wanted to know when she could start her exercising. She is not even out of surgery 24 hours! Be well, Ladies.",

There are other factors as well such as being overweight, if it's your dominant side or not and some other stuff..not sure what.... Kelly..I like the cartoon. It is so true. Most people here get Fridays and Saturdays off of work. Teachers work 5 days a week meaning that nobody works on Saturdays but teachers have to schedule in their other day off as there is school at most schools on Fridays. And yes..they get holidays off...the schools, for example, are off for a week for Sukkot but business have one or two days off and then are open during the week of the holiday. Then they will close again at the end of Sukkot for the holiday of Simchat Torah. Confusing, I know. Nothing closes for Chanukah as that is not a religious holiday and is our least important holiday of the year. The holiday lasts 8 days but school is closed for about 3 days out of that holiday. The longer mid-year school holiday is in the spring for Passover...school is closed for 2 and a half weeks. My dh only takes Yom Kippur off. He has to. Nobody...I mean NOBODY works on this holy day here in Israel. Otherwise, he takes no days off unless we decide to go away for a weekend (rare) or he goes with me to the States (summer 2008 he plans to go with me for 2 weeks). Such is life....",

I feel like this was is trying to skim off the computer dummies. that's me. I'm still in Florida til next Sunday. I don't believe I read all your messages here since it's too confusing for the computer dummy here, but I will be sending little packages to those of you who didn't make it to the Rock tober Fest.Â  There is talk of another Fest and I hope that we can have it in a territory that is not too expensive to arrive at, stay at, eat at, play at, etc at. I WANT TO BE THERE!Â  The Rocktober Fest is still fresh in my mind partly because I'm still on my trip and haven't entered routine mode yet. Good thing I'm here. Dh has become a maniac pomegranate juice maker because he had pomegranates he couldn't market..overripe. so he is making a huge pomegranate mess in my kitchen my dd reported. good thing I am not THERE! My dog misses me and is depressed so reports dd and youngest son. DD says that our cats are acting like dogs. hmmmmmmmm Youngest son who is in charge of watering my plants forgot to water plants on entrance porch so plants are dead. DD reports that the house is a pit and there is now a sign on the fridge door to remind family members to wash out juice glasses cuz the ants have invaded. I'm reading The Devil Wears Prada (obviously I'm on vacation mode if this entertaining me! I did see the movie last year) and I wanna buy a Prada bag now! OY VEY...I'd better get back to Israel FAST!

It should have arrived in Tel Aviv by now. HUMPH! It's weird to be back. And I hate these new boards. I don't have time now to read all the things everybody wrote but I did read that Paula wasn't feeling well so, Paula..feel better. Those zinc things are great. Debbie..I hope the chemical way will work for you. Mary...I'm with you. Also..I love your new avatar because that is what you look like and now I can even hear your voice in your written words and see your face the way I know you! Our meeting that weekend was certainly the highlight of my trip abroad. I only wish all the women had been there. Next time... I'm zonked and am off to bed. Tomorrow I'll clean the house. It's unorganized and there's nothing to eat here! Send some good luck that my luggage will arrive safely tomorrow! Be well! Cindy..hope you are doing okay.",

No node involvement but last Jan. she found a weird lump on the affected side..swelling...and so she had a biopsy and there was cancer found. She then had a mastectomy but no further treatments were recommended. She's young..about 32. She said the doctor couldn't be sure if it was new cancer or something left over. That's when she said she needed to have her breast removed. It was nice seeing her. She hadn't cut her hair at all since she finished chemo and now has long, almost shoulder length soft curls. She never had curly hair before. Last time I saw her she had short hair..that must have been a year ago... Anyway..it was fun to see them again. We spent a lot of time together when we did our chemo...weekly...",

I'm not totally obsessed with getting it back, but it's like a dark shadow over my head, if you know what I mean. It is on my mind a lot and I still haven't gone through a day, no matter how busy I am, when I don't think about cancer. I am reminded of it constantly with my back ache because that started during treatments so that is my time line. I look in the mirror and see my gray/white hair and I know that if it hadn't been for the chemo I would still be dying my hair black. Maybe i'd look younger. Maybe I'd feel younger too if I hadn't had the chemo and of course if I hadn't been diagnosed. I think the diagnosis aged me even without the chemo and the physical aging. I think it made me older in the way I think and sometimes that is good and sometimes I just feel really old and am mad about that.",

If you've never seen one (I hadn't) it's an exotic fruit from S. America (my father in law said we've been growing them in Israel for about 10 years). It's bright pink on the outside with some green type thing on it..it's a cactus fruit. It's white on the inside with tiny black eatable seeds. The flavor is nothing special..not very strong or anything..but it's a beautiful fruit. I can picture using them as centerpieces....",

I'm angry that our medical world here relies heavily on the studies in the States and on what the American Cancer Society says. We do our own studies here too and many things come out of Israel as well, but we still rely on all of that which is the reason I was given AC to begin with.",

On gmail you can have a running conversation much like the boards and there's no limit on inbox messages. It holds tons of messages so no worry there. You can have a separate gmail just for rocktober women and then it's easy to find the messages and keep the conversation going. You can post pictures and attach things with no problem of how heavy it is. Think about it.... It's very simple. Must go to bed now!",

How do you keep your sanity? Laura..how was your speech? Mary..that is THE prayer for Yom Kippur and is repeated all day long. I will admit that I only went to services at the very end to hear the shofar. I can't get to my own syngogue that is part of the Progressive Movement in Israel. This is because on Yom Kippur nobody drives and so I would have to drive there before the holiday begins (sunset the day before) and stay until sunset of the day of the holiday. Since that isn't possible for many reasons, I have only the orthodox synagogue in our village and for a zillion reasons, I do NOT like their services. Yep, Kelly, we have Sukkot starting on Wed evening. Nice, fun holiday. It is a week long and at the end we have Simchat Torah which celebrates finishing the entire Torah and we begin it from the beginning again. That holiday, 2 years ago...started on the day of my first chemo treatment of AC. I went after my treatment and danced with everybody else since I was feeling great then. I have mixed feelings about this holiday now....' My mom is okay and was moved to rehab yesterday. I spoke to her. She sounded not as chipper as the other day. I will talk to her today and see how she is in the rehab. She wanted to be in a different one so I think she was unhappy that she didn't get into the one she wanted to be in. But she's tough. She'll do well, I think. I was back at my beach today! Life is good. Be well, everybody! I hope to get on and chat with y'all one time. I can be up late one time and do it with you. It's not easy, though to do it at 3 am! maybe on a weekend when you aren't working we can all get on.",

When I moved to Israel I told my dh that if I were to ever get really sick (and of course, I never thought I would) I would not be able to deal with the Israeli bureaucracy. Boy..I managed and better than I ever thought I would! Cindy...you taught me a new word...disabuse. I actually looked it up in the dictionary! Thanks!",

Well..you are going for pt, right? Massages should help get the swelling down, I think. I read that. I don't have LE. You are not overweight, Gail! I saw you!!! Those who are overweight (not by a few pounds, Gail!) tend to be at a higher risk for LE. That is only one of the things. There are others, of course, and the biggest one is the amount of nodes removed. The other things are secondary, I believe. But I read that just the surgery itself on the breast can put you at risk for LE. If that is the case, then if you did a prophy on one side with no node surgery, you are at risk on that side, as well.... This is what I read on the lymphedema thread by Binney....",

So, now I'm afraid to try. I noticed though, that if I keep moving I'm fine. I clocked my walk on the beach. It'sÂ close to 5Â kilometers and no pain. Kinda hard to keep walking in my sleep though.

Nice to see you posting here. Good luck with all your gastro tests. Doesn't sound too pleasant but at least you'll have some answers. That's the important part. Brenda...I was wondering where you were! Glad to hear you do not have LE. I think you putting Little Johnny on the tall cabinet is definitely good exercise. I approve!",

Tracy...you are great! I love that Hope sign. Can't wait to see the pics of that. good luck with the walk! Well..I will admit that here we will see two holiday \"symptoms\" early...one for Chanukah. The bakeries will be selling the jelly filled donuts very soon and they will be sold out all the time til way after Chanukah. Just as we have fattened up on those...they will start making the 3 cornered pastries called \"hamentachen\" in yiddish or \"oznei haman\" in Hebrew for Purim.Â These are filled with all kinds of goodies..dates, nuts, poppy seed, jellies and even chocolate. Next question... Would it be possible to keep our conversations on gmail? I am finding this time consuming to check in here as well as there AND I haveÂ other e-mail accts I check daily in connection with my congregation and other personal things. I do come on BCO often and browse but I don't always write. i do want to keep up with all of you so........... or..do we separate and keep bc related events of any kind here, and other life events on gmail?",

I agree with Laura..it's too much to keep up with all the different e-mails and I get a lot of them from lots of people outside of the rocktober women! I set up a gmail strictly for the rocktober women but it means signing in and out. Of course, I sign in here, too. I am so saddened by Shelli's passing. She was so tough and had so many difficulties at the end but sounded in good spirits until she could no longer post. I'm so sorry. And she left young children and a young husband behind. BC is not pretty or fun in any way. We had fun on our weekend meeting each other but the fact is that BC is ugly and deadly. I was distraught in many ways over the pink mania that is happening in the States. This is not something that is happening in the rest of the world. BC has turned into aÂ commercialized frolic in America and I was stunned by that. Here in Israel there is little \"pink\" around although the idea is beginning to catch on and I did find something that you can buy and a small donation will be given for bc research. Israel enjoys copying America's gimmicks but I really hope that it doesn't do what America has done. The walks in America are great and I wish we had that here, but the rest of the pink stuff can go, IMO. When a bc sister dies, is suffering with mets or whatever, it confirms my feelings about this. My friend here is suffering with lung mets from bc and will be on treaments all her life, probably, with all the side effects. It's not pretty and it's scary.",

I tried to get him to ride his bike for a fundraiser for something else (he's an avid mountain biker) but he wouldn't do that, either. Oh well... I picture you in the jacuzzi because that's where you were when I arrived on Fri at the hotel! Gail..enjoy the rain. We got a bit of it but it ended as quickly as it came. Hopefully we'll get enough rain this winter to fill the Sea of Galilee and supply us with water. ya never know here in the desert. My mom is doing okay in rehab. Hopefully she won't need to stay there too long and can do pt at home. Not sure. I'll talk to her later on today...much later. I keep falling asleep. I can only talk to her when it's evening there and well..that's past my bedtime.. My sciatica is not behaving. I slept on a really bad sofabed at my parents' and ever since then, my leg has been aching a LOT. I'm not doing anything for it. I guess if it gets intolerable, I'll see the doctor. Still haven't scheduled my mammo or US and that was supposed to be done in Sept. Guess I missed that! Just don't feel like doing any of that... It's a holiday here..Sukkot...so all the kids are home and we grilled meat outside and ate out on the patio last night. Our evenings are finally cooler as Fall settles in for a while.... Be well everybody...",

Wonder why your pic didn't come through, though... Something weird with your posts! I finally made appts for my mammo and US. Oct 22nd. They will do both of them on the same day. That's unusual...they used to tell me I had to wait a week. Back and legs (both) are in pain. Sciatica. It has been like this since I slept on a sofa bed at my parents'. Seems the right leg is getting worse and I'm having a hard time getting comfy at night. It's an ache, not a strong pain. I'm off to walk it off at the beach. Gotta keep myself moving and maybe it will slowly disappear... Have a good day, everybody!",

I can take Tylenol but I'm not taking it. I hate meds and I take enough stuff. If the pain is unbearable, I'll obviously take something. When I had pains with RA when I was hospitalized with my chemo catastrophe, I did take some strong pain killers and when they took me off of them to get a more accurate blood test, I complained big time. I was in terrible pain though. This is not TERRIBLE and it's not life threatening. It is uncomfortable and literally a pain in the as*! It is frustrating and makes me mad. And in the back of my mind I'm wondering if it's mets. It's WAAAAAAAAAAAYY back there but it's there...will ask my onc when I see her whenever that is... I also wanted to add that for those women I've met...when you write, I can hear your voices..especially Mary-Anne's when you wrote about how you were..uhm...you-know-what! I could just hear you saying that and laughing! Be well everybody...Check out the gmail..I believe a chat is going to happen this weekend! Bring out the martinis! And as an aside...today is my Hebrew calendar anniversary of my first chemo..AC. I am not really that up on the Hebrew calendar but I had my first chemo on the day of the holiday of Simchat Torah which begins tonight. I had chemo in the morning and went dancing in celebration at our temple that night...I'm off to dance again if my sciatica allows me to..tonight.",

When I was in the States I was browsing the Halloween aisles at Michaels and turning on all the spooky sounds, like a little kid. I sure love that store! I used to love Halloween when I was a kid. I still like the candy corn and had to stop myself from buying it when I saw it! I've got a Michely project I may be doing this year...renovating my studio..actually moving my studio to another locale in my house. Once I figure out where, I plan to alter my studio into an apartment...big plans and this may never happen but...I'm on the road to Michelyhood.",

It IS cute BUT it would mean taking care of it every morning. I'm a lazy bum and need a \"do\" that I don't \"do\" anything to, if you know what I mean!!!!! I confess...I do not even own a comb or brush. I use fingers only and sometimes some hair cream. Â I sometimes dry my hair with the blowdryer but that's only if I need to leave the house early and it's cold out. Otherwise, I prefer to let it dry naturally as it seems to lay better. I like the color stuff..the chunky stuff. Just that I'm sooooooooooooooo white and I already have black (my original hair color) underneath the white so when I use hair creams, the black shows and my hair looks grayer. I hope that my hair dilemma is the biggest problem I have in 2008.Â HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYBODY!!!!",

In some cases it is necessary and in others they feel it is not. Â My lump was seen on the mammo and ultrasound because I found it first and it was visible with the naked eye because it was just under the skin (and I still wonder when it popped up so suddenly). Â I have extremely dense breasts and the radiologist says that my mammos and ultrasound are useless. Last year I requested a breast MRI and the insurance rejected it (even though my oncologist spoke to the head doctor in the insurance about it) because the mammo showed my first lump. This year my onco requested it again and I got the MRI. It showed my affected side to be fine (this is already 3 years after diagnosis) but my right side has an abnormal spot that needs to be followed up. I did US and mammo and of course, they didn't see it. It's very tiny. I have a follow up MRI in December at a different hospital and it will be interesting to see if they see it. MRI's pick up everything. The doctor who analyzes it must be well trained and experienced to distinguish between the benign abnormalities and something that warrants a biopsy. Well..that's what they told me. I'm just repeating what I've been told. My personal onc told me to pay for the MRI and do it every 2-3 years. On the other years do mammo and ultrasound. I doubt I'll do anymore mammos..just my personal feeling..because for me it's wasted, painful and just gives me more radiation because she can't read them anyway. Â They are not using MRI's as a regular screening process and it is really just diagnostic or for those with very dense breasts. Well..again..that's what I read.",

I was just at the onc today who read the report (she's the second onc to read it) and she said it's all clear and not to worry about it. More than that, it was recommended to have another MRI in a year and the onc said \"we will talk about it at your next appt\". She said I should have a mammo, this same radiologist (best in our country I was told) will read the mammo and decide from that. I have dense breasts and for two years now the radiologist who was reading my mammos says she just sees all white. I don't know who to believe!",

I was looking for a post from you because my good friend whom I've written on the boards about who has brain mets, was recently diagnosed with mets in the spinal fluid as well. She is now getting rads. She is hospitalized (common here because the insurance covers it) and is bedridden as well. I keep in touch with her family daily but she hasn't been feeling up to talking to anyone. It's good to see you on here. They told me that if the rads don't help, she may get chemo but most likely directly into the spinal fluid via spine injections as opposed to the omaya. I'm guessing at this. What's good to read is that among all the terribly bad things about the progression, you are finding the good things...family around you. My friend feels this, too. You are a wonderful inspiration. I hope they figure out that foot stuff. Huge, big cyber hugs for you! editing...she would get the omaya IF she is up to it. Just spoke with the family....",

Horner's syndrome is a symptom of other conditions. They didn't find a brain tumor. I have a dissected carotid artery. This causes the horners syndrome. Don't wait.. see a neurologist and ask for a brain scan and a CT angio which is a vascular ct. It was the CT angio that showed the dissected artery(common cause of horners..). It's important to know what the cause of the syndrome is. Be sure to beÂ TESTED for Horners syndrome. It's important to know if it's REALLY horners syndrome. Horners syndrome in and of itself is harmless. You eye will never close all the way. It's the CAUSE of it that can be deadly.. Please get this checked out! I'm under care of a few doctors for this.

One spot was benign as shown by a washout. The other was not confirmed. Was recommended I have follow up MRI in 3 months. I just did an ultrasound and mammogram, as requested by onc, and they couldn't see anything but the radiologist said my breasts are too dense to be able to see much. I'm approved for a breast MRI in a different hospital because they believe too many are false positive in the hospital I had mine in September. I don't have my MRI scheduled yet as I'm trying to get in between appts because they are booked till who knows when. Would they do a biopsy on the spot if they saw the spot again and felt it was suspicious? I would be concerned about the pain and would want to take something prior. Â Any thoughts?",

I was interviewed on this subject for a TV talk show here in Israel. And this is exactly what I said about it. My fight was to get oncologists to offer this test.

Nothing happened the first time I flew overseas but this year I decided no to take any chances. I got my breast surgeon to write that I do need it even though he doesn't agree. The LE therapist recommends it. I got sleeve and gauntlet and honestly, I took a long flight of over 10 hours and I had no discomfort with the sleeve or gauntlet, no swelling...no nothing. It's so worth preventing a problem. You can usually get an off the shelf variety for prevention only. This is what I got. I had it fitted by an LE therapist but didn't need a custom made one. I am still not sure if my insurance will cover it...must go check on that. I filled out all the papers. You'll be surprised to see other people wearing these things on the flights. There is a controversy as to whether LE can occur because of a flight and I say that until proven otherwise, I'm taking precautions.",
