    "Content": "SusanJoy wrote: Had lumpectomy 7/6, SNB was clear, but m.r.i. and p.e.t. scan showed an enlarged internal mammary node.  It is behind the sternum and have been told that it is too dangerous to remove or biopsy, even with ultrasound guided needle.  It has complicated the recommended treatment.  One oncologist says chemo, but not aggressive (2 medicines, 3+ months) and then radiation.  2nd oncologist says should be aggressive (3 medicines, 3+months, then single medicine 3+months) and then radiation.  Has anyone had an internal mammary node enlarged?  Biopsied?  How aggressively were you treated? Thanks, so much for answers. Log in to post a reply",
