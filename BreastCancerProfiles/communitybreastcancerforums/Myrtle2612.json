On stomach, arms fell asleep & board hurt my ribs. Had cramps in shoulders. Was sore for two days after. They called me 4 days later & said they had to redo it cuz I wasn't centered on board....eye roll. Head rad did the remapping today & got it approved by physicist & rad onc while I was there. Not sore from today's mapping. Thursday they do the simulation. I have 6 weeks of rad. Llamalady thanks for the green tea idea - I'll try it!  Looking forward to getting it over with as well. My calcium levels have continued to increase through this journey & med onc had Parathyroid levels checked & they were high & says it indicates hyperparathyriodism- which may have contributed to my breast cancer. Now I will need to have parathyroid surgery after rad. Hopefully after that life can calm down. DH & I own business - so I have to continue to work so hoping fatigue isn't too bad.  Dx 5/18/17 IDC, ER+, PR+, HERS2-, stage 1A, 2cm, grade 3 Surgery 6/5/17 right lumpectomy, sentinel & auxiliary nodes -",

My rad is at 8:20am (not a morning person) & by the time I get home from work at 6pm I'm ready for bed. Hoping the fatigue will lesson. I've heard exercise helps but not sure when I can fit it in. Over yesterday & today, I've developed all these bruises on my arms & legs. I've done nothing to cause them. Probably unrelated to rads but will mention it to RO tomorrow. Have any of you had this happen? My MO told me I'd need to take tamoxifen for 5 to 10 years. I'm 48 & premenopausal.

My fatigue lessened Tuesday night & ive felt fine ever since, not sure why but I'll take it :)  Gp is testing my liver enzymes & told me to take organic vitamin C for my easy bruising. Congrats on for those of you that finished! Must be awesome feeling to be on the other side of that hurdle! On the natural deodorants topic, I first tried freedom & regular native but both had baking soda in them & it irritated my skin & turned it darker. I now use the native cotton & lily for sensitive skin without baking soda & it works just great.
