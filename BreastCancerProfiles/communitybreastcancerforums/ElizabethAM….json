The first session, I didn't seem to have any SE's except fatigue. When I went to get my blood tested before my second session, I was using 300mg shots of nupergen for 7 days after my treatment. My blood count was .6 on Wednesday. I had to go early on Friday to have a second blood test done and it was up to 1.7, so I had my second session. This time is weird. I have had indigestion since the infusion.. Feels like something is stuck under the lower part of the breast bone. I have drunk a lot of water, and that helps some, but it comes back with the next meal. In the afternoon after lunch, I get chills and cover up completely and then sleep for 5 hours. Has anyone else had this problem?",

This is a link to tips about managing the SE'S. It might have something to help http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/chemotherapy... Lori - my husband has to work on the days of my treatments too. I have a BFF who takes me there and picks me up too. If I have any problems she would keep me at her place till my DH gets off work. Also here in Canada there is a rides program run by the cancer society and they take you to and from treatments.   YAY !! I'm sprung. My blood tests are up to pre-chemo levels. So if all goes well my 3rd session should take place on Friday as scheduled. One of the oncologists on the floor told me my port placement looks like it is scheduled for the 13th. That will give it a little more than a week to heal before it has to be used.",

Got up on Wednesday and had a hell of a time moving around. It hurt and I was so tired. I had to go to the nursing office to get the dressing changed and there I found out why. It was so bruised... Happily, no problems with the incision sites, but I was pooped... Slept most of the day and night... Had a couple of hours with my hubby for supper and then back to bed. This morning it was so much better... The dressings were much smaller, and I felt rested at least until this afternoon. Then I slept some more... At least I cleaned up the kitchen... Hopefully I can do some laundry tomorrow. I have to keep it covered till Sunday, then I can remove the dressing and shower. Next week is my 4th session of AC and the first one that will be done with the port. They changed my day from Friday to Thursday, so I'll let you know how things go.",

Just trying to get through the rest of my Herceptin treatment. We went to Rotan in September and met a wonderful couple from Colorado with whom we spent half of our vacation. I wound up with a really bad urinary infection and had a trip to the hospital there. Thankfully antibiotics knocked it out. The rest of the vacation was awesome. Then I went to Little Rock to spend most of a week with my 92 year old father and step-mom. I had a wonderful visit with them before I left to go to my home town of Shreveport for my 50th High School Reunion. That was a great thing. I was able to see my best friends (we were friends from 1st grade and have stayed in touch all these years) Then back home to Canada. I am so very glad I was able to go. My husband is an angel (most of the time, LOL) My last Herceptin was in October, 2017. It was so great to finally ring that last bell. It took a couple of months for them to schedule the removal of the port, but that was the last vestige of the treatments. The beginning of 2018 was spent getting my strength back. Walking more and working in the garden. In May, we went to Costa Rico with the couple we had met in Rotan and some of their friends. It was a good trip and I was able to snorkel a lot while we were there. Brad and I watched a documentary when we came back home on Prime TV called The Magic Pill. It talked about the Keto Diet. This is a diet that changes your metabolism from sugar burning to fat burning for energy. Since cancer lives off sugar for growth, we started this diet. I said what did I have to loose, I am hoping it will help prevent a recurrence. I have lost about 40 lbs since May and have decided to stick with it in one of its forms or another. If interested here is a link to explain : https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ketogenic-die... This July, I took a PADI Open Water Diver course and became a certified scuba diver. It was very gratifying. At the end of this month we are going on another trip with the couple from the States. This time we are going to Bonaire where the diving is extraordinary. Brad said it would be a perfect place for my first diver vacation. I am back to singing again. Jam nights and karaoke with my friend, Luann. She was by my side through all of the treatments and I love her as if she were a sister. This is not the latest picture, but it is a good one since my hair came back in. It was taken at a jam session by a good friend. I'm skinnier now. LOL I thank all of you for your support during that time and hope that everyone is doing well. Love, Elizabeth",

It Sure works well and I recommend it to anyone doing an 8 dose or more Chemo followed by Herceptin for a year. One of my first cultures came back with a Gram Positive Bacilli, but they have not localized which one yet. So more antibiotics and I may get to go home on the weekend",

The next day I went to the masseuse. 30 minutes of deep tissue massage then she did lymphatic drainage on my chest and shoulders. After this you have to drink a ton of water and sometimes you hurt more the next day, but boy did that help my situation.

That time I passed and was able to proceed with the treatment. Treatment # 4, which was my last, the doctor lowered the dosage in the hopes that I would not have that problem. If you start running a fever over 100 F, get to the hospital... Cali -- So sorry to hear about your throat. I sure hope it clears up in a hurry. The session went well. I was given steroids to take 12 hours before treatment and the same for 6 hours before treatment (5 pills each). At the clinic I was given Benadryl and Zantac, then a 30 min. Saline drip was started as a timer. After the Taxol was started and it was a 3 hour treatment, followed by a 10 min saline flush of my port. the final step was a flush the port with heparin. I was good to go. My BFF Luann, picked me up and drove me to her house where I had left my car. I went grocery shopping and then went home and slept for about 2 hours. Next time my session will be 5 and 1/2 hours. They are adding the Herceptin with the Taxol. I have to be observer for 1 hour after I receive the Herceptin. ",

My Herceptin was added when I had my second Taxol treatment and that medication I will get every 3 weeks for a year. I started my Hormone therapy 30 days after I my chemo was finished. Rads started on Jan. 3, which was about 4 weeks after chemo. I have 16 treatments every week day for 3 and 1/2 weeks. I now have 3 treatments left to do.

I was told it would just mean that I would not be able to hold a note as long as I had before. So far I have not seen a problem. To help with lung function there is an exercise for singers.. Lay on the floor and blow up a balloon without puffing out your cheeks. This builds up the diaphragm. My GP put me on extra vitamin D, because it is necessary for calcium absorption. I also take extra B-12 and B-6 to try to help with energy and the neuropathy I have from the Taxol. I also take calcium/magnesium supplements to try to combat osteoporosis as I was already osteopina when I started cancer treatment. My Rad treatment tanned a good portion of my underarm and chest. The tan is slowly fading, but I am also having intermittent shock like pains. I have been told these are the nerves healing. After the lumpectomy, I did not notice much change in the size of the affected breast. After Rads, it does appear a bit smaller. Glad everyone is doing well.",

I think this is because of the effect of the Rads on the lung. I have gotten some B-6 and B-12 to help with the nuropathy in my feet and hands. The hands are not affect very much, but the toes and balls of my feet are worse. AND I finally have some peach fuzz on my noggin.",

I have decided to go ahead with that even though I will lose 10% of lung capacity in the left lung. I am really glad to be here.. It is good to know I am not as alone as I felt. I'm still kind of scared ",
