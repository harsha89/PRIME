Just earlier this week, we found out that she has brain mets with edema because of her severe headaches. She has lost coordination of her right hand and leg. Let me say this, you are so lucky to me living in a developed country like the U.S versus us living in a third world country like Fiji where we lag behind in terms of medical infrastructure and basic health care. I sent my mom to India for treatment in 2014 because there was nothing that could be done here in Fiji. Anyway, with the help of her oncologists in India, we have started Dexamethasone 8mg 12 hourly and it seems to help. She has been on oral chemo (cyclophosphamide) 50mg daily for last 3 years. I would love to hear more from you especially when you have used Dexamethasone. We are new to it and do not know what to expect as side effects.  I would appreciate if you could please private message me. Wishing your mom good health always. Take care. Kind Regards Jabid",
