I did a clinical trial with more chemo than most to see if it would help in recurrance. It didnt. I am now 39 and a single mom with 6 children. 3 at home. 2 out of the house grown and 1 that i had to send to his fathers house because he isnt handling this divorce or me being sick well and has been showing out more than normal(he has adhd and i believe he is bipolar or high functioning autism) His tantrums at the age of 12 are horrific and he can be so hateful. I feel like i cannot get a grip in my life. Many times i feel alone and wish i just had my family back even if it is dysfunctional. My oldest hasnt spoken to me in a year and still hasnt spoken to me since the diagnosis. I try to keep focus on the children that are here and especially my onky daughter thay is just 10 years old.",
