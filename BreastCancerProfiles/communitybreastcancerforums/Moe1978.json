My husband is my biggest supporter, he kisses me as  where my scars are and he always tells me he is so glad I am here with him.  I also love that on the weekends or when I am home from work I don't have to have my bra on.  I just wear a t-shirt.  I am also glad I don't have to worry about mammograms any longer. ",
