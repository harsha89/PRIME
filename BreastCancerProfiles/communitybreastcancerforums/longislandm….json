I have not gotten any pathology back yet...but I a, thinking and praying the fact they only took SNB (2 in BC side and 1 in prophy side) is a good sign. I have not been on painkillers since yesterday. Just tylenoland a bit of Valium at night. I am lucky and the pain has never been too bad...but that probably varies from person to person. I was on IV pain for a day and vicodan for 3 days. I am up and around...but limited. I have walked around the block, gone to get my hair washed and blown, and walk around the halls. But I am still very very tired.. I am tight and sore, but nothing is unbearable. I am basically lounging around and napping between visitors. I'm planning on giving myself two weeks before I really try to do much...need to get these drains out first! I know it's easier to say this than to believe it...but the anxiety of surgery truly is the worst part. You can get through this!!!! Fel free to ask any questions. Best of luck.",

Prob an A cup ( I was DDD) before. They saved extra skin for expansion so they are kind of lumpy and irregular looking.and my incisions are probably larger than most because of the size of my breasts....but the appearance doesn't bother me. I know I need to be patient. The TE makes your chest feel tight...like u r wearing a bra inside. Not pleasant...but ok. Honestly, I am more focused and concerned re: good path report next week. Maybe after that I'll worry about boob look!!!",

I am still putting out a lot of fluid, so I think I'll be stuck with them through next week. Re: camisole...the hospital discharged me with three compression camisole/ bras which I wear 24/7. They have Velcro loops to hold drain bulbs. During the day I wear zip up sweatshirt from target with interior pockets. Love these! Champion makes them and highly recommend. A gal on the march mast list told me about it...great find! Also, I sleep sitting up,in bed. I have a pillow structure we built from a zillion pillows. Two must important ones are the big body pillows. I bought thiose at target, too. Sleeping is definitely the biggest challenge. Some girls get recliners... Otherwise invest in pillows!",

I started to read from the very beginning but there's just so many so I'm just trying to pick up.  this sounds like a great group.  I found a lump under my left breast on March 28, mammogram on April 10, biopsies on April 12, was told on April 16 I had breast cancer, met with a surgeon on the 17th who said it was Stage 1 and i would have to have a partial mastectomy - scheduled for April 30.  Yesterday surgeon;s  office called to say there was some more information they received from the MRI I had last Friday, and they want to discuss a full mastectomy tomorrow.  This whole time I feel like I've been on a runaway train just hanging on for dear life, but tomorrow I put the breaks on.  If he tells me I should have a full mx I will tell him I want to put the surgery on hold at least until I talk to a plastic surgeon and weigh my options and thoughts about reconstruction.  I'm not completely informed on all of this, so I want to know exactly what I'm doing and what I NEED, not what I'm told to do.  My question is do you think waiting a week or so while I sorted out my options and decided what to do (about reconstruction if necessday) would be a bad thing?
