Does anyone else experience pain on the inside of your forearm?  ",

I just got my diagnosis yesterday and have been wishing i had something to help with this big scary feeling of dread that is always there.

And i don't know if it's appropriate to ask the surgeon who removed the tumor and gave me the diagnosis.  Your meltdown was absolutely normal. Having someone non-judgmental to listen to you at the mental health center would be very helpful.  It can't hurt.  Reach out for whatever help you can find.",

When she was finished, she proudly presented it to me, explaining that she had drawn  me with long hair because that's how it used to be before i got sick.  Then she said she drew it for me so that when I died she would put it in my casket so that I would always remember them all.  It was so sweet and kind of funny, but i lost it and started crying.

Choose one that you trust & respect.  If the pathology report comes back with good news, the lumpectomy might be all the surgery she needs...maybe with chemo and/or radiation to follow.  If the tumor is large or aggressive, further surgery may be needed, followed by the appropriate treatment.
