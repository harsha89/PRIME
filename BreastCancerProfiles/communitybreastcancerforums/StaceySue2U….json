I was able to be calm and keep it together during the day but night was an entirely different story. Every time I woke up I'd remember I had breast cancer and start crying, and my husband said I was even crying in my dreams. I'm crying now, remembering what it was like. That was the worst time ever. Before I had my BMX I had the bone scan, chest and abdominal CT and was just convinced they'd find something. They didn't find anything. Then I had my BMX and they got nice clear margins and after that I never woke up scared and crying again. I'd wake up and remember \"it's gone and it's going to stay gone,\" and then roll over and go back to sleep. (Well not literally roll over - LOL - that wasn't exactly possible post op) I don't have an aggressive form so chemo won't work for me but they have me taking letrozole. The BMX recovery isn't the greatest. I've had one drain in for 4 weeks already and yesterday had to have another one put in because they pulled the others too early. But - no more crying :) The physical pain is NOTHING compared to the emotional pain I was having. Now it's just waiting, waiting, waiting for this all to be over so I can get back to my life. I'm sorry to hear about the discouraging answer to the egg harvesting question. That adds an additional layer of sadness for you. I wish there was something I could say to make you feel better about that.",

I learned that I have 2 tumors in my right breast, the biggest is 3.5 cm and I also have an 8cm long line of microcalcifications that need to be looked at further. I'm having an MRI on the 4th. They're calling it stage 2A for now but I have a bad feeling that it's worse than that. My aunt only had one 2cm tumor when she was diagnosed and 4 years later she was stage IV. 18 months ago, she was informed she had 2 months to live so I guess she's doing pretty well, considering everything. She was HER2+, ER+,PR-. Since my diagnosis I've learned that my dad has had 2 aunts and 13 cousins with cancer and he has a mass on his lung that is being monitored. His brother died 5 yrs ago of lung cancer at age 50. My aunt had her blood drawn for genetic testing today and I have an appointment for genetic testing. We're not sure, but my grandpa might have been Jewish. I've already decided to get bilateral mastectomy, don't know if I'll have to have chemo first or not. I want to get DIEP reconstruction and my breast surgeon says when she does the mastectomy she'll put tissue expanders in and I can have the DIEP when I'm done with treatment. Why not immediate reconstruction? Does she think I'll need radiation? I wonder if the expanders will be over or under the muscle. I can't stop obsessing over it, reading this forum for hours. People keep trying to reassure me - because they know survivors. It doesn't help because 2 months ago I was assuming I'd live to be 100. Now I get to feel lucky if I make it another 10 years. I'm 46.

EstelaLorca you're right - I felt like I was losing my mind and now that I have my makers back I'm feeling a little better. I'm sorry you got cancer at such a young age. God bless you! This morning I got the first bit of good news I've had yet. My markers came back and it's 100% ER+, 2% PR+, Her2- and ki67 is only 1%. They're going to give me my oncotype after surgery. I should be hearing back with them about the surgery date some time today, the breast surgeon is coordinating with the plastic surgeon. They are planning to do skin sparing mastectomies but I can't keep my nipples. They're still not willing to do immediate DIEP reconstruction but they will put the tissue expanders in and wait for the circulation to the skin to be completely restored before doing the DIEP. I'm being seen at KU Cancer Center and it's one of the best cancer centers in the US. They have several dedicated breast surgeons and do the surgeries and reconstructions every day. While I've been waiting for some sort of treatment to start, I've been using frankincense per my aunt's recommendation. She's been using some different complementary therapies and she says her cancer hasn't gone away but it seems to have stopped growing. She was given 2 months to live, 18 months ago. So I've been doing the frankincense oil on both breasts and under my tongue and have ordered the other therapies she's using and they should come in the mail soon. I started having sharp burning pain in different parts of both breasts. I don't know if the frankincense has anything to do with it. This morning I did a thorough check of one of the spots where I've been feeling a pain and I can feel a deep lump there that I didn't feel before. I have large breasts and this spot would have been very easy to miss. My guess is that it's been there all along but I'm wondering why it started hurting. I've been reading that pain is common when chemo starts to work - so maybe the frankincense is doing something good. . ",

Must be the child in me - ridiculous fear of bodily mutilation that I just never got past. If I didn't know that I could have good plastic surgery, I don't think I ever would have the courage to get mastectomies and I would be freaking out about a lumpectomy because of the size of the lumps and microcalcifications. Everybody says the likelihood of dying from this is small. The likelihood of having my breasts disfigured is 100% so I'm very interested in discussing plastic surgery options.",

It's not going to get worse. None of the surgeries or treatments are as bad as what you're going through right now. Hollywood really does make these things look worse than they are. The only true suffering I've had from this whole entire ordeal was the suffering caused by the fear. Sure, there's occasionally been some physical discomfort but it's truly not unbearable. The fear of looking at myself after surgery was much worse than the day I actually looked. That's not to say I haven't had some major pity parties and it's not been a bed of roses by any means, but there is no suffering worse than the suffering from the time of diagnosis until treatment starts. I'm getting close to being finished with reconstruction and I'm a different person than I was when all this started. It's definitely been a journey but if I'd known then what I know now, I would not have been afraid. I don't think it's possible to keep your sanity where you are now.

I am so very grateful I do not have children at home at this time and I know that, while I value my life and my health, if anything happened to me it's OK because nobody is really very dependent on me. I've found my doctors are absolutely willing to be as aggressive as I wish. They would have done mastectomy, chemo, and radiation for me. The pathology report indicated that I would get very little benefit from chemo or radiation and I probably could have got by with just a lumpectomy but they were very willing to do a mastectomy, with prophylactic mastectomy on the other side, because that is what I wanted. You have to go with your gut and do what your intuition tells you to do. Several years ago I had testing that showed I had large tumors on my ovaries and there was about a 50% it was cancer. I had a very strong feeling those ovaries had to go so I told the doctors \"I want those boogers out even if they are not cancerous.\" When they did the surgery it turned out not to be cancer, just large benign endometrial tumors. The doctors did as I wished and removed the ovaries entirely. The uterus had to go and the ovaries were fused to it so leaving even a part of one would have been difficult. For years I questioned whether that was the right decision or not, because early surgical menopause was not easy to go through. I was wishing I'd had them leave at least part of one ovary. Now that I've been diagnosed with 100% estrogen receptive breast cancer I thank God that I listened to my gut and got my ovaries out of there. I'm sure my cancer would have grown faster and I could have even had stage IV by the time I got up the nerve to have my breast lump checked, if I had not had my ovaries removed. Do what your gut tells you to do, after getting all of your results back. You are not being irrational.",

The fear and sadness were so terrible when I got my diagnosis. Every time I woke up in the middle of the night I remembered I had cancer and then had such a terrible time getting back to sleep. It went on like that for weeks. Then, I got my bilateral mastectomy. I slept about 15 hours the first night I was home and 12 hours per day for about 6 days after. Every time I woke up I thought \"I have cancer. Oh, wait - it's gone,\" and went back to sleep. The only trouble I've had sleeping has been from discomfort from drains, and that is quickly resolved with repositioning. Today I'm probably going to have 2 of my drains removed and get my first fill in my tissue expanders.

The pharmaceutical industry pays for all of their medicines to be researched. Some of the scientists will use some of the $ they earn from researching pharmaceuticals to research complementary and alternative medicine, but only if they have a personal interest in complementary and alternative medicine. Who would fund research into herbs and supplements? There is not a financial motivation to do the research so the only way we'll ever have to learn about supplements is through anecdotal evidence and word of mouth. My aunt who has stage IV bc was told she only had 2 months to live, about 18 months ago. Her cancer has not gone away but appears to have stopped growing since then. She has continued to use herceptin and also started using curcumin, co-Q10, boswellia and fankincense. I don't know if the complimentary treatments are the reason she's doing so well or not. I was diagnosed with BC on 1/29 and have not had my appointment with my MO yet. I'm scheduled for bilateral mastectomy 2/25. I started taking all of the supplements my aunt is taking after my ultrasound and mammogram and biopsies came back but before my MRI. I'd only been taking it a week before my MRI and my MRI showed my large tumor was much smaller than it showed on the US and mammo and that there is only 1 tumor, not two. IDK if the supplements had anything to do with it or not, but it definitely feels smaller. I am aware that I won't know the true size and makeup of the cancer until after the tissues are examined post mastectomy. My aunt and I both definitely support conventional cancer treatment and she says she would not be alive today without conventional treatment. I will go ahead with my mastectomy and have chemo or radiation or whatever else the doctors tell me to do, and hold off on the supplements several days before surgery since 2 of them are blood thinners. I feel comfortable taking the supplements and enjoy the added pain relief benefits of the boswellia and curcumin, and the antidepressant effects. Nobody should take supplements without taking the responsibility to thoroughly research them and their side effects. I'm an RN and I saw a lot of my hospice patients turn to complementary/alternative medicine at the last minute but by then their cancer was so advanced that nothing would have worked for them.",

How has it been doing? Any recurrence or problem at all?? I just don't get how your lump that appeared so suspicious could be benign and yet they just happened to find DCIS (microscopic, I'm assuming?) surrounding it. What's confusing me is this: lumps are LUMPS. Clearly cells are either swelling up or dividing abnormally quickly inside of the lump, or the lump would not exist. If the lump had not presented itself I never would have called my Dr. and it never would have been investigated, and I wouldn't have had an abnormal mammogram and biopsy. The lump is what caused them to see whatever is so suspicious on the mammogram. If there is cancer nearby which somehow caused this lump, but the rapidly dividing cells inside the lump are not cancerous - what are they? Why are they dividing quickly and how are they related to cancer? Do the nearby cancer cells secrete some sort of chemical that makes nearby healthy cells divide quickly? Has anybody wondered about this? Researched it? I see on other threads where people mention they have parts of the lump that are cancer and parts that are not. My biopsy was of my large lump, and directly between two much smaller stellate masses inside of the lump. I want this lump GONE even if it just comes back \"atypical lobular hyperplasia\" again. Clearly it is not normal at all. I don't care if the palpable lump isn't where the cancer is, I want it out of there. I want the whole breast gone.",

My sister asked my stepmom to pick me up some sweet tea and some melatonin and leave it on my door step and leave me alone to be a hermit for a few days. I appreciate it but feel bad for Dad and and my stepmom. I will hopefully have my results Friday. Janet I really hope my lump is a fairy godmother too! That gives me a lot of hope. I guess there are actually 2 lumps. Maybe they'll find LCIS in all of those clustered microcalcifications and it won't be big bad tumors. I asked the radiologists how lumps can be cancerous in spots and she explained that tumors were kind of like calico cats - clusters of normal, abnormal, and cancerous all together in the same \"animal.\" SummerAngel, how are you doing now? How do you like your reconstruction? How about you, CT? Is your prognosis good since they got it while it was still DCIS? Karlyrie, God bless you and may the whole lump come back B9!

It's really good to hear that they can be wrong even when they sound so positive about it. I got the impression that my score was BIRAD5 because the first radiologist said she was 98% sure it was cancer, then recently when my records finally came in the mail I see she had it marked as BIRAD4 but with no letter after it. Then when I saw these doctors (at KU Med Center, which is a really good breast cancer center), they all said the negative biopsy results were discordant. So I guess that implies it was 4 or 5 in their opinions too. What was your BIRAD score? Did yours turn out to be B9? Thanks for the good wishes, SummerAngel. White knuckling it definitely describes what happened today - I tried hard not to break anybody's fingers. They were so sweet, holding my hand and stroking my shoulder. I bet you'll feel more whole once you get your nipple tattoos. Did you go larger? How do your foobs compare to your originals? If I have to do anything I think I'll get the DIEP. I'm overweight now but even when I got down to 124 lbs and worked out and cross country skied I still had a \"mother's apron\". I have to admit I'm looking forward to a \"free\" tummy tuck. The only thing better than a free tummy tuck would be finding out it's not cancer :) God bless you, Sanduchi, and may your results come back completely B9. Roxgirl, I'm 46 and also have a strong family history - all on my dad's side. We're starting to wonder if our great grandparents who came from Austria were Ashkenazi Jewish because there's just so much BC on that side. My grandfather's family only married other Austrian immigrants up until his generation, and they all came from the same place in Austria. They do look very Jewish. I'm the oldest in my generation and the first one to possibly have it at this age. Hopefully if it's CA I can get genetic testing. I want mine OUT even if the biopsies come back B9. I want the whole thing examined and want to be 100% positive it's not CA because if there's even a little area of LCIS I want to get the most aggressive treatment possible. I can't handle the thought of being checked every 6 months until something looks suspicious again and then going through all of this again. I'm wanting to go into travel nursing and trying to get back here every 6 months would mess everything up bad. What are you majoring in? How old are your kids? I have one son. He's 25 and has two beautiful little girls. ",

I'm going to convince them that taking my double chin will make it just perfect :) I'm one of the odd ducks who has always thought implants were pretty. If I could get implants and get a tummy tuck that would be great :)",

I cried and cried while I was waiting for test results and then for a couple of days after but now I feel OK. I've been talking to many breast cancer survivors on here and in person and I know it's going to be fine. You will be fine. It's scary and not what we would choose to be going through right now but none of it is as bad as I imagined it would be. I'm having bilateral mastectomies with reconstruction and if I need chemo/radiation I'll get it and go on with my life. You will do whatever you have to do and when your treatment is done you will still be here. I realized that my battle is not against cancer, it's against fear and anxiety. I have the choice to think about what I want to think about. I don't have to worry. I let the fear overcome me for a while and got it out of my system and now I'm enjoying each day. I've caught myself imagining what things will be like in the future - imagining pain, lots of Dr. appointments, etc. But if I take it one day at a time and only think about the day and not about what might happen, it's really not bad. Today I am not in pain. Today I did not have any Dr. appointments. Today I'm comfortable and the day is almost over and I'm going to walk on the tread mill. Tomorrow I'm going to visit my aunt and I'm pretty sure tomorrow will be a good day too. I'm not going to look beyond that for now. One day at a time.",
