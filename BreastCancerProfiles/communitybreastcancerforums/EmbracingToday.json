It seems that from everything I've read that the Adriamycin/Cytoxan is the worst to endure. I have a lot of anxiety and want to know what to expect. For those of you that have done the taxol and AC, what can I expect? Any tips/advice? Thank you!

I did the 12 weeks of taxol, and finish my 4th round of AC this week. Radiation was planned to start about 3 weeks after this. I had a bilat mast with recon in Dec 2017. She called me yesterday and went on to explain that she was looking through my chart and pathology reports. She found a path report from late December that she says she never saw or received. {I'm ER+PR+Her2-} And, this is what I've been treated for the past 5 months. She said one of the path reports says that my tumor is actually Her2+. So, this means that I should have been receiving Hercepin along with the 12 weeks of taxol. My surgeon and my oncologist missed this particular path report. This path report was never reviewed for the past 5-6 months!! No one did anything about it!! I'm going in first thing Monday morning to discuss with her. I'm shocked & devastated! I'm just like WHAT? How did/can this happen? I know there's human error. But, this is my life! The studies indicate that I would have benefited from receiving Herceptin earlier, my percentage at survival would've been better!! I have 3 kids. I need every percentage in my favor, and this was taken from me. And, now I can't go back. I have so many feelings right now. I don't know what to do or think. I'm asking for help and guidance with this situation. I don't understand what this means for me. How do I go forward? I'm so thankful that she came forward and didn't just sweep it under the rug. But, I'm devastated at this news. Do I continue with my team of caregivers? I still have so much care left. What are my rights? Tuesday, May 15th is my last chemo. And, also my birthday. My family has a huge party planned for me that evening for my end of chemo. Such a blow, I'm just in shock that this just happened. Please help me with any thoughts or advice. Thank you so much.
