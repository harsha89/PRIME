I'm guessing women with C-sections are maybe better used to these post surgery things. I think I'd convinced myself that my boob was unnecessary and not vital so then somehow extrapolated that erroneously to it's just a big lump of fat that gives milk but has no nerves or structure or who knows what I was thinking. . Anyway...if it had been ANY other body part I would not have been so silly in my thinking. So, I had some magical boob thinking for sure. The shooting pains went away at about 2 weeks I think. I was prescribed but did not take gabapentin. I had the shooting pains from Biopsy on. Generally soar and hurts when I reach carry heavy things. That's gone away but JUST at the 6 week point. But still fatigues if I overuse and pain return in a lasser way, and iron boob still lingers, so I think it's a process. I think I'll need some PT in the end. And I'll have to give it a different name, like the boob under construction, and in need of respect, not scornful epitaphs. I could imagine it with a cute hard hat or something. Iron boob yikes, that makes me a robot or an android or bionic. No it's 100% organic and it's under-construction. Anyway, I just did a LUMP reconstruct surgery today. I was eager to do it as the old pain was not gone yet so hey maybe this balancing will help it a bit. Or maybe it will make it worse. But it is what it is and having my nipple point straight again after the fluid reabsorbed and the real dent finally showed up a few days before today's scheduled surgery, is a small victory, but it was one worth trying to achieve! And I think I'll achieve it, and if I don't then hey, I feel cared for that my health care provider placed and places such importance on repairing a deformity of such a personal body part. I'd say they put more importance than I did for sure, because they know. They've been down this road. I'll am grateful for that! I'm doing a planned two pronged fat graft. Fracking out! Your \"bump\" for today DaniLind. Is it getting any better now? if not, I hope it does and soon,",
