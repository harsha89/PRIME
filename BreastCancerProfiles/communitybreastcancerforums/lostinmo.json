If they suggest further testing then at least talk to your Mom and let her help you find a good Dr and go with you.  You will want someone with you IF you have to have further testing. Then together you can decide how and when to tell the rest of the family, IF there is anything to tell.  Hopefully you won't have anything to tell them. Good Luck ",

Let's see if I can remember everything. The bad news of the day was that my hemoglobin is very low and if it gets lower they would have to give me a transfusion. So instead I am getting another 3 weeks off the platin drugs (IV chemo) and just taking the xeloda. The radiologist did see a suspicious spot on my back, but when the Dr examined me and we talked about the pain I have in my back he thinks it sounds more like degenerative disc than cancer. He is however putting me on XGEVA, Vickie tells me this is a bone strengthening drug. And now for the rest of the story......... PRAISE REPORT COMING!!!!! Preliminary ct scan show significant regression in the lungs and liver. Liver shows only a few tiny spots where it was full of cancer on the last ct I had in March. Lungs sound clear upon exam. We went over the plan of action with the waiting and the adding of the Xgeva and he said, \"since we have you in REMISSION, I think this is the best course of action.\". Remission is not as good as NED but I will take it!! Believing that I will hear it soon though. Thank you Lord!",

Hopeful I to had progression with the Taxol. Have you done the Adramyacin (sp?) most just call it A/C?  That shrunk my original tumor by half it is a relative to the doxil but stronger. The carboplatin is also one I was just taking that shrunk my liver mets. Sadly I had  to go off it for now due to low platelet counts.  Allison have you tried glutamine powder for the neuropathy? My MO's NP gave me a sample  the last time I was in and said that studies show that it helps but you have to do a higher dose of 30 g a day. Wildflower, I won't say welcome cause I hate that any of us are here. Instead I will say Hello, I hope we can get to know each other better. Hugs to everyone else..back to work for me. ",

Slow sorry about not getting into the trial, hope havalin works for you. So on April 1st I had my first round of carboplatin, by the 5th I could feel a difference in the tumor on my back. I also did 2 weeks of xeloda. When I went back for carbo # 2 on the 22nd my platelets were too low to get it. But when they examined me the 2 x 3 cm on my back had to be felt around for, my liver functions were back in the normal range and the liver had shrunk back to almost normal size!  Went this week to get the carbo and platelets still to low (they had given me a super mega dose) so I am going to start the xeloda back up and we will try again next week for the carbo. All in all I feel better than I have in MONTHS. Carbo is my new best friend at the moment.",

At my Dr appt I told them about all the pain I have been having and we also talked about the stress levels. He postponed chemo to get a ultrasound of my abdomen to make sure the doxil is working and that nothing new has appeared. The ct scan from last week didn't show the liver very well.  It did show that the nodules in my lungs were slowly dissolving. That's good. He took me off the warfin for the blood thinner and put me on a newer medication for dissolving clots. I don't have to watch what I eat with the new one!! Liking that. They put me on a mild antidepressant. Ordered me some pain pills. Next tues I go back to get the us results and chemo. But I'm feeling pretty good about the results. The radiologist came in afterword and said he didn't see anything new and that he thought the liver was enlarged because of the tumor cells inside it were dying off. I am hoping I heard and understood him right. :)  The liver is also where all my pain is located.  If this is the case I can deal with the pain knowing it's the chemo killing.",

IDC means it has spread outside the duct. Keep us informed and we can answer any questions you have along the way. ((hugs)) Try to keep the dark thoughts at bay. I know how hard that is. ",

Cindyl and Kicks last year we spent part of the year working in Cactus Flat. Had to do our major shopping in Rapid City.  We hope to get back up there sometime in the future, farther west than what we were though.",

Like the others have said don't google and once you get your treatment plan and get started you will go into fight mode. You didn't mention what tests or surgeries you have had. Some have surgery first and some have chemo first. This site is full of information on both. Hugs to you.",
