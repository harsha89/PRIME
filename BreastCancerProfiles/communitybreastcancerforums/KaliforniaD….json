I have a history of anxiety too and I suffered from postpartum anxiety/OCD really bad, to the point I was in the ER and given a shot of Ativan. It worked fast and calmed me down quick! You might want to conisder that if you feel like breaking down. I really sympathize with you. I hope you get the treatment you need.",

I had a breast exam, ultrasound and fine needle aspiration all within a 48 hour period when I had a lump in my breast 10 years ago- fortunately it was benign. I have an appointment tomorrow with a different doctor for the new symptoms I've begun to experience. I suggest you take a deep breath and think positive thoughts!!",
