PMS that would kick my butt. 2 years ago I got a hysterectomy but kept my ovaries. Life without periods...Awesome! The first few months I'd still get some PMS. Fast foward to a couple months ago, I noticed my breasts were sore. So I just figured PMS. Last month I discovered a lump that was painful to the touch. So I waited thinking maybe hormonal. It didn't go away, pain got worse and started traveling into my armpit and under arm. It hurts to wear a bra. Went to my ob/gyn this past Thursday. I love this doctor and trust her completely. She's honest and won't sugar coat anything. She felt it. Told me it's about 3cm and seemed concerned. She told me it's one of 3 things...cyst, fibroid benign tumor or cancer. Gave me referrals for mammogram and ultrasound and a breast specialist. So I go next Tuesday for the tests and the following Tuesday, the 13th, to the breast specialist for an exam and for her to go over my test results and what will happen next. Does it really take a week to get mammogram and ultrasound results back? Will these tests be able to tell if it's cancerous or will it just rule out if it's a cyst or not. I've only had one mammogram so far...I'm a bit overdue, but was told to go get the disc for it and bring to my tests since it's at a different place. I've read about symptoms so I know there can be pain and there might not be. There might not even be any symptoms except what is seen in a mammogram. I have only had itchy breasts here and there and always tired. I can get a full night sleep and still be exhausted the next day. Had blood work done for that a few months ago and was told I was a bit low on vit d but fine other than that. I'm trying to be positive. I find myself having pity parties here and there, waiting for all this sucks. I like to knit washcloths, hand towels and blankets so I've been knitting more than usual to keep my mind off of things. Thank you all for taking the time to read this! Log in to post a reply",
