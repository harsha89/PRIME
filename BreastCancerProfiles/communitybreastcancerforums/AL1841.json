Some slight evidence of Lymphatic invasion (whatever that means).  100% ER/PR+; Her2-. My oncologist is recommending CMF chemo (8 cycles over 6 mos) followed by Tamox.  A 2nd opinion suggests ovarian suppression injections into abdomen (1x/month for 2 yrs.) coupled with the Tamoxifen. I also have a mild form of Multiple Sclerosis, which adds a slight wrinkle.  With chemo, I get to go off weekly MS injection for the 6 months---that's a plus. Witth the hormonal treatments, I will need to continue with MS injections.  Can't decide on which approach? Any advice?",
