I tested negative on the BRCA gene.  That was huge relief!   However, because of my age, I'm seriously leaning toward a bliateral.  I'm 36 and have an 8 month old daughter.  I found my lump while I was breastfeeding.  A bilateral seems extreme, and I'm not comfortable taking a perfectly good breast.  Yet my chances were pretty low of getting this cancer to begin with; and it seems recurrence is more common than I thought it would be.  In addition, I can't stand the thought of testing every 6 months--I have always had lumpy breasts and I wonder how many mammos I will go through before I get a call telling me they've found something.  While that doesn't mean it'll be cancer, I abhor the thought of putting my husband or myself through all this again.   I should mention that when I originally posted this, I was under the impression the cancer was lobular.  I spoke with the doctors office and found out that right now they have decided it is invasive ductal--so I'm not sure where we got our wires crossed.  In any case, I don't have a grade yet (obviously) and I don't know what stage.  I've had a biopsy, a mammogram, an ultrasound and an MRI, all of which indicate stage II.   As I said, I'm not comfortable taking a perfectly good breast, yet I'm not comfortable with testing and worry on the other side.  (Sigh)  I'll keep praying.  I'm scheduled for surgery the 11th, but I know I can change my mind before then.  It's also an irreversible decision.   Any suggestions pre-surgery?  Maybe I should post a whole new topic on that...? ",
