They said that because they do not have a previous x-ray to compare it to, they need a diagnostic x-ray to see if what they are looking at is \"normal\" or not. This makes sense and does not make me terribly worried; what does make me worried is that they want to only view the Right breast and I have noticed over the past 6 months or so that my Right breast has become larger. I didn't think much of it at the time and feel really stupid about that. Anyone in a similar situation with a new larger breast (and no other symptoms on it?) Best, Log in to post a reply",
