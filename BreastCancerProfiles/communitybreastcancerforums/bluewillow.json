NO, VERY VERY VERY comforted by smaller node and less pain!!!!     The fact that it is lessening is a hugely good sign!!  That sounds like some kind of infection, NOT cancer.  It could be caused by a generalized viral infection, or even mononucleosis, and those could show up in any of your lymph nodes in your body.  I have had both mono and IBS, and had enlarged, painful lymph nodes.  And remember, I am Dr. B.W  but I won't send you a bill. I love Ann's idea about the shovel to the nurse ASSistant.  I wish there was some kind of medical police department we could report these asinine people to for their careless and cruel remarks, and they would be whisked away to spend the night in jail, with ladies like us as wardens!!!!   You have some very legitimate medical concerns and for a nurse to say that you need a psychologist is not only cruel, but I would think it is totally against her nurses' doctrine and she should be fired for it.  I am glad you found comfort in your former church family.  Keep coming here for more comfort and keep holding on a little longer...

I asked my chemo nurse about it, and she did not seem to think it was related directly to Taxol.  This may sound really dumb, but could it have to do with the loss of nose hairs?  I have been so proud because I have had minimal side effects from my chemo treatments, but this is just plain driving me nutty!

Right now, it's hard to visualize being anywhere close to being finished with this stuff and I haven't even started!  But I am determined not to let it get me down and maintain the attitude that it's going to heal me rather than making me sick.  I'm glad to hear you've been able to work quite a bit too-- that gives me lots of encouragement. I noticed in one of your previous posts (if I read it correctly) that you have been camping during your treatments.  Did you manage ok and did you take any extra precaution?  My husband and I love to camp and that is something I hope I don't have to miss this fall.  I'd love to hear from you about that too, if you have time to respond.  Feel free to send me a PM if you want. Good luck with the rest of you tx's! Mary Jo ",

Hopefully someone will provide some good website links. My office is located at our school bus garage and I come in contact with a variety of substances, a major one being diesel fumes from the buses.  If that's not enough to worry about, our building is located on top of the old county old landfill, with methane pipes decorating the landscape.  When it rains, we have yellow bubbly stuff coming out of the drains...  goodness knows what is buried under there.  I worry about the health of all my co-workers too.  One of our bus mechanics was stricken with leukemia about 8 years ago and can no longer work.  LUV, we have frozen bottles of water for many years...scary, isn't it?

I was just looking for a similar conversation hoping to figure out my mood swings/depression or whatever it is...  I think you may be onto something about the nervous system connection.  I always have my Taxol on Mondays, and on Tuesdays I feel great, in fact my husband says I am high as a kite, both physically and mentally the day after tx, and my moods are great.  But is it the Taxol or the steroids? (I also get Benadryl)  From his observation point, he sees a lot of things that I don't, and I really believe he's right.  Then, on Wednesdays, my moods and physical energy all take a nosedive into some kind of depressive funk.  Hubby says it's because of the steroids and coming off them so suddenly (I don't take any oral steroids w/Taxol like I did w/A-C)  I got home from work last night, changed into my nightgown at 6 pm, and couldn't even cook supper.  And I wasn't \"sick\", just so down and wanted to crawl into a big hole. I feel some better today, and by the weekend, I will be fine again, then it starts over on Monday. I have discovered this pattern and it is the same every week.  Are you feeling something similar?  I hope someone else answers your question about the nervous system being affected.  Thanks for posting about it! Take care! Mary Jo ",

Tri, if you try the antidepressants, please let me know how you do.  I have certainly considered that and don't think the nurse practitioner would hesitate prescribing them. I don't really want another med to take, but if it would help keep me \"stable\" instead of having the ups and downs, then I'd gladly try it.  My big hole right now is the living room sofa, under a fleece blanket...",

The Neulasta shot, from what I was told, will boost your white blood cells so you aren't as prone to infection from external sources-- is that correct, ladies?  I have had no side effects at all yet from mine.  I took a Zofran last night just because the nurse told me to, and got a slight headache shortly after, so I've nixed it today in favor of Ativan they gave me also for nausea, which is the anti-anxiety med that I've been taking for a while anyway to help deal with menopausal symptoms (though a much lower dose).  The Ativan already being in my system may have helped quell the nausea too. How is your support group going for you?  I've considered attending one at the cancer center but it would just be another drive and all you ladies are helping me so much here anyway!!!  I'm glad yours  reassured you about your second tx being better-- I am sure it will be.

I thought I'd check in before I go crash on the couch!   I had a wonderful day at the Heritage festival with my daughter, except she got a little sick (not surprising since she is 6 month pregnant) today, mostly because she hadn't eaten enough and it got pretty hot around noon.  We didn't stay at the festival very long, but long enough to spend money that I shouldn't have at the crafters area.  We got to watch some Cherokee Indian stickball, some tribal dancers, listen to some bluegrass, see cloggers, and smell some awesome aromas from the food booths.  This festival had a lot of variety and focused on \"old timey ways\" and no fast food vendors were allowed-- instead they had kettle corn, roasted meats and corn, cornbread, ice cream.  But the most popular food item was Indian Fry Bread, and the lines snaked all around the university campus just for that.  I have no clue what that tastes like and would probably still be in line for it if I'd wanted to.  Does anyone know what it is?  Anyway, I had a wonderful time, no problems at all, and I am SO GLAD I went!  THANK YOU to everyone for encouraging me to go!!!  The fact that I outlasted my poor darling pregnant daughter was pretty encouraging! Paxton, I see you're a bluegrass fan too!  Sam Bush, one of my favorite musicians, played at Western Carolina Univ. last night, where the Heritage festival was held today- wish I could have gone but I've seen him before in concert and he is phenomenal.  I hope your day has gone well and you're not too terribly lonely.  Hope you sleep better tonight. My husband is still in his treestand as I write this, so it'll probably be 9 or 10 tonight when he comes in.  I worry about him, but he's such a seasoned veteran of the woods, and he's safer there than on his job.  Hope he comes home with some venison! Janice, I'm so sorry to hear about your picc line problems.  I hope the antibiotics work very quickly and you feel better soon. Marietta, Hope you're feeling well today.  We're looking forward to your photo! Laurie, How are you feeling this evening?  Hopefully not too yucky now. Urbie, Have a great time hiking with your girls! What part of VA are you in?  My daughter's in-laws have farms in Independence and Galax and it's so pretty there. Well I'd better go plan some supper for the bowhunter, then maybe sneak in a nap before he comes home.  Take care everyone and have a well weekend! Mary Jo",

I also had a metal one that I decoupaged all kinds of favorite music and tv stars, horses, peace signs, etc. all over it.  Yep, still have that one! Let's see, my all time favorite toy was my Lincoln Log set.  I nearly wore those things out, but my parents kept them for years and years.  Also my Spirograph, which I still have.  I had a Tonka metal car carrier with metal cars.  And of course Barbie dolls, which I still have!  And I gave them all extreme hair cuts, especially Midge.  In fact, we resemble each other a lot right now. Jingles:  I love The Jetsons theme song; plus \"plop plop fizz fizz oh what a relief it is...\"  My best childhood memory was the local horse show that my parents took me to every July.  It usually last three days, and we'd try to go all three, but always on Saturday night to see who the Grand Champion Tennessee Walking Horse was- and we'd always buy those wonderful hot dogs from the concession stand.  We didn't eat out much, not like now, so that was a real treat!  Can't wait to see how others respond!  Thanks again Paxton-- hope you're feeling well.  I've been a tad nauseated today, but nothing major, and a little more tired than the first one, but still at work and going strong.  I hope you don't have to miss your hunt! Hope you're not too lonely and not having too much difficulty being by yourself. I've threatened hubby if he doesn't take me camping next weekend for at least two whole days. The steroids make me really moody and I think he's afraid of me right now And Laurie, Nancy, Janice, Urbie, Marietta, Rachel, Trigeek, Karyll-- I hope you are all doing well this afternoon!   Love and big hugs to all!

You probably feel like you were \"abandoned\" this week and in a way, you were, because you felt badly, plus you didn't get to hunt.  I think bf owes you a lot of cuddling and attention and pampering!  Maybe the moon phase is our problem. This has been my worse day yet. I have had diarrhea all day, out of the blue, and have been housebound except for a quick trip to the grocery store where I felt like everyone was staring at me, and that's not the normal me to feel paranoia like that, even with no hair.  DH was supposed to hunt until noon, but just walked in about 9:30, and though I didn't show it, I was a bit miffed at him for being gone all day and me sick when I really wanted him home to take care of (pity?) me. Pax, do you know what is triggering your diarrhea and is this a common symptom after chemo?  I hope you get relief soon and hope you get a good night's sleep.  Tomorrow will be better.  Take care...

      "Content": "Nov 13, 2007 11:39AM - edited Nov 13, 2007 11:41AM by bluewillow Good morning everyone! I thought I'd report in after my first Taxol tx yesterday, and I must say I am feeling just fine!  None of the weird queasiness that I had after the A/C, and I am pleasantly surprised!  I hope my experience encourages you Taxolers!  They gave me steroids and Benadryl along with the Taxol, and Benadryl is not my friend.  I went to sleep almost immediately in the treatment chair, which was most embarrassing, since the tx room was full of about 10 patients plus their friends/spouses, with 5-6 nurses bustling around, timers going off, cell phone ringing, bright fluorescent lights and there I lay, just napping away!  My husband touched me on the arm several times just to see if I was still alive, because I'm usually wide awake, reading and chattering.  I did take Ativan yesterday morning before tx, so that may have enhanced the Benadryl effects.  The Ben wore off and the steroids kicked in about 2:30 this morning, so I'll be face down at my keyboard this afternoon about 3 pm. Paxton, I am doing the 12 weekly taxols.  I hope you don't get the bone pain too badly.  Not sure when mine will kick in.  They told me to take tylenol or aleve for it, so maybe it won't be too bad.  And I am in the same weight boat too.  As of yesterday, I have gained 15 pounds but I think my appetite has slacked off now and I am hopeful that I can start losing now with some effort on my part. Your comments about hunting reflect mine exactly.  I am a huge softie when it comes to domestic pets and do not like to see any animal in pain.  But I feel like you about the purpose in hunting.  I would recommend everyone who eats meat to visit a slaughterhouse- it is not a nice place to be.  And I respect those who have different views than I about hunting. But hunting is not all in the \"kill\"- it is getting outdoors, in total peace, in tune with God and nature. I hope everyone is feeling well this morning! I have a question for you all:  has anyone been offered a study on Bisphosphonates as Adjuvant Therapy for BC?  I cannot decide whether to say yes or no to this study.  It is being done to find out if adding biphosphonates to hormonal therapy or chemo will help prevent cancer from spreading to the bones or other parts of the body. In the booklet they gave me at the cancer center, there are numerous side effects from all the drugs in this \"three-arm\" study, and I am very hesitant to do it.  I just worry if, down the road a few years, will I regret not taking it should the BC return.  Does anyone have any input on this?  What would you all do?  Laurie-- you mentioned a study-- what is yours and are you doing it?  Thanks for any help you can give me! Take care everyone and I will check in again soon! LOVE AND HUGS, Mary Jo ",

YAY!! I hope your rads go well for you and it's great that you get your tx down to 16.  Let us know how that goes, ok? Marietta, I am so sorry to hear of your mother-in-law's illness and I hope for her quick recovery.  We will all be thinking of her and you during the Thanksgiving holidays. Barb and Jim, things will get better!  It does help to keep something in the stomach for the nausea.  I hope you both have a better day tomorrow, and hang in there, ok? Paxton, I'm glad to hear the gathering went well for you and that you had fun!  And I'm with you on this Taxol stuff... not what I thought it would be.  Even my husband can tell a big difference in my overall energy and he even commented on how pale I seem today after my second tx... thanks honey, but glad he's honest.  I so do not want to have that ashy pale sick look, which I have avoided until now.  The steroids in my first Taxol made my face very red, so at least I had color!  I'm already having the gastro problems, mostly diarrhea, but not the cramping... sorry to whine...had my first Herceptin today also, and so far so good with that... at least I stayed awake today even with the Benadryl. My husband's cousin was having her chemo for ovarian cancer and she and her husband sat with us and we talked and laughed-- that helped pass the time for all of us but probably bothered the other patients I'm off to bed since my husband just left for a few days of deer hunting with his brother.  I miss him terribly already but will join him on Wednesday evening at a little restaurant near where he's hunting for Thanksgiving dinner!  Then he's to hunt on Thanksgiving Day, and I'm going to my parents for Thanksgiving lunch-- so, we worked all that out and we're both happy!  He's such a \"deer\" man Take care everyone and Happy Thanksgiving!

This may sound crazy, but I spent about two weeks, before Thanksgiving week, agonizing and worrying about recurrence.  And I'm not even through treatment yet!  It was like I was obsessed about it and couldn't get it off my mind.  I am not sure where it came from, but it just hit me out of the blue. I got so down and even my chemo nurse noticed it and recommened that I visit the psychologist there at the cancer center. I reluctantly agreed, then went home and started trying to pull myself out of my funk.  I realized that there is not one thing in the world I can do to make this stuff not come back beyond taking care of myself, exercise, good diet, etc., and that is all.  All the worrying in the world won't stop it, and I realized that if I spend 1, 3, 5 or 10 years worrying about it coming back and it doesn't, look at all the time I wasted!  So, I hope I can keep that mindset with me forever-- I hope I can do like you said, Karyll, just pack up the bad thoughts and kick them to the curb!  Sorry if I rambled about this but maybe it'll help someone else out there when those bad thoughts creep in, and I feel better when I type things out too. Incidentally, the therapist I was to see called in sick the day of my appointment, which was fine with me!  I may really need her one day, but I'm ok for now. Marietta, I am also having weight gain problems, so you are not alone.  Most days, my skin feels a size too small for my body!  But I can't seem to get moving-- at least you and Tri are making efforts to work out and good for you both!!  By the time I get off work at 5 pm and get home, stop by the store, cook supper, etc., my energy is just gone.  I had planned on cutting back on my hours and that would probably really help me, but I am trying to be tough. But for what ??  I think I will cut back, then go home and do one of my 100 workout videos that I have amassed. MJ, congratulations on almost finishing chemo and going onto rads.  And I know what you mean about missing your hair.  I have so many scarves and hats that I'm out of storage in my closet.    Thanks for letting me vent and take care, everyone!

I hate thinking that way but still have to wonder.  In comparison, I don't think you are being \"under-cared for\", but possibly I am receiving too much care.  My insurance was billed for over $27,000 for last Monday's chemo and Herceptin tx's, and the charges to my ins. for the four Neulasta shots I received were around $6500 each.  All I know is someone is getting filthy rich off this!  I am just now getting a lot of my bills straightened out too.  I went to two different hospitals for my two surgeries and what a mess! My husband knows nothing about it and doesn't want to, so that has left me with it, and I don't know much more.  It's like the drs. and hospitals charge whatever they want and sometimes the amounts aren't jiving.    I will have a ct scan for rads too, so that must be pretty much standard.  I am getting nervous about all these rads and rays going into my body all of a sudden...  You are so lucky to be tall.  I am 5'2\" and every single pound is so obvious on me.  I hope you get to take your son skiing, bless his heart.  He must be such a trooper and I bet he is such a big help to you right now!  My grandbaby is due the week before my last chemo and I know my daughter will need help right in the middle of my rads, and she lives 140 miles away  Damn this interruption in our lives!  Will life ever be normal again? Paxton, I'm so glad you're feeling good, girl!!  You so deserve it and keep those great drawings coming-- we'd love to see more!  And thanks for bursting my bubble-- I thought you'd say \"it's just all water retention and it will all go away the day after the last chemo\", etc.,etc. Take care everyone and have a great Saturday evening, Mary Jo",

I'm so mad at myself for the 17 extra pounds I've gained!  Ugh!  I know it's mostly my fault, and I've not exercised as much as I'd promised myself I would, but after I work all day, I'm just dragging by the time I drive home.  I swear my metabolism has just stopped and I feel like a bloated cow.  And my husband is badgering me every day to exercise and lose the weight.  He started in on me yesterday on the way home after my chemo!  I felt like jumping out of the car onto the interstate.

You've had a pile of stuff to deal with lately and none of it has been in your control.  I'm glad you got your computer working again, and hope you get your car fixed soon.  I bet in a few weeks you will really see a difference in your body, but great for you that you're eating right and exercising!  I'm sure you've got muscle now instead of fat since you've been working out.  Is your taste pretty normal?  I think that is my problem-- nothing tastes right and I keep eating hoping to find something that will.  I love fruits and veggies, but they don't taste like themselves, but ice cream does!   My chemo nurse said it would take several weeks for the metabolism to get back to normal after all the steroids and crap along with the chemo. I feel like I am bloated 24 hrs a day and after reading that stupid article about weight gain and cancer death, I am just ready to throw up my hands in disgust. I've got to lose about 35  more pounds to really be healthier and that will take at least 40 years at the rate I'm going.  Don't worry about the hair color-- from what I've heard, whatever comes back eventually changes back to what was there before.  Mine looks salt and peppery too but at my age, who gives a hoot. I must admit the wig made me feel more feminine.  What your bf said was funny about putting on your hair! I really hope you get your inner ear problem resolved soon.  That has to be just totally miserable. It's good that they have a corrective surgery for it, so hang in there, ok? Take care and stay warm. MJ ",

I feel better when I hear all that everyone else is going thru.  Looks like I'll have my first tx on February 25, my dad's 79th birthday (he's in better shape than I am and is at the gym every morning at 5 a.m.!!!)  Maybe I'll ask him to go with me as a good luck charm I noticed on your rads post that you are having problems with itching-- what do you use for that?  My skin is pretty sensitive and I itch anyway, so I want to be prepared when I really itch! How is your herceptin regimen fitting in with you rads?  I will have to work around that with mine, since I have mine every 3 weeks.  How often do you get Herceptin?  Sorry if you've already told me-- still got chemo brain Best of luck with your kids shoe store- wish you were nearby so I could buy shoes for my little Mason.  He would be a male version of Imelda Marcos Take care and good luck w/the rest of your rads! I hope everyone else is doing well!!!  Hugs!  Mary Jo ",

I hope you hear some great news soon! I went into work this morning and the minute I pulled into the parking lot, I just felt that something wasn't right.  It was a premonition of sorts and I've been having those feelings a lot lately and they usually turn out to be true... pretty spooky.  I got to my office and found out that one of my co-workers had a very serious heart attack over the weekend, has pneumonia, and is in the intensive care unit at the hospital. He isn't doing very well and we're all really worried about him- - there's just a big dark cloud hanging over our whole workplace today.  He's close to retirement age, and is such a joy to work with-- always on time, does his job perfectly, always smiling and joking, even though his wife has been very seriously ill.  He's going to need lots of healing thoughts and prayers.   I hope everyone has a pleasant Monday!

There IS hope for your nails-- just be patient and the hair and nice nails will come back, I promise!  Hope this helps you and the best of luck to you! Mary Jo ",

I'm glad your dr. didn't budge about your tx schedule-- that way you can enjoy your hunt and know you are getting the proper tx as prescribed, even if it does mean cutting your hunt short a bit.  And how neat that you could organize your photos.  Maybe you can post more here soon! I hope you are still feeling ok after your tx and will do great this time.  Did your dr/nurse tell you could take Ativan at any time?  Mine did, and told me that although it is normally an anti-anxiety drug, Ativan also works extremely well for the nausea, and I've been taking it pretty regular.  Maybe that's kept me from being nauseated, so hopefully it will work for you, and at least it's cheap compared to the Zofran and others. I am still feeling good, except the bone pain has started in, at precisely 5:30 this afternoon on the drive home.  It really scared me at first and I'm thinking oh no the \"c\" has spread to my bones, then I remembered the nurse telling me about the bone pain from the Neulasta.  It is weird-- it jumps around from my knee to my upper leg and to my arms and all around, but the pains are brief and not too bad.  I have taken Tylenol and hopefully it will help soon.  Other than that, no other s.e.'s yet.  I haven't remembered to drink a lot today, so I'd better catch up on that before bedtime (so I can get up and down to the potty all night ) Take care and have a great evening.  Let us know how you are doing tomorrow!

I got brave (or stupid) one night and had spaghetti and was up until 1 am with acid reflux and pain!  Maybe the Emend will be just your ticket to relief. They asked me about the morning sickness too and I had none, but they have held nothing back as far as anti-nausea meds and steroids in my IV.  Not sure why your onc. nurse would discourage the Ativan-- mine told me that it is also an anti-nausea med and would help me relax and sleep.  Maybe you should at least try it in a low dose.  It works better for me than Xanax.  I have been taking a very low dose Ativan for about a year now, and someone said that my lack of nausea could be due to having the Ativan in my system already.  Hope some of this helps!  Take care and hope you feel better soon! Urbie, good luck with the Neulasta shot-- I have mine tomorrow in my left arm.  Every cancer center is different-- we sure don't have massages at mine!  Sounds very nice! You're lucky you have no aggravating port.  Hope you continue to do well! Hi Laurie, sorry to hear you've had a rough time of it.  I hope you feel better very soon.  I did have some throbbing pain in my back, neck,and hips, but it finally settled in my left knee and I could hardly walk!  I go for my 2nd Neulasta today,and hopefuly it won't be as bad or at least no worse. The chemo nurse told me I could take Aleve for just a day or two, then go back to Tylenol, and that really helped me a lot.  I feel fine after my second chemo yesterday, but who knows-- that could change in a flash. Janice, I hope your next tx goes well.  And hopefully you can find a solution and get some good sleep really soon.  I woke up many times last night, but I think it's those steroids.  The last time it was temporary though. Paxton, I hope you're doing well and taking care of yourself so you can get geared up for that hunting trip!  I'm so excited for you and please post more pictures for us.  Are you able to eat more today? My hubby buzzed off my hair last night and it truly feels so much better!  No more worry about if it's going to fall out in clumps at my desk, and it sure was turning loose Sunday and yesterday.  He did a great job, but he did it with tears in his eyes-- and that was hard. I did not cry one bit though since I knew how stressed he was.  But we made it through!  He's my rock and my precious soul mate. I also had a wonderful discussion with the nurse practitioner who I usually see and I expressed my concern about my doctor's reluctance to give me encouragement for a good prognosis and survival rate. Well, she knows my doctor very well and while being very professional, she did not hesitate talking to me and explaining all the stats pertaining to my individual situation, even showing me the graph run for my special chart.  She was truly wonderful and so encouraging and uplifting!!! If only I could have talked to her two months ago, I would'nt have felt so down about this HER2postive thing.  She explained all about the PR/ER neg and the advantages to that and the great success with Herceptin.  She explained that the chances of my 10 year survival was almost 100 Percent with the treatment they are giving me! What that woman did for my mental state can be measured in gold--tons of it!!  Love and hugs to all! Mary Jo ",

I've gained almost 10 pounds and I just cannot do this!!! Does anyone have ideas on how to lose it?  Food is starting to taste a little odd, so maybe this will resolve itself soon.  The NP at the cancer center told me to walk daily, which I have not done yet but plan to start immediately.  Since last October I lost about 45 pounds until my dx, and I know most of the gain is due to my increase in carb intake.  Should I just limit my carbs and see what happens?  I would love anyone's ideas here, because I just cannot gain this weight back-- for both my mental and physical health!!! Well enough about me.  I hope everyone is doing well.  I have loved reading everyone's nostalgia and count me in on the Partridge Family and Bobby Sherman too!  Paxton, sorry you didn't get to go on your moose hunt but congratulations to your bf on his harvest.  Please let me know how the meat tastes-- I haven't had it either but would sure love to try it.  I love venison and we prepare it so that we never have the 'gamey' taste.  It is all in how it is aged before you cook it.  Karyll, (Happy Thanksgiving this weekend!) the casino sounds like so much fun, though I've never been to one in my life!  I would now if I had the chance though.  Urbie, I am having the fuzzy brain thing too-- is that what is called \"chemo brain\"?  Some things I can do fine, like at work, but the simple things like ordering at McDonalds is getting me.  Nancy and Janice, good luck and enjoy your family gatherings, but be safe and stay well.  Nancy, I think the Neulasta starts working about 7 days after chemo-- is that right, everyone?  Laurie, hope you're feeling well! Well gotta go get some rest if my steroid withdrawal will allow it.  Take care everyone and have a great weekend! Mary Jo",

Marietta, I got the gawks this morning when I was in McDonald's breakfast line (had to wait 35 minutes-- one cashier on Saturday morning-- gee).  And you know, I get the most stares from \"older\" people who should know better!  I thought maybe kids would be the ones to look, but haven't had that yet.  I just go right on and let it all roll off my back though.  We have to.  Let them all deal with this.  And just fyi, I had my teeth cleaned one week prior to my first chemo, and my mouth still feels gross, so don't feel too badly.  You'll get a chance at a cleaning soon! Trigeek, thanks so much for your advice about the weight gain on my other post!  I feel empowered today and much better! Karyll, I hope you get your taste buds back in line soon.  Some things taste odd to me, and others don't.  Ice cream tastes the best (thus, my agony over my weight gain!) Everyone, have a great weekend and be well! Mary Jo",

I know you are so excited!  We just happened to find some hunting lands to lease this past weekend and I'm excited about that, tho it will be next year before I get to hunt it.  I'm still depressed about missing this year's hunting season, although I'm glad dh has gotten to go quite a bit, although he hasn't harvested a thing.  He didn't think he would be able to hunt at all because he thought he'd be at home playing nurse to me while I was sick as a dog, which thankfully didn't happen.  I plan to go turkey hunting in the spring though.  That's hard on an old body though-- sitting on the ground and trying to be motionless and quiet (that's really hard for me to do!!!)  Take care, MJ ",

I appreciate reading about your holiday plans.  Actually, some quiet time at home is beginning to be more appealing to me.   Paxton, I'm glad you're feeling better. And I like your new pic! I think your bf and my dh are kin.  DH told me the same thing about getting used to the cold and getting \"climatized\" before I hunt again. And it makes sense. Really my head is the only thing that has been getting cold!  (and dh took he day off from work today to go hunting and I'm trying not to be jealous) Yes, you have it correct about the holiday thing with us.  I guess I'm just in a rut about how we have always spent the holidays in the past, and now with my two married adult children who are also going in different directions plus my parents are aging, it just has thrown me into a confusion about what we \"should\" do.  I think everything will work out-- I just want to enjoy whatever happens and not stress out. Urbie, I really like your plan!!!  That may be the way to go-- and I think you should enjoy every minute of your \"guest\" status!  And don't touch those dishes! Thanks everyone for your input and I welcome all the help I can get! MJ ",

Karyll, congratulations on being almost done!!!  I worry about the nerve damage with Taxol, since I sew and quilt when I'm not in a lazy streak like I am now.  But yes we are doing well and will get through all this! A little about the hair subject:  you all may think I'm nuts, but has anyone had problems with their scalp perspiring?  In other words, a sweaty head?  I have this problem only when I don't wear a cap or scarf, which is only at home where no one can see me except my hubby.  I wear a sleep cap to bed and a few nights left it off, and I woke up with a damp pillow!!  I am menopausal and do have some hot flashes and night sweats occasionally, and am wondering if this is related to it.  Maybe it's all that fuzz growing back that's making my head hot! Good night all and thanks to everyone for their continued support-- what a great bunch of gal pals you are! Mary Jo",

Please let us know how your Taxol goes.  And I hope everyone has a great Veterans Day today.   Remember to hug and thank a Veteran because they have made our country free!  \" mce_src=\"\" alt=\"\" border=\"\" hspace=\"\" vspace=\"\" width=\"\" height=\"\" align=\"\" />   ",

Someone described it as growing pains, and that's what it feels like to me, just stabbing pains that jump around?  Paxton, is that what yours feels like?  You made me laugh too, especially about the wood-- maybe you oughta give bf a red eye and cheek of his own for asking you to carry in wood !  Laurie, it's ok to feel grumpy-- I have those days too, especially when someone starts whining about something really petty, I want to jerk off my scarf and say \"hey, be glad you have hair!\", but I have done well to contain myself so far...  And Karyll, it's ok to have the blue days too-- I've had those too, as well as days that I cry for no apparent reason.  And yes, 2008 is going to be BETTER, for sure!! We just have to focus on those long-term survivors and get our inspiration from them, and I've met lots of them so far! I made it back from my trip just fine, had a great time, and even got to spend the night with my daughter instead of in a hotel room, which made the drive to the meeting a little longer, but everything went great.  When I arrived down east Thursday, the temperature was 78 and sunny, then yesterday coming back to the mountains, I ran into heavy snow flurries, fierce wind and 25 degrees.  That's our great North Carolina weather for ya! Have a great weekend everyone! Mary Jo ",

YUK!  At least we aren't losing weight and sick and unable to eat anything. A lot of ladies in my chemo room are and have to come in for fluids frequently.  Honestly, although there may be something to the insulin thing and eating right and exercising is always a winning combination, I'm just not so sure about insulin 'feeding cancer' because there are a lot of folks who eat a lot worse than we do and are huge and don't have cancer.  That's just my elementary perspective of it.  I don't think the drs. and scientists really know what causes cancer, so I don't think we should beat ourselves up about it, although I tend to do that frequently.  I always look back and try to figure out how I got this stuff, and nothing makes sense.  Hang in there.  And the cancer is not coming back -- ever!!!  And you will get a pheasant!!

I put my two cents worth in, since I had the same se's-- never in my 51 yrs have I had hemorrhoids and bleeding until the Taxol, so it's very scary!  It has gotten much, much better though.  I have also had the throbbing back pain when the \"Taxol pain\" sets in-- very uncomfortable!  And Oh the palpitations, which started back when I went into menopause.  They used to scare the wits out of me but I've learned to ignore them now.  Guess if I did have heart problems all of a sudden, I'd just sit and ignore them I have a 2-D echo (whatever that is) scheduled for Jan. 22.  I've had a treadmill echocardiogram before, as well as color echos, so I'm not sure what a \"2-D\" one is.  It's good you're getting the Holter too-- I think I'll ask about that also.   Interesting that you should mention the unresolved conflict as being connected to the BC... I think there could be something to that. I've been thinking lately of all the stress I endured from a bad 15-yr long first marriage years ago, then the stresses of the divorce plus being a single mom... I really think that had to have taken a toll on my health. I have worked almost every day thru my chemo, and I still have chemo brain.  I cannot multi-task like I used to, but I'm getting better at it.  Now that I'm almost done w/chemo, the fatigue is starting to really set in and my heart and mind are not into my work.  I had planned on cutting back on my hours and have done that a few days, but I think I need to take off some more.  But preferably on a warm day when the sun is shining... Paxton, be so thankful that you are HER2 negative and won't have to do Herceptin-- I am HER2 positive and that is what scares me so badly.   And I agree wth Tri, it would be nice to go out and celebrate big time when we're all done with chemo!!!  I've never been stoned before, but would certainly consider it, especially on Mondays when I have to walk into the chemo room... Take care everyone and sorry I've babbled.  I'm at work and very bored and uninterested today! (and side-tracked thinking about my future grandbaby! Mary Jo ",

I hope it goes well and hopefully the tattoos aren't too bad.  I have heard that they are little dots.  Looks like they'd come up with something more creative or artistic?   I'm in the same clothes boat as you.  I got lucky the other day at the thrift shop.  We stopped in on the way home from chemo and I found two pairs of really nice jeans for $2.99 a pair, so now I have 3 pairs I get fit into instead of just one.  And my employer provides uniform shirts that have been a mile too big for a long time, but now they fit just about right   But, we will win this battle too and get back to our normal sizes, I just know it! I just my husband would realize that I know I've gained weight and and quit harping on it every single day, every day of my life   For me, it's certainly put a damper on things as far as the home-fires go, if you know what I mean.  Aw heck, I'll just say it-- sex has gone kablooey for me just because of his harping, not for him because he thinks I look bad-- does that make sense?  Your bf is humorous about the sweatpants.  Hang on to your Christmas shirts-- you will be in them before you know it!  Good luck on your fitness program.  Now you've inspired me to get going. I just ordered a new Leslie Sansone in-home walking DVD, and I am determined to get up earlier and work out in the a.m. before work, when I have more energy.  I've decided I'm not waiting until I finish chemo to lose this weight-- I'm doing it now, and for myself and my health and for my sanity.  And hopefully hubby will quit worrying about my health so much too and our home will be peaceful once again!  ps-I haven't tried Pilates yet.  Do you use a Pilates video and if so, what are the good ones available?  And I'm curious about the V-8 Fusion-- haven't tried it yet-- is it sweet, like a fruit juice?

Paxton, I'm glad to hear your night out went very well-- you sure deserved to have a night of fun!  And the fishing derby sounds like a blast.  Did your bf shoot any coyotes?  I hope so-- they are such a pest to humans and other animals.  Hope you had a good time with your college pals.  How sweet of bf to think you're still hot.  That sure goes a long way in making one feel better with this dang chemo/rads.  And good luck on your next rads- keep us posted on how that's working for you. BTW, you're not alone with the MIA eyebrows.  Although my eyelashes are still all there (at least for now), I just noticed today that almost all my left eyebrows are gone and a good part of my right ones.  I would have thought since I made it this far, they'd hang around but I guess not. I have to tell something funny on my husband.  Last Thursday night, he stopped by his co-worker's house (his name is Shaun and he and my husband both work for my son in his housing construction business).  Hubby visited with him and his girlfriend and played his guitar and banjo for them.  They just live about two miles across the river from us, so hubby called me and told me to come over and join them. Well, hubby and Shaun started drinking Tequila about 6:30 and didn't stop until almost 11 o'clock.  Although we do enjoy occasional glasses of wine, I've not been around my husband when he's been drinking a lot, so this was a real eye-opener for me.  (He was a logger in Washington State years ago and drank a LOT then, but quit drinking way before he met me.)  He sang all kinds of crazy songs that I had never heard before and started telling all these wild stories about his ex-wife and of course Shaun and his girlfriend were rolling in the floor laughing and I'm just sitting there dumb-founded at this person that I am married to.  Shaun has a cat and she kept getting up in my lap and purring and I was just loving the attention from her.  Here's the really funny part: Hubby was on his last Tequila and he turned to me and said, \"honey I'm going to get you a cat just because I love you so much!\"  Well, he hates cats and I sure wish I'd had a tape recorder, but at least I have 2 witnesses!  Tune in to see if I really do get a cat! Sorry if I bored everyone to sleep with that story, but we usually don't do anything on the weeknights except come home from work, eat supper, and go to bed, so this was something very different for a change!  Guess the poor guy deserved a night out and Tequila.  I have Taxol #10 tomorrow and I dread it SO MUCH!  Thank goodness only two left after tomorrow. Last week's tx really got to me, and I have been so tired all week.  I swear, when I get through with chemo, I think I'll get plastered! Take care, all and hope everyone is well! Mary Jo",

I'm so glad you mentioned Montel Williams' book-- I saw that on Amazon.com and wondered about it.  I'm interested in reading Ice Bound, a book about a lady doctor that got breast cancer while at the South Pole, did her own surgery and treated herself until the weather broke so she could travel back to the US.  I figured that might make my treatment feel pretty easy compared to hers, unless it's a depressing book.  Has anyone out there read it? It's been out a while I think. Are you going turkey hunting this spring?  I am so ready but I've got to get my arm back in shape to shoot my heavy Mossberg 12 gauge.  I've not shot it since last summer right before the bf dx.  Will we always think of our life in terms of before and after bc?  That stinks. Take care and feel better soon! Mary Jo",

I decided to come down off Cloud 9 for a while and check in with you guys.  We had four inches of snow and are expecting a freeze-over tonight which will result in lots of black ice.  My plan was to spend a couple of days at my daughter's house (and dog-sit with her dachshund) when birthing time came, but the bad weather changed my plans!  Instead I drove 2 hours yesterday morning (\"mad dash down the highway\" would describe it better) just in time to hear my grandson's first cries, then drove the 2 hours back home last night before the snow set in-- truthfully a wise choice, but a painful one.  I sure hated leaving my daughter and new grandson, but my son-in-law is taking very good care of them while they're still in the hospital.  I'm so proud of both \"dad\" and \"mom\".  My daughter's due date wasn't until next Monday, the 21st, so this was a surprise.  She is a very dedicated kindergarten teacher and was worried about lesson plans for her substitute on the morning Mason was born!  He weighed 7 lbs, 2 oz. and was 20 inches long, with a head full of dark hair with blond streaks (much more hair than I have!)  My daughter has dark hair and a slight olive complexion and her husband is very fair with red hair, so it will be so much fun seeing who Mason grows up to resemble.  I just can't wait to get my hands on that darling again soon!  I'm going to kiss him all over!  So wonderful to have something else to focus on besides BC!  And I plan to be around a long time for that little boy!! I hope everyone is feeling well today.  I read your posts about radiation with great interest, since I'll be starting them hopefully in February, and I am glad you are sharing your experiences. I know this will pass too and we'll all be on our way to recovery and BC will be a blur in our minds soon!  Paxton, I hope you're not too tired today, and hopefully bf will take you out for a nice steak dinner or something for rescuing him at lunch the other day!  What would our guys do without us? Marietta, I wish you the best of luck on your rads!  I'm glad to hear it's easier than chemo.  Sorry to hear about your wig and I hope they get it fixed.  My hot flashes have lessened lately, not sure why.  Do rads affect the frequency of hot flashes any?  I'm getting so very impatient for hair.  I still think that affects my body temp a lot. Cheryll, congratulations on your last day of rads!  I know you're so glad to have it behind you!  I can relate to the bills-- I'm hoping to get mine paid off within the next decade, because that's the best I can do.  I hope you can catch up on your rest soon.  Harsch, the steroids have been my nemesis during chemo!  I have my tx on Mondays, feel great on Tuesdays, then the downward spiral comes on Wednesday (except this Wednesday-- I was too happy about my grandbaby for any side effects!), and then Thursday I start feeling much better.  It's been that way every week with the 12 weeks of Taxol, but some are worse than others.  It really works on my mental state, but you hang in there with it, ok?  It'll pass very quickly, I promise! Well everyone take care and have a great Thursday evening! Mary Jo",

      "Content": "Jan 22, 2008 08:54AM - edited Jan 22, 2008 08:57AM by bluewillow Hello to all! Cheryll, is the book you read called \"After Breast Cancer: A Common-Sense Guide to Life After Treatment\" by Hester Hill Schnipper?  I am reading that book now, the version with the yellow cover, which is not the updated one (the updated version has a pink cover).  Strangely, there are parts of the book that are very good, but also parts that I find very depressing, discouraging, and dark, and got some mixed messages.  Sometimes the author just puts it plainly that your life will never be good or fun after breast cancer.  Then other times, she says one will be fine and recover completely.  Cheryll, please don't think I'm being critical of your recommendation, because there are very good points to the book, such as the three great quotes that you pointed out.  Another book I really enjoyed, and it is geared for those with Stage 1 and 2 cancers, is \"Just Get Me Through This!\" by Deborah A. Cohen.  This book was totally upbeat, but the downside to it is that it needs to be updated to 2008.  I found some great things in it though, along with lots of encouragement and real hope.  I have found that just staying away from books, websites, etc., that I find scary or depressing has helped me not get down and feeling doomed. I guess that's the \"head in the sand\" way of living, but so be it.  I cannot stand to visit the www.her2support.org website-- I have found very little encouragement at that website, certainly not like here!  Another great book I just finished, really my favorite:  Living Through Breast Cancer by Carolyn M. Kaelin, a doctor who is also a breast cancer survivor.  It is very helpful and upbeat also. Just some of my thoughts and recommendations.  I'd love to hear some more from everyone! We are all very different in the way we handle our breast cancer tx and healing, and that is what makes us such great pals here!  If I couldn't work every day, I'd have gone nuts and probably gone off the edge a long time ago.  But then again, I have pushed myself a lot and am really feeling the fatigue now to where I need to take a break.  So, it's perfectly ok to not work and stay at home and take care of yourself in anyway you can.  And Paxton, you made perfect sense about not needing the stress of working!  Your outdoor activities have helped you heal, and I've missed out on all mine because I've been at work! Tri, my gut feeling is I think you should go for the node surgery and get all that out of there.  Then you would have no doubts, and you will heal faster than you think.  I sincerely wish you the very best of luck, whatever your decision.  Let us know what you decide. Marietta, Congratulations on your precious son's communion! I am with you on the chemo brain. Mine has gotten much worse in the past two or three weeks.  Yesterday, after treatment, it was really bad. Taxol #11 hit me harder than any of the rest, and I was just wiped out.  I think it's because I forced myself to stay awake during tx and not have my \"benadryl nap\".  I was so tired I could hardly eat my lunch and didn't have the \"up\" feeling that I usually have because of the steroids.  Maybe they forgot them all together! Well, sorry this is so long and blog-like!!!!  Gotta go now to have my echo to see if my heart is pumping sufficiently after having Herceptin.  Hope it's a-ok! Take care and hugs to all, Mary Jo ",

I am at my daughter's house for a few days spoiling my brand new grandson, and I thought I'd give him a break for a while  and check in with you wonderful ladies... Tri, I really feel that your body has already healed from the smoking damage of years ago.  I have read many times that when one stops smoking, the body begins to repair itself immediately, so please don't worry too much about this.  Have you showed the article to your rad dr.?  I just have a feeling you will be fine.  And best to you on your surgery. Paxton, I wish you the best on your genetic tests.  90 percent is an extremely good chance you're going to be fine and won't have to worry any further about it.  And so glad your bf gave you the extra encouragement and support-- you deserve it.  Hang in there! We're all sure rootin' for you! Karyll, I've heard it's common for the liver profile to be out of whack.  I just bet your onc will give you good news on Tuesday.  I just learned also that having an abnormal pap is common, and I had that scare a couple of months ago.  If they're going to do these dang tests, I wish they'd be more careful about their wording and how they present the results.  I truly wish that part of the money for all this pink crap that is being sold would go for legislation in favor of FAST test results and a wait of no longer than one hour.  The waiting on the results and interpretations is by far the worst part of all this. I finally got the official word from my onc.'s nurse today about my echo/heart tests, after being frightened by the echo tech.  The nurse said the echo and my injection fraction test were both perfectly normal-- YAY, thank goodness that's one less worry!  Now, I'm dealing with some slight depression, not really because the end of my chemo is near, but I think I am stepping back and looking closer at my life and what it has meant and what I would like to accomplish with the rest of it and I want it to really mean something. (not that I think I'm dying soon or at least I hope not-- I think this is part of menopause and aging too, not just the bc issue, because I was having these thoughts before I was dx'd)  I've been mentally tired lately and need to have some fun to put the spark back into life. (of course, a new grandbaby has helped- I just need more sparks)  I have considered asking for a mild dose of anti-depressants, but am very hesitant-- drugs like that scare me.  Anyone else have any experience with A-D's?  My sister and niece have both taken them for years and truly they are both fruit-loops now  and I don't want to end up that way. Take care, everyone! Mary Jo",

Crap,I wish I'd quit reading stuff online-- all I'm doing is getting scared!!!  http://www.breastcancer.org/risk/environmental/new_research/20071211b.jsp I just read this article about weight gain and lower survival rates here on breastcancer.org.  Here is the part that scared me: \"Women who reported gaining more than 10 kilograms (22 pounds) since their breast cancer diagnosis had approximately an 80-percent increase in their risk of death; women who had a BMI in the obese range after diagnosis had more than twice the risk of breast cancer mortality compared to women with a normal BMI.\"  It almost sounds that whatever your prognosis, if you're overweight, you're going to die for sure!  Has anyone's doctor addressed this issue?  When I asked mine, he looked me square in the eye and said my weight gain was from steroids!  But how long does it take for them to wear off and make weight loss possible again? Officially, I gained 17 pounds w/chemo, but I think I've added 2-3 more lately (found Valentine Peanut M&M's on sale ).  This article has literally scared the P out of me!  I've got to get it in gear.  I've decided I am going to follow the South Beach diet or a similar kind of low carb diet, along with regular walking, beginning immediately! I'm writing this during my lunch break at work, but I haven't eaten anything and have certainly lost my appetite.  In fact, I'm sick w/fear right now!  Tri, I've been playing around w/fitday and it will be a great planning tool! Marietta, have you heard back from your dr. about the a-d's yet? Paxton, I sure hope you are warm and are getting to your rad tx today. I hope everyone has a good Friday and a great weekend! Hugs!

Boob-b-Q-- that is SO funny!!!!!   I had my tattoos today and CT planning.  I can't remember if I related the story about my difficulties with the radiology oncologist on this thread (I did on the Feb. rads group thread), but my consultation with him was 02/06, and I literally wanted to bolt and run after meeting the doctor.  Some reasons why: he removed my cap without asking to look at my hair re-growth (not sure why he'd care), examined my left boob first (it was my right one w/cancer), told me I would have a \"break\" after 3 weeks of rads (no one else has had a \"break\"-- scary) then told me they had no afternoon appointments when I asked for them.  Well, I agonized over it a few days, then called his office and told them I was going to another practice (a much longer commute) so I could have afternoon appointments.  I want to work as many hours as I can, then leave and go to rads, then on home to crash.  I even set up an appointment with the other rad. onc. practice.  Well, 5 minutes after I talked to his receptionist, the first rad onc called me at home and at work and told me he would do anything to accommodate me and they could do afternoon appointments, and they really wanted me to come to their practice.  My surgeon/onc had recommended him, but he just left a bad first impression.  But to his credit, his office ladies and rad techs were very nice and totally ok.  So, I decided to go back and now I'm glad I gave him another chance.  The rads tech that did my CT scan and tattoos is great-- nutty but very sweet and seemingly very competent.  She also explained the reason for the \"break\", and she said it would be for skin-breakdown reasons and if I needed one, it would only be for 3-5 days, a normal thing for big boobed women like me (yay.) So, now I am happy, I reckon. How neat that your son got to go with you to rads!  I'm glad to hear he was treated like the true prince that he is!  And Happy Birthday to him!  I bet the movie will be a fun experience.  What are they going to watch?  Just get a big tub of buttery popcorn and have fun too!  And please let me know about your website!  Sounds great!  My son-in-law's dad just totally outfitted Mason in hunting camo clothes at BassPro, so he will definitely need the appropriate footwear!  I hear he got three hats, onesies, overalls, and shirts, all in camo.  Watch him turn out to be a golfer, which would delight my dad and son, of course. Have a great evening, everyone!  Hope all are doing well! Mary Jo",

I've had the worst shoulder pain lately but I know it is because I am tensing up and not realizing it until the pain starts, but before I remember I am tense, guess what I'm thinking...  When I was at the cancer center on Monday getting my Herceptin treatment, the resident counselor there was making her rounds, talking to all the chemo patients, and finally she came to me.  We talked a while and I mentioned the subject of freaking out about recurrence and mets, etc., and she said that was perfectly normal and that it would definitely decrease with time.  She said \"have the thought, then move on and don't give it any more of your life\", and also remember that \"help is just a phone call away if something does come up\".  I felt so much better after talking to her and it relaxed me a lot to talk to her.  I have never talked to a counselor before in my life and never thought it would help, but it did, just a short 15 minutes worth.  I may even make an appointment with her to talk more.  I hope the yoga works for you in relieving your tension.  Did the onc office ever call you back?  The radiation mapping is a breeze-- I have wonderful rad techs and I hope you do too.  Mine are very chatty and it keeps my mind off the process.  And Happy Anniversary tomorrow!  Enjoy your nice dinner and let us know how you like your juicer-- would love to hear what all you make with it!  Yay for your courage to go commando!  (I say \"you go girl\" too!) I wish I could go commando, but I refuse until I get more hair on top of my head.  The rad techs told me today that wearing scarves and hats would impede the hair growth process-- how wonderful to hear and it 19 degrees and a 40 mph wind!  If it was 75 outside, I'd be glad to leave the headgear at home.  Your spinning class instructor should be slapped , or all her hair should just fall out one day, or just half of it-- that would be better.  I've had people in the grocery store turn around and go the other way, thinking I don't notice.  I usually follow them just to irritate them.  Hang in there, Tri.  Things are getting better!!

Tri, I have had shoulder pain ever since I started rads and I know it's from holding my arm in place above my head.  I have shoulder bursitis anyway, and that's not helping any.  I've been told it will improve soon.  I've had some real fatigue too, but I've noticed is isn't as bad when I eat well (more protein) and it comes and goes, isn't consistent with every day.  I've not been resting enough either-- gotta slow down some. Marietta, glad the job is going so well!!  You sound really great and am glad you're doing so well! Hugs to all and take care, everyone! Mary Jo ",

Glad to hear the mouth sores have really improved too!  How much baking soda and salt and water do you use for rinsing?  You'd think I could figure out something that simple, but I am a flunky in the kitchen... Good luck to you, Paxton, and I hope you start feeling much better very soon with the addition of some real food!  Please let us know how you are doing!

It may seem like an odd post but I know you all can help me with this. My daughter is visiting us this weekend and just called and invited me to an outdoor folk festival this weekend at the local university (Mountain Heritage Day in Cullowhee, NC), and I immediately said Yes! but then I just remembered about how chemo patients are advised not to go into crowds.  It will be held outdoors and it is a very clean environment with only local food vendors and exhibitors (no fast food or typical \"fair\" food or rides, etc).  Of course I always watch what I eat out like that, but will I be ok if I go and take my Purell hand sanitizer and just be careful?  What would you all do?  I'd just hate to miss time with my daughter who lives down east and I don't see her real often.  Thanks for your feedback!

Thank goodness for the nurses giving you samples, so now you can start your Christmas shopping!

I love Italian food and when I start feeling better, I plan to dive into a pan of lasagna asap.  I know that will make me feel better Thanks and take care everyone! Mary Jo",

I must say that I am feeling about 200 percent better today than yesterday.  And I do believe that I was close to being dehydrated, because I have really increased my water intake today too and felt fine.  No fatigue or rotten feeling whatsoever.  And I worked a full 9 hours today.  And I have to tell something funny on myself-- this past Sunday, we were visiting my husband's brother and his wife and just out of the blue I said, \"I'd love to have a cold beer right now!\"  Well, it's funny because I don't drink beer!!!  But something triggered a thought about it and it sounded so appealing.  So, I guess that's another sign I needed more fluids...  I do like wine but stay away from it now.  I'd rather just spend my calories on a hot fudge brownie sundae with vanilla ice cream... Be safe and stay well, everyone! hugs from Mary Jo",

Would it be ok if I go totally off topic for just a bit?  Well, this is sort of related to chemo...  I could post this elsewhere but I feel like you all are my buddies! I am interested to hear how you ladies are dealing with the upcoming holidays.  This year, it is going to be very different for me, of course because of the chemo and all the physical and mental SE's, plus my daughter is pregnant and won't be coming in for Christmas because it's so close to her due date, plus my husband wants to go out of town for Christmas for a mini-vacation.  And now he says he wants to go out to a restaurant for Thanksgiving dinner!  We've always pretty much done the same thing every year and spent most of the time with my family (his parents have passed on and his grown kids do their own thing) I know he should have a say in what we do, so do I just go with the flow and enjoy whatever happens?  I would be interested to know how you all are handling the holiday planning, celebrations, etc. and I welcome any hints and advice.  Thanks for letting me go OT for a bit and thanks in advance for your responses.

Paxton, I'm glad you're feeling better. And yes it is all a Catch-22! Do you get lots of heartburn with your Taxol?  I have been belching frequently and feel like I have a bubble in my chest at times, just like when I have a GERD flare up. Still taking the Zantac they prescribed at the cancer center. But I have no nausea or queasiness at all, in fact I feel really energetic, finally!  I have to drive three hours today for an overnight job-related trip, so I hope I do ok-- I dread being away from home and my dr. (and hubby!) that long. No body aches yet, but I've got the Advil ready.  So, Paxton, do you think movement helps the aches?   Hi Janice, I don't get the tearing much but my nose is just pouring water-- is that part of the Taxol SEs?  My face was blood red and puffy yesterday so I got a little panicky and called the cancer center and they told me it was a steroid side effect and it would go away in a couple or three days. It's much better today and I don't look like I've been slapped and sunburned! I hope everyone has a lovely fall day! Mary Jo  The NP at the cancer center recommended 50 mg of Vitamin B, three times a day, for the neuropathy, but I can't find just Vitamin B.  Or maybe I'm just dense-- is there just a Vitamin B without B3, B6, B12, etc?  ",

I would feel it just randomly while moving around the house and changing positions while sitting or standing. I will not be having Neulasta at all w/the Taxol.  I have to say that I honestly believe this Taxol (number 3) is a lot easier so far than the first two (so there IS hope, Karyll!)  I did find out yesterday that I am anemic and started taking my iron yesterday after my tx, and don't know if it's psychosomatic, but I already feel better!  Also, I ran out of my generic Ativan last weekend, and did without for about three days, and it was dreadful!! Aside from awful anxiety, I had terrible chest pressure and didn't realize that was a withdrawal symptom until I talked to the chemo nurse yesterday. I won't run out again, you can bet that!  I have gained 15 lbs and am so depressed but I am determined to lose this weight, even before tx ends.  Tri, at least you are exercising, so don't beat yourself up, please!  And don't worry about sending negative vibes-- we can handle it!

I hope everyone is feeling well tonight.  I have Taxol #4 tomorrow-- gee the weeks are flying by!  I have made up my mind that I'm not gaining one more ounce even if I have to starve, because I am so miserable and mad at myself right now for gaining.  Tonight I feel (and look) like a pregnant Michelin Man!  Marietta, I love the pun about the water retention!   Hope your pizza was good!

I hope you get to go turkey hunting-- you will love it.  To me, it is much more exciting than deer hunting because you have to really be quiet and alert.  The first time I turkey hunted, I got one and as soon as I shot, I screamed, and my husband thought I'd shot myself!  I was just so excited, and we had a fine dinner that evening.  The breast is very delicious and tender, but the legs aren't much good eating.  Your DNR programs sound like loads of fun-- I'd love to do that one day.  Go for it and let me know how it goes! Urbie, WOW you had a busy Thanksgiving, and that's great!  Your gift baskets sound wonderful-- what do you put in them?  You must be really talented and creative.  And lots of congratulations on your last tx and on your weight control!! I had Taxol #4 today with absolutely no problems. In fact, I feel better tonight than I have in a long time and didn't get real groggy or loopy like I have been.  It was an eventful day in the chemo room.  My chemo nurse, who is a darling and happens to be an acquaintance, said their Monday had been crazy and I was witness to part of it!  There was a lady in her mid-30s who came in, got hooked up to her IV, and absolutely lost in right there in front of everyone, including her useless husband, who just sat there and never said one word!  She decided she did not want chemo and demanded to be unhooked until she could think it over.  She was upset because she wants more kids, and she has 3 already, but is refusing chemo-- none of which makes any sense to me!  I felt sorry for her, but at the same time, just don't understand-- why would she not want to be around for the 3 kids she already has?   Then, another lady who was having her last chemo tx for ovarian cancer had an allergic reaction to the Taxol and Carboplatin and every nurse there was tending to her, bless her heart.  She was real good natured and talkative, but was sneezing, having trouble breathing and was beet-red and scared everyone in the room.  She was still there when I left-- hope she's ok. Well that's my novelette for today.  I hope everyone is doing very well and staying warm.  Take care and the best to all, MJ",

I'm glad to hear you and Miller had a good time outside.  You'll get that pheasant eventually!  Glad you got the insulation done, now you don't have to worry about the pipes freezing.  That's a pain-- been there, done that.  Hope you get to go with your friend for lunch and have fun in the snow!",

DH is mad at me over the insurance check I spent on paying other bills, and I didn't consult him first and it really hurt his feeings.  And I didn't tell him because I was afraid he'd be mad-- DUH!! I feel so bad about not telling him and now realize my mistake, because knowing I hurt him and now I'm afraid he doesn't trust me and that's a sickening feeling to me.  We've been married 5 yrs, tho been/lived together for about 13, and it's not like we don't know each other well.  All I could think of the last 2 nights was \"maybe I deserved to get bc\"...  All this on top of bc-- what stress! Trigeek, I can totally relate to your \"freaking\" feelings-- I am having those myself.  Like you, some days I am strong as nails and others I get into this awful dark depression funk. From what I have read, the feelings we are having are perfectly normal, but sometimes that doesn't make them easier.  Let me know if the yoga therapies work-- they sound very interesting.  And I think I will have to go to with Nexium- stronger than Zantac. Paxton, I do hope you get a pheasant!  And try not to stay mad at Miller too long. I know exactly what you mean about the moods... but just remember, things will get better!  It helps me to talk to other ladies who have gone through bc treatment and see how well they are doing and how they are leading \"normal\" lives now.  I have a close friend/co-worker who helps me out so much, especially when I look at the gorgeous hair she has now!  We'll make it thru this!",

After finally giving up and going to bed at 10:30 last nite, woke up at 3 a.m., got on eBay and some quilting sites, so I'm going to crash about 2 o'clock this afternoon, right into my keyboard! The chemo room was jam-packed full yesterday, including a lady who had gotten herself dehydrated over the weekend.  Her husband literally led her in and sat her down in the chair because she was almost to the point of collapse. That pretty much was an emergency for the nurses to handle, and they almost forgot to give me the herceptin and started my flush too early. That was ok though and I don't dare complain to those precious nurses because I could not do their jobs.  The lady sat in the chair beside me and I heard her start crying and saying 'i'm not going to make it through this' and my heart just sank. (I had a crying spell myself before seeing the nurse practitioner yesterday-- I just had a meltdown b/c I was so sick of going there)  I had to start talking to her and tell her that she would make it fine (she's taking A/C now and will start Taxol soon) and that her cancer would be cured and she'd be fine!  She was in her early 60's, sweet and very easy to talk to, and her hubby was so supportive of her.  About 15 min. after they started her fluids, I told her her color was already improving, and it was.  I told her how I drank about 1-2 liters of water the day before, day of, and day after chemo tx's, and for her to try to do that too, and to keep something in her stomach at all times.  When she left, she came over and thanked me over and over for my help.  That made me feel good that I could help someone else and hope to see how she's doing next week.  I had a better appreciation of yesterday after all that than I did when I first got there.  Like I've been told, there are reasons for everything. Trigeek, you are just so awesome!!!  And I enjoyed your blogs tremendously.  Gee you are one gorgeous fit lady!   And good idea to stay out of the lake water while on chemo, I think.  I have forgone winter camping for that reason.  I wish you the best on your lymph node consultation-- please let us know what you find out and we'll be thinking of you.  And best of luck with the spinning class-- you'll do great!!!!! Paxton, glad you enjoyed the make-up session.  Don't let the other ladies' situations get you down.  They might not have had all the meds we've had, or found it at a much later stage, etc.  That is the main reason I don't attend support groups-- I tend to think everyone's bad situations are mine too...  Tri had a good point about the relativity of situations.  I think we just can't worry about the recurrence thing, though I know from talking to others who have come thru tx and been declared cured, they always think about it from time to time, but it gets much easier with time.   Hope everyone has a great day!  MJ ",

Methusala, how are you-- doing very well I hope?  Stillkickin, how's the low carb diet going and I hope you got the issue with your armpit thing resolved. I went yesterday for an ultrasound on a \"lump\" that I felt near my SNB scar and they told me it was scar tissue. Whew, big relief. Paxton, it's good to hear from you!  I don't get on here a lot either, or not as much as I used to anyway.  I'm glad you're doing good and congratulations on your first duck!  Sounds like you did a lot of great healing during your camping.  And gosh camping food tastes so good and I firmly believe it has to be good for you whatever it is as long as you're out in the woods and fresh air.  I haven't lost much weight according to the scales, but I'm in much better shape physically and cardio-wise and I can feel myself improving every day I'm outdoors.  All my hunting clothes are too big, so I guess that's a good sign. Gee we need a reunion here of sorts-- I know, we're all trying to forget about our cancer experiences but it would be nice to know how everyone is doing, so chime in here if you can and let us know how life is treating you all! Here is a photo of me with part of my dove harvest on Labor Day this year.  I only got to be a spectator last year, but boy did I use up the shells this year! (the doves are safe-- just got 3)  The first time I shot, I cried, partly because of boob/arm pain, but mostly because of pent-up emotions thinking of the past year's events.  Finally got to bowhunt Saturday-- no harvest but had a great time. Love to all, hope to hear from you guys! Mary Jo   ",

I wear a sleep cap at night, and it gets too hot.  I take it off, lay down, and my head hits an ice cold pillow!  Gee whiz, can't win for losing.  I guess that's what hair is for and for someone that never really liked their hair, I sure miss mine.  Is anyone taking anti-depressants for hot flashes?  I heard that helps, but am very leary of more meds. Well, now that I got that off my chest-- uh head-- I'll lighten up some... Paxton, I've always heard that hair grows during rads.  And I am having the chest pressure thing too, but I know mine is anxiety.  Do you think that could be causing yours?  If I don't keep Ativan in my system (I only take .5 mg twice a day), I really get bad symptoms. This has been a week of melt-downs for me.  I wish I could do something about the emotional rollercoaster I'm on.  I think it's the holidays too, but the tx's are really getting to me.  I just want to scream at the thought of going back to the cancer center.  I know I'm whining and I'm sorry, because you all are having the same thing too!  But bless you all and thanks for listening to me. Marietta, I am so sorry to hear about your friend.  We have a school bus driver who has had lung cancer for six years and is doing very well-- still driving every day.  Seeing other people w/advanced cancer is both difficult and inspiring.  I was in the grocery store last week and ran into my old junior high English teacher, who has prostate cancer.  He is loved and remembered by everyone and he probably taught every baby boomer in the town that I live in and knows and remembers all of his old students.  I talked to him and hugged him, and I plan to stay in touch with him.  I cried all the way to my car because he was so vibrant and healthy, never owned a car and walked everywhere, and he has damn cancer.  So much for being nice and living healthy? Trigeek, Good Luck with your upcoming decisions.  And I think your weight gain theories are totally correct.  I am very grateful for your knowledge about fitness and the insight that it could very well be a metabolism thing, rather than just due to eating more and doing less.  Since I've been on Taxol, my appetite and cravings have slowed considerably and I'm not pigging out like I was and have been more active, but sure haven't lost any weight.  I sure plan to get busy after Jan. 28- my last one!  Hey ladies, are you all celebrating after your last chemo?  I'm trying to come up with something appropriate... a scarf-burning, maybe? Take care everyone, and have a pleasant weekend! Love and hugs and thanks for all your support, from Mary Jo",

The nurse practitioner at Hope Cancer Center where I go recommended South Beach, but I found that a bit restrictive for eating during chemo.  I'd love ideas on how to modify SB if that is a good one.  And, so you think exercise is the real key to all this, even more important than the eating plans?  Thanks for your help on this-- you're great inspiration for us!!!!!!!!

OK, here's my whine for tonight: I am having heart palpitations like crazy.  I have them anyway (before chemo), thanks to menopause, and I've had all the heart tests and checked out fine, etc., but they've been increasing in the last several days, especially right after I eat.  And I have noticed they are worse when I eat anything w/sugar.  Does anyone else have a clue about this?  It's driving me nuts.  I do plan to mention it tomorrow at my monthly visit w/the nurse practitioner.  They generally decrease when I am active, have no pain, but just very annoying.  For the brief few months that I took hormone replacement therapy, I was palp-free, but chose to quit taking them when I was dx'd with bc. Paxton, I hope you're feeling better and not getting the flu.  And I like the idea of dark chocolate at every meal... I can certainly handle that!  Did your bf get through with the tomato beers?  I had to ask my hubby what that was-- he described them in detail-- seems he had quite a few back in his logger/drinking days... Marietta, I hope you had that nice glass of wine.  I certainly plan on having some after chemo is done.  In nearby Asheville, there is a nice Italian (chain) restaurant called Carrabas, and I plan to load up my parents, hubby, kids & spouses, and anyone else and go there to celebrate, sometime in February.  I love their food and atmosphere and I plan to indulge 'til I bulge (more so than now)!  I'm hoping your prediction is correct-- hmm, that will fall on Friday, so I'll have the whole weekend to play Grandma for the first time!   I'm looking forward to some more predictions here, y'all... Have a nice Sunday night, everyone! Mary Jo",

It sounds like your rad dr. is very knowledgeable and wise and glad he made you laugh.  That's what we all need more of-- laughter! Take care! MJ",

I still haven't decided whether to bring up the a-d issue yet. If I could just get myself on a strict diet/fitness program, I'd see a big difference and probably not need the a-d's, but getting started is the problem! Some days I have such a lack of interest in my health (and everything else), and that's not good... I'd love to see a pic of you and your son in your new hairstyles! Take care, MJ ",

YAY!  I'm not normally a regular mall visitor, but I'm getting desperate to get out and see some different scenery... I'm broke b/c of co-pays and extra gasoline, but lookin' is still free, right?

Tri, I am glad you got some good info from your oncologist.  I think you are on the right track.  I really like what your onc said about the port removal- can I borrow those reasons in case mine says we need to leave mine in?  Although I won't have further surgery, I feel everything he said makes sense and I don't even want to hear anything about mine not taken out the minute I finish Herceptin.  And at least you will have plenty of time to heal before rads.  You go girl! Paxton, good luck at the derm's office and like Marietta said, it is a really good idea to get checked out regularly.  Is it warmer there yet and how's your car?  Hope you're feeling better and just keep plugging along-- tx will be over soon and you'll be on your way to total recovery! Marietta, sorry to hear about your wig but glad you are ok.  And I'm glad your herceptin is going well.  I feel really great and can really feel a difference in my energy level this week.  Thank goodness I don't have the downhill slide off the steroids-- that was dreadful! Are you all getting hair yet? Well, here's my pre-chemo (and pre-chemo fat) photo, as requested by Tri!  I look pretty washed out and droopy...    MJ ",

The ladies at the center are absolutely precious!  The nurse I had happened to be the wife of one of my former co-workers, and they both are just great folks.  So she took special care of me for that reason and I was not one bit scared.  She explained everything to me and even gave me written instructions and details so I would remember-- that is sure helpful for me!  I go back tomorrow for my Neulasta shot and I hope I feel good then too for the trip back over there.  I hope you have recovered from your bout with dehydration-- I know that must have been really miserable for you.  And glad to hear you got some Zantac-- that stuff works wonders!  I have taken that for years for my acid reflux and thankfully they upped my dosage for the chemo months.

And thank you for your kind words-- I'm so glad I can help.  When I was first dx'd, I immediately thought the worst and did not have a positive attitude.  But the more I learned (mostly from this board) the more I realized how much hope there is in beating this!  And you will be fine too!!!  I hope you are healing well.  I am just now getting away from the pain that went with mine, which wasn't too bad.  The SNB was a bit uncomfortable, but now, unless I turn a certain way, I forget I had it. My port felt funky for a while, but strangely since I had my first blood draw last week and my first tx on Monday, it doesn't hurt now.   I wish you the best tomorrow!  You sound like a strong lady and you will make it through just great!!!  I too had plenty of \"freaking out\" days when I just knew I couldn't make it through the chemo. I know all the stuff they give you to read at the chemo training is overwhelming-- mine was 9/11 (of all dates!) and my head was spinning when we got through, but the nurse really took her time and made me feel at ease.  And I have to tell you-- my first chemo was a total breeze!!!  I suppose I was lucky, because I personally know the nurse that took care of me and she was so comforting and explained every single thing she did and what I could expect.  I am sure they will do that for you too.  She also explained that today's chemo treatments are nothing like the ones in the past and that there is no reason to be sick with all the improved meds they have now. The actual infusion was a piece of cake, and I have yet to be anything beyond just a wee bit queasy, and just eating a light snack or crackers make it go away.  I have been sleeping the best I've slept in weeks, and that's helped me feel good.  I really feel a positive attitude is the only way I can deal with this-- being negative just causes anguish for me and my precious husband, who has stuck with me like glue.  I think if you can go in with the mindset that you are not going to get sick, it will work.  I know it's only been two days for me, and goodness knows what I'll feel like tomorrow, but I think I'm going to make it fine.  And you will too!!!  Please let us know how your first tx goes as soon as you feel up to it. How many Taxols are you going to have?  I was originally scheduled for 12 weeks, then they said 16 weeks, now they say 12 weeks again.  I guess they'll have it figured out when the time comes.   One more bit of advice-- ask all the questions you feel like you need to, while you're in the treatment room!  I had a long list on Monday-- even went back yesterday for my Neulasta shot and had another list for them, which they all cheerfully answered.  By the way, my Neulasta shot was a breeze too.  So far, no side effects at all, and no pain other than a sting with the actual shot.  The nurse did take the time to warm it up and she said that made all the difference how it felt going in, so you might want to ask about that.  And I had mine in the fleshy (fatty) part of the back of my arm, right above the elbow, as opposed to the stomach area where some have it, and that might have made a difference.   Hang in there and I'll be praying for you and thinking about you tomorrow!!!  PM me anytime, ok?  We can help each other sail along smoothly since we are in the same boat!  Take care and best wishes!

As for the Biotene tooth paste, I think it tastes excellent, much better than I expected.  It is a little pricier than the regular, but I bought a big bottle of the Biotene mouthwash at Wal-Mart for a little over $5 and attached to it was a tiny sample of the Biotene toothpaste.  You might look for that special offer in your stores.  But the regular size tube is about $4-5 I think, but not that much more than the jazzed up fancy regular brands here.

I hope everyone is still doing well and feeling good today for the weekend.  Make sure you get lots and lots of rest.  I will log on later this evening after I get back from the fest.

Glad everyone is doing pretty well.  Trigeek, I can sympathize with the 'ice queen' feeling... you and I must be on about the same wave length or something because I started out thinking, ok, chemo is not going to interfere with the intimacy thing here, but now, after my #4 A/C, I really could care less.  Thank Heavens I have an understanding hubby... I am 51 and menopausal, and I think that has a lot to do with it too, and I even tried a product called Liquibeads which helped for the dryness. (and I have had an increase in night sweats) But I guess it's mostly a mind thing, especially when your body feels so weird from all these meds.  Paxton (hope you got the dog barf taken care of)-- I get that \"faraway\" feeling too- I've sure not figured that one out-- I felt closer to dh at first, but now, it's like we're just keeping our distance-- can anyone explain that?   We've just all gotta hang in there and like Karyll said, let's check out the \"mojo\" thread.  Laurie, you're gorgeous, and good luck on your job trip-- hope you feel well the whole time!  Urbie, I've considered keeping my new \"look\" too-- so easy to style!   Cheryll, I have noticed some very fine fuzz growing back too and it's increased just this week.  I wonder if it will leave again once I start the Taxol tho.  My husband says it looks like rabbit hair on the top of my head.  Whatever! Everyone have a great Friday night and pleasant weekend! Mary Jo",

MJ, hope you're feeling ok after your #4.  And Laurie I hope you are doing well too after your tx. My hair has been really growing for about a week, mostly spikey fuzz on top, but on the back, I'm getting thick, salt and pepper patches-- pretty funny looking!  I have noticed just a wee bit of stubble on my legs too- darn it!!  I still have all my eyelashes and my eyebrows have thinned only a slight bit.  I just hope it doesn't all fall out again during Taxol. Marietta, your Thanksgiving sounds very nice-- taking food to your friends' home.  (And who in the world wouldn't like sweet potatoes w/marshmallows? YUM)  Laurie, what you mentioned about being the center of attention in a crowd is a lot of what worries me this year.  My parents, uncles, aunts, and cousins on my dad's side always have a party Christmas Eve, and my husband is pretty much adamant about not going this year, and I am almost relieved.  The main reason is that no one on that side of the family (except my parents) has sent a card, visited, or even called me, and one of my cousins that lives really close by did not even know about my breast cancer until I walked into his art shop wearing a scarf a couple of weeks ago.  He and his wife thought I was just sporting a new look!  I hate to sound whiney or immature here, but this has hurt my feelings somewhat as hard as I have tried to look over it. Ironically, my sister, who I have been a bit estranged from for the past 5 years because she hasn't treated my parents well, has been the only relative of mine that has called to check on me regularly.  Since my diagnosis, my eyes (and heart) have certainly been opened to a lot of things that I would have normally missed.  On the other hand, my husband's family have called, visited, and offered to help on a regular basis.  His brother calls about me every single day.  And I know that everyone has different ways of dealing or not dealing with someon who has cancer.  Has anyone else had some strange or unexpected family reactions and experiences?  I guess that is why I posted my initial concern about celebrating the holidays this year.  It will be different, I know that, but maybe in a bittersweet and learning way.  Sorry this was so long. Thanks for letting me vent some more about this holiday thing. I am just so desperate to have some really pleasant and happy memories of this holiday season, however they happen.  Take care and be well, everyone! Mary Jo ",

I have IBS anyway and I think all the meds are just triggering it. I haven't had any more of the bleeding hemorrhoids either, thank goodness, and taking the stool softener instead of the ss/laxative combined. So, hang in there, it will get better!  I too have gained 15 lbs and am determined to get it off before I start rads.  I have been really trying to eat less to make up for my lack of exercise motivation, which I must start! I'm sure Paxton can tell you more about Minnesota's DNR, but it stands for the Department of Natural Resources, and North Carolina's is called the Wildlife Resources Commission but it's the same thing (each state has their own-FL's is www.myfwc.com), but that is the department which governs hunting, boating, and fishing licenses and permits, bag limits, hunting areas, wildlife conservation, hunting education and safety courses, hunting workshops and courses like the one Paxton talked about.  Gee, all the great things you can learn on this breast cancer forum ! I wish I was in sunny Florida, basking on the beach or at the pool in a lounge chair, with a tall glass of iced tea (Long Island, maybe), a stack of magazines and not a doctor or nurse or needle in sight!   Hope your aches and pains stop soon.

And Paxton, you're right about the normal life thing being very important. I just have to make up my mind that I'm going to be ok and not spend the rest of my life worrying about this stupid cancer coming back.  Is it possible just to ignore it and assume that it wont, because I could probably do that if I set my mind to it. I would not want to be a burden to anyone either. Paxton, hope your lunch is fun today and glad you got to visit your job.  I think getting out and socializing is very important and acting normal is good.  While hubby hunts this weekend (last of the season), I am driving my parents down to visit my daughter, where we'll all spend Saturday night and coming back Sunday afternoon.  I am a bit nervous because I hope I stay well (have the sniffles), but this is going to be a real adventure. I haven't spent the night in the same house w/my parents in over 20 years-- it should be fun!  Hope my daughter and her hubby think so... of course they will see us a lot when the grandbaby gets here next month!  They only live 130 miles away, so it should be a good trip.

My hubby, the extreme hunting and fishing expert, tried to teach me to fly fish years ago with no success.  I can bait cast all day long, but got very frustrated with the fly technique. So, that would be a great excuse to attend the CFR... thanks again, MJ, for the link!  They also have awesome quilt shows there too! Take care everyone!  Mary Jo ",

Marietta, yes, the 25th would be a very nice day!  My son-in-law's birthday is the 26th, and his dad's is the 11th, so we have lots of potentially good birthday matches here!  But woe be until us all if that baby is born on Grandpaw's birthday!  We'll never hear the end of it I want to ask how you are feeling since you are getting the chemo out of your system?  I am so excited for you and the other ladies who have finished.  I am counting down the days until Jan. 28.  And I want hair growth reports from all of you.  I'm convinced I won't have hair again until 2011. Methusala, I don't know what to make of the people that stare.  I just hope I never am guilty of doing that to someone.  The scary thing is if someone ever said anything to me or laughed at me and my husband was there, he'd probably end up in jail for assault.  He really cannot stand rude people, esp. when his wife is involved.

As for baby names, a boy will be Mason and a girl will be either Mallory or Maylee.  I think they're planning to put Katherine in there as a middle name with whatever they choose, and that is my mom's first name and my middle name (Mary Jo is my first name), so that will be nice!  I'm getting so excited!  I just realized today that her due date is on my next-to-last Taxol treatment day, so I hope that stuff goes in quick! I talked to the NP today about the palps, and she said since I'd had them previously, she didn't think they were anything related to chemo, but who knows.  I still think they are related to my diet (eating sugar) and probably anxiety, menopause, and stress, etc.   I hope yours have gone away.  Do you feel that you've got all the chemo out of your system?  I've wondered how long it takes.  I'd like to hear from Paxton about that too-- and Paxton, I hope you're feeling better today!  Hugs to all and have a pleasant Monday evening!

Tri, I echo everything Marietta said!  Please try not to worry, though that is easier said than done, just focus on the positive.  And truly, I hope you enjoyed those brownies without guilt! Marietta, I hope you had a nice dinner with friends.  I am trying to figure out an \"end of tx celebration dinner\" and I think I will hint heavily to my son and his wife, who are moving into the brand new house they built next weekend, and she is an awesome gourmet cook at only 22 and makes the most wonderful spaghetti sauce! At 51, I still can't cook hot dogs without ruining them (they're bad so I shouldn't be eating them anyway!) Paxton, are you any warmer today?  I hope so!  It was in the 60s yesterday and we went scouting on some game lands for a place to hang my stand for next year.  I barely made it up the steep hill, but heck, I made it!  It was so good to get outside and sweat and needless to say, I slept great last night!  And I am excited-- all of a sudden, I've gotten on a bow-fishing kick and want to buy some equipment-- I've never tried it but I'm determined that is going to be my new hobby for 2008!  I can sure use some hints, tips, and information!   I shot my bow yesterday and did extremely well!  DH was really surprised.  It sure boosted my morale and made me feel \"whole\" again. Pardon me, but I need to whine for a while!  I just noticed this morning that the toe nail on my big toe is coming off, weeping (gross-sorry!), and I am so afraid it will get infected.  I do believe this is a Taxol side effect-- anyone else had this?  What can I do to care for it?  It is starting to hurt this evening.  Crap, after finishing up the Taxol, I thought I was home-free from S.E.'s!   Ok, I'm thru whining for now... Take care! MJ",

And by the way, I re-read some things in the book you mentioned, and I didn't find them negative at all... See, you're not the only one with moods and being emotional... I'm sure I was the day I read whatever it was I read in the book that I thought was negative.  Tri, your family is absolutely beautiful!!!!!  And I know what you mean about the love-hate photo thing.  But I look at my current photos and in most of them, I see more of a 'spark' in my eyes than in the ones last year... hmm what does that mean?  I've also listened some to Joyce Meyer and she is great and a gutsy lady.  And I love what you said about staying busy inventing our new selves-- that is exactly what we have to do!!  But, we must never feel badly about being emotional-- heck we have a good reason to be, but I feel it's going to make us tougher when we come through all the tx's and recover our physical selves. Paxton, I am excited about bowfishing! I am going to start bow-shopping soon since I don't want to keep my hunting bow set up just the way it is  because it sure shoots sweet (sorry if I've already said that somewhere).  Do you shoot a compound or recurve bow for fishing?  Mine is a compound but I'd love to try a recurve or even a long bow. There is a thermal lake in the adjacent county that provides cooling for the power company there, and it is full of tilapia, which is considered a delicacy around here and is perfect to bowfish and I am so eager to get out there!  They don't allow electric motors on the lake, so it should be a nice, quiet peaceful place to take our drift boat.  Hurry up, fishing season! Sorry you didn't get drawn for turkey season.  You can always come here to NC and the bag limit is two.  From my office window this morning, I witnessed about 45 marching down the road until one of the guys test-driving a bus came along and they all flew-- pretty impressive sight!  We have got plenty of them, that's for sure.  I'm just now getting used to going commando around my husband, though he doesn't care if I wear a hat or not.  He shaves his head so he matches me anyway, except for his beard- and I may end up with one of those too, who knows?  I think my taste is improving some, but I'm starting to really crave cold food like salads and of course ice cream... strange!  Please let us see your picture when you finish drawing.  You're very talented! Ok, here's the wacky and emotional issue that I've been dealing with lately:  my husband's ex-wife, who has not remarried and has no significant other, has been calling our house for various reasons, for instance, to tell him what their grandkids are doing (their daughter and three kids live with her), asking about how to repair something at her house, car, etc. I have no reason to think anything at all is going on between her and my husband, but my fur stands up every time she calls    DH cannot understand why it bothers me when she calls and actually takes up for her saying she has changed from a very bitter woman to someone nicer in her old age.   She has also called to ask about me and how I am doing and is probably genuinely concerned, but the mean ol' bitty in me wants to say \"no I'm not dead yet!\"  I have even had times when I imagine them getting back together after I die of breast cancer... is that sick, or what?  I am not normally a jealous wife because I have no reason to be, but how can I stop my imagination from going wild?  I think if my ex called that often (he never calls anyway), I have a feeling dh would not really like it either.  I can't stand feeling this way!!!!! Thanks for letting me vent... Mary Jo ",

And no, Tri, you are NOT acting illogically-- heck far, anything related to BC is scary stuff to deal with! Just hang in there and don't beat yourself up for not hearing the \"message\" as clearly as you feel you should.  Here's how you have helped me:  all the while, I have been depressed and hating myself for not taking better care of myself, maintaining a lower weight and exercising more, because I feel that all the self-neglect is what caused me to have breast cancer.  BUT, I look at ladies like you, very healthy and fit and working hard at it every day, eating very well, and still bc has affected your life.  So, in a nutshell, I think \"anyone, no matter what shape or size or fitness level, can be affected by this stinking thing called breast cancer.  And I admire you so much, because you are such a remarkable lady and have stuck with your fitness efforts as best you could during all your surgeries and treatments, and YES, with utmost GRACE!  And thank you for reminding us that good does come out of bad!  SO, sweet lady, you are such an inspiration to me and to all of us and I thank you for it!!!!  How's that for a message? Hugs to you and the rest of the ladies that are left on the Sept. chemo thread-- you've all helped me so much!  Mary Jo ",

Keep the hints coming, please!  They are SO helpful! Best wishes to all, Mary Jo ",

I am dying to try it!!  I have a Parker Challenger compound that is a sweet little bow, but would like to get another one to set up for bowfishing.  I just came in a while ago from shooting into my Block target-- first time since my surgeries and I really surprised myself- a little weakness but did great!  (my hair usually gets in my way of my knocking point-- won't have to worry about that soon!) Hubby says he is going to put me in a ground blind, since he doesn't feel good about me being in my treestand yet, especially with all the medicines I'm taking, so there may be hope for my hunting season yet!!  And I do plan to do some rifle hunting in November.  I tagged along during dove season this year which was 2 weeks after my last surgery, cried the first day because I couldn't use my shotgun, but got some good video footage of my husband and his brother shooting, but still had a great time (even in 90 degree weather).  We met the game warden in the area and he suggested I use a crossbow during bow season and I almost cried-- that hurt my pride but he was just being nice and helpful. Glad you got to sight in your rifle and I hope you all have a great scouting and camping trip!  Take care of yourself but hang in there and do as much as you can!  I believe it is great therapy. Being outdoors has really brought me tremendous peace and strength during this bc thing. Thank you so much for the wash \"recipe\"!  I will begin it right away. I'm glad you're feeling better and that the venison and apricots worked.  We have a roast thawing that I plan on putting in the crockpot tomorrow.  I had my Neulasta shot today and breezed through it, so I'm hoping I'm past the point of the nausea thing.  I am not even tired, yet.  I'm trying not to brag, but I'm doing much better than I thought I would- just hope it keeps up for the rest of my tx's.  When is your next tx?  Mine is October 1 and I should have my last one Oct. 29.  Then onto the Taxol and Herceptin.  Take care and let me know how your scouting/camping trip goes!

Take care and be well, Mary Jo",

Marietta, I hope you like your hats.  Let me know how they are-- I am considering the ez chemo hat too.  And I'm sure your son thinks you rock in that doo rag!  Fun headwear has got to make this thing easier for us!  And thanks for the baby oil tip-- hadn't thought of that. The bone pain is a bit easier tonight.  I didn't realize it would start several days after the shot though-- is that everyone's experience?  I thought it set in right after the injection. Have a good nite, everybody! Mary Jo",

Hi Ellen and welcome!  Glad you're doing good with your tx.  You're lucky to have a darling little hugger to make you feel better!  Hang in there and try to rest as much as possible. Laurie, good luck tomorrow!  And I have to admit, I'm not the brightest bulb in the pack most of the time, but I am so curious-- why did you onco tell you to flush twice?  And I've had chemo brain for 51 years !  Your post was humorous. Paxton, I'm glad you're still doing good today-- hang in there!  I do plan to go to the festival.  And I'm hoping to do some hiking and deer scouting on Sunday with dh, but it won't be crowded with people, and with my luck, no wildlife either. Marietta, hope you're still feeling good after your tx today.  And those cute shirts on eBay-- I need one too!!  Maybe they offer them in lots for all of us? Good nite, all!  Best of luck everyone for tomorrow! Hugs from Mary Jo",

Maybe I should go back to doing it.  That is how I met my husband-- I was on the clogging team and he played in the bluegrass band that accompanied us.  I know you'll be glad to have your bf home.  Good luck on the meat packing-- hope you get it all worked up ok-- it is truly hard work and it's good that you're getting help and yes, stay away from the knives.  DH just left for bowhunting this morning-- hope he gets one for our freezer.  Sure wish I was going too. I have to get control of my eating.  I think I just need to cut carbs, mostly sweets.  I know how I would do it if I weren't taking chemo, but I don't want to risk skimping on nutrition.  If I could just get back out in the woods and do what I was doing before, I'd be fine.  I did shoot my bow a few times this week, did fine until the last shot, I just hit a wall-- couldn't move a muscle.  I've never done that before and it was sure discouraging   I may have to turn down the poundage on my bow just a bit for a while, but I'm only pulling about 48 lbs as it is.  I feel like a big wimp and can't seem to build my muscles back.  Guess I should just be grateful I'm not having worse side effects.  I got a big surprise at my work yesterday.  I work at our local school system where I maintain school bus routes on computer at the bus garage.  The bus garage is also in the same building as the school maintenance dept. and I work with about 30 guys and 3 other ladies.  We all work real close and are all buddies.  Well, everyone pitched in and donated money and surprised me with it yesterday morning, along with words of support and encouragement.  I was so touched that I cried like a baby-- I love them all so much and don't know what I'd have done without being able to go into work and have their support.  I am finding small but very meaningful blessings out of all this bc experience.  Even though we have great state employee insurance, I have worried about how to pay for all these co-pays I have to shell out with every chemo and Neulasta shot, and all that adds up quick.  I am certainly blessed in a lot of ways. Well sorry for my long posts- I'm rambling now and I'll go get in the shower and start my Saturday morning chores-yuk- and maybe hit a garage sale or two.  I hope everyone has a great weekend and is feeling well!

I've never had so many weird sensations in my life since this Taxol stuff.  I'm trying to be tough but it ain't working... I'm glad to hear you got to go duck hunting!  It sounds like fun-- I've never been but would gladly try it just to be outside.  We scouted our new deer lease last Sunday before gun season opened this week and though part of the trail was very steep, I barely made it a half a mile!  I was so discouraged at my lack of stamina.  Will it ever return?  Don't feel bad about being a wimp, Pax-- this stuff is brutal on us.  But we will be our hardy selves again soon!!  DH is gone all week with his brother on the lease, and at first I was a bit p-o'd at him for leaving me alone after my tx on Monday, but I have ended up really enjoying myself.  I had a great Thanksgiving, plus I have cleaned like mad just to keep occupied plus I've watched some old movies, worked puzzled, read, and had a nice period of solitude.  I think I was afraid of being alone, esp. with my thoughts, but I've been just fine!  And I have kept the woodstove going constantly!  It was 17 degrees here last night-- not a time when I'd want to be out in the woods, deer or no deer!  DH is coming home tomorrow and then we go Monday for Taxol #3 (YUKK).  I'm glad you had a great Thanksgiving with your friend and I know what you mean about the chemo comments.  I saw a lady today that I hadn't seen in a while and I swear she would not look me in the eye.  I guess that just teaches me not to do stupid things like that...

I can use that excuse now, but I wonder what my excuse was before I started chemo?  Paxton, congrats on your motivation to work out!  Send some my way,please.  Miller is so handsome!!  He reminds me so much of my son's black lab, Dixie, who is one of my two spoiled granddogs (the other is a mini-dachshund), and she also has her own swimming pool.  It is so much fun to watch her \"dive\" into that little bitty pool and knock most of the water out every time!  I can tell Miller is a happy dog by just looking at his face!  Does he like the snow?  Are you able to get out now and did you get your Christmas lights up?  I bet they're pretty against the snow. Hope you're feeling good today. Marietta, are you feeling better today?  Has your taste improved?  I know what you mean about the hunger thing, too.  I felt great yesterday but this morning I woke up with a weird sensation-- lots of acid reflux and chest pressure and not sure what to do.  I've taken my usual Zantac plus a Tagamet afterwards. I have GERD anyway and have been taking Slow Fe Iron Supplements and wonder if that is causing the reflux to worsen.  My diarrhea seems to be better, but I just feel \"off\" today, even though I'm at work and functioning ok.  Feel like I'm getting a cold too.  I think this is my crabby day. I had a meltdown last night-- it was like I just crashed into a depression and was snappy at my husband and in my eyes, he acted like he didn't care if I lived or died. He has definitely been pulling away lately and there is a distance between us that I have never felt before.  I hope we have a better time this evening.  Well that's my whining for today... take care everyone!

My daughter played flute in the orchestra for the Christmas pageant at her church last night, so we all attended that and it was so uplifting and enjoyable. My parents and I had a great trip, traffic was very light both going and coming (pleasantly strange!), and we all had a fantastic time! DH called me several times-- thankfully he missed me and I sure missed him. Paxton, thanks for your encouragement. And I can relate to everything you said, including the anxiety attacks over what we think is now \"nothing\"-- I had those about a year ago, all connected with menopause, but gee I wish that's all I had to worry about now. So, you are not alone and are perfectly normal. But please don't feel guilty about the thoughts about getting cancer-- like you said, everyone thinks and does weird things! And how was the Pampered Chef party? I got so excited when I read about you going-- my daughter is a Pampered Chef consultant as her second job (she is a kindergarten teacher also), and of course I have gobs of that stuff and I love it! I promised her I would host a show in the spring for the Help Whip Cancer pink campaign that they usually have. Did you buy something nice? I guarantee I know every product by heart... and I can't cook a lick but love it anyway! You sound like me with the girlfriends... I get along better with guys because I don't spend my time at the mall or the jewelry store or other typical female stuff. Most ladies think I'm nuts talking about shotguns and hunting and fishing, and lots of times I make guys mad because I try to be educated on outdoor issues and it makes them feel threatened-- but that's more a Southern male thing because my Washington State born hubby and brother-in-law are not like that. ps-- I hope you have a great time ice fishing-- hubby used to do that in when he lives out West and it sounds like so much fun-- let us know how you do. Trigeek, of course we could get together with a no-kill DNR! There's lots of things we could do! I'd settle for rock painting right now just to get out of the house and in the outdoors! Cheryll, Yes I have definitely mix up my words and say one thing when I mean another-- thank Heavens I'm not the only one! Please post more about your rads experience so we know what to expect, and I wish you all the luck with and hope it goes by fast. But I hope to Heaven my jerk dr. does not suggest leaving this dang port in like your jerk dr. did, because I think I will just haul off and hit him. I actualy asked the nurse practitioner about the recurrence within 1-2 years and she said no, that is not true. I know I keep mine for a year (next Nov.) for the Herceptin, but beyond that, it goes! It hurts almost constantly and bothers the crap out of me! (Anyone else's port still annoying?) I agree with Paxton, we got to keep living!!! Marietta, how are you doing? Hope you are well and enjoying the holidays! Have a wonderful Sunday evening, everyone! Mary Jo",

So, here's a link to a website that I thought was very comforting and informative.  The website is for the Deanna Favre Hope Foundation and there is a page called \"Surviving Breast Cancer\" which is very optimistic and has some very encouraging stats, which is what we all need, rather than stupid doctors that are jerks and doom-and-gloom people out there!  I especially appreciated the info on the lumpectomy (which I had and wonder if it was the right choice) vs mastectomy. And seeing Deanna Favre and how beautiful she is after BC is also extremely uplifting!  If you have problems accessing it, please send me a personal message and I'll help you out further.  Hugs from MJ http://www.deannafavre4hope.com/hopefoundation/beating+breast+cancer/surviving+breast+cancer/default.asp",

I hope everyone is feeling better by now and ready for a great new year in 2008!  Meth, I'm with you on the hair thing-- I want mine too!  I am so SICK of these dang scarves.  As soon as I get some hair on the back of my head, I'm wearing my ball caps (most of them are camo or have fish embroidered on them, but my boss doesn't care!)  For some reason, I've noticed people staring at me.  If kids stare, I don't mind, because they're kids.  But the adults really irk me.  Maybe they were staring all along, but it is just now really bothering me.  I just want to snap back and say what the H*** are you looking at, but so far, I've maintained my control.  Anyone else feel this way?  At least no one has said anything yet... oh boy it would be on then! Tri, hang in there-- it'll all be over soon and life will get better!  I hope the Taxol doesn't do any permanent nerve damage and good luck with the nodes and rads! Karyll, Cheryll, and Tri-- I am so relieved that I am not the only one using the wrong words, losing things, etc.!!!  Really, you all have made me feel so much better, don't mean to sound like I'm glad you have chemo brain, but glad that I am not alone and apparently it's a \"normal\" thing.  I found a bag of fresh carrots in the freezer the other day and have no clue when I put them there, all I know is they didn't belong in the freezer!! At least I didn't put them in the cupboard... Pax, How did the fishing go?  Wonderful, I'm sure, I mean how can fishing ever be bad?  It's my favorite thing to do beyond anything outdoors.  I hope you caught some nice ones and had a great fish fry.  We'd love to hear about it and see more pics if you have them. Marietta,  I have a half eyebrow too!!!  On the left side and it's the weirdest thing.  My daughter is doing great, thanks for asking! and the baby is due Jan. 21.  Daughter is pretty miserable right now with all kinds of pains and she says she feels like a cow.  Well, she's a size 4 with a basketball under her shirt-- not very cow-like in comparison to her puffed up Chemo Mom!  Ha-ha! I had Taxol #7 today, with four more to go!  I have been battling days of being fine to days of being depressed.  I have tried to eat better and get more exercise, and that is helping a lot!  Well, everyone have a very SAFE and Happy New Year's Eve tonight!  Love and hugs to all of you and thanks for all your support!!!

I just got back from my echo test and it was short and hopefully sweet.  It took all of 30 minutes start to finish and I didn't even get to finish reading the magazine I'd just sat down with.  I asked the echo technician about what she saw, and her words were: \"I saw a little something but your heart function was fine, and you do know that adriamycin can damage the heart\" SO now I have to worry myself silly until next Tuesday when I talk to my doctor about it.  The echo tests I've had in the past have been fine, and I feel perfectly fine, except for being fatter than I was.  Anyone have a clue as to what they can find with an echo?  Does an echo show up a heart blockage?  I am determined not to worry about it until next Tuesday.  I will be really pissed if that red devil has done something to my heart though... Paxton, I can see why you chose not to work.  All I do is set on my butt all day at a computer and work on school bus routes and student assignments and answer the phone, so it's not like I'm hurting myself.  Ironically, I need a more physical job.  You will get back into the swing of things when you're ready.  In the meantime, enjoy your healing time.  You are so lucky to live on a farm and be outside a lot.  My lifestyle since chemo just stinks-- not outdoors enough!  And good luck to you both on the genetic counseling-- let us know. Marietta, I posted a question about the runny nose elsewhere here, and I thought it was the Taxol doing it, but maybe it's the Herceptin after all.  Mine has been driving me nuts.  It drips during the day and stops up at night.  My last Taxol is next Monday-- YAY!  I just hope the heart thing does not keep me from taking the Herceptin-- that is my biggest fear.  Your son's opinion of your hair was funny! Take care, all, MJ",

YES, it is such a relief to be done w/chemo!!!!!!  In fact, I never thought I'd feel such relief!  Now it's going to be fun waiting for hair Thanks for all the pre-rads skin care advice.  I'm sure I'll be asking you all for more info!  Marietta and Paxton, where are you getting your rads, meaning where on your breast?  My lumpectomy site is underneath my right breast, close to where my bra band rests (oh lovely!) and I anticipate some agony there.  Back when I had my lumpectomy, I bought some nice Hanes all cotton sport bras with the racer back at K-Mart and I hope those will work for me during rads, because with a D cup and a bunch of male co-workers, I cannot/will not go braless to work! I saw my onc/surgeon today and he was very encouraging, for a change!  Thankfully, not the gloomy gus that he was at the time of my diagnosis. I asked him a bunch of questions, including when he would consider me \"cancer-free\" and he said since my surgery, and that I should be fine and cancer-free after the chemo + herceptin + rads.  That sure made me feel better.  Of course, I know there is no guarantee, but I feel like I can breathe easier now.  BTW, Tri, I decided not to mention the idiot echo tech, since I did ask her what she thought-- but I might have felt differently if my heart tests hadn't turned out fine.  I also asked my dr. about the weight gain, and he looked me straight in the eye and said \"steroids\"!  We shall see how easy it comes off!  I've been working out to my Leslie Sansone walking videos and now I need to eat better.  My taste is really off lately and only sweet things are appealing   I start my solo herceptin next Monday, and have my rads consultation on Wed., Feb. 6.  Gee, this year is already flying by like last year... Tri, you have really been through the ringer lately, and I am sure you have been very stressed about it.  I hope you can find some comfort and help at the bc group.  Let us know how that goes.  And I don't blame you for not wanting to go on anti-depresssants.  I'm fighting that issue right now, but I think I will be fine without them once I get this weight off and get on with my life.  Could your heart rate be due to stress?  I am still having major palpitations at times, and stress is getting the blame for mine.  Paxton, sorry to hear about your car and extension cord troubles!  I swear, I will never complain about the cold weather we have here after reading your temps. brrrrr!  I asked about missing 2 rad appointments for a conference in March, and they said no problem, they'd just tack it on at the end.  And yep, you do have a keeper man for sure!  Your bf sounds like my dh-- totally happy just being in the outdoors until a good woman came along...   When he lived in Washington and Oregon, hubby pretty much stayed in the woods hunting, so that's why I didn't find him sooner and I sure wish I had!  After his miserable divorce, he moved here and I met him while he was playing in the bluegrass band for the clogging team I was on, and I knew the minute I met him, he was a keeper too!  We've had just a few rough times, but nothing we couldn't handle, the bc being the worst, but we have stuck together thru it all.  Sorry I got off topic there... steroids are still affecting me.  I woke up at 3:30 this morning and haven't slowed down yet.   I think they gave me a double dose.  At least I got some house cleaning done before breakfast.  Today was certainly in contrast to yesterday, when I couldn't put one foot in front of the other.  Yesterday I was more tired than I have ever been since I began chemo-- very strange!  I guess all the excitement of my trip to see Mason just wore me out! Well, I will finally shut up for now.  I hope everyone has a good evening and a pleasant tomorrow! Mary Jo ",

I thought I'd try posting at a reasonable hour, rather than 3 a.m.  My latest post appeared twice, so I deleted one, but Mason still got his picture on here an extra time!   Don't know why I've been waking up-- I'm still taking my little .5 mg ativan before bed and I refuse to increase it. Paxton, I hope you got your car fixed so you don't have to miss tx again.  I wish one of us lived close to you and we'd make sure you got there!  Still sending good luck vibes for great tests results.  Thanks for the info about the J and J powder-- I plan to stock up on supplies soon. Hi Marietta, yes it is interesting to hear how many different protocols there are for getting thru rads.  I'm sure mine will tell me something unique.  I just hope I like the radiology staff.  It is at a different hospital-a much smaller one- but it is closer than where I had my surgeries.  Is your son liking your new 'do now?  And what did your dr. say about anti-depressants?  I know mine would prescribe them, but I'm still not keen on taking more meds, but I may have to resort to it to get myself back in gear. I am just ready for my head to not be cold!  I went out to lunch with the guys at my work today and the restaurant we ended up at had no heat!  I sat there and ate with my jacket hood pulled over my head- I figured I look funny enough already, might as well add to it!  Take care, everyone! ps- where is Karyll?  I'm worried about you-- I hope you're ok!

Paxton, yay for you and your car!!!  I know you are so relieved to get it fixed.  And good luck with the rest of your tx-- you're almost done!! Tri, like Paxton said, please don't apologize for what you said-- I have had the very same feelings!  Recently I have noticed huge, grossly overweight women and think, why do I have this and they don't?  Or will they get it later on?   I'm talking about women who are 100+ pounds overweight and wonder why they are out walking around, with hair, with not a care in the world?  Then I remember that they could very well drop dead the next minute of a heart attack...  and the saddest thing in the world is a child with cancer-- that makes me angry!! I must crawl to bed now-- take care everyone! Mary Jo",

I've not been on these boards quite as often as previously, but I have been trying to check in and at least say 'howdy' to everyone.  I am trying not to read a lot in an effort to give BC as little room in my mind/life as possible, even though I am still in the midst of radiation treatment and Herceptin.  I too have been feeling very \"down\" just in the last couple of weeks-- not sure why because I was sailing along great and doing very well emotionally until all of a sudden, bam-- and I have given thoughts to anti-depressants too.  I have had weird feelings and thoughts too, and I truly and honestly think mine is fatigue, and I bet yours is too.  I have also wondered if radiation has a part too. I have worked mostly all through treatment and thankful for being able to, but I am just worn out, mentally and physically.  Last week, I came home from a busy day at work and a stop at the grocery store and just sat down and cried.  My husband wondered what in the world was wrong (he is weary of all the BC stuff too and is being distant lately, which is very stressful for me) and I told him I was sick and tired of being stared at when I go out in public.  His response was \"it's all your imagination\".  Well, it's not. Is your hair re-growth a boost for you?  Mine is coming back but not yet ready for public viewing. Good luck on your Walk-- you're awesome for doing it!!!

Stillkicking, what kind of A-D you are considering for the hot flashes?  I would like to know if they are helping, because I am considering asking my gyno dr. for a prescription.  Mine have worsened all of a sudden.  I was in menopause about a year before BC dx, and I also have those wonderful heart palpitations as a meno side effect and I take Calcium/Magnesium for those.  I wore the Vivelle Dot patch for 3-4 months before dx and it worked so wonderfully and I felt like a human being again, but am scared to take it ever again.  It also worked for the \"dryness\" issues, which is also a major problem for me.  BC stinks, but so does menopause!!!  Sorry for all the whining-- I actually am happy today-- my last radiation treatment was today, though I will certainly miss those wonderful ladies!

Oct. 1.  I noticed my temp has been up in the last couple of days to 98.5 from my normal of 97.3, but now it is back down.  Is this part of the \"nadir\" (which I don't really understand yet)?  Of course I have had plenty of freak-out moments thinking that the cancer has already gone to my bones in just a few short weeks after my dx-- what my husband describes as my \"running through the woods screaming\" mode.  I'm hoping some of you ladies can describe your Neulasta pains for me and also what worked best for your relief.  I have taken Tylenol for some relief, and my chemo nurse said I could use the oxycodone they gave me after my lumpectomy, but would rather not go that far if I can help it since it makes me nutty (nuttier?)  Thanks so very much for your help and take care everyone!

I asked the nurse about being scared at every little pain and she said that was normal but that it would subside with time and that they would always keep a check on what's going on with me.  Thanks again and take care, everyone!

I haven't been here in a while, but thought I'd pop in and see how everyone is doing.  I just finished tx #17 and am just now \"feeling the burn\"!  The rads office is closed today for Good Friday, so I'm glad to get a break, especially from the drive. I have enjoyed catching up on your posts, and I have some questions for you all!  Has anyone had a \"weird\" feeling during radiation?  I woke up this morning with a strange feeling that I can't pinpoint, but it's almost a flu-like feeling, but I don't feel sick-- slightly achy, chilled sometimes then I sweat, almost like a low-grade fever. I didn't sleep well last night because of the full moon (I'm not a werewolf-- just can't sleep unless it's pitch black dark!), but oddly I feel energetic otherwise.  I have been taking 1 mg of Ativan daily (.5 mg in the morning and then .5 mg right before bed), but have done without it for the past two days.  Could my weird feeling be withdrawal from the Ativan?  I sure wish I could do without it, but it sure helps with the anxiety.  The rads techs have told me not to try to lose weight during radiation, but to maintain.  They said it would interfere with the mapping for the radiation.  Not what I wanted to hear, because I gained 20 lbs during chemo that I must get off soon!  Has anyone else been told not to lose weight?  Just checking to make sure they're not feeding me a line of horse-hockey!  Ok, one more question-- has anyone noticed feelings of depression during rads?  Sorry if someone has addressed this already.  For the past week or so, I have felt \"down\" after weeks of feeling pretty good.  All my lab work came back normal, so physically I am ok.  I think if our weather here in western NC would improve and be steadily mild, instead of a nice 65 during the day and 26 freezing cold degrees at night!! Well, that's it for my whining and list of questions.  I hope everyone has a great weekend and a nice Easter!   And continued best wishes for everyone during rads! Hugs, Mary Jo ",

I hope everyone is doing well!  Tay, yippee for your good news!  So glad to hear you're painting again-- I am trying to get back into my quilting-- and it's hard to eat and quilt at the same time, maybe that would be a good start on my diet! Ulla, thanks for all your information-- you've helped me so much, again!  I think you are right on target when you say I need to find something at the gym that I love-- makes perfect sense! Sue in NC, congrats on your daughter's graduation!  I hope it went well and hope you didn't shed too many tears, but if so, that's ok.  (Go Tarheels!!!!!!!) Doe, oh gosh, I just love your new word for \"hungry\"-- you made me laugh out loud-- and I think that may be part of my problem also...   Good luck with the heart monitor.  And I love your advice: \"Let's face it, we've all been to hell and back. We need to be gentle and loving with ourselves...\"  We all need to remember that, don't we? Sue in NJ, you are so right about needing to be \"ready\" to diet.  I have really been psyching myself up.  I just bought the new issue of Prevention and I am really intrigued with the South Beach Diet features.  LUV, so glad you had a great time on your cruise-- heck, if I was going on vacation, I'd wear a \"toe-sack\" if I had to and not worry any more about it.  So glad you could laugh a lot and forget about the BC!  (and that cute smiley baby is the most recent photo of my grandson-- he's growing so fast and I miss him so much, tho he's 2 hours drive away!!) I hope all of you had a wonderful and fun Mother's Day, whether you be a mom of a human child or a furry child! Love and hugs to all! Mary Jo ps- we have Relay for Life this weekend in our town.  I attended the Survivor Kick-off Dinner last week and it was so wonderful!  My friend and co-worker was the guest speaker (bc survivor of 4 yrs) and she was awesome and so inspiring!  Lots of very nice folks were there and everyone had a great time!",

I have been worried that I should have waited like the rads onc said to, rather than going by what the cancer center nurse told me (where my surgeon is and most of my treatments were)-- I just wonder \"who do I listen to?\", but sooner seems better than later in this case. I wish they would communicate and at least tell me the same thing.  Like you said, I'm sure there are different things they consider. I hope some other ladies reply as to their post-tx mammo timing. Lucky you that you will have no waiting.  That is great and I wish all mammo centers would do that-- would sure save a lot of stress for many women.  Good luck with your future mammos!

I had my bi-monthly checkup today and talked at length with the Nurse Practitioner at the cancer center, mainly about some issues with depression I am having right now.  The depression came on fairly suddenly-- I was sailing right along after radiation, then bam it hit-- and she said that was exactly typical of BC-related depression.  She suggested three things that would help: Exercise, Anti-depressant medication, and Psychotherapy (I don't even know what that is!)  Well, the exercise is a no-brainer-- I definitely need it, but I am not sure my insurance will pay for psychotherapy, so I went with the A-D in the form of Effexor.  Has anyone out there taken Effexor and have you had success with it?  I am starting out on a very low dose and working up to increase.  The NP also said it would help with hot flashes and night sweats, which is a BIG plus!  Anyone had experience with psychotherapy?  What is it, exactly?

I am going to see my grandson Mason this weekend-- riding with my parents to dd's home in Statesville, then we're all going up to Virginia with her family to visit her in-laws and hopefully go to the Fiddlers Convention in Galax, VA!!  WHOOO I can't wait!!!

I suspect it may be costochondritis, and the nurse practitioner at the cancer center examined me today and really didn't seem to know.

What kind of bath soap are you all using? I need to ask that today at the rads center, if I can remember it then.  I guess I could pin a note on myself like little kindergartners get in school...  Hey Sue in NC-- I just read your post about your friend with the mass.  I tried to put myself in your position, and that would indeed be tough to handle while trying to put this cancer stuff in the past.  But I think I would try to stay in touch with her and find out how she is and what her tests reveal and support her as best you can. You sound like a very warm and compassionate person and probably would not feel right just ignoring her, PLUS you've got to remember- her situation is not you and your case is very different and you are going to be absolutely fine!  But if you decide that you can't handle being too close, then don't beat yourself up for it, ok?  I do believe it is very, very important to stay close to positive people and those who uplift you instead of bringing you down (BC or not)  I think we have the right to make the choice of who we are close to during our ordeal. I recently spoke with a lady who does the same job with school bus routing in another western NC county that I do here, and she is 7 years out from her breast cancer and she is doing so great!  She told me that I have to remember that I am cancer-free thanks to the surgery, and that I have to get out there and live my life wide open.  She also advised me to walk every day, and thanks to her advice, I went to the gym last night, walked for a measly 30 minutes (but hey, better than none), and I feel SO MUCH BETTER! I slept better than I have in many months, so I think I have found the key to my well-being now! Gotta go for now-- talk to you all later!  Hugs and best wishes to all! Mary Jo ",

Sorry I haven't posted much, but I have been reading about you all and I hope you all are doing well on this Saturday morning! I finished my rads on April 17 and am SOOOOOO glad!!!  Although I miss the rad techs, I don't miss that drive every day, esp. with gasoline at $3.60 a gallon here!  ouch!  I had very little problems with rads except tiredness, and looking back, I should have taken more time off from work and rested.  I am so glad to finally be wearing my \"good bras\" again, instead of the non-supportive camisoles!! WhEEEE!!  I am feeling absolutely wonderful, except for lots of aches and pains and stiffness.  If I sit a while and then get up, oh, it hurts!  But when I walk a little ways, all the stiffness and pains go away.  I had these before BC, so I'm not freaking out or anything, but I do wish I knew what was causing this.  Oh wel, at 51, I suppose the aches and pains are normal.  I blame the extra weight too, so the hurtin' is making me get back on my fitness and weight loss wagon! I have a question for you ladies:  while I was taking chemo and rads, I was told not to take antioxidant supplements, etc.  But now that I am finished with everything except for Herceptin, is it safe to get antioxidants in the form of green tea?  I absolutely love Lipton Diet Green Tea, and I was drinking it by the gallons before BC.  Anyone know if this would be detrimental to the lasting cancer-fighting effects of the chemo and rads?  LUVmy2girlsZ, I just saw your post about the water bottles-- thanks for posting it!  I have been increasingly concerned about this too and even my daughter is very upset because of the baby bottle issue (thankfully she is breast-feeding but does use bottles sometimes)  I am wondering if anything plastic is safe.  Now that I am a baby-boomer, I think back about all the plastic that has entered my lifetime, way before any testing or regulations.  Do we just throw away our plastic?  What would you use to transport hot lunches in?  Or do we just ignore all this and hope for the best?  (that's hard for me to do) Hello to Sue in NC, Sue in NJ, Tay, Ulla, Doe, mpellot, climbergirl, Larousse, Darah, Tina, PAlady, Quinnie, 12954, DeAnn, kajo, and all the others I might have missed!  I wish I had made time to post more, but I feel like I know you all from just reading!  I hope everyone is doing very well and enjoying their journey back to WELLNESS!!!

And glad you're plantar fascitis is better-- it can certainly be painful and interfere with life. I've had it for over 20 years and had a sudden flare up this summer. I've been in and out of bc.org, not doing a lot of reading about BC, just trying to get to the end of my Herceptin treatments-- last one is Nov. 10 and I get my port out Dec. 8.  I can't believe how fast time has gone by for me.  I'm sorry to hear about your jewelry business and I hope you find good employment soon. Cancer is stressful enough, but the expenses that go along with it are horrible.  Even with fairly good insurance, I'll not get my dr./hospital/lab bills paid off any time soon. Plus my husband had hernia surgery in August, so there's his bills due now.  I send them all a little each month, but the collection agency still calls my house every day, even weekends.  Used to really stress me out but now I really don't give a flip-- too tired to care most days. Continued good luck with the support group.  I planned on joining one this fall, but the gas situation around here kept me from driving the 60 miles to attend. Hope to find one in the spring. Take care! Mary Jo",

Heck, anger is not always a bad thing-- it can be a great motivator to make changes when life doesn't fit anymore.  Don't let it get you down and please don't be so hard on yourself, hear?  Let us know how you're doing.

Well two down and 31 to go, I think!  So far, I haven't felt a thing, but I'm sure that will change.   Has anyone experienced dizziness because of rads?  Yesterday about an hour before I was supposed to leave for my treatment, I got so dizzy I had to get my husband to drive me.  I stayed dizzy until I took a long nap after I got home, slept all last night, and today I feel ok.  I was also a bit nauseated, so it might have been a touch of flu bug, which is rampant here right now.  I also had my Herceptin treatment on Monday, and wonder if that might have been part of it.  Who knows... When should I expect to feel a change in my skin?  The rads tech told me I  would need to wear a t-shirt under my bra to protect my skin when it gets sore-- oh goody.  I am a 40DD and cannot stand to not have good support,so it may get interesting. Take care, everyone and good luck on tx!  Thanks to everyone for all your support and help! Mary Jo ",

I hope everyone is enjoying a nice Springtime day!  It sure is nice and sunny here, although we had a cool start this morning.  And have you voted yet?  I voted at 7 a.m. and there sure weren't the crowds that were predicted.  Maybe they'll come later on today. Whatever our beliefs or party affiliation, I think it's imperative that we exercise our right to vote!   Ok, on with my whining... I had a major meltdown last night!  I received an invitation to a Survivor's Dinner to be held tonight, in connection with Relay For Life, and I agreed to go, since my good friend and co-worker, who is also a BC survivor, is going to be the guest speaker.  I'm really looking forward to the dinner, but the reason for my meltdown was not related to my cancer, or fear of it, etc., but was because I am SO FAT and I am not doing anything about it!!!!!  I had my meltdown after trying on clothes that I was sure would fit but didn't, but it wasn't even the clothes thing.  It was the realization that after a breast cancer diagnosis and all the terror and treatment that I've gone through, I'm still not taking good care of my body by dieting and exericising and losing the weight I gained!!!  I am just plain mad at myself for the 20 lbs I've gained, knowing that obesity and lack of exercise can actually cause a bc recurrence!!  So, what is wrong with me?  Why can't I get going with my weight loss program?  I know exactly what it takes, have all the \"tools\" and \"know-how\" to do get it done-- but I have hit a brick wall ! I want to live to grow old with my husband, to see my grandson enter college, to go on my dream vacation to southern Oregon, and I just keep eating junk and sitting on my big fanny!  Sorry if I sound so worked up, but I am scared-- what does it take to change and get started?  Have any of you out there had the same problem?  To make matters worse, my husband gave me no support and told me he \"didn't want to hear me squawling\", because he is disgusted with me too for not making a better effort to start eating better and working out.  It's just the two of us and my schedule is pretty much mine, and I buy all the groceries, so it's not like there's anything stopping me but me! HELP HELP HELP!  Any suggestions?  Thanks, dear ladies, for listening to a big 51-year-old cry-baby/whiner! And, To all of you who are doing the walks and marathons, you all are AWESOME and I admire you so much for your efforts!!!  Love you all! Mary Jo ",

Yesterday was a very interesting, stressful, tiring day for me.  I had my checkup with the radiation oncologist yesterday morning and he said I had healed very well and doesn't need to see me again until November.  I asked him about when I should have another mammogram, since I was due for my yearly one June 1.  He told me to wait 3-4 months until after my last rads tx, which was April 17.   I was ok with that, sort of.  I still have my good left boob that I need to watch over, so I mentioned this to my chemo nurse yesterday afternoon when I went for my Herceptin treatment. She said she'd check w/my dr. there and she came back and said \"you're due now for a mammo, how about today?\"  SO, after my Herceptin was finished, on to the breast imaging center downstairs I went to get BOTH boobs squashed.  It wasn't as painful as I'd expected for my right one  Now the agonizing wait for the results, although the mammo tech did tell me \"not to lose any sleep and nothing jumped out at her\".  That doesn't make me feel much better because these techs have been wrong before.  But I'm trying not to worry. Questions:  have you all had your follow-up mammos yet and how long did you or your doctor advise to wait until after rads were completed?  Should I have waited the full 3-4 months after rads?  I hate it when one onc says one thing and the other onc says another...  and I trust them both very much.  Thanks for your help and hugs to all!

(anyone here have ideas?)  I found this great new topic for early stagers and just thought I'd chime in here and say \"there IS life after chemo, rads, Herceptin, stool softeners , steroids, endless dr. appointments, etc., and YES, there are thoughts that DON'T include breast cancer.  And hair DOES grow back (I am back to hating mine again )  If I may, I'd like to recommend a book that really helped me, and it was written especially for Stage 1 and 2 ladies:  the title is Just Get Me Through This!: The Practical Guide to Breast Cancer, by Deborah A. Cohen. (forgive me if someone has already mentioned it).  Amazon.com has it and it is well worth the price.  I am a Stage 1 survivor of 2 years.  Yes my boob still hurts and my scars still itch, but life does get better.  And to prove that life gets back to \"normal\"-- my forgetful mind just realized today that exactly one year ago, I had my final Herceptin treatment. I'm doing great and living life even better than before my dx.  Hopefully this is some encouragement for you ladies currently going thru treatment and I hope I have helped someone in some small way. Those of you who are still in treatment-- HANG IN THERE and to those of you who are done-- CONGRATULATIONS! Hugs and best wishes to everyone!!!",

Although I am a member of the \"February Rads Team\", I thought I'd pop in here for some support from some of you rad \"veterans\"!  Ok, here are my questions: I had my last Taxol tx on Jan. 28, had my consult today, then go for the set-up thing on Feb. 11.  Is that about right for the scheduling?  I am a bit p-o'd because the rad. onc. office just has morning appointments.  I was hoping for afternoon appts. so I could just leave work and just head straight home after tx, but that is not to be.  For those of you who work outside the home and have morning appointments, does it work well for you? The rad. oncologist said I would be getting a \"break from radiation\" about 3 weeks into the program.  Did you all have this \"break\"?  I thought if you were scheduled for 5-6 weeks of rads, then you just had them straight through, with no days off.  I just need to know if this is the norm or something freaky this particular practice has implemented. Also, how do you deal with the \"no-bra issue\"?  I am a 42DD and that just doesn't sound appealing to me.  Thanks very much to all of you for your input and help, and best of luck with the rest of your treatments!

Thank you all so much for your help!

I wish you luck with the chemopause, and I plan to ask my dr. about the evening primrose oil- have heard it works wonders.  I am menopausal but had to stop my Vivelle Dot patch and the night sweats aren't fun, but not unbearable.  Exercise helps that symptom too! Again thanks so much for your reply- you are very inspirational! Mary Jo",

I am still doing great after my first tx yesterday, went to work half a day today, and am just hoping and praying I continue this \"good\" streak.  I had my Neulasta shot today and so far so good with it.   I hope the rest of my journey with tx's goes as smoothly... There have been some great replies to this post about \"getting back to the old self\", hasn't there?  Really great inspiration! Take care and please stay in touch and let us know how you are doing!

I too, like Harley, would like to know more about chemo helping autoimmune problems.  Do you have a source you could pass along to us?  Thanks so much for bring up something that really hadn't clicked with me before... but it sure makes sense now!  I just had my first tx on Monday, but how come I feel better energy-wise in the last two days than I've felt in a long, long time?  Hmmm...    Best wishes, Mary Jo",

Since my diagnosis, she and I have discussed breast cancer a lot and she keeps reminding me that I will probably never regain my energy level even long after treatment is over and recovery starts, and that I will never feel the same physically.  This is very alarming to me! I may be in denial, but I feel great right now, better than I've felt in a long time, and to think that I will never feel like my \"old self\" again depresses me greatly.  Do you ladies agree that you will never feel the same ever again?  I understand that mentally and emotionally we are forever changed, but is stamina, energy and vigor lost forever?

Best wishes for recovery and good health in 2009! Mary Jo",

Gracejon, I think you said it so well about liking the new person that we become after enduring the therapies, and for having a new appreciation of life-- excellent point! Tina, I agree about looking past the doomsday crowd. There are a lot of them out there, even though some of them may mean well.  Glad you're doing so well and feeling great-- what an inspiration you are to us! Fumi, thanks so much for sharing your experience-- how wonderful that your se's were minimal!  You are a testament to the fact that we can look and feel well again and that sure give me great hopes that it can happen to any of us! Mamasj,so glad to hear you're getting back to your old self.  And I agree that taking it one day at a time is the only way to go!!!  I have a tendency to look too far beyond today and that just causes unnecessary worry, you know? Trigeek, you said it all so well!!!  I hope we can all realize what you have-- that life is all of a sudden better in a whole lot of ways, with a new perspective on everything.  And yes, Life is Good!! Harley, I'm glad your chemo hasn't been too bad for you and glad you're edging closer to the finish line!  I'm glad you've found hope and comfort in this post too.  After I was complaining about it being so dry here, it is raining buckets with a 100 percent chance of rain all day long!  Prayers are being answered! Take care, everyone-- Mary Jo ",
