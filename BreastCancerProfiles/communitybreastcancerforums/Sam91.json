By the way my abdominal CT was $1912 including the charge for the doc who read them.  I also had a pelvic scan which was another $1879!!! ",

I wore it next to my skin when I mowed the lawn last week and yikes was I full of sweat afterwards. My oldest son is getting married in Sept and I found an off the shoulder dress I fell in love with. I guess I will have to do the strapless bra - do they make a pocketed strapless bra?? Would hate to loose something on the dance floor.",
