I am having Sentinole node biopsy and lumpectomy on 9/9. I am much less worried about surgery than I am about the findings. My feelings flip from moment to moment. I am trying so hard not to think about the results of the surgery. I just want to know what I am facing. Will my lymph nodes be clear? Will there be any new discoveries? Will this mean chemo? And if there is some question, will I make the right decision? I'm disappointed in myself for not be more of a warrior type person. I just want this all to quietly go away. I found this site a few days ago, I have never posted on a forum before. I find comfort in knowing I am not alone in this. I have a great family, but I'm trying to be very positive and casual with them. That is not how I feel inside. If you do not mind, would you please pray for me? I'm worried and anxious. I will keep all of you in my thoughts and prayers.",
