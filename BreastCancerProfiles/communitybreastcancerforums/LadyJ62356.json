They gave it a BI-RADS of 4. I live in a smaller town and the only surgeons that take my ins are on vacations and I have to wait 2 weeks for a consult. I of course have Google every term on the report and everything says highly probable for malignancy. So my question is just to gather info if anyone has had these same terms and been benign or malignant. TIA!! Log in to post a reply",
