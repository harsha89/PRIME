I just found a lump on april 4 the doctor checked me the 5th and today i had a mammogram and ultra sound and nothing showed up on either so he had me come back at 1 and did a biopsy. he took 4 needle jabs and then placed a metal marker in my breast above the lump and now i have to wait 3 days. It does not hurt but it pulls on my nipple when i move a certain way. he said it was a very hard mass, not cyst or tumor and had a hard time getting the biopsy.????? any suggestions??? Why a metal marker, he said so they will know it has been checked or how to find it later if they need too but you cant miss it. the ultra sound wouldnt show it but he could feel the wand thingy move over it! Totally freaking here. I havent told any of my family cause i want to know what it is first and not worry them. hard not having someone to talk to when your scared shitless!!!!!",
