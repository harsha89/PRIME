I had some type of traumatic reaction and literally shook for two weeks. I am much calmer now and am planning activities for after the lumpectomy. I was wondering how long it takes to recover and be able to do any activities. I want to watch some high school volleyball, but I don't know when I will be ready. The area was detected on a mammogram and the radiologist did a thorough ultrasound (which said looked really good) and a biopsy. At the time that she was telling me what was going on, my mind wandered and started thinking of funeral caskets. I kept thinking, how did I go from having an annual mammogram to picking out a casket? I was in such disbelief and shock. Luckily, it is a small area, and hormone receptive. I am 54, have taken prometrium for years when my body stopped making it after the birth of my daughter, and don't smoke or drink alcohol. Primarily a vegetarian, I keep thinking, is this really happening to me? Any responses will be appreciated.
