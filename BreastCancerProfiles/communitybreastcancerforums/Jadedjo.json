Thank you deeply for the info I'm pretty sure my counsler is referring me to a dietician so I will ask how close to this kind of diet can I get and still have enough money and food to last me the whole month.

I'm starting as soon as my cycle has tapered off (because for some reason this month I'm practically bleeding to death instead of barely having anything) and going until surgery cause I know I'm not going to be able to do much afterwards. I need to build muscle as much muscle as I can because everything I read says recovery is easier. If it leads to weight loss (which it might because my appetite has gone to nothing) even better cause that will help the diabetes and blood pressure issues. I am trying to reduce as many complications as I can. I already know the first words to the surgeon will be \"tell me what I need to do no matter how radical to keep me from having chemo\" I know you all say you get through it but I wouldn't. Not right now. I'm am not mentally and physically strong enough to get through it.i know myself enough to know this. If the symptoms got bad enough I would just give up and kill myself. I'm already riding the edge already for two years now I'm amazed I'm going tobbe fighting this cancer actually..Maybe if I was in better shape,maybe if I was in a better place mentally I could but I'm not there right now possibly ever but definitely not now.",

      "Content": "Jul 19, 2018 06:11AM - edited Jul 19, 2018 06:16AM by Jadedjo @blueberry89 I'm in a very similar situation even down to thinking when I went for the mammorgram thinking it was a cyst and when I went to the biopsy I hoped they would say it was something like fat necrosis except the radiologist pretty much said it was cancer without actually saying the word cancer due to cover your arse legally reasons just in the slight case she is wrong.She used \"very,very concerning\". I prettty much lost it and the nurse asked if I wanted to talk to someone.Then I was sent 15 min later to talk to a social worker  who kept using  the words early stage breast cancer.cant get a bigger hint then that. I also had breast pain where my lump is but it actually went away after a couple weeks and didn't return until the mammogram after that I felt it again and burning sensation for some reason. I'm desperately hoping it's just a \"great pretender\" lump that's actually benign or maybe the doctor didn't have enough coffee that morning and wasn't that with it cause she certainly acted grumpy enough.thats why I won't join the newly diagnosed thread just yet.im holding on to a tiny tendril of hope. I'm waiting for results too and with how our system works it could be over 2 weeks before I get the diagnosis. I've run the gamut of \"just cut em off\" to right at this point now \"just let it kill me cause my quality of life is already near zero and it will be below zero if it's cancer\" For you, If she says it's probably not cancerous but should get checked then odds are it isn't and they are just being overly cautious. They also probably factored in other risk factors when she said \"not likely\". From your description it sounds like just a precaution to be fullly sure because one never truly knows. Basically what I am saying is your experience would have been closer to mine if they thought it was cancerous. I think you will be ok but I understand your worry and anxiety of not knowing for sure. Good luck, best wishes for life,health and love and huge hopes for you getting benign results. Jadedjo",

I'm planning on using them for loungewear and nearby grocery store runs after I can start wearing my regular shirts again.  So thrift stores are a suggestion if your just looking for something to wear for the time for recovery actually if you hit the right store  it's also not so bad for some nice dress button up blouses too I would say since you will be swollen for a while go up a one to two sizes just to be comfortable. One size up might even be too small still depends on how sensitive the surgery and drain sites are I think. Also the larger size hides the bulkyness of the drains and bandages when your out and about. She also told me elastic waistband pants or simple tie pants and a oversized comfortable button or zip up top. Something you don't have to struggle to put on. Since she works all the time with people who go through surgery with and without reconstruction I took her advice for my clothing choices. Almost eveybody including the nurse has told me about the small pillow for seatbelt so your not in overwhelming pain from the pressure of the belt on your chest.  Good luck with your surgery! Wishes for a quick full recovery with no issues. ",

I know what you mean, I'm isolated myself for the same reason. I found it was just easier to stay at home then be with people who would get irritated when my chronic condition acted up which was most times. There times in people's lives where there is no upbeat and positive,just find the strength to get through each day. I appreciate the support and as things happen will probably reaching out more. My difficulty in facing a probable  cancer diagnosis is the question I can't yet answer \" why do I want to fight for a future when there's nothing to look forward to in it?\"  . I know that's what needed to get through treatments and fight this disease  , that the end game is what your fighting to live for but I don't have that.  Let me know how things are going for you too.",

It's a traumatizing situation so I would ask any of the medical personnel you are dealing with if there is access to mental health help. There usually is in regards to cancer. Many people have also pointed out to me getting ahold of the local cancer society chapter to see what they have available for supports. I'm sorry that the surgery choice has changed but I send Well wishes for a safe surgery and a speedy and safe healing recovery. Blessed be.",

It was going ok until the plastic surgeon, then it slowed down to a snails pace with me having to call and say \"hello what's going on?!\" I will be calling back on Monday saying \"I'm going to have my cycle then, are you SURE  you want to choose that day?\" they don't want you to wear underwear in surgery but I'm going to have to wear something and I'm not able to use tampons. So it's going to be complicated for everybody involved. giveityourall Thanks  No I am unable to chose my own doctor,Canadian health system. You get who you get especially if they are busy specialists which these guys are. It's this office that's the issue. First there was no contact For an appt date I had to initiate it after 2 weeks,then this time after two weeks again of waiting for a surgery date I called. Didn't get a callback or anything I called again and got ahold of her and that's when I was told the tentative date which was way later then it should be if she had started choosing the date after I saw him. Which is why I think it only happened after I called the first time. It doesn't take over two weeks for a doctor to look at their schedule and say ya I got an opening or no I don't got an opening. They don't stop and think I'm dealing with this on my own. There is nobody to help me get up to go to the bathroom and doing what needs doing when one has their cycle. Also the supplies I will need are going to take up room in my small bag that could have been used for something else. I mean I gave her the dates so I could avoid this and she went and made it right in the middle so nobody there seems to be listening to me.",

I think for a lot  of us that's where the anger comes from. What we are losing, whether it be our breasts,our lives as we know it,what we thought our health was, the certain future we thought we had until the word cancer was uttered no matter what stage a person is at,so many of the things we lose when we are diagnosed and have to endure before,during and after the treatment for it. I think maybe it's anger at the loss. I don't know.  ",
