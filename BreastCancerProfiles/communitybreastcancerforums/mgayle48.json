By the  time I realized it, she had started and I didn't want to move to mess the test up so I just stayed that way for the 30 minutes.  I must have compressed the nerve because for about 4 weeks after that I would get a zinger if I moved my arm just right. Not really painful but more annoying. The  test itself was a piece of cake.",

She went through the whole thing. The doctor sent her for an ultrasound and they decided it was not a cyst -- so she had a biopsy and it turned out to be a fiboadenoma -- benign growth. Anyway -- you would have to be examined and yes they feel it first. You would be in a gown and the doctor would only open your gown enough to check you out. If you are really paranoid about it a women doctor would  probably make you feel more comfortable. My daughter was sent to a women's health center where they did all the testing. They were all women and treated her like she was their own daughter. She was a little embarrassed but got over it when she realized how great everyone was. It is very unlikely you have cancer, but you should be checked out. I was diagnosed myself with cancer this past year and I used to be very self conscious about my breasts. But heck, after going through everything I've gone through in the last year I'm not any more. I've even been known to flash people(well just my husband really -- but he loves it). Anyway -- you can handle it!!!!",

However that said, breast cancer is not something you take lightly, and it is good that you are checking yourself and concerned. Has your nipple always been inverted or is it a recent change in your breast? If it has always been that way it is probably not a concern. If it is a recent change, you should get it checked out. The discharge is not as much a concern as the inverted nipple.  I was diagnosed in February last year with early breast cancer after finding a bloody discharge from my right nipple.  You said yours is clear  so it is probably ok. Do not be afraid to talk to your mother. My daughter who is almost 20 now, found a lump when she was 17. We went through the whole process with her and hers was a fibroadenoma(benign lump).  She was a little embarrassed about the whole thing, but she was more concerned about making sure it was nothing to worry about. You are at the age where you should probably see a gyn/ob anyway for regular checkups. Maybe you could find a female doctor. Most women are more comfortable with a women, I know I am. Talk to your mom and tell her her you want it checked out. Not knowing is worse than anything. ",

I haven't posted very much but have done a  whole lot of reading of other posts. All I can say about this site is WOW!!!  Yes you should be concerned -- but not panicked. If you are having bleeding get to the doctor. That's how my DCIS was discovered. One tiny drop of blood on my bra. My doc sent me to the breast center and I had an ultrasound. They didn't see anything specific but it was suspicious enough my doc sent me to a breast specialist/surgeon. She then did another ultasound and rather bluntly told me she thought I had DCIS. At first I felt I had been punched in the gut, but she was very reassuring and told me DCIS is one of the earliest forms of breast cancer. She sent me for a breast MRI and scheduled a biopsy the next week. The biopsy confirmed her hunch.  There are other reasons you could have bleeding. So the thing is don't panic, but don't put off following up. Try to take the attitude of dealing with it one step at a time.  ",
