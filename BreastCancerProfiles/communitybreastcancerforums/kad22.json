I feel as though I don't know what I need to know about steroids and other medications etc. Any advice would help out a lot. I had a bi-lateral mastecomy 2/18 and have been back to work for two weeks already so I feel good. Have balloon expanders in right now and am getting filled. I guess any advice about tomorrow would be great - just really scared! Also don't want to lose my hair. I start cytoxan and Adriamycin every 3 wks for four times. Then Taxol once a week for 12 wks. Thanks for listening and any advice would be welcome!",

I know it's hard but remember it will grow back - that's what i keep trying to tell myself! Even though I was like you hoping that I would be the one where it wouldn't fall out! So what made you decide other than the losing it? Was it coming out in clumps? Did your scalp hurt? I just want to be more prepared for when it happens to me, most likely this week as I am 1 wk behind you. I am going to a salon where she ordered my wig and has it standing by then she will shave me in a private area and help me with the wig. Hope everyone is doing well! I am feeling better just still have to watch what I eat because it I don't - OH BOY! Have a great Monday everyone and a week without SE's!

I have had long hair all of my life also and took the big step today. I thought that I would freak but actually it is not so bad. I got a really cute wig and everyone likes it better even than my real hair! :-) I just couldn't do it anymore losing my hair and finding it everywhere. My hair dresser also said that we shouldn't pull out our hair because it can cause infection in your scalp but to let it fall out naturally even the 2\" stuff. I am a little nervous to show my husband but he is so supportive and I know once I do it everything will be fine but it a huge deal - I know! Do what you feel is right for you but know that you can get through this loss of hair and it will grow back - that's what I keep telling myself! Julie - I know you didn't mean to freak me out and that it is for our own good but I just hate to think about how bad that stuff is. Yuck. Shygal - thanks for the support - it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I did have a great stylist and went into a back room to do it and then she fitted my wig and cut it to my face! It is really cute and I don't want to take it off! Have a great weekend with no SE's everyone!",

But your treatments include Tamoxifin so I am confused? Well I go in for my third heavy dose of AC this Friday and am already dreading it! Although it is so nice to feel good these last few days before I go. All my hair is gone almost totally bald- bald!! My eyelashes and brows are still here - do you think they will go yet? I go to work everyday with a wig that is really nice and then come home and whip it off!! I use scarves and went out this weekend for the first time with only a scarf on - people stare - but o-well! Is it nails that go bad when you are on Taxol? Because so far (knock on wood) mine are healthy on AC. Stay postivie we can beat this!!! (((Hugs to all)))",

I had to have one cut off and was in the worst pain of my life!! It still is healing after 3wks of it being gone! I took a lot of sitz baths - warm water in the tub with a little bit of epsom salt - these really helped exspecially after each bowel movement.  Hmmm .... is anyone doing Taxol yet? Just want to know some of the SE's that you guys may be experiencing from this drug. I have to do 12 rounds of it after AC so was curious. BRCA gene I have known to have since around 2000. It was a good thing to knowing because the doctors really had me on a schedule of Mammo's and MRIs since I am younger and started these in my late 20's! If I didn't do the MRI's they wouldn't have found my tumor! Mammo didn't show it and no one could feel it but it appeared in a year's time and was at least 2cm! So I would suggest getting this test done for everyone that has family history of cancer and maybe even if you don't!  Well since I am feeling good I get to take the 2nd grade class to the Milw. zoo tomorrow and I am stoked! Then Friday off for 3rd treatment of AC - yuck! Have a great weekend - hopefully with no SE's!",

Ladies I sure hope this does not happen to anyone else - I wouldn't wish this on my worse enemy. The nurse did say that because I am younger 37 and had nausea when I was pregnant this can be a sign for more nausea - just to warn those of you that may get sick more easier than normal. The nurse did say to tell the doctor for next time that I want Emend. I just don't ever want to go back. I feel like I have been hit by a truck and to think that my surgery had gone so well - maybe thats what I get. I am soo sorry to whine on here espeically when I know others have to go through it all still. I know that everyone is different so please keep that in mind. But I need encouragement because I just want to be done and I haven't even lost my hair yet!! O-man I told myself I wouldn't do this on here -soo sorry.

So today I am wearing to the park my shirt that says \"Cute bald chick Kickin' Cancer's butt\" and wearing a baseball cap! My eyebrows are almost gone with my eyelashes I too was hoping to not lose them. Well tomorrow is the first of my Taxol's - thanks for the encouragement!

I had only two sticks, one for blood and the other to get my IV in! Yeah! The Benadryl knocked me out - WOW! I was just sitting there and then all of a sudden I was down for the count! It was good though because I slept the whole treatment! Today I am fine but worry about day 3 and 4 hopefully everything will go ok. Toughmom and SGJ05 - YOU CAN DO IT! Just one more!!  You are both strong women and will conquer this! One more and you are done - YEAH! I do go out more and more with just a scarf or hat on - it is too hot to wear my wig. People stare but o-well. As long as my husband and 15 yr. old daughter are fine with it then I do it. Jenc - good luck starting Taxol. Too bad we are the few to finish up last. We can do it!",

So I got my wig last Friday and went to work, I work at the elementary school as the librarian so I see PK through 4th graders. All of the students were great with my hair - most had already heard that I was getting a wig. Some funny comments from them - \"Is it glued on?\" , \"Can you take it off and show us your bald head?\", and probably the best one that made me laugh was \"WOW Mrs. Kelly you look even better than before!\" The kids are so good about it all and very curious. I just love them all and it helps to go there to take my mind off of everything! Well I do not want Friday to come but hopefully I will get different meds so round 2 is not so bad as the 1st. I have to let these rounds come so that I can get to the end of this and start growing my hair out to look like my wig!!

I am only up to 300cc in each but had one done today and feel sore also! I just feel overwhelmed with all of the different medications - I'm sure my nurses should tell me informational things that I will need to know - right?! The hair is the toughest part for me - not even upset about BLM. I have longer hair and still having a hard time with thinking about the loss. My DH is wonderful and supportive but am afraid of his reaction to a bald head!! O-well I know I we will all get through this. Best of luck to you on Friday and its really good to have others to talk to even though I hate that we have to go through it!!",

Thank you again to all the words of encouragement - really needed to hear them. Julia123 - I did ask my onc. why I had to do 12 wkly taxol and not the 4 dd every 2wks. He basically said it really came down to wear a person lives!! He said here in the midwest they like to do the 12 wkly and on the coasts the 4 dd. He said with the weekly we don't need the N shots that cost like $3500 each! He did say insurance will cover the shot but they perfer to do the weekly here  and for mebecause they feel that they are not giving my type of cancer,Triple N, the time to build back up between Taxol treatments. Not sure if that was a bunch of bull or what but that's what he told me! ;-) My eyebrows seem to be thinning. Have had periods still throughout treatments but I am 37 - so don't know! Not sure what to say to you all about the ports - I refused to have one put in and was doing really well with the IV everytime up to this last time. The nurse thought this may have happened, not finding a vein, because I was so tense! I may need to take something the next time I go to help me get through it all! Sorry to hear you are having these issues though. Why does this have to be soo tough on us all? Sometimes I just don't understand... Wishing everyone a SE FREE week and a happy first day of summer!!

You are strong and will get through it and December will be here before you know it. I am waiting for Sept. 20th and can't believe that these 6 months will have gone by soo fast overall! So is there anyone still on this forum that is going through chemo treatments, or am I the last? Just wondering! School inservices are back in full swing and next week Wed. will start the school yr off! I am ready, hear me roar!! ;-) Hugs to all - have a great Friday!! Kelli",

You sound like money if fine and she shouldn't butt in but that's what any mothers do! So have fun planning and don't worry she'll get over it. Well after 3 days with the kiddos at school I feel like sh**! My throat and head are throbbing! Took two slepping pills (that 's a first for me) last night thinking that would help - still was up twice and today still feel awful. At least I have a three day weekend!!

Susuesue - Just wondering how you are dealing with the results of triple neg? Do you have the BRCA gene? I do and knew about it before diagnosed with cancer - acutally if it wasn't for the knowing I wouldn't have found the cancer so soon - Couldn't feel it our find it on a mammo - they found it on my MRI!  It looks like we are going through exactly the same type of treatment which is good to see that doctors are kind of consistent with what they prescribe for different types of cancer. Can I ask what state you live in? Just wondering I am here in Wisconsin and still have not gone to a support group but am looking into it. With the Triple Neg results we have such a high rate of it reoccuring in the first 2-3 yrs that it is so scary! Hope everyone is doing well with their SE's and have a great weekend! Kelli",

Take care and good luck next week with surgery. I have also been gaining weight - it sucks but I feel like if I can eat I might as well. Although, after this last treatment everything I eat comes out the other end and not in a good way. I have been taking Imodian AD almost every day and lots of baths! So went to the PS past week to be filled and had the PA and she told me that I am already filled to a D cup- yikes - I told my PS I only wanted to be a B cup!! She told me to make sure that I am very firm with him because he likes to make us big! Luckly she told me that I just have to be firm with him when the time comes for my implants and tell him hat size I want to be and the extra skin can be helped to get rid of some of the scarring!

Happy fo those that are done or are close to being done - it means we can do this and are conquering this battle in our lives! Question - those with TEs in do you wear a bra? How do you figure out the size? I am doing being filled and want to start wearing a bra but don't how to pick one out - might have to Victoria Secrets and have them measure me. Hmmm.... Underwires or no? I can't wait to have my surgery to get my implants and be done with this all! Also - lost all my eyelases and most of my eyebrows - which really sucks!
