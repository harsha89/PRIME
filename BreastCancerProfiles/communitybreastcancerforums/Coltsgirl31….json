I'm out in Oregon and wishing you the best. Won't know my staging or treatment plans until they do the sentinel node biopsy during surgery, which is hard. I don't know if my journey is ending or beginning. Which, honestly is one of the hardest parts so far. I don't know what my treatment looks like. Are any of you in the same boat? Is this common? Thanks! ",
