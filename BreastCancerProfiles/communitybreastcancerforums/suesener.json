Ive just completed my chemo and after a 4 week break took my 1st radiation treatment today. A total of 24 more to go over a 5 week period Yay... Im yet to start the third and final treatment that will muck with my hormones. since my diagnosis i have gained a total of 17kgs and Im a bit worried that not only I am going struggle loosing the 17kg I will most likely gain a few more by the time I see the end of this year. Im yet to consider reconstruction which at this point dont consider to be as important. Will i continue adding the pounds in the next couple of months. Or at some point in time in the near future I will slowly come to my self and hopefully with the right diet as well as activities i can expect to start controlling the weight. A total of 17kgs in 8 months is scary :(. if im to expect a further 17kgs till the end of the year then I will be in some serious trouble... Any feed back will be greatly appreciated...
