Several lesions were found by the CT scan, as well as swollen lymph nodes and fluid outside the lungs. Tomorrow morning I am meeting with my oncologist to dicuss the full body PET scan done on Friday. I was surprised that they didn't want to biopsy the lungs, instead the nurse said the Onc wanted to do a PET right away to look for bone mets. I have been through every emotion possible these last few days. After 5 years of trying to have a child, fighting cancer and now finishing up our adoption paperwork, the news I get tomorrow could bring one of my biggest dreams to an end. However, by this evening, I am actually breathing fairly well and haven't coughed for a few hours. I feel like I'm ready for whatever news I get tomorrow. If I could survive the treatment for Stage III triple negative, and the aftermath, I can do just about anything. Reading this board has been a great source of information and encouragement. Thank you. Dx 1/05 Stage III, 6cm+, 3/16 nodes Dx 6/13/2008, Stage IV, Grade 3, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I delayed treatment and then lost the baby anyways. The MRI showed a tumor and node involvement that upped my staging to Stage III, triple negative. We are in the process of trying to adopt and now it seems like I have some lung mets. Just did the full body PET scan today to see if it's in the bones or elsewhere. I guess this is going to crush my hopes of adoption. I wonder if the state agency would consider us for foster parents or even respite providers (just a few days relief for foster parents)? From what I understand Stage IV women can live for many years. I wonder what my life will be like and if I could still care for children while receiving treatment? During my previous TAC treatment, I had to take a leave of absence from my job. Though I hope this time around that I hope I won't be too sick. Am I being realistic? I am just hoping this will be a chronic condition, not a death sentence. How can I convince people that this is a possibility?
