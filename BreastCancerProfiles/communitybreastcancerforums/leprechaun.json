Her recent illness and fever were indeed a banal urine tract infection and not liver mets induced as we feared and antibiotics took a good care of that. She also saw her onc. In fact, her permanent onc (a man) is now on honeymoon (yep!) so the second onc (a lady) in the pair saw Olga today. It looks like we'll restart the chemo (Carbo+Gemzar, Gemzar) in the second half of September in Carbo+Gemzar formula (without the additional Gemzar) regardless of the scan results.The onc says since Olga's disease is so aggressive and TN, it's dangerous to extend the chemo break (she's off chemo since June 25th).  Anyway, we'll wait for the scan results (September 9th) and will decide during our trip to NS. Just wanted to keep you posted. Take care, Yan Log in to post a reply",

I couldn't go (my co-worker is on vacation), so Olga was accompanied by our most \"pusher\" friend, a biologist that is working in clinical trials herself. We had a long list of questions prepared. Our onc just loves answering questions. Q: What alternative chemos do you have right now? A: Taxotere, CMF, Navelbine, VP-16 (Etoposide) . My thoughts (MT): Olga already had Taxotere when she was Stage III two and a half years ago. CMF is only different from FEC (which she also had then) in one letter - Methotrexate instead of Epirubicin and she had FEC in 2008 too. Navelbine is known to many of you. Never heard about Etoposide,from what I found on the Web it's used in lung and testicles cancers... Not so many options, I must say... ----------------------- Q: Are there any PARP trials in Canada now? A: A trial of Iniparib shall begin in April. MT: That's something. AFAIK, this should be a Phase III study! ----------------------- Q: Any theoretical chance of getting Eribulin? A: Yes, in theory. But it's long, bureaucratic... yada yada... Notes (N): At this point our friend (her name is Olga too! :) ) interfered and asked the next question: ----------------------- Q: Would we be in the States, what you do? A: Ixabepilone, Eribulin. MT: I hate to hear the word Ixempra (Ixabepilone), two many BAD SE's... ----------------------- At this moment the two Olga's said: Q: Aha! So you'd like to try Eribulin! So will you sign the forms? A: Eh... OK, but that may take months. MT: Who cares? We're going on a PI3K Inhibitor trial anyway, right? So bring on the forms, let the bureaucratic machine start working! I already printed the forms and will fax them to the onc office tomorrow. ----------------------- Q: Lymph node in the armpit. Are you sure it's bad? Don't we want to biopsy it? A: It's probably NOT a lymph node. But I do think that's a subcutaneous met with probability of 90%. MT: Eh? Weren't you all sure Olga's lungs were overwhelmed by tumors last winter? Turned out to be an infection. He also said that shouldn't matter too much. ----------------------- Q: Can we go back on the Carbo / Gemzar if the PI3K Inhibitor doesn't work. A: Yes, but this practice usually unsuccessful. We can try that if we need though. There were a few less important questions such as menopause etc. Ah, and another thing. The PI3 Kinase Inhibitor trial coordinator called and said Olga is eligible to participate! So we'll get all the details on Monday. Thank you all for the support!

This didn't have any effect on the chemo efficacy (same combo). You'll need some time off the chemo to gather strength for this fight. If the scans are good and your onc is thinking of it, why not? Do you eat pomegranates? They help a lot with the platelets. Also, try to find a good Iron supplement for the same reason. This kept Olga away of transfusions for several months. Take care, Yan",

It's able to flush the chemo down the drain because the goal of the chemo is to intoxicate the body. I don't say to avoid the flax completely, I meant, try to not eat flax on the days of the chemo and a couple of days after. Flax is full of phytoestrogen that might ignite growth of existing ER+ tumor. Actually, the studies results are mixed. Some say they are cancer free because of the diet (be it Budwig or anything else), but you never hear those who didn't succeed because they are gone. IMHO (and I completely agree with Dr. Servan-Schreiber on that) it's a crime to propagate that diet only, without chemo, can cure cancer. Period. Hope this helps, Yan",

We very much agree that more education is needed about the various types of breast cancer, and in recent years we have added additional information ti NBCAM.org about inflammatory breast cancer, mBC, and other types of disease. If you are not already involved with these organizations, you may wish to contact Living Beyond Breast Cancer, the Metastatic Breast Cancer Network, or the Triple Negative Breast Cancer Foundation. All are excellent groups who work to offer support and education around various types of breast cancer. Thank you again for contacting us and sharing your concerns, and for continuing to support National Breast Cancer Awareness Month.\" Edited to add: I'm not sure what I've been expecting, but this looks to me like a standard \"do not disturb\" note.

I keep telling the kids that mom's leaving doesn't mean she doesn't love them anymore. And that they can see their mom, each time they look in the mirror. I'll have to work more with the little one, he's still a little child and a concept of \"never\" is obscure to him. \"One hundred\" is an absolute maximum for him. The older son is a blessing. He knew it all even before I began explaining. The social worker that kept working with him through the last year did a marvelous job. It's so hard sometimes, especially it's so scary to wake up in the morning from a dreamless sleep into a nightmare. And the sound of a frozen ground falling on the casket is awful. And sometimes I feel I could do more, I could work faster on everything, other buttons to push, other strings to pull... But here's how I want to remember her, happy, beautiful. And healthy. She's gave a good fight. ",

If from my words you understood that I tell Olga all the time \"you'll be fine\", that's not true. Well, as I said, English is not my mother tongue, so my expressive language might be poor. Olga is in a full understanding what Stage IV means, what might happen. More than that, she's Triple Neg which is making the things even worse. After all, she sees her onc and she knows the stats and etc... What I try to do is to make her concentrate on the good sides of her life now, to make her feel as positive as possible. Cause she's a very emotional person, she might lose the last remnants of hope should she be exposed to the constant flow of negative info. But NOT in any way I treat her as a baby.  Thanks for you post, this gave me an opportunity to explain the things better. Take care, Yan PS: edited to correct the typos.",

      "Content": "leprechaun wrote: An almost Shakespearean question. Highlights for newbies: in February my wife was almost transferred to the hospice, but then a change in treatment (switching Xeloda (useless) to Carboplatine/Gemzar (superb response)) sent her mets into retreat. Olga went today to see the onc. We are approaching the end of the chemo, the last treatment is scheduled on June 25th. On July 7th there's a CT scan. So, to make long story short, the onc is so excited with the great results of the chemo (and with the great way Olga tolerates it) he wants to extend it with two additional rounds (7 and 8) which will be very flexible in their schedule. Now, we have a dilemma. On one side, he's right. He wants to kick the bastard as hard as possible as long it's working. But on the other side, I suspect that if the chemo will be extended and stop working somewhere near its' end, we'll lose this weapon forever. Ending the chemo at June 25th  will still leave us with a chance of re-trying the same treatment later. I hope I explained the situation well enough. I see the oncs' reasoning and understand that, but there're also doubts. And tiredness. We just want to enjoy the summer together, noone knows how many of them we have left. I think we should at least wait for the CT results before making a decision. So, I'd like to know what the collective Wisdom of these boards is able to offer. You guys are such an incredible group of support, let me rely on you one more time. Thanks and take care, Yan Edited: typos, typos... Log in to post a reply",

Or ask your onc what you can do with that. My wife's platelets were pretty stable since the moment she's began with the Iron supplements (she's been on Carbo/Gemzar for almost a year).

It's in the corner between the breast and chest wall, just under the skin. She could barely find when she tried to show it to me. Seems to be maximum lymph node, but I think it's really nothing. She has a breast MRI on Sunday anyway, but this lump supposedly will not be covered due to its' location. Now, I'm trying to convince her this doesn't make any difference at this stage even if the lump is malignant. Am I right? Another thing, she's worrying that Xeloda doesn't do its' work. She was expecting the bone pain to go away by now completely (Wednesday will be a third cycle start) and to not use two Advil pills per day. I say its' too early to know, only 6 weeks passed. Please give your thoughts. Am I right? Thanks in advance, Yan Log in to post a reply",

Then, if she's unable to work, the long term disability will begin. Great-West Life is a company that pays her the money. Her onc was honest and filled in the application that her date of returning to work is \"unknown, might never be able to work\". They didn't like that, approved the STD but said they'll re-assess the situation in a couple of months. Yesterday we've got a call. Some young lady from the G-W began asking questions about Olga's condition and etc. As I stated in another thread, lately she has trouble sleeping because of the worsened pain in the spine and hips, was put on the Oxycocet and will have rads starting today. And she's got a severe cold which keeps her voice creepy as if she's smoking heavily (I have a nasty thought crossing my mind occasionally... you know what I mean). Basically, the condition has worsened since the last time they assessed the claim. So Olga says: \"My condition is worse today than then.\" and the gal keeps asking \"So when are you going back to work?\". \"Don't know, I'm in pain, will have the rads.\" \"OK, may you go back to work next week?\" and so on and on and on... Ended up saying they'll send a new application form for the onc to fill out. Ah, cool, so he'll write the same answer again! I was sooo pissed off! I wanted to shout on that idiotic phone lady myself! I mean, you hear she's in pain, the rads will begin shortly. Don't you think she's not likely to return to work NEXT WEEK?

I prefer to filter for the information she hears. I created a sort of a cocoon around her, feeding her with positive news only. There's no reason for her to be aware of all this stuff, just no reason. I told her about Kathy's 17 years and counting, told her about 30 years of Rita Arditti. But I didn't tell about Heidi, KBUG and Kim. She doesn't need to know. Why should she?",

It's in the corner between the breast and chest wall, just under the skin. She could barely find when she tried to show it to me. Seems to be maximum lymph node, but I think it's really nothing. She has a breast MRI on Sunday anyway, but this lump supposedly will not be covered due to its' location. Now, I'm trying to convince her this doesn't make any difference at this stage even if the lump is malignant. Am I right? Another thing, she's worrying that Xeloda doesn't do its' work. She was expecting the bone pain to go away by now completely (Wednesday will be a third cycle start) and to not use two Advil pills per day. I say its' too early to know, only 6 weeks passed. Please give your thoughts. Am I right? Thanks in advance, Yan Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "leprechaun wrote: An almost Shakespearean question. Highlights for newbies: in February my wife was almost transferred to the hospice, but then a change in treatment (switching Xeloda (useless) to Carboplatine/Gemzar (superb response)) sent her mets into retreat. Olga went today to see the onc. We are approaching the end of the chemo, the last treatment is scheduled on June 25th. On July 7th there's a CT scan. So, to make long story short, the onc is so excited with the great results of the chemo (and with the great way Olga tolerates it) he wants to extend it with two additional rounds (7 and 8) which will be very flexible in their schedule. Now, we have a dilemma. On one side, he's right. He wants to kick the bastard as hard as possible as long it's working. But on the other side, I suspect that if the chemo will be extended and stop working somewhere near its' end, we'll lose this weapon forever. Ending the chemo at June 25th  will still leave us with a chance of re-trying the same treatment later. I hope I explained the situation well enough. I see the oncs' reasoning and understand that, but there're also doubts. And tiredness. We just want to enjoy the summer together, noone knows how many of them we have left. I think we should at least wait for the CT results before making a decision. So, I'd like to know what the collective Wisdom of these boards is able to offer. You guys are such an incredible group of support, let me rely on you one more time. Thanks and take care, Yan Edited: typos, typos... Log in to post a reply",

But that's definitely an option now. We'll be talking with the onc in a few days and will raise that matter. I'm not sure this suites triple-negative, though... Thanks!",

It worked great for her and given the similarities with your disease, this has a great chance to work for you as well. Ask your daughter to find a good Iron supplement for you. Although Gemzar hit her platelets hard, Olga needed only one transfusion through the entire year, these supplements kept her Hgb levels acceptable. (((Hugs))) Yan",

      "Content": "Jan 7, 2011 10:24PM - edited Jan 11, 2011 08:42AM by leprechaun OK, thanks for your opinions. Especially you, Otter. :) Telehealth and Telemedicine are somewhat different things. The Telehealth is used when you, Barbe, call for a diagnostic opinion (we used that once with our older son and it spared us a trip to ER). Telemedicine is follow-up and routine. It can be used for education and it is used for that purpose massively here, in Ontario. But the most important issue is the ability of people to \"go\" to their physician who might be 1000 miles away, using the videoconferencing station. In fact, I work for the Telemedicine service provider. We're the service provider behind all the Telemedicine in the province and I personally  work in a team that takes care of the technical stuff, in particular - videoconferencing. This network is a largest and a most active Telemedicine network in the entire world (we have almost 2000 video units province-wide) and is growing at an astonishing pace. Each dollar the province gives us returns almost two. But still - only 10% of physicians are using our network. Not so many people are aware at all of such a thing. It's all secure, we use secure communication and there's an entire department dealing with privacy procedures only. We have a few programmes, such as Telestroke, Telehomecare, Teleophtalmology... but there's no usage by oncologists, almost none! Why did I come here with all this? We live an hour away from the hospital. For Olga its a burden to go there. Add to this all the psychological experience of going to the hospital (you know what I mean).  Whythe hell can't she have her follow-up appointments from home, using Telemedicine? Of course, this will not work when the appointment is diagnostic. But a lot of her appointments with the onc are only bla-bla-bla which might be done easily from home over the network. We'll start running a pilot shortly of PC-based videoconferencing (till now it was all with dedicated equipment). Then, in about 4 months, it will hopefully be rolled-out. We're discussing who should try this first. I want it so much that the oncologists will adopt it. This would save Olga and other Ontario ladies needless hours in traffic and public transit (weak immune system...). I wanted to know what you know about the Telemedicine first, because many people feel unsafe in front of the camera and a screen instead of the physician. That's why I came here asking this question. Now, my next question - would you do this? Would you trust the technology? Thanks in advance. Yan.",

That is why they have exorbitantly high rate of lactose intolerance. However, other races developed that gene over a course of evolution. Why? Because they began cultivating cattle for dairy thousands of years before. The same reason (but in reverse) is underlying the effective breakdown of soy proteins. Caucasian bodies can hardly process soy effectively. Unlike Asians.",
