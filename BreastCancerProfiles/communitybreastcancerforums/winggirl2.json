My heart went with the breast surgeon who said he felt comfortable I could get by with a lumpectomy. I had a lumpectomy then 2 weeks later a re-incision for clear margins. Needless to say I lost a lot of breast tissue. Plus going thru radiation there was some shrinkage. I was concerned about my \"downsized\" breast also. It is now a year later and my breast has filled back out and looks great to me! I have a small dent from the surgery site which no one can see. You may want to consider giving yourself some time. No regrets on my part as to which prodecure I had done. Do what you feel is best for you. Best wishes WingGirl",
