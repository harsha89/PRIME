Once it started growing it started coming in pretty quick - but not curly like most people get. Straighter than prior to chemo!! Be prepared though if you have to take a hormone blocker (I am on Arimidex) because one of the side effects is thinning hair. I've always had fine hair, but when it started growing back it was actually thicker - until I started Arimidex! I now have to deal with sparse hair on the top of my head (like male pattern baldness almost)!!! And I am told I will need to take Arimidex for at least 5 years - if not more!! I just keep my hair short hoping it will look thicker that way. And use a lot of hair spray to keep my bald spots covered. Hate windy days!HA",
