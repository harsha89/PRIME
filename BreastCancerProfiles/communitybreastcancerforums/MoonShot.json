    "Content": "Nov 23, 2012 04:58PM - edited Nov 23, 2012 04:59PM by MoonShot Carly, The mole-like growth may be the beginning of a new normal mole or (because of the redness around it and although rare for your age) could be abnormal skin changes. Whatever the case, you are always better finding out SOONER than later. I know you seem embarrassed about telling anyone, but try to think of yourself decades older - at which point you really won't give a hoot (it just happens). At that decades-older stage, what would you be advising if you could have a talk with your 14 year old self? Try to be a good parent to yourself and listen to the wisdom and lack of embarrassment that the parentÂ you is giving. Then follow the advise - take your parent you and the 14 year old you to a female physician (I advise a dermatologist) and get it checked out. On the plus side, if it is a normal mole, the sooner you get it removed, the better before it becomes much larger. And yes, you should demand that it be removed because it can get larger, will rub against your bra, and if you have it removed at such a young age there will be little or no scar.",
