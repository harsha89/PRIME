The thin scarfs, not the large ones that we used to cover our whole heads. Its just a thought...and as with everything you all have endured...This too shall pass!!",

I was told that my lymph nodes looked great at surgery, lo and behold, I had 2 lymph nodes with macro (1cm in each), not just micromets. So, I know how that feels. They thought I was just ER positive then bam..another call to say..I am HER2 positive also. My pathology showed a smaller tumor (just under 2cm) yet it did spread quickly. I did a dbl mx and I am grateful I did because they found two additional smaller tumors. And the best part of all of this....I had a breast reduction at 35..lol  Go ahead and smirk, I do!

Lauren- Here is a poem I wrote about Rads. I gave this framed to the team as a thank you gift at the end. I just wanted to share it since you are in rads now. You can so relate!! If it makes you smile, then it was worth posting! ( I won't make this a poetry thread....lol) The 3 Million Dollar Tanning Bed By: Kathy / Breast Cancer Warrior   I walk into the office with apprehension and fear The diagnosis of cancer is what we all share    Radiation is needed for 6 weeks and 3 days Completed my chemo and now it's this phase   The entire staff is filled with compassion and care They make you feel as if they've known you for years   A mold is made from my chest to my head To prevent me from moving and being misread   The next step seems to be exciting and new Not one, not two but many small tattoos   The first day of treatment seems so surreal The patients you meet know how you feel   It is time for radiation from the 3 million dollar tanning bed You get on the table and gently lay down your head   You look up and the ceiling is filled with flowers galore Your heart starts to beat and you feel anxiety to the core   The staff aligns you and each exits the room It  feels like you're awaiting some impending doom   I lie there alone and start to pray It is painless, this so called radiation ray   Each visit gets easier and the staff becomes friends Fear, apprehension and anxiety all begin to end   Yes, the skin can get red, blister and peel But doctors will take care of anything you feel   These words are my gift of appreciation and gratitude For encouraging me to always have a positive attitude   Each day I walk in, I smile as I have learned to cope This office has given me care, kindness, but most of all hope.   From the front desk to the doctor to each one of you I am so grateful and proud of the job that you do",

Dr sd some get the cycles back, some don't..just depends on your body. Try to find an oncologist so you can have your cehck ups. Why no Tamoxifen? AIs? My hair was so curly, too. Believe it or not, those curls will disappear as it gets longer. Mine did. It does make your hair more stylish w/curls vs straight! lol  Congrats on finishing treatment!!",

My DH and I are taking my three great kids to a fun dinner at Benihana on Monday.  So many of you are just starting your journey and it seems so overwhelming. I know. I have been there. Don't look at the whole pic, just one day at a time. When it gets overwhelming, take a breath and look how far you have come thus far. My prayers are with each of you Warriors.  If you have any questions, please ask. I have been pretty much thru it all...chemo, rads, herceptin, dbl mx, two different reconstructions (failed implants and successful DIEP flaps)  Stay Strong and remember..there is sometimes only one thing you can control during this time and that is YOUR THOUGHTS.

I have been wanting to write for so long because many of you, especially the newbies, need to know that normalcy does return. It will be SIX years in January that I got diagnosed. I am doing VERY WELL!! Yes, it's a long hard journey but if you surround yourself around people and friends that can support you, it will make it all doable. There were times during cancer treatment, that I had to ground myself from the computer. There can be some negativity out there and some love to blog and blog about it. Those that have got to the other side of treatment, have resumed their life and you will not always find them here. It doesn't mean that I am not here for you. I am. Even if you want to talk, u can inbox me. Just know this journey is doable and we all got your back!!! Much love and inner peace!!! Xoxoxo",

I feel fine, it was the damn IV that killed...I have poopy veins. They poked me numeours times in my hand, arm , feet and all failed so they had to put IV in my juggular...ouch but I am home and resting and should be fine in the next day or two.

I, myself, tried it once in addition to my Tamox but I think my body went on overload and started having hot flashes, insomnia etc. Not to say its not a great supplement, I believe it is but it may just be too much in addition to our biological therapies. Try it. Whatever we can put in our arsenal, the better. Also, search DIM on this website and you will have lots of conversations to review. Good luck.",

For me,the benadryl did the trick if taken 20 minutes before the tx. The advantage was I did sleep through most of the treatment which was over 5 hrs long. lol I just want my fellow warriors to know that I am still reading all your posts because I know have it linked to my email....so even though I started this post and I am not posting as much...I AM HERE! :) 3 years and counting....Feelling good. I am scheduled to have a hysterectomy in November but keeping my ovaries. I am still premenopausal. My cycles came back almost one year to the day I started tx. ( I was 39 at dx) My cycles are pretty regular but quite light. Lately, I have been having hot flashes but I think stress makes them worse. lol For my warrior sisters that are going thru treatment, and even those that have it behind them, just know my thoughts and prayers are with you!!! xoxo",

Sometimes, and most of the time, its not back to normal but a new normal. :) As for the ovary situation. i had the same thing. If its filled w/ blood etc, its called a complicated cyst. It can come and go. Mine was from tamoxifen. I recently had it removed when they removed my uterus and all is well...as yours will be, too!! Hang in there and plz keep us posted.",

You may be able to relate to the many feelings...ENJOY! PS..My pic is me now and chemo ended last July...it will grow back!! The Chapter Closes... It has been over a year since I received the call You have breast cancer...I remember starting to bawl. Surgery was needed, chemo and rads, too. Don't forget the IV med, Herceptin, which is new! My journey is written but I don't know the end.... But do any of us really, my friend?? I have written each chapter in my heart and my head, From every tear to hope to all of the meds. My surgery has temporaily changed me frm a C to an A Thank goodness for pump ups in this modern day! I made it thru surgery, waking up w/4 drains. Taking my Vicodin to get thru the pains. I heal and get stronger each and everyday So, I finish that chapter w/success, I say! A new chapter starts, the one we all dread... Chemo begins and I know it will affect my head. Soon, my brush was filled w/chunks of hair I was sad, but I was prepared to look in the mirror. Fun wigs..short wigs...sassy ones, too! No one knew which one I would do! Made it through chemo w/support of family and friends Time to close that chapter, thought it would never end! So, the new chapter begins of radiation for over 6 weeks The burn and the pain would eventually peak Again, I make it thru w/everyone's love and prayers. Each day, I live in Faith and Hope, NOT fears. I close the chapter of my new burnt skin. Grateful my expanders did not give in! I do my IV med, Herceptin, every 3 weeks for a year. The Oncologists staff know you by name and truly care The access was made easier by inserting a port But it's been over a year, not very short! So, when does this chapter get to close for me? In 2 weeks, and my heart needed these words to be free You won't hear this often, but it gets stuck in our mind. We get fearful, as safety nets are removed one at a time. This is where I learned to control what I think Positive thoughts can turn a black world to pink! I also have learned to not live in fear, but hope It is love, faith and believing that helps us cope. So, here I sit two weeks before my final surgery day Looking forward to silicone, port out and an overnite stay I felt the need to write down my words for others to hear. Maybe you will read them and want to share I am a fighter, a warrior at war. I have my battle wounds to even the score I wear my pink boxing gloves and continue to fight. So, pray for all of us each day and each night!!   ",

I wish I would of so much earlier than I did.  Make sure you have Emends for nausea etc...ask the protocol to control side effects.  You will find that you see your Dr near each chemo so each time you can discuss what is happening. I took a sleeping pill during that time and at the same time, I got a metal taste in my mouth...well...it ended up being the pill side effect and NOT chemo. So make sure you learn about the main side effects for any drugs you take. Don't be afraid to take xanax or melatonin or something to help you sleep.

I always had a small area on my mastectomy scar line that would not heal..it just stay scabbed. Its easy to get staph w/an opening like that.  As for lotions, do whatever drs tell you. When do you start rads? Did you read my poem about rads? Kind of humorous since you will understand it all...I think its on this thread.  Keep me posted on your tx!! happy thanksgiiving, too!!",

For those of us on Tamoxifen, you need to request the CYP2D6 Test from your oncologist. It shows what kind of metabolizer you are. Majority of woman will be an extensive, some will be intermediate and a few will be poor metabolizers. Its important you know if you are a poor metabolizer.  I tested and found out I am an intermediate. This means I carry one gene that DOES metabolize and one that DOES NOT. So, I am undercovering my next step, which is to figure out just how much that is. Mayo and Univ of Indiana are working on this test currently. Look up orange1 and her info on the test and Tamoxifen......  It is important to have as much knowledge as you can......... Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to One and ALL!!",
