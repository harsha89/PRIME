There are some with many nodes removed who never develop LE at all.  There are others with NO nodes removed who develop LE.  This part is kind of a mystery.  The more nodes removed the higher the rates, but you never know where you'll fall with all those statistics. You may be fine.  The best thing to do is to realize that you are indeed at risk and to learn how to care for yourself best.  You can find a certified LE therapist and have a consultation.  Possibly they should do some checking for you, will probably take your measurements.  At this point, you probably have sufficient post-surgical swelling, which can complicate the picture for the next couple weeks.  For now, you can keep your arm elevated just to give it a rest and keep swelling down a bit.  Spend some time reading here, you'll learn a lot. Many who do have LE do not develop it immediately.  For some, it's within weeks, for others it's years later.  Awareness is key.  So, you are doing well to have popped in here!",

I am assuming they are trying to make sure what your options are, given the type and location. I had 2 followup MRI guided biopsies, which placed markers for future tracking. The markers are helpful to pinpoint future growth.  Your diagnosis is so recent, I imagine you're feeling rather upside down right now.  If they find only one location or multiple locations - this will be helpful info in determining how to proceed.",

You may need to discuss this further with your PT - does she do MLD?  Prevention is good, but is not enough if you are having fullness and heaviness.  You got measurements, but what is the treatment plan beyond this?  MLD is the core of treatment, and a sleeve will add to the benefits of MLD.  A sleeve without MLD is only a partial program.  If your PT does not do MLD, find someone soon who does.  Hopefully, that can give you some relief.  And once someone does MLD, you can learn to do it for yourself at home, which gives you more control over your symptoms.",

I wore a compression shirt for the flights - I did everything I could think of, since I'd had some swelling difficulty with a flight in Aug. Swelling makes me crabby, then I'm miserable in too many ways....so I was trying to find a better way to fly.  By chance, she asked me if I wear a gauntlet or a glove.  When I told her I only have gauntlets, she suggested I wrap my fingers for the flight.  I have gauze for pm wrapping which I tossed into my carryon.  I waited till I was on the plane to do quick wraps of both hands, then I looked like a burn victim.  My white gauze against my black sleeves and gaunlets were certainly eye-catching, and I noticed most of those around me wondering what was up. I've got to tell you wrapping my fingers really, really made a difference.  I don't know why it never occurred to me before.  In the past, flying has pushed fluid into my fingers, creating puffy little sausages in the past. It was so great getting off the plane, unwrapping my fingers to find them looking good and feeling comfortable. Just thought I'd pass it along.  Bilat NS DIEP Jan 2010, LE Mar 2010 Dx 12/2009, DCIS, 2cm, Stage 0, Grade 1, 0/7 nodes, ER+/PR+ Log in to post a reply",

Again, flaps can be delayed.  However, if you do the mx and flaps at the same time there is a lot less scarring.  Ultimately, you have to get some peace with your decision. Take the time to read and to ponder.  Do you HAVE to keep your 12/1 date?  Can you extend just a few weeks in order to process?  It is my opinion that we are rushed into things, yet looking back an extra couple weeks is probably not a big deal.  You need to find your heart in all this, and to have a little time to come up with a plan which matches you.  I thought I'd go no recon, since I did not want implants.  Flaps seemed scary and risky, especially after meeting with  my local PS who is simply too green yet.  Then, I found the docs in New Orleans, had several talks with their people, did tons more reading, and was able to finally make a decision which matched me.  My end result is very good and, best of all, I was able to get some peace about it before going into surgery.  I wish the same for you.",

My LE therapist is soft spoken, very zen, and mentally flexible.  She put up with my tense rantings as I sorted through things while she gently worked on me.  LE's massage confused me, which made me feel even crazier for awhile.  It just would not sink into my brain initially. After awhile, the routine started to make sense, I read more about LE here, patient thread members gave me good answers and some order began to appear out of the chaos.  This takes time, and it takes patience, which is hard to come by when we have been through various stages of crisis with cancer and LE.  I am glad you are here and I hope you feel at home and comfortable with all of us on this journey.",

It was overwhelming and I was often discouraged.  It does get better, but it tends to come and go in severity for many of us.  I have confirmed LE in my right arm, but not my left.  However, my left non-LE arm is often very effected - it just seems to balance itself a bit better, so that's why it's not officially LE on that arm.  I've recently been working with a new therapist who is more aggressive in the lower abdominal drainage, and I've found that to be surprisingly helpful.  Maybe it can help you, too.  In addition to my existing MLD work, he has me working the abdominal area 2 ways - breathing, and massaging.  The breathing starts with a very strong exhale, which includes tight kegels to fully compress and hold.  To inhale, I'm to simply release all tension and allow breath to come in, then fully inhale.  Repeat many times.  The massaging component is done deeply in the triangle between the hip bones and the belly button, as well as over my scar, as I had a DIEP recon with a scar that runs side seam to side seam.  Those deep nodes are the core of our body's drainage, so massaging and stimulating them can help the other areas drain more effectively.  MLD is light pressure, but this that I'm describing in the lower abdomen is very firm and deep.  This therapist has also suggested rolling a tennis ball deeply and repeatedly over/into that lower abdominal area since my hands tire.  At first I thought this seemed odd, but it has added one more helpful layer for me.  I have mild LE, but it's not always well controlled and seems to change for no reason.  When it flares I'm a big crab, so my family is happier the fewer flares I have.  It seems by working the lower abdominal area, my arms look smaller for awhile.  That's just been my experience so far.  I don't believe this is documented in research, so this is just personal experience.  I've had no success with insurance whatsoever, but others here have.",

In a non-cancer part of my life, I am involved with parents of chronically ill teens.  The parents go through a lot being caregivers in a chronic situation.  Most parents are on some kind of med support, to varying degrees- anti-depressants, benzo's like xanax or klonipin, some find they do better with thyroid support and/or adrenal supports.  Personally, I have a med I can take as needed, for which I am greatly appreciative.  That said, I still have totally crappy days regularly, since I do have a chronically ill adult child, in addition to my own stuff. At some point there is a quality of life issue which simply has to be addressed - what will it take for me to feel good today?  what will it take for me to manage well today? Regarding your pain, I recently read an article on a product which has my attention.  In the alternative/complimentary world, turmeric is very commonly used for inflammation and more and more is being associated with having anti-cancer properties.  There is a product which uses turmeric as it's base, in conjunction with a couple other herbs, which some are finding works very well for pain, as well as inflammation.  Your arthritis comment made me think of this product - arthritis and anti-cancer together - it might be an option for you. You can read up on Curcumin (turmeric), curcuminoids, and a specific product called Curamin, sold at health food stores.  I have been taking a turmeric extract since my dx, and just got a sample of this Curamin last week when I went into my local shop, but I've not used it yet.  The literature is promoting it for chronic pain issues. Just a thought.  I know neurontin works for some people, and I hope you get relief from it.  If not, there may be other options. Thinking of you, KC/Christine ",

It'sjust one more way to help.  For me, it works fairly well, but it's not remarkably amazing.  Just one more way to maintain control.",
