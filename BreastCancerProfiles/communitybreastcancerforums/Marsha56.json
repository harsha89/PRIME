But I am an will until the Lord takes my hand to my new life and home! Currently a week out finding out I have brain mets.. Three more rads treatment's and done with that for know. I believe that as you except what you have life gets better and so does your streghtn and fight! So let's keep being warrior's and go head and have those pissed off days and down day's . Then pick your self up and go for the run!!! If you are struck reach out that's what we are for!! Keep the faith and peace,",
