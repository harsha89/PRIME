Can I ask for my pathology reports without them glaring at me? Does this include all the testing done, everything from mammos to ultrasounds to bone scans etc...?Will I beable to read them? Today I had an ultrasound of my stomach area and it was only upon questioning did I get the information that they were looking for some liver spots after they dug up some old cat scans that had been done on my liver back in January.  At the time the C scans were done, the spots were dismissed \"Probably nothing, you may have even had them all your life. I had asked them to look into my liver because of constant pain in my right quadrant (just under the infected breast) Yikes...no one told me at all what they were looking for at the time of the ultrasound. I can't help but feel utterly spooked and in the dark....no, scratch the word spooked and replace it with terrified...really terrified.",

Thanks for your feedback and I really appreciate it -- I'm very torn about using holistic medicine over 'white man's medicine' and I'm more and more inclined to use them in conjunction with each other. I totally hear you when you say I have one chance at it, that I can't change my mind later. I went for ultrasounds and bone scans today. I'm not so happy about some liver spots that they've confirmed are still there (since an original scan I had in Jan before the breast cancer diagnosis was made. I had requested the scan because of continuing pain in my liver area -- just under the present day tumour -- and the prognosis at that time was \"don't know, probably had them all your life\" and that was that. Have you heard of 'liver spots' and breast cancer (with a tumour only around 1cm large) being connected? I just got over the first wave of fear and was sailing on some optimism and hope and now I'm crawling around in the cave of terror again....this is really not easy stuff -- as you all know! Thanks for your words and wisdom mg",

      "Content": "Monika wrote: I'm totally new to both the cancer and this kind of forum on the internet. It is quite amazing to beable to exchange information and questions in this way. I was just diagnosed with b cancer three weeks ago and I'm still very unclear about what's happening. I'm going into surgery and have the option of either a lumpectomy or mastectomy. My lump is only 1 cm and the surgeon said it was a common one \"Invasive Adenacarcinoma\" My MD told me it was tubular which \"isn't the worst kind of cancer, nor is it the best\". That's about all I know so far.. I still haven't decided what to do for surgery. The mastectomy sounds drastic but I like the fact that I probably won't need radiation afterwards (?). Is there anyone out there who has had a mastectomy and did have to have radiation and also chemo afterwards? If I have a lumpectomy, I know I have to have both. BUT....I tend to be inclined towards alternative health and I would love to hear any stories of woman who had the surgery and did NOT have radiation and chemo afterwards. Were you successful and what did you do instead to keep the cancer from coming back? It's all such a crash course on a topic I just don't really want to study! But I know it's important and I'll do everything to inform myself. Thanks ahead for any replies I have a gazillion questions and will be pestering you all the time! (Does anyone out there have Dr. Lozon, Owen Sound, Ontario Canada, as a surgeon? If so, can you tell me what you think of him?)
