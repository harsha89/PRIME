My focus then became on what my choices are and making plans for work and home. My other focus has been to keep a positive additude and keeping in mind that even thou I have Breast Cancer I am really lucky....lucky for  living in a time where medical science has advanced so far that I have a chance to survive this. I too feel guilty because I had a mother that had breast cancer....I had knowledge....and I ignored it because I had the additude that it \"happens to someone else\". My new mission in life is too educate myself and to educate my friends and family, anybody I run into about Breast Cancer and early dectention. I have been told that 1 in every eight women may get breast cancer.  I have told the women at work that there are 16 of us in the building, that means two of us could get breast cancer. EVERY women I work with has gone in and had a mommogram these last three weeks. (Some not having done it in 5-7 years, some not at all till now) I work with young children and one of my parents came to me last thursday...She had did her mammogram last week (she was due it has been two years but kept putting it off) She needs to go back and get another mammogram because \"of something they seen\". This Mom kept Thanking me....because even thou she is scared....she would rather \"face the ugly then ignore it\". Ginnysue don't feel bad about not being upset......just keep your mind focus and keep strong. If you have break down moments thats ok too, this is how you get through things so you can deal. We have all been given a new path in our life....we just need to figure out where it is going and what we want to do with it. Take Care, Denise",

I guess I'm nervous as I never have had a sun burn in my life.....I am one of those who has always tanned. The only type of skin burn I have experienced is a wind burn on my face when we have camped on the coast in some really windy weather, I have had a second degree burn on my foot when I spilled a pan of boiling water....ouch that one hurt! These lotions we are using......Are they a protective that will help our skin become conditioned and not burn as easy? Or is the lotion just to make the current skin condition you have feel better? Sorry for all the questions but like I said I have not had experience with a sun burn. So I guess I am feeling a little nervous about skin feeling like a \"rug burn\". Right now I am crossing my fingers that I do not get any skin breakage or any other problems. Onehalf/ Denise",

Instead of worrying about the undies....I just wrapped them in many paper towels and threw them in the outside garbage. Then I told them at work that I had to run home \"and get some medicine\"....my medicine was a fresh pair of underwear. When I started Chemo I had an embarrassing moment while shopping at Long's Drug Store. It was a week after my first Chemo treatment.....The urge of not knowing if I was going to have loose stools or vomit came over me.....I went to use the bathroom at Longs ( as I have many other times)....but now there was a code lock on the door....OMG! when did this happen! I hurried to the RX counter and asked if I could use the bathroom...\"sure in just a minute\" was the respnse of the girl....she waited on two other customers then called on the mike for someone....I waited and waited....I had to sit in a chair they have by the RX counter....Finally I couldn't wait any longer. I then stepped up to the counter and I told the girl, \"listen I am having Chemo treatments and I don't know if I am going to shit on your floor or vomit\" ...she left the counter right away and unlocked the door for me!  This was the only time I used getting Chemo as a means of getting what I needed....well except for at home...LOL! LOL!LOL! I've learned at home I don't need to say the words...if I put a certain look on my face, or take a deep breath...my husband will tell me to go lay down and relax.",

The gel patch is the best thing I have felt since I started Radiation, but as you said, how do you keep it in place, especailly in the area of the axilla. This is what we (nurse and me ) have discovered with me.....after placing the patch if you can wrap the qauze wrap around you to hold in place. But this depends on the location. My nurse has also used some of the (I call it) surgery tape. The other thing that we did on Friday was to place the gel patch then put a flat pad over it then I wear a netting (looks like a tube top with little holes). A sheet cut in long sections and used like a binding wrap will help....Hey! We did do this the first time, sounds extreme, but holding those gel patches in place was important. I had gel patches at the axilla area and under my breast...and for me the wrapping was comfortable because it held both breast in place....like a home made bra. I know this all may not help you as it is the weekend and all these materials you will find at  Radiology . But the idea is to place the patch and find a way to hold it there....If you are ok with wearing a bra....then you might be able to place a pad, diaper, kotex, between the gel patch and bra....anything to hold it flat in place. Also don't forget some hospital pharmacy are open on the weekend and might have some supplies you can use. Monday I would call your Radiation Oncology location and talk to them about helping you. Something I just discovered....(duh! I should of known this )even when I am all done with my Radiation (which will be next week) I can go back to the Radiation for skin care. I don't know why I thought that just because I have a last treatment then they were done with me. My doctors nurse explained that skin care IS part of the treatment. So I encourage you to call them if you are uncomfortable, you may need a little extra help especailly in the next two weeks. Congrats on having your last treatment Denise",

      "Content": "Apr 4, 2009 03:37AM - edited Apr 4, 2009 03:53AM by Onehalf Hi Everyone- I haven't posted for a while. Some may remember that the last time I posted I reported that I had the beginning stages of a skin infection at my raditation site. My primary care Dr. did not want to mess around and he put me on Vancomycin antiobitic. This is given through an IV which I had to have a PICC line put in. And I had to do a treatment every 12 hours....Well this adventure is now over. The meds worked very well, but I got to tell you it took me three days to feel somewhat normal again. The fever went away quick, but the lack of energy, really did a number on me....I did not even feel this tried when I was getting Chemo. Dr. says it's a combination of Radiation and the infection. And he has order labs, to check on everything (throid, liver) just to be on the safe side. Which I do next week. Well I did finish my Radiation treatments....I had my last treatment on Monday March 30th. I am glad that is done, and yet have feelings of \"what now?\".....Since August 2008 I have had doctor appointments dealing with this Breast Cancer Beast....now here I am in the beginning of April....and it seems all appointments have stopped. The feelings of \"is the cancer gone?\" are there...My safety net of Chemo and Radiation are no longer there. But I knew this would happen....so it is just getting used to having living life without BC consuming all my activities...adjustments as always. As for my skin infection..... When I began to peel and get small patches of raw areas under my arm pit...axilla area. To help with the discomfort the nurses used the gel patch....aaaah! It felt so much better having the area covered. After all when air hits the raw skin this is what hurts.....your nerve endings are closer to the surface and this causes the pain. Well the gel patches helped, but they did not stay in place, so the nurses had to find ways to hold the gel patch in place, by using gauze wraps.....Big mistake for weekend use. This is why my primary care doctor believes the infection happened....the way I was \"patched and wrapped\" created too much moisture. Resulting in an infection. Well my primary care doctor's office had a \"new product\"....In a form of another patch. This patch..(6\"X6\") looks like a suba suit material and had silver (silverdine) on the side that sticks to you to kill bacteria. The patch has an adhesive that make it stick to you, yet it is not so strong....you can take it off and shower and replace. This patch is the bomb! I wore this patch in and showed my Raidiation Clinic staff.....they were in awe! And ordered some. This patch made such a quick improvement in my skin. A little over a week later and my skin is almost completely healed....by that I mean no raw areas.....and I can now wear a bra.  I have a (half) patch I will still wear for the weekend, just to keep the delicate skin protected. The reason I am telling you all this is because if you are experiencing any raw skin areas, I strongly encourage you to have your Radiation Doctor or Nurse look into this product....there is no reason to be uncomfortable or chance what happened to me a get an infection. Here is the website for the product....I used the first Patch the gray one Mepilex Ag www.molnlycke.com/item.asp?id=14955&lang=2&si=181 You can also go to the \"home page\" and click on wound care products. Like I said my Radiation nurse and Radiologist were very impressed with the product. I gave them the website and customer service phone number....they have ordered some, but yet the product did not come in time for me to use with them. So my primary care doctor's office has taken over on skin care for me. I do feel good knowing that I have exposed the Radiation Clinic to a product that they will use with other patients.....in fact on my last day (Monday) the nurse told me that they have another women that could use this patch and as soon as it comes in they will introduce it to her....which the patches were due to arrive on Tuesday or Wednesday of this week....lucky lady she will be As I have read through all the post.....So much has happened...So many who have completed their Radiation....Congrats to all! Debi- I feel your pain in losing your sister.....I lost my sister who was 15 months younger then me. This happened four years ago. ( I am now 48 years old). Her death was an ugly one.....boyfriend accidently shot her with a gun...long story.....but it should of not have happened.  My regrets....My sister did not want to have much family communication. Just the way she wanted it to be....We respected her wishes....I figured one day she might come to terms and things would change......all this time I was thinking maybe as we got older we could have a better relationshiip....give her time.....Now I am sorry I allowed this time to happen with her.....because there is no future for us now. It is so hard to lose a family member.....something that you will never be able to accept. Deb, You hang in there and as you said...\"she is not in pain\" and she is watching over you. Since I have already made up for lost time.....LOL!  I am going to share something weird that heppened to me when I discovered my Breast Cancer....... First of all my Mother had Breast Cancer....she had died....not from the Breast Cancer, but other medical problems that became more pronouced because of the Breast Cancer and Treatments.... My Mother died in 1998.... August of 2008....I went to the doctor because I had a \"bug bite\" on my right breast....this \"bite\" was there for two weeks....The second week it changed a little, to me it looked like a bug bite, yet I knew it wasn't a bug bite....My doctor said \"it looked like a surface thing\" but yet her ordered a mammogram because of family history......and he scheduled an examine by the \"breast clinic\" which was scheduled in 3 days.....After my Mammogram I got a call that they needed to redo the mammogram because they did not get a clear immage of the left breast....I'm thinking lady your crazy because the \"bite is on the right breast\"....they wanted me in right away, but I argued that I have an examine in two days with the Breast Clinic, so it could wait until then. I was also under pressure because I could not leave work early that week as other teachers were on vacation time and I did not want to ask for the time off.......That night at home when I was walking through my living room, I caught a glimpse of an image of my Mom in our Patio Window....this was only a split second, then I reconginized myself in the window.....I shook my head and was confused as this was the only time I have had a \"vision\" of my Mother........ Went to Breast Clinic and scheduled another Mammogram........Results I had Breast Cancer in  my Left Breast (not the right that I had the bug bite on)....My doctor called and said \"Denise I am so sorry you have to go through this\" I said \"thanks to him for being cautious...this was detected early\" My doctor also said that \"they still do not know what that is on my right breast...it is not a bite, boil, or infection\" I told him \"I know what it is......it is a kiss from my Mother to get me in\". So see they do take care of us even when they pass! Densie/Onehalf",

First thing this morning I called the Radiologist and spoke to the \"skin nurse\"....Explained to her how uncomfortable I was, and also let her know that the areas of the peeling under the arm that hurt the most began to seep a white fluid during the night. Her response....this is a normal process. What I'm thinking is that my boob is going to turn into a ugly blob of puffy red.brownish stuff and swell up for everybody to see.....at this point I hope this white fluid will seep the whole breast and I can pour it into a cup ( more like a gallon jug) and be rid of it....and she tells me this is normal. Anyways the nurse calls back, She has spoken to the doctor and they decide to start me on my 7 day boost, this will give my sensitive area a rest. Then they will do the last two boost at the end. The nurse also tell me they will see me after my appointment time and \"put a dressing on and I will feel so much better\" She then lets me know one of the other personnel will put the dressing on because she was going home sick...thats ok we all get sick. I get there and the other nurse looks at my breast, her response was \"Ouch, you must really hurt\".....The nurse was a little bothered because the doctor was at another clinic doing some other specialty work and she really wanted him to see me. She promised that she will be leaving him a note....She then put this what they call a \"jell pad\" on me....OMG! Instant relief where the patch is. It was amazing, I could actually bend over...heck I could walk without the discomfort in that area. This little patch made me feel 85% better...good news it gets to stay on for three days. Better news my skin does not show signs of an infection. (Ya-hoo!, I was worried) Proceeded to get my boost done....the boost area is real close to my peeling, fried area, but clears it. After leaving the clinic I feel so good I tell my husband lets both stop at the grocery store together (original plan was for him to drop me off at home....because I did not want to even walk around the way I felt before). In the store the jell pad started to stick to my shirt and bunch up  I am so disappointed. We get home and I unstuck the patch from my shirt, but can tell that it is not going to stay on my for the whole night.... Hey I will take what ever comfort I can get, so the rest of the evening I have not moved my arm from the outside of my breast, Hoping to keep this patch in place....I do suspect that it will not last through the night as I turn over in my sleep.....oh well all is fair in a nights sleep. Tomorrow I will Jones for another patch, now that I know their secrete   (Then we can focus on under the breast). Denise",

'Well,' she said, 'I think I'll braid my hair today.' So she did and she had a wonderful day. The next day she woke up, looked in the mirror and saw that she had only two hairs on her head. 'H-M-M,' she said, 'I think I'll part my hair down the middle today.' So she did and she had a grand day. The next day she woke up, looked in the mirror and noticed that she had only one hair on her head. 'Well,' she said, 'today I'm going to wear my hair in a pony tail.' So she did, and she had a fun, fun day. The next day she woke up, looked in the mirror and noticed that there wasn't a single hair on her head. 'YAY!' she exclaimed. 'I don't have to fix my hair today!' I just love it! Now that is Attitude! Denise",

If you look, or even look up and see the refelections you can see green and red laser lights/beams that cross your body....they have to get all these lights to line up just so. I know it is scary, but we need to trust that these people are trained correctly....When I get my Radiation, there is always three persons in there. I think this is like checking with each other. I trust that now of these people will ever want to make a mistake and hurt someone...so I am sure they are very careful. I bet that the mark on your throat is just to help with lining you up. But if you are nervous and don't feel secure....then keep asking. Explain to the Techs that if they can not answer your question, \"then yes, you would like to speak to the doctor.

I got my appointments set for 4pm ( a little later then I was trying for) but on the same note, I was told I could go in a little earlier and they might be able to squeeze me in sooner as they have two machines and run appointments every 15 minutes....Today I showed up a half hour earlier and I got home 20 minutes earlier....it was worth it for me as I too hit heavy traffic and I have a 30 minute drive both ways on an easy traffic day.",

I know my WBC is low right now and I have been feeling more tired and lazy, but I did not know about the WBC until today when my regular doctor called me and told, and is having me do another blood draw....he thinks this is the results of my Staph Infection and I had just finished the Iv of Vancomycin last friday. Cupckae7- I too am getting my treatments at Kaiser Rancho Cordova....my appointment time is 4pm....when are you there? Pascal- You are right about all the different lotions...each Radiation Oncologist has their own they like to recommend...Mine likes Miaderm...$23 for a 4 oz, tube....I said what the heck and ordered three ( to get me through the 6 weeks) I figured I want to give my boob the best. I did buy Aloe Vera made by Fuirt of the Earth at Walmart for $2.49 for a 6oz. tube. Walmart also has Udderly Smooth, but I think I saw it in the pet supplies. Lories- When did your fatigue from Radiation start hitting you? I am only at 6 treatments and I know this is too early. My concern is I still want to continue to work. I work 7am -3pm, then I have my Rads appointment at 4pm....so I go straight from work to Radiation, then home. I am home by 5pm. Right now my husband is driving there and back, which is my relax time...I sound busy but I really am not. When I get home I have no demands on me....My children are young adults....the only ones I have that rely on my daily care (besides my kids at work) are my two miniature poodles. They are my \"empty nest syndrome\". My husband he takes care of me . Today at Radiation one of the techs asked me what I was doing with the rest of my evening....I told them \"I was going home to figure out dinner then I was getting on the web on breastcancer.org and I was going to talk about them\" he then asked me...\"ok, what's for dinner?\"  We laughed and I told him don't worry. Great sense of humor he has! Until Later, Denise",

I picked the Rancho Cordova site as the commute was shorter. But the Roseville site has better parking . As far as the Clinicla Trails_ I was asked before Chemo if I wanted to participate. When I was asked, I spent a week thinking it through and I really stressed over it. Let me set the stage;  After I had my lumpectomy (by DR. Bodai who I love!)...I was given two appointments first one for Oncology, then two weeks later for Radiation. I went to the Oncology appointment...together we decided yes, to do Chemo. I was also offered to do a Clinical Trail, but declined as it would mean too many days of appointments that would take me from work. (But my Chemo would be the same with or without clinical trail). Then I went to my Radiation appointment.... Well here he talked about the Clinical Trail...what it was a Whole Breast Radiation vs Part Breast radiation.....But the thing here is I did not get to choose....\"a coin would be flipped\" as the Radiologist explained....and then there would be different ways to treat me...one: Whole Breast, two: Part Breast, but being done in three different ways....one: beam of Radioactive like with Whole Breast but only hitting Part Breast (hitting area of lumpectomy site) two: would be the Mammosite...where they put a ballon inside at the site of the tumor and pass Radioactive matter to the area of where the tumor was......three: would be tubes inserted inside to the tumor area and Radioactive matter beads dropped into the tubes and go to the area of where the tumor was. I was confused and overwhelmed because at first there was a plan......Oh yeah! If I choose to participate in the Clinical Trails then I would do Radiation first and then do Chemo after. I'm a Virgo....I like knowing what is happening next...I like plans. So here I am hearing a plan from my Surgeon and the same plan from my Oncologist....then all of a sudden the plan would change if I did this Clinical Trial and I would not know how the plan would go until that coin flipped....What the Radiologist was selling to me was that the Whole Breast Radiation would be 30 treatments, BUT if I got the Part Breast Radiation then it would be only for 5 days. Well Why I was thinking it through, it came to me what my Surgeon had said before surgery...That if I did a lumpectomy then I would \"need to do Rdiation so that way any hidden or messed cancer cells will be gotten.\" So I called my Surgeon and asked his opinion....He said \"do whole breast\". I told him that I could not repeat word for word what he said, but the message I got from him was....the part of WBR getting messed or hidden cells...and he said \"that is exactly right...do WBR\" So I went with what my Surgeon said....Something that I found out later that the Radiologist did not tell me.....if you are going to do the mammosite or the one with tubes....it is best to know this before your lumpectomy is performed so they may insert the materials need at that time....you run a chance of infections if they have to enter these in later. For me I am happy with my decision.",

Everytime I have gone in there all the Techs have been very nice...actually really sweet. Both women and men. Today I had a couple of the same Techs and then there was another man I have not seen before.... When I go in they have me sit on the table and undo my gown. I have large breast so they have me put a net around my breast to hold them in place ( or I say so they won't flop off the side of the table...LOL!) Each time a Tech will hepl with this...as I pull the front in place, the tech pulls the back in place...again this happened today....they they help me get in positon. When the process is over the Techs come back in.....move the table and one of the Techs (man or Woman) always puts their arm out and helps you sit up. Well today I had trouble lining up on the table.....I needed to scoot up higher...so we did this. (This happened once before, no big deal) Afterwards the one male Tech I never meet before came in and said here let me show you where to sit and line up at....at this point I reached for his hand ( just like the ohters have done on their own) and he said \"Oh, just grab the sides of the table\"....This bothered me as it made me feel wierd, like he didn't want to touch me. Yes I am overweight, and my boobs are out there exposed for everone...so I already feel kind of ugly....I'm showing parts of me to strangers that I already hide from everyone else (even myself at times).....then to have this man respond this way made me feel bad. It's not really a big thing YET. After I sat up (on my own) this Tech pulled the sheet down and showed me the bare table and where I should position my bottom for tomorrow.....when he did this I looked at him and smiled and I said \"Thankyou...I figure this is only my third time and I have 3 0 sessions so I have a lot of time to practice'.....AThere was another male Tech in there and he has been there each time...I looked at him and smiled and winked at him. Above I said this is not a \"big thing yet\"....it is really not a big thing, but I have decided that I will not allow anybody make me feel awful doing this....So if this man is there and again and in anyway makes me feel uncomfortable.....I will voice my opinion....to his supervisor. Please understand I do not look for trouble, but I have gotten to where I am speaking up more.....yet I am a very patient and understanding. So how was your Rad session? Onehalf/Denise",

Some of you have given me other thoughts as to why the Tech responded the way he did while I was getting up off the table. I never thought that maybe he had a condition.....yet I'm betting on he might just be a jerk...LOL, LOL! Seriously.....As I have encounter this whole new hobby of mine, Breast Cancer. I have had to expose myself to many different people. Each person has treated me with care and dignity. The thing with the Radiation treatment....I have had 6 different Techs work with me, from setting everything up to the daily treatment....They all have offered their arms to help you up on the table...At first it was weird for me when the first Tech did this....but I've learned to accept...part of me being polite and not refusing help when offered...the other is that table is what 12 inches wide and it is a little weird sitting up when you don't know how close to the edge you are. I just thought this man's response was not like his co-workers....When I reached up he said \"oh, no grab the edge of the table\" I was ok with it as I can do this myself, but then I don't know it was the way he kept speaking....something in his voice....then I got to thinking about how ALL the other Techs have treated me.... I will wait and see, and keep in mind all the other points that have been mentioned above. About gowns....We get to pick the size of gown we get to wear...except there are two sizes...super small and huge.....I pick the huge! It will wrap around to my front....So since I only wait for maybe one minute I don't even tie the back...I just wrap it around and hold it in front. We do get to leave on our lower garments, only taking off the bra and shirt...this is nice. The whole set up is cool....You walk in, type your name in a computer...go to the dressing room area, pick your gown, change then enter a small waiting area...then the Tech comes and gets you and off you walk to the Radiation room. There are small lockers for you to store your clothing and personal belongings into. The whole place is relaxing and comfortable. Well it's time for me to get ready for my new daily activity...treatment # 4.....Later, Denise",

Under my arm pit and the top of my breast (close by under the arm ) are not happy....the area is brownish and a couple spots are peeling. Each day I see the techs and I have had the skin nurse look at me and they all say I look good...I have \"no skin breakage\" what the!....what do you call peeling....I guess they mean that I have no blisters and no fluid coming from my most tender and sensitive areas. I have been using the cream they recommend and yet I get little comfort. It actually hurts to take a shower...I can not let the shower head spray on that area...I have to get a cup of water and pour it on. Right now the cream they have recommended and Aloe Vera, cause a little stinging affect when I put it on....Does anybody else with peeling experience this? I took Friday off from work because I was uncomfortable and I have just called in for tomorrow (Monday). I don't know I am large breasted....my skin type, I have never had any issues with my skin, in fact I have always tanned and never burned. I don't experience dryness of the skin. I heal quickly. I did read somewhere that women with large breast and women that have recently had Chemo will experience peeling and the skin changes I now have....But nothing says about experiencing the discomfort I now have...it just feels RAW and everytime I move I hurt. All I have done all weekend is to sit and I have my arm propped up to allow air under my arm....this is helping some. I have lost the whole weekend as I have not even gotten dressed, I wear a armless nightgown....and my arm is constantly extended as not to cause rubbing and to allow air to keep the area dry. Tomorrow my plan is to call the Radiation department and tell them what I am experiencing...I am also going to tell them I need something more then \"it looks good, and keep the area open to the air\". I am bummed as I went through Chemo so easily, starting Radiation was no problem....I believe everything was explained to me, but I did not realize I could come to a stage of where I felt like I did not want to move. When I did Chemo I was able to continue to go to work, now at the end of my Radiation I have taken two days off of work. I don't mean to scare anybody who's treatment is behind mine....Keep in mind we all react to our treatments differently....I guess for me this is going to be my tough area. I guess I am just disappointed right now...Not disappointed in my treatment or myself....just disappointed that I have to experience this. Hear I am always saying 'healing begins in the mind\"....well mind start healing under my arm! I'm realistic....I know I am healing even thou I'm uncomfortable.....I started healing the day I decided to be active with my doctors and treat my Breast Cancer. I started healing the day I had an lumpectomy. I sarted healing the day I started Chemo, and the days I continued to go back. I started healing, the day I put a scarf over my head to cover that bald head. I started healing, when I began Radiation, and I am healing each day I go back when I really don't want to. Most important...... I heal each day I wake up! (Thanks for allowing me to vent,) Onehalf/Denise",

I think it is an adjustment from having so many Doctors appointments, then all of sudden nothing. In the back of my head the feeling of \"is the cancer really gone\" is there. Then to make matters worse, when someone inquires about my condition....when I tell them I'm done with Chemo and Radiation, then automatically will respond then that means you have no more cancer.... I don't know how to respond....I want to say yes, but do I really know.... Since I ended Chemo I have only had one follow up appointment. She checked my blood work and viewed the charts....I asked her about a Mammogram, she said in August...that will be a year from when I was first detected with breast cancer. When I looked at her (like why so long?) She said \"trust me your breast does not want to go through a Mammogram right now\". Which was true I was at that turning stage with Radiation where you were \"feeling it\". Then when Radiation ended I was not given any information for a follow up appointment or anything else...so I called and left a message with the doctor....I was told he would have a follow up with me in two months. I don't know is this the way all others ended their appointments.....I had expected more information from the doctors....am I expecting too much. So did the Chemo and Radiation do their job? How can one tell? What information do others get from their doctors....So this feeling of being lost is partly from the way everything ended...It's kindof scary to have this cancer beast in you....being proactive in treatments then all of a sudden everything ends. I guess I would feel better if there was an x-ray, mammogram, something that I can be shown. I guess it's all about adjustments..... as for crying no I'm nit doing that....sleepless nights, yes I have a few, and I do not know why. I keep reminding myself to just take this one day at a time.

I had a lumpectomy on September 30, 2008...And I just finished up on January 7, 2009 with four treatments of Chemo (Taxotere and Cytoxan). I did my simulation for Radiation on February 11th, and boy o' boy!, when I was done I was not really looking forward to going back to do Radiation....Up to this point I was excited and wanted to get it going, because I wanted to put this everyday for 6 weeks behind me. But when I did the simulation....my goodness....I had to lay on the x-ray table (which wasn't too bad ) but then I had my arms up behind my head, fully extended for 45 minutes....My left arm was ok, but my right arm and shoulder was not happy....my right shoulder hurt and it felt like it was going to lock in place. At one time I finally told the techs. that \"my arm was hurting and could I please put it down just for a few seconds\"....the tech, said \"no, hold on just a little longer\"....well I'll tell you I am thinking in my head \"you bit#4!\" but I did noticed the two techs actually walking real fast back and fourth. After a few minutes they said \"Ok, we can let you rest your arms now\" ...and the one tech that told me \"no\" earlier actually massaged my shoulder. Then it was time to do it again.....but this time it was only about 20 minutes. When I got home I took a heavy dose of Mortrin. I felt like I did not want to go back the next day..... I did go back....After I removed my top clothing, I was taken to the X-RAY room. Laid on the table, put my arms back....the techs called out numbers back and fourth...moved me, moved the table, then said \"lets do it\" They left the room.....Radiation took place, All of under 2 minutes.... I was in there undressed, radiated, dressed and on my way out the front door in 15 minutes. Maybe I can do this! I have had only two treatments and I will not go back until Tuesday (Monday being Presidents Day). Onehalf/Denise",

      "Content": "Feb 28, 2009 01:32AM - edited Feb 28, 2009 01:42AM by Onehalf Boy! just as I am beginning to get to know some of the women on this forum, they are already done with their Radiation treatments....congrats to those who are finished, and good luck to new beginnings for you. I do hope you decide to hang around and continue to give us advice. Today was treatment number 11 for me. I had seen my Radiation Oncologist on Wednesday, everything is looking good, except my blood pressure was very high....But we figured it was because I took Sudafed 2 hours before I seen him....so no more Sudafed. My cold has tapered down a lot. So I don't need to worry about medication. As far as my breast ( or should I say Boob)...my nipple is a little tender. The skin under my arm has changed colors a little....looking more tanned. Up front I am beginning to show a little pink. Rad Onc. says I will see a difference next week Ididn't ask, but should I be worried! The Tech team I see is real nice....even the gentleman I spoke about before, that doesn't offer to help you up....he is nice, so maybe it's like you guys pointed out before, maybe he has a physical condition that won't allow him to help, or he is protecting his back....either way his personality more then makes up for his lack of help...I've also noticed that the other techs are quickly there to offer help, so maybe there is something. All the Techs have a friendly, funny personality....they sure make the 30 minute drive worth it. What Mary5454 mention before about being done with this...I sure understand the feelings. After doing four treatments of Chemo, I felt a little lost...kind of \"what now\" but then I knew Radiation was coming...6 weeks worth. I am afraid of when this is done....parts of me wants to be done, so I can get on with life, other parts are afraid...I feel while doing Chemo and Radiation something is being done about the cancer...then when it stops I have no safety net....will I be protected is my feelings. Will I be safe if nothing is being done....kind of like the Chemo and Radiation is my guardian keeping me safe. I wasn't scared going into the treatments, but I'm scared going out. Oh well I guess it's all about adjustments....I'll adjust. I do have an appointment with my Oncologist on March 5th. Maybe she will shed some light on this weening process. Regarding fatigue....OMG! Have I been taking the naps....Once I get home from work and Radiation...thats all I do is nap. Nap, Nap,Nap,....finally today Friday I feel better, but I still did take a short nap. I don't know if I am this way because the cold I have had, Radiation or both...I guess only time will tell. Chemo....looking back that seemed so long ago, and now it seems to have gone by quickly ( I did Chemo from Nov-Jan, only four treatments every three weeks) Maybe in five years I will be able to say...Breast Cancer...that seemed so long ago an seemed to go by quickly....as I will still be Breast Cancer free. Until Monday when I go back to the \"tanning booth\". Later, Onehalf/Denise",

Then above my head is a bar for me to hold onto. If the tech weren't so nice then this would be an embarrassing position.My husband and I joke about this all the time. In this position my right arm is not comfortable, but I can deal with it because the whole procedure is only minutes. The whole process of setting me up only takes about 5-7 minutes....In fact I am undressed, radiation, dressed and out the door within 15-20 minutes and that also includes a bathroom trip. The actual time of the radiation is very short...It's funny that you mentioned this because today I actually counted...1, one,thousand, 2 one thousand....and I counted to 10. The drive to there and the changing into the gown are all longer times then the actual radiation. Today was my 13th day of radiation.....and today is the day that I feel the most uncomfortable....before this my nipple was a little tender, but now after today I have a area under my arm pit and by the top of my breast that is sensitive....kind of feels that it has been rubbed too much. I think tomorrow I will do as one suggestion and wear a sleeveless tee under my bra....I just don't want to cause any excessive rubbing and cause any skin breakage. Other then that I have a little pink to my skin, but under my arm, in the arm pit area I look more tanned. This is 13 out of 30....and I was feeling...hmmmm this isn't so bad. Now today I feel hmmmmm...hope I can make it with no problems. Well tomorrow day 14 in the tanning booth, and I will also see my doctor after the treatment. Until later, wish you all the best, Onehalf/Denise",

Why  he was gone the techs asked me each day how I was doing and did I have question or need to see the doctor....so I felt I was well taken care of. About the x-rays once a week, I like the idea. I feel like they are keeping track of the progress as we go, not after the fact. The x-rays only may take 5 more minutes, but this is ok as I am already on the table and in position. Mandy1313- I had a lumpectomy and I am having 30 treatments of Radiation with the last 7 being boost. That is kind of exciting that you can pick the number of boost you will get....but at the same time I want what is best for me. So if given the choice I might be asking the Doctor pros and cons on the numbers of boost. But then again I am not in your shoes....so it's easy to say what I would do. I also heard that the boost are nice to have has it hits a different area then what you have been getting. One of my Techs explained that \"the boost focus on only the area of where the tumor was\", then she continued to say \"by then your breast is happy with this as it gives the other areas a rest.\" At first I was nevrous  when I heard about boost, because I did not understand.....now since I have a small area that just started feeling like a \"rug burn\" I think I am looking forward to the boost.....in fact I wish they could do it in the middle of the treatments. Today I asked my Techs about my skin and how many treatments I have had, and they said I look really good.This made me feel better.....Tomorrow is my Doctor day. Jane_M- I need to look at TLC's website.....although t-shirt under bra still might be the best for me.....I have LARGE breast....I'll check it out....As Lories pointed out...trial and error ....Important thing is I can't let these puppies flop around at work While on the subject of boobs/breast.....Anybody know why god did not give men boobs?

My skin in a couple areas feel like a rug burn and the skin is dark brown/reddish. Other areas of the breast is a pink color. The area that is dark brown feels like a rug burn and is very sensitive.....so as not to cause any furture problems or discomfort. I have been wearing a shirt under my bra, as to keep from any rubbing happening. At first I used a sleeveless tank shirt I have at home....this was working, except I had to keep adjusting to keep the arm pit covered. In this area, under the arm and by the top of the breast is my most sensitive spot. Welp, I spent all day shopping looking for the right kind of garment I could wear under my bra....What I kept finding was womens t's or shirts that where either too heavy, or had too much fancy lace that would cause rubbing. The light shirts were again tanks shirts or cami's with no coverage where I would need it. Well at Walmart I found Mens V-neck t-shirts, by Hanes. It is perfect! There are 3 in a package, there is no lable on the neck of the shirt, it advertises on the package super soft  (which it is). Also the t-shirt is very light weight, So it is not too hot to wear t-shirt, bra, then my regular top or blouse....The best part....all this for under $7.00 (for three)! Denise/Onehalf",

I'll be honest when I woke up this morning, I thought to myself....I just want to be done with this, I do not want to continue.....but then I quickly thought about all I've gone through.....from the beginning to now....biopsy,lumpectomy,chemo and now radiation....why would I want to stop now. I knew this would be a long haul, and I knew there would be down moments....I just need to face this beast and continue on..... I read on here a post by another about %'s and 40% chance of no recurrence by having radiation as a follow up treatment after having an lumpectomy.....This information reminded me why I'm doing this. Ok.....today was not a good day, but now I have tomorrow! I need to remind myself that healing begins in the mind.....guess I better go rest my mind so I can be stronger....

I have not seen what you have described, but I myself have taken extra time in the bathroom....I leave work and drive straight to my appointment....so when I change into my gown to prepare for my treatment I like to \"freshen up\" Especially under the arm that is going to be treated, making sure no lotion is there.....well the nurses have instructed us to go in the bathroom and use the paper towels and clear water. So this is what all of us do. The other day the womens bathroom in the changing area was being used longer then I wanted to wait, So I went to the Mens changing room and used the bathroom there. There is privacy for all....I even seen one of the female staff walk out of the mens bathroom before.....Sounds like you do have an idiot working there.....lets hope she will never have to experience the tanning session we get. Seabee- You are describing where I was at a week ago. The peeling was not bad, but then when it gets raw....ouch, but don't be concerned it will turn around....with a little help from your friends at Radiation Oncology. Something I forgot about...Radiation will cause internal heat....so even thou I spent the time to let air hit under my breast and create a dry environment....as soon as skin comes in contact with skin...it heats up. One of the girls that I seen at radiation....her breast is so hot to the touch...no kidding they put the gel patch on her because of the heat. She says she feels like she is having hot flashes. The ointment and pads under the breast is what I am doing now...but they are using the gel pads and the wrap gauze around me to hold it in place.....in fact because of the axilla area and under the breast my skin nurse has created a method of just binding me with a sheet after I get my treatment...first she puts on these gel pads, then gauze to hold them in place, then the sheet....Sounds strange but it is working and I am much more comfortable.....Plus I don't have the worry of going without a bra (which they want at this stage) Unique- Seen the Doc today....he really does not want to do a break at this point....He said he would if needed, but would rather not....then he went to explaining about Radiation....and we are really better off having treatments with no breaks.... I am still getting the gel patch, but the nurse has made sure they stay in place. You are right about propping up and holding that patch in place....thats almost what I did....except I was able to lay on the side of my treated breast and my arm and body held the patch in place all night....next day I walked with my arm against my body holding it in place....like a bird with a broken wing. Skin damage under the arm pit I am not worried about....I have a 12 inch scar from that area down the side of my breast from my lumpectomy.....so I am already going to have some signs of  \"work\" being done on my body....besides my days of showing off that area outside of my bedroom are over. My biggest worry at the moment is what will take place in the two weeks after my last treatment...I am told that we will still have skin changes and side effects two weeks after our last treatment....And since lady luck is on my side...NOT!...I am getting my boost right now, but it turns out my boost field runs across the area in my axilla that I am suffering most with the raw skin....so my worry is what will happen when I no longer have treatments....I asked the Doc..\"will they give me the supplies I need so I can treat the skin at home...or what will happen?\" He said he can do that or I can come in and have the nurse take care of it....Ya-Hoo! I was relieved, I thought when I was done I would be dropped like a hot potato....So my 6 week drive 45 minutes each way, might become a few more weeks.....At  this point I don't care....as all I want to do is to continue to feel good. And knowing that I can go in after my treatment is done for skin care makes everything seem to be falling in place.....maybe ther is an end after all..LOL! Tomorrow another day at the tanning booth... Later, Denise",

On Monday I stayed home because I still had the fever and chills, and I was super sleppy....no energy....I also put a call into my Radiologist, because I did not know if they wanted to see me if i was sick,,,,I left a message, Then soon after my primary doctor called and wanted to see me right away...... I went in......I have a skin infection. I had to PICC Line in and I will now get antibiotic through IV for a week. I have missed Monday from Radiation because Dr. appointments and getting a Picc Line. Today I missed Radiation because of follow up appointments regarding my Picc Line and medication. Tomorrow I resume ging back to Radiation. I am a little upset because last Thursday...I had a slight order coming from one of my \"owie\" areas and I asked about it, The nurse said it was normal...It was part of the process of the skin healing.... This odor is the same odor I had when I went to my priamry care doctor on Monday, except it was much stronger. I'm bothered by this because I don't think action was taken soon enough, and I feel that the way I was covered with the dressings from the skin care personnel may of added to this infection happening. But at the same time I am not going to look to blame any person/persons....Once again I have learned through this experience.....And now I am a little more wiser.... I do believe that nobody had intents of this happening. Friday I will be in charge on my dressings for the weekend.  Actuall Chemo was much easier for me.  Oh well.......Like I said before So close and yet so far.

You might want to mentally prepare yourself for both Chemo and Radiation.....this way you will not be shocked...and if you don't have to do one or both, then it will be a present surprise....I tried to think on the practical side then I'm prepared. About notifying the Parents, I think just one letter and photo copy is good...I favored putting it in their Parent file at the school....It gave each Parent a chance to express their feeling to you.(only if they wanted, which they all did) E-mail can be tricky...you will have to make sure you have everyones e-mail, then your not sure if they check it. When I put the letter out, I had so many parents talk to me. It gave them a chance to express their hidden fears...One parent even asked me if I plan on going into early retirement....I laughed and told her \"no way\"...You should of seen the relief on her face. A suggestion when you talk to your boss....I would let them know that you really need to work to keep you strong (sane ) this seemed to carry a lot of weight with my director...which was the truth. And let them know that you will keep them on any updated information as you get it. One thing my director helped me with....she explained to me that my Boss likes a plan of action....So together we made a plan....who would lead the classroom why I was gone....which asst. would be in charge....who would do circle, who would buy snack...( I get a classroom budget to buy snack and extra things I need). They wanted to make sure that I had open communiction with my asst. Doing this made my boss happy which meant less pressure on me. My director is a good leader and understanding. Very helpful. My lumpectomy, I was scheduled to be off of work for two weeks, I was back to work after one week and one day. I heal fast and had no pain ( a little soreness) But I was not allowed to pick up any children or heavy thing for about 5 weeks. Best of luck and keep positive,....if you have a positive out look so will others and that is much needed to keep your Boss/Director feeling that they can rely on you. Remember healing begins in the mind first. Denise",

But I got to tell you, with the no hair I am wrapping a scarf around my neck to take the children outside as I do get cold now.

Just to get the kids used to the idea that I will have something on my head. I only did this because I never ever wore anything on my head to work. I did not even wear scarves around my neck in cold weather months....Wow! What a change to now! Anyways I was not going to say anything to the children, but then I was stressing about what to wear to school. I could not find a wig comfortable for all day wear, and besides they just didn't look like me. So the weeek my hair began to fall out I decided to tell the children.... First I asked several parents if they would mind...I told them I would keep it very simple. Parents thought it was a good idea. I only told the children I had a \"sickness\", then we talked about all kinds of sicknesses....children talking about the common cold. one child said he couldn't go outside when he had a cold, another then chimmed in, that his mommy said he had to stay upstairs in bed until his cold was gone....with this I said see when we have a sickness there are different ways our body feels and different ways we take care of it.....then I told them for me because of my sickness, for my body to take care of it self I will lose my hair for a little while, but then it would grow back. I explained to the children that every part of the body has a job...eyes for seeing, nose for smelling...etc.. and the hair keeps the body warm,....but because I would not have hair I would need to wear hats, scarves, and wigs....they laughed at wigs....one child asked if I would wear a blue wig. Anyways I felt soooo much more relaxed. I have been wearing a couple \"kercheif\" scarves (they are made for Chemo patients, and the back has a closed area to hide balding). I have also worn scarves on my head (as I got all those from the children and parents) I had to learn how to tie these, which I only use one style that is easy. I did purchase a under the scarf cap...much better fit and keeps your head warm. I have only worn a cap with a wig attached to it for about a week to school (in the beginning) and did not feel comfortable in the fit...so it is just sitting to the side with my $200.00 wig. But you know I might of wasted money in the beginning, but it brought me security in the beginning having something ready to go.....At that time I just did not know what I wanted to do. The scarves I wear....does show a bare neck, but I now don't care....and the children they don't care....once in a while one will ask to see my \"no hair\"...so I will show them my side burns area. One thing is I never gave the children the name of \"my sickness\" and I never did tell them that I would lose my hair because of medicine (chemo) I thought this information would confuse them and I don't want them to be afraid of taking medicine. I feel any other information should come from their parents....whats funny is the parents have reported their children have said nothing....the kids accept us as we are. Comfort is for the adults. My sugesstions is tell them little as you can, but enough for them to know that you will look different....as far as explaining over and over again. You may find you won't....I would only explain it once then answer only the ones that ask the questions. This is just like any other lesson with the children....they will guide you and you will soon discover that they have no worries, it's only us. I love your duck story...it is so cute....sounds like the little guy that shared the duck with you is very bright and noticable Once you discover what you are comfortable wearing to school then you'll relax. As I said before I never wore scarves in the cold weather....now I have to have one all the time as my neck really gets cold when we are outside palying on the yard, but that's ok cause now I feel like one of the other girls....they all wear scarves for warmth and style. Sad news thou....As I am going through this, one of the teacher in the other preschool class ( we have two classes) has just found out she has breast cancer....now that is two of us at the same center....16 women employed.....they say 1 in every 8 woman will get breast cancer....Wow! Best of luck and don't worry.....take it one day at a time, you'll do fine!    Denise",

My treatment is Taxotere and Cytoxan every 3 week for 4 treatments then radiation for 6 weeks (whole breast radiation). When I first found out...I naturally told work....then I wrote a personal letter to my classroom Parents. I did this for two reasons...One). I wanted them to know I would be gone for two weeks (lumpectomy surgery) and to let them know my plans. Even thou I have good support from my director and boss. I'm realistic....I know if you can not be there then they need to find someone to fill the shoes why you are away....So the second reason of my letter....sssssh!  Job security...I felt if I got the parents involved they would support me and the \"office\" personal will of course back me up because thats what the \"parents\" also want. As for the children in my class (ages 2.5 to 6 years old) they are too young to really understand or needing to know all the information. I had planned on not telling them anything, but just recently changed my mind. My first treatment was Nov.5th and my hair just started to fall out on Monday the 17th, I had big plans of trying to hide any baldness and to look as normal as I can....Well I have been carrying so much stress about this...So I talked to a few of my parents,.....and this last Friday (Nov.23) I talked to the children....I explained that \"I had a sickness and this sickness was going to have my hair to come out....BUT it would grow back.\"... We talked about all kinds of sickness.....one child told of a freind that died at the age of four. I also discussed how parts of our body has special jobs....then I focused how the hair keeps the heat in our body and since I will have no hair then I will need to wear caps/hats, scarves and wigs to school to keep the body heat in. They laughed when I said wig....one child asked me if I will wear a blue one to school.  Whew! I feel sooooo much better now. Now I can even play with my new look.... Saturday morning I had to shave my hair....my head is now bald as it was coming out by the handfuls. But you know I did not even cry as I already knew this would be happening, but like I said the stress of hiding from the children is gone. Tomorrow (Monday) I will go to work wearing my first wig under a cap....I have already been wearing a cap for the last two weeks as I have been preparing the children that I will be wearing something on my head. I never wore anything before....maybe I was also preparing myself. Something I need to point out....in dealing with children I will not tell them the real truth that I am losing my hair because of a medicine I'm taking...I think this is too much for them to really grasp. Besides I have joked with the parents...if I tell them that then the parents could not even give them cough syrup.....I have a vision of a parent trying to give a cough syrup and the child covering their mouth saying \"No!, I don't want to lose my hair like Denise!\" LOL! Germs....just do your good hand washing and turn your head away if a child sneezes or coughs. This is also said by my oncologist....Hint- I also keep a small bottle of Purell and Sanitizer in my pocket and I just use it when ever the need strikes. Ladyjane54 Best of luck to you, don't stress about the days of work you will have to miss. You will need to take care of yourself first. Then work...I will tell you I have only had one treatment...I only missed the day of the treatment, then one day the next week due to the side effects of diarreah. The next treatment I have scheduled on Wednesday in the afternoon, so I will only miss two hours of work....then feel good for Thursday and Friday and have the weeekend to rest. This is what happened last time....although I get to cheat this time...Thanksgiving, so I get four days at home. Take Care, Denise",

But leave your check book at home....go before you begin your treatment, but after you find out what your treatment is ( if you will lose hair or not). This way you will prepare yourself about the workings of the shops and what they offers.  I Have a nice wig...I bought ahead of time....but I will not wear it to work...Too hot and too much moving around I will need to do. But I bought it right after my first treatment ( I had it on hold) this gave me security of having something to fall on and be ready. I will use this wig, at home base. I did also get a hair attachemnt that will velcro in caps.And I just ordered hair halo's from tlc. I think these will work the best at work....I can wear caps. scarves and what ever with these. For fun I ordered a curly and straight halo's. Did I mention that the American Cancer Society has a free class called \"Feel Good, Feel Better\".This class will teach you about wigs( and have free wig for ones who want or need) they also teach you how to wear hats and scarves. And how to apply makeup (and you get a free kit). I have a 2hr. class on Dec. 10th. If you need I phone number I have an 800 number. Appointments....Calendar on the fridge has become very important. My biggest adjustment has been....with my Chemo I have to start an anti-nausea med. the day before Chemo (2 pills 2X a day for 3 days) then the next day One hour before Chemo I have to start another pill (2x a day for three days) then....I have another anti-nausea pill for in-between those pills for every 6 hours as needed (which I have only used once)...All this was very confusing, and still is....So to help I put on the each bottle A, B, C (starting with the first day pill. I take the pills as they have requested. I have not had nausea problems, probably due to the fact I follow their instructions. Best of luck, Denise",

Hair falling out they said about....7-14 days, but I do believe I went to my second treatment with my own hair. Mine started on a Monday which was 19 days later.....by that Friday I did not  shower because I knew a lot of hair would come out and I wanted to wait and deal with it on the weekend when I would have the time to be alone.....Saturday, yep had to shave it as the hair was coming out in globs. I have heard the description of hair coming out in chuncks.....I thought that meant that a whole  hairpatch in one area would come out....that is not the way it happened for me.... I would just comb my hair and my comb would be full with hair...but it was from all over. The upside....I still have eyebrows and top eyelashes (bottoms have thinned a lot). And I have my fourth and last treatment next week (Jan 7th) . But I have heard where others start losing the eyebrows even after last treatment (Bummer!) You will be stressing now and until the hair comes out....All you can think about is losing your hair, but then once that time comes and it finally happens you will be so much more relaxed. I was so relieved when I finally had to shave my head. I know it's strange....but it's something that you know has to happen(and you don't want it to happen) and you keep waiting....then finally the time comes...whew! I actually enjoy my showers a little more....LOL! I can't believe how much faster my showers are. I still shampoo my head though ( I actually never did lose all my hair, I have always had fuzz on top, that is growing) Drying off is so much easier....I no longer have to wrap a towel around my head....and we now know the hair left in the drain IS my husbands.....LOL! best of luck, Denise",

I told them my doctor said I had a high precentage of full recovery.

I then talked about how important it was for me to return to their children, because their children gave me strength. I explained that I would not discuss with the children about this and I invited all the parents to choose what they felt their child needed to know...I would only answer the question the child asked. (Which I did change my mind and told the children I had a sickness and I would lose my hair....doing this relieved a lot of stress...and I had not only parent support but encouragement...I only discussed this with the children a couple days before my hair came out) In my letter I ended it with a little humor...I told the parents that the area that bothered me most was losing my hair...then I told them that if they see a beautiful red hair or blond in the class (I'm med. brown) Not to worry it was only me in a wig....I got so many suggestions for wig or hair looks...which was ok...it did get tiresome...but I smiled and thanked all as this si how parents felt they could show support and help. There was a couple good suggestions. Be warned when you tell your parents...you will get a lot of \"when my Mom. or aunt or....had cancer..\" Again I smiled and gave my thanks or the \"Really!?\" remarks. As usual this post is long....I hope the info helps  Edit- Sorry about all the mis-spelling....tonight I had to take my anti-naseus meds for Chemo tomorrow and the med wires me up....and I don't want ot take the time to correct.

I would like to wear other type of scarves to work, but all I have right now is the long rectangle scarves ( the type more used for fashion in tying around the neck) Does anybody know of how to wear these types of scarves on the head? Or where to get information on how to wear a scarf. I already have the ACS Look Good, Feel Better book. I went to the class, which was a good class, but felt that most of the time was spent on makeup. This was fine as they gave us a kit with \"$350.00 worth of makeup in the kit\".  I do wish there was more information on scarf tying in class, but I understand as the class was already 2 hours long. So any advice on wearing scarves on the head I would be happy in hearing. Denise/Onehalf",

I have worked with children in the age range of 2.5-6 years (Montessori program). I have not missed much work or had any problems. On Chemo days I have scheduled my \"chair time\" as late as I can get them, so around 3pm is what my appointments have been. (I work 7am-3pm) On Chemo days I have just left work a little earlier. With the the Side Effects....for me have not been too bad. The first two treatments I did miss only one day of work due to some diarreah. But that has been it. Working with those kids do keep you going! I do not think I could of been as strong or had the energy if I was forced to stay home.....I think self pity would of set in, along with boring! Being sick and catching everything that goes around!  Nope!, none of that either. In fact I have been the healthy one. All I do is wash my hands and turn my head away from someone who sneezes. Of course I have done this job for 20 years so maybe I have built up a protective cloud to ward off sicknesses around me. Keep in mind that all the Chemo cocktails and everyone reacts different. My oncologist said my cocktail was doable to keep working. So I do suggest you talk to your oncologist about the being able to continue to work.

I have learned that being on this web site....Ihave gotten A LOT of useful information. Today I had a \"Chemo Class\" which was very interesting.... a lot of what I have learned from here was confirmed, and there was a couple things that I had asked and the response\"s were Hum, we have heard of something like that, but have no experience or data....As anything else in life...as I educated myself I need to balance the pros and cons. Another interesting fact of information....The difference in opinion of losing hair, when and if so from the medical profession. Something I'm naturally concerned about, but have come to terms of accepting it....doesn't matter if I don't accept it....it's going to happen anyways....So I have made plans already for a wig to get me through the beginning stages of hair loss. Any ways Oncologist and Chemo nurses have all offered their opinions about my treatment and when (or if ) I will lose my hair...Kindof dfunny since I did not ask, but they offer because this is probably the number one concern. Oncologist says...\"you will lose your hair\"  First Chemo nurse says...\"You will lose the hair in 7-14 days...Second Chemo nurse says' You probably may not lose your hair, you may just have thinning but that won't happen for 6 weeks\" So what is it....I think I might start a betting sheet.....and the winner gets to give me a buzz or a new hair style!!!!. I'm betting that I may have to go with my original plan and serve Ham at Thanksgiving so the family won't get me mixed up with the turkey.  So to here's  (wine class clicking) a toast to a new road ahead..... Denise ****Time for another pill (and it's bed time) Breast Cancer is not a death sentence, just another path in life.

First of all I need to explain my sign on name \"Onehalf\" No the name is not my Breast Cancer treatment....I had a lumpectomy LOL!. The name is related to my last name. I am so happy to see ladies on here from the years 2005,6,7 ...I was dealing with my Breast Cancer last September in 2008. Just recently had an Oncology check up, mammogram and even a pap smear....Everything is CLEAR in case you couldn't hear I was singing the word clear. When I got the little postcard in the mail ( Kaiser method ) to tell me my mammogram was clear, well I have it up ready to be framed and I have decide that I will frame each year that comes in.  And yes I am finding out there is life after Breast Cancer.  Here last year at this time the only vision I had im my head was my breast....now I only think of it when I run into something that reminds me.....Like something on the television, hearing of someone else who is going through this experience, and just recentily when I was decorating my Christmas Tree, a friend reminded me that she had helped me put the tree trimmings away last year, as I just had chemo and did not feel like dealing with anything....boy did the memories come flooding back. It is good to forget and go on, but still having something like Breast Cancer will always be a part of me, something I will always hold on to, something that even though it meant taking a part of my life, it also gave to me..... To me I have learned to look at life differently. Not taking family and friends for granted. Learning to let \"stuff\" just roll, And most important, learning to love myself Cheers to all....for new beginnings, each day is a new beginning to us all! Denise (Onehalf)",

Misty1- I am so postitive about this but I do look forward to being able to say...yeah! I'm done. And I keep telling myself heys it's only a few months (then radiation, and yet that is just another 6 weeks) All this is better then what I could of had...no time! But medical science is giving me a chance to add more time to my life. I am pleased with this. Gramadeb- I love the word \"doable\" I so hope I can be like you....My main goal is to take care of myself and going to work....I need to work....mostly for mental, but also for job security. But my health does come first I will not allow my self to become sick because of a job.* See my note at the end about my treatment today ilovemykids-You know I will take your advice about not shaving too quickly...If I could wear hats and scraves to hide thinning and have my own hair below that will make me happy.  I have read some of your other post and I know you were having some harder time in the beginning. If I may be so bold as to say part of a problem for you could of been some guilt...Your sign on name say's so much to me. Not only are you dealing with having breast cancer, but you are also doing it at a time in your life when you have children at home. This could be really hard. I have two childern but they are young adults...age 23 and 27. The 23 year old lives at home right now, but helps out a lot. Ilovemykids...you sound different in your reply...you sound more at peace. You sound stronger...you go girl! Ok for all... Today my treatment- I breezed through my first treatment...no allergic reaction, no side effects...I did follow directions for anti nausea and I will continue even if I do not need it. I am pleased that the first chair time went easy...but I do understand that does not mean smooth sailing all the way through (But I am hoping this could be the foundation of my treatments) Something I learned from this site....medication and WBC. I do have a doctor that will wait till my blood work comes back and will decide if I need the medicine. I like not having it given to me before radition...I am not looking forward to bone aches. The anti-nausea medicine does make me wired up...More alert...Last night I MAYBE  got one hour of sleep....and haven't slept yet. It is just after 8pm here. So I now have an side effect medicine to treat the side effect for the side effect medicine from the Chemo...LOL, LOL!  I am taking the anti-nausea med because of the side effects from Chemo, and yet I need to take a sleeping pill, because of the side effect from the anti-nausea meds. Oh well! Question for all.....Does anyone have information in \"ice mittens\"? Do you believe in this? I asked about this at the Chemo Class they did not really support the idea, but yet my husband seen two people in chairs with mittens on. Whats is the purpose of ice mittens? What is your ideas? Thank You, Denise",

My PT was not in dealing with Cancer....it was after a wrist surgery and years later knee injury. But I fully agree with you.....To sit you in front a video and feel that their job is done is WRONG! I think you need to follow this through. Just recently I did have a Chemo class for my Breast Cancer....The Chemo class did only have two patients in there ( one being me) We were told that we were lucky because usually there are more patients in a class and we would not get so much one on one....wrong again! I don't care how many people are in there if I have a question about my health I will ask. I suggest you go to the memeber service and file a concern/complaint....this is the only way to make changes and really be heard with a follow up. On a good note, I have been pleased with Kaiser, A little overwhelmed with their asking me if I want to be part of a Clinical Trail, or a Study...I have declined on the Clinical Trail...but agree to Pathways study. Best of luck and keep us updated. Denise",
