I am 36 years old and went to the dr because my breast felt different. They found a \u201cmass\u201d, 1cm about 1cm from nipple. Mass is partially microlobulated, hypoechoic and no calcifications or vascularity. I wish there were better ways to understand the differences between Birads a-c. Why would a physician classify a over b and visa versa? Is there a criteria checklist? Log in to post a reply",
