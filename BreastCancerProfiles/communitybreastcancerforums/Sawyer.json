I do my\"dry run' next week and start the dailys on 5/16. I have to do the deep breathing machine. they had me trial the breathing yesterday and its a bit claustrophobic having that thing in your mouth and your nose plugged....but Oh well if that is the way it needs to be done.... The RO had me order the pure aloe gel and vit E oil. I have been reading what you all have been doing too. i am allergic to petroleum jelly so i need to avoid a lot of the products. I am going to try to work during tx but i know i will be tired.... Sawyer ",

I have 3 tattoos and they said they will place the 4th near the nodes area either tomorrow or on day 1 which is Monday. My place is nice, quiet, staff is very kind. The RO is young and beautiful Asian woman. I felt very comfortable with the male rad tech who made appropriate jokes on my first day for mapping and made me feel comfortable. I have to do the deep breathing kind so will have that device in my mouth during treatment which I am not happy about.... I will have 30 treatments total starting Monday. They are down a machine so my appts are at 6:30 pm which will be tough for me...I live 35 min away and if I work my work gets out at 5;00 and is only minutes from the RO office....so I will have time to kill and with the thought of fatigue I just don't like the time frame. Oh well. I read through the previous posts; thanks for the great tips. I look forward to joining in more on the conversations! Sawyer",

I asked today again about it and they said I am describing to a T inflammation of the esophagus caused by radiation with difficulty swallowing and increase heart burn like pain. I will the RO tomorrow to discuss further. I have the full on foliculitis on the chest area (they told me the radiation kills the hair folicles and the rash like appearance comes that is itchy) as well as pink color to the radiation field now. using a cream they gave me for day time and vit E oil at night. Hope everyone is doing well ~ i have 17 down as of today! Sawyer",

I have my first appt wit the RO on 5/2 for meet and greet and plan. I have been a loyal poster in the TAXOL group but since I have finished I wanted to find a radiation group. so here I am :) I had 4 surgeries in the fall then AC followed by TAXOL and graduated chemo and rang the bell on 4/7! My diagnosis was invasive ductal. I am going to go back and read all your posts so I can see what folks are doing to deal with radiation. I am going to try to work and go to treatments in the afternoons; I see on here someone is doing that and its working well. 2 weeks out from chemo I am no longer feeling \"sick\" ; but I am still tired, bloody noses, and sore muscles. I am having a bone scan Monday as the MO wants to make sure the pain in my hips is nothing more than post chemo muscle soreness. I understand radiation can be exhausting after chemo but I am happy to no longer feel \"sick\". I look forward to following this thread :) Sawyer",

My skin is breaking down but dealing with it with the tips the RO gave me and its ok. wondering though: has anyone had any increase in heart burn or any difficulty swallowing? i read that at times the rads gets close to the esophagus and this can happen. I asked the RO about it as the heart burn started when the rads did but she didn't think she was getting close enough to the esophagus for this to happen....but a week or so ago I started to feel like I was having a bit of trouble swallowing....so I plan to ask her about it this week when i see her again but wondered if anyone else had this. thank you for any input!
