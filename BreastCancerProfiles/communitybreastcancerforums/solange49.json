I have a great Onc who gave me 5 months of chemo, the did another pet scan after my chemo ended. It showed that chemo had reduced the cancer by over 50%! I will have my double mastectomy on Monday and radiation to follow. My prognosis is good. So...even in later stages there's always hope and medicine has come a long way and going further soon I pray!

When I saw your photos it reminded me of what my right breast looked like. It was swollen, purplish, had a bruised appearance. It also felt warm to the touch, skin thickening, and my nipple was inverted. It just seemed to appear overnight. I had a mammo and ultrasound the next day (after a clean mammo 5 months earlier). The radiologist told me it appeared to be IBC but ordered a biopsy to be sure. Well I had the biopsy and I was diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Carcenoma. I had a lot of the symptoms of IBC but not all...such as the orange peel appearance of the breast. I agree with the other ladies. You need to find a good gyn or breast surgeon that will be knowledgeable and find out what's going on. Your biopsies might not have been done correctly.

Have you visited the \"3+ years out\" forum. I enjoy going to that one. It gives me hope for long term survival. Speaking of hope...I just finished a wonderful book that I would recommend to any woman with breast cancer. It's called \"There's No Place Like Hope\" written by Vickie Girard. She was diagnosed in 1992 with advanced stage IV breast cancer. Although she's no longer with us... She lived for 15 years! Her story and spirit inspired me. :) I have read several books since being diagnosed. Vickie's jouney and message was so uplifting. It brought me to tears. We need all the hope and encouragement we can get right now. There are also several good survivor stories on the Susan Komen site. Diana",

I thinks it's great that you're being proactive when it comes to your health. A little about my diagnosis. Before my cancer was discovered, I had been having diagnostic mammos and ultrasounds every six months for 2 years due to calcifications they were watching. I went faithfully. In late Dec of last year I had a \"clear\" mammo and ultrasound. Then on Mothers Day this year I was taking a shower I noticed the whole right side of my breast was swollen and the lump could be felt easily. After going to my gyn the next day, another mammo and ultrasound was performed ( at a different breast center I might add ). It showed the 5 cm lump and abnormalities. My biopsy was done a couple of days later, then I had to wait about 3 days for the results. It came back IDC. After my pet scan and pathology report, I was diagnosed as stage 3c. It's grade 2 and I'm Her 2 neg which means I don't have a fast growing cancer. I feel my lump should have been caught 5 months earlier. I might not be in a later stage. I also blame myself for not being more diligent doing more self exams and putting too much faith in the medical community that were supposed to be monitoring me. I hope I didn't scare you with my story. We can't be too persistent when it comes to our health. And since 80% of biopsies turn out benign... I pray that you're in that percentage. I know the wait is horrible but we're here for you anytime. :) Hugs, Diana",

That's good news that your bs doesn't think theres any lymph node involvement. I know it's hard to hear the mastectomy recommendation. I remember how I felt. I just had my surgery Monday.

I'm 49 and I've always faithfully had my mammos every year. About 3 years ago a mammo detected micro calcifications in both breasts and was then informed they wanted to keep an eye on any changes and was told to start coming in every six months for a diagnostic mammo and ultrasound. I did so. Every six months I went. I had my last mammo and ultrasound in late December of last year. They said they saw no changes and informed me to schedule again in 6 months. Well...on Mothers day I had just taken a shower and when drying off I noticed my right breast was swollen on one side, a bruised apperance and felt a lump. I scheduled an appt with my gyn the next day. He was so concerned he sent me for another mammo and ultrasound and it showed the 5 cm lump. I then had a biopsy in which I was told several days later that it was cancer. My PET scan was done and I was staged at IIIc. I had just had a \"clean mammo\" five months prior now I have a more advanced cancer with lymph node involvement. I feel my cancer should have been detected so much sooner. And If I had to do it all over again I would have asked for a biopsy. I still stress the importance of regular mammos to my friends but now I know that they are not foolproof and since I've been diagnosed...I have read other stories like mine. If you have any concern ...don't wait 6 months...get a biopsy. Again...I I hope this doesn't scare you and please know that 80% of biopsies turn up benign.

My PET is scheduled now for the 3rd and meet with my breast surgeon on the 5th. She'll look over the results of my scan and schedule my surgery then.

My surgeon called me earlier and informed me that she removed 15 lymph nodes and 13 of those were cancerous. My tumor was 6 cm. I'm glad I made the decision to have my left breast (the good one lol ) removed as well because the path results showed numerous problems with it. There's a possibility I may have to have more chemo before radiation but I won't know until I go for my Onc appt. I hope not...but I'll do more if needed. It's been hard looking at my bare chest... but I'm here and that's really what counts. I'll have reconstruction when my dr gives me the go ahead. Hugs and thinking of you guys, Diana",

It sounds as though you've really been through an ordeal. :(  Glad it's almost over for you.  AJ- Im sorry to hear that your ultrasound didn't tell you much. I totally understand being anxious and worried. I've been on pins & needles. My last chemo is tomorrow, then I have to wait about 10 days for another PET scan. I'll meet with my bs with the results afterwards then I'll have a date for next month. I'm worried about my PET scan. I had a place of concern in my chest wall and being stage IIIc...I tend to have thoughts about becoming stage IV. but I try not to let my thoughts go there. We'll make it through this! hugs Maria_Malta- Hi and welcome!- I'm also having a BMX. My \"ggod\" breast has several calcifications and a fliid filled cyst. Very lumpy. I feel better doing them both. I may have to wait on reconstruction, I'll find out when I meet with my bs. TexasRose2127- Hi, and welcome!  :)What type of surgery are you having? RK85- Welcome! The fat grafting procedure sounds very interesting. I'll have to check into that option. :)  gamergirl- you don't have much longer! Lol...I know what you mean about needing new bras. I'm down to two now. I think about the little elderly woman that measured me where I go buy my bras. She kept a little notebook with her customer's bra sizes and styles in it. Wondering if one day I'll be able to go in again.  :)  Funny the things you think about. To the other ladies...I hope you're having a good weekend and get the opportunity to chat with all of you. I'm having my last chemo tomorrow!!! Hugs, Diana ",

I've been pretty down lately and just ready to feel halfway normal again. After finishing all my chemo treatments, my onc told me not to get my hopes up about having immediate reconstruction after my BMX due to my stage of cancer and needing radiation afterwards. I had my PET scan Monday and met my my surgeon today. The good news is that my chemo reduced the size of my tumor and lymph node involvement by at least 50 %. the bad news is I'll have to wait a few months for reconstruction. I was really disappointed to hear that. I had hoped to wake up with something. I'll just have to get used to the idea. The office will call me tomorrow to schedule my surgery. Dawn- I'm so sry to hear about your setback. My thoughts and prayers are with you. Gamergirl- I'm sorry as well to learn your news. I know you were not expecting this at all.

I began on may 30th. Four DD AC then four DD Taxol. The dose dense taxol has been a little tougher than I thought. I have run fever for a few days after each one. And the bone pain! Ugh. I'm sure most of that is from the neulasta shot. I also began physical therapy for a shoulder problem I'm having. It hasnt been a good year health wise for me. :) I've always been so healthy before all this. I'm just so ready to get this chemo behind me. I'm doing research now on what type of reconstruction I'd like to go with. Then rads after that. I'd like to hear from you guys to see how you're holding up, hugs, Diana Diagnosis: 5/19/2011, IDC, 5cm, Stage IIIc, Grade 2, ER+/PR+, HER2-",

Bak94- I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to have my reconstruction before rad. I have chemo on Thursday and my onc and I are supposed to talk about my surgery. She wanted to wait until I'm close to the end of chemo. I'm ready to find out my options and get on with it! I may have to wait as well though. I'm just anxious to find out so I'll be prepared. I've also been reading about Diep. So sorry about your cold. Hope you feel better soon. :) Diana",
