But they were going to put a new one on so all is good. She asked me what the bug was called and I told her Cancer. She never heard of Cancer so was ok with it and happy the doctor took care of me. When she would play doctor she would get her little scissors out and take my hand, then tell me she knew what was wrong with me. She said it's nothing to worry about. I had a bug in my boob and she would cut him out and put a new one on. She also would tell her teacher that \"oh my grandma had a bug in her boob, but they took it out. No big deal.\"",
