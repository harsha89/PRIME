Some people absorb certain brands better than others too. I remember one lady on here could not get her levels up,, and then she switched brands and went up! So it does pay to purchase a good quality brand,,, get tested after being on it,, and then stay with that brand and you'll probably keep that level pretty close to the same. And FL sun helps,, but not as much as you would think. One of my co-workers tested at 17,, and she walks a mile or more every morning outside.",

Please ask them to increase your fentanyl patch.  It is available as 25mcg, 50 mcg, 75 mcg and 100 mcg patches. And yes, you can wear multiples if the 100 mcg patch needs to be increased. There is a period of waiting for the new dose to kick in 24-48 hours where you may need some extra oral meds. I've seen patients on as much as 600 mcg total dose. And it's much easier to change the patch every 3 days, than to remember to take the oral meds every 4 hours around the clock. Hopefully a pain management doctor can help you get on the right dose of the patch, and then you can use the oral meds for breakthru pain.  I can't speak on medical marijuana as sadly, it is not legal in my state, but if you can get some, go for it.

You also seem to have some possible lesions on your liver. He recommends follow-up and further testing which you are in the process of doing.  I'm not sure if I answered your questions. A lot of what he wrote has to do with the size and placement of the masses, so that a surgeon can find them more easily when they do a biopsy.  If there is a specific part that you are wondering about, please let me know. I'll try to help. I have medical background, but not in radiology.  But I've read a lot of my own reports. All the best,, glennie",

So I tried the elliptical machine, the recumbent bike and the Arc trainer. elliptical is the only one that use arms at all. It is also the hardest of the 3. So I did 2 mins.  Don't want to overdo. You all think elliptical is a good cardio for LE, since it gets the arms moving too? Bike is easy,, Arch trainer was the middle of the 3,, It's like climbing stairs, but no arm movement involved. No weights at gym. Only doing the prescribed band exercises, etc from the PT.",

Edited: to say,, Disney is always trying to suck people down to Orlando.  If we plan this for the \"off\" season, I think we could do well on hotels and so forth. May and Sept/Oct/early Nov usually good months. The first 2 weeks of Dec are beautiful,, rates and weather wise,,, but a lot of people would probably hesitate to travel between the two major holidays,,, which is why things are so cheap then!",

I have truncal LE and some mild upper arm also. I finally found a CLT and after much discussion with insurance company, got my co-pay visit down to $50  (it was originally $350 a visit!!  out of network hospital, etc)  She has helped me with the massage, but I haven't had much advice on exercise. i found some Lebed vids on YouTube and have been doing them.  Do you advise buying the vid for the complete work-out?  I also have a stationary bike which is parked in front of the TV. My stamina is really crappy now, but I'm up to 14 mins at a time!  Big improvement from 5! I'm also confused on truncal compression.  I went to one fitter and she said I was too small for the Belisse compression bra. The smallest size would not give me enough compression. So she recommended a regular exercise compression bra.  OMG!!  I tried it, I really did, but I have given up on it as it hurts my shoulders with too much pressure and my remaining breast was aching and sore after I wore it.  I'm sure that bra is not meant to be worn 10-12 hours a day! I have a Kimbe swell spot on order and waiting for that to arrive. I tried an Armour all compression shirt but the smallest one is still too big.   i have been to 2 fitters, one here in town and the other is 40 miles away. The one here in town got me my first sleeve but the other fitter said it was too long, that I didn't need a long length, so she ordered me a regular length. She also said I was a 34D whereas the fitter here said I was a 36C.  Confused??  You betcha!!  My rib cage measures 29 in and if you add 5 then i guess I am a 34. But it's just weird that two different fitters come up with different sizes!! So I'm researching on my own. Any advice would be appreciated!  I see the CLT again on Monday, so if there are questions I should ask her,,, please advise!!  She has shown me how to do the massage on myself,,, and I hope I'm doing it right, cuz it doesn't feel like much,, you know what I mean!! Thanks!!",

I just checked and Southwest flies to all of these cities. They are on the cheaper side, I think.   side note:  a pilates book for BC survivors??  Interested!!",

Would a consult with an infectious disease doctor be an idea? Is there fluid that could be cultured? Hoping you get some help STAT. Please keep us posted.",

Bad news: In April, they are closing the pool area for 10 WEEKS!! for remodeling,,, and sadly they will not be making the warm therapy pool any bigger. i use the warmer pool for my classes as I find the regular pool is just too cold for me to be in there longer than 30 mins, no matter how active the class is.

I went to Sports Authority today and bought some \"cheap\" poles. The twisting directions on them are backwards! To open, you have to twist in the opposite direction. I had to ask the sales guy what I was doing wrong and he said, they are backwards! Anyway,, they haven't fallen apart yet, so I'll try them out and see how they do. I feel uncoordinated walking with them, like it is not natural. I know there are some vids on YouTube about using them so I'm going to check them out. Wow, Carol, that's a lot of steps for gardening!",

      "Content": "Oct 26, 2014 11:29AM - edited Oct 26, 2014 11:31AM by glennie19 I\"m bacccccccccccck!   Went to gym today,  did just a little more.  7 mins on bike and 8 mins on Arc trainer. I follow a blogger, NerdFitness.  He is a big proponent of the Paleo/Primal livestyle, and I really enjoy his blog posts. He is quite humorous, although I don't get all his references since I'm not a gamer.  But one post in particular stuck with me,,, How to walk to Mordor.  http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2012/07/23/walking/ Sometimes it is hard to stay motivated to exercise, especially for me, when I need to repeatedly start over and take baby steps to get going again. *can't aggravate the LE!*  I've always wanted to do a long distance hike,, walking across England has been in the back of my mind for years,, so this post appealed to me.  By keeping track of my miles as I walk/bike/Arc trainer, I am \"walking\" somewhere, and making progress towards my goal.  Now I'm not walking to Mordor. What I decided to do was walk the length of U.S. 1 up the east coast, from Key West to the Maine/Canada border!  That is 2446 miles!  Will be breaking this down in parts.  Key West to Miami = 161 miles. So that's the first goal.  I actually started this a long time ago, and stopped keeping track of it. Well, I found my little notebook and I'll be taking it to the gym everytime and recording my distance as I go.  This will give me a little extra boost to help me keep going.   I don't have a pedometer or a Fitbit thingie,, if I did, I would be recording much more mileage every day I suppose,,, but for now, I'll stick with what I do at the gym, or walks around home.   Will let you know when I get to Miami!!",

Yes, walking is great. I would probably hold off on doing any weights with arms until you are evaluated. StepUpSpeakOut has exercise information too. Start low, go slow. Walking and deep belly breathing to get the lymph moving. Swimming is good exercise, walking or jogging in the pool. You could bicycle, road or stationary, but be cautious about resting too much weight on your hands for now. I think if you have a treadmill at home, go for it. Before BC, I used to work out with a trainer, and lifted decent sized weights. When I started back, it was ONE pound weights. Very hard to deal with. I'm moving up very slowly.",

I stayed there for an extra week. Then I moved to 1 lb x 10 for 2 sets, then 2 lb x 10 for 1 set. Did that for a week. Then 1 lb x 10 x 1 set,, 2 lbs x 10 x 2 sets for 1 week. then I moved to 2 lb x 10 x 3 sets,,, stayed there x 2 weeks. Then started slowly with the 3lb weight in the same slow incremental increase. Does that make sense? It is hard as heck to progress SOOOO slowly,, but that was the advice I got. That is just one exercise of the group I do,,,, but just wanted to give you an example.

It is the closest one to my home, so it will be good for cardio workouts. They even have arm bicycles, like I used at PT, so I think that will be great for working the upper body for a while, before trying weights. I tried the elliptical and Precor and then walked 0.5 miles on the treadmill. I feel SO OUT OF SHAPE!! Hoping that Friday I can get to the big gym and check out the pool and those classes.",

We talked on the other thread, but I'll repeat myself in case other people pop on looking for info. I had itching and scaly rash on areola.  It came and went. Did not matter if I used a cream on it or not. It would appear for 2-3 days and then disappear for 2-3 weeks/months,, whatever,, and then come back.  This went on for approx 6 months,,, I was waiting until annual GYN appt to talk to her about it. But on Memorial Day weekend, it came back and then time broke up and bled, so really freaked me out. By the time I got to GYN, it had healed up,, of course,, but she could tell that the skin was thicker in that spot. Mammogram and ultrasound showed nothing.  Radiologist says, I really doubt it's Paget's (first doctor saying it)   then I went to BS and he said same thing! (doctor #2) He was actually surprised that biopsy came back positive.  And I did have an MRI before surgery, to see if any thing else going on,, and again,, nothing could be seen on MRI either.  And I had underlying DCIS that no one saw either. so please don't let anyone tell you that it doesn't LOOK like Paget's,, cuz you cannot tell by looking.  ((hugs))  hoping for a good outcome for you.

All of the compression tees and camis that I tried did not fit me properly. They were too tight under the arm or across the abdomen or something.

It seems to be hard for most health care professionals to diagnose truncal LE.  With an arm, it is much easier to do measurements and compare to the other arm. Not so easy with truncal.  And Binney's suggestion about looking for marks from your bra is another good idea. I use Breast Binders from EAB Medical. Compression bras are not easy for me due to some shoulder issues. I do sometimes wear WearEAse compression bra. I think I first really noticed that I was having an issue when I noticed that wearing a MX bra with prosthetic made the area feel better by putting pressure on the area. (this is not true for everyone)   It was giving me some compression which made me feel better. I hope that you can find another therapist,,, trained in LE therapy who can help you.",

GYN and MO said OK,, no tamoxifen or surgery needed as I'm going into menopause. Well. apparently my body isn't ready for that yet,, as my estrogen levels popped up to over 500 last month. So I'm having the HX next month.  Everything is coming out as they want my estrogen levels to come down.  Do you know what your levels are?   It's rough to be tossed into menopause at your age, since you are not having any signs of it. At least I'm having the ups and down of peri-menopause.   If you leave the ovaries,, you won't be thrown into immediate menopause.But you will still be at risk for future ovarian cancer. And you will still be making estrogen, which could have effect on your BC.  I would continue to question your BS, MO and your GYN and consider what they all have to say.",

I had high estrogen levels for years,,, most likely due to the fibroids,,, but right after my MX last year, they started dropping so we thought I was finally going into natural menopause,, then we had the July level! That's when we decided to get rid of everything. For the last couple of nights, I've had one night sweat episode. Hasn't been too bad, not soaking the sheets or anything. Just enough to wake me up. Had those back in Jan, when I thought I was going thru natural menopause and then they stopped. Probably my estrogen level rose back up again!  So we will see what happens this time.  I'm 55, so I *should* be in menopause now anyway! ",

I do know some triple negative women will be on Herceptin forever,, so I guess it is possible you could be on Taxol forever,, but I would ask others more knowledgable on the subject. About the nerve pain. How much Lyrica were you on? Did it do anything at all? I tried Lyrica for neuropathy and it did nothing for me,, so I asked to switch to gabapentin (Neurontin) which is similar to Lyrica,, and that worked much better for me. You may want to ask for it. Lyrica works for some,, but not all people,,, and for some people, the older med, gabapentin works better. And I think that if marijuana works for you, then I would ask for the medical marijuana card.

I've only had the 5 for 6 months so I may have to wait. I was comfortable with going w/o the form for some of the day, and I was wearing a sports bra for the right side.

Chronic pain OUTSIDE of active cancer treatment,, which I believe you fall under. I am sad that your doctors are treating you this way. They should be more proactive in helping you obtain your meds. And they should be prescribing you better drugs too. #60 Tylenol 3 to last 30 days. That is nuts. That is only 2 tabs a day for a med that only lasts 4-6 hours in duration,,, obviously not enough to get you thru the whole day. And Tylenol 3 is a crap pain med. (If it works for you, forgive me for saying that! But it is not the best choice) As for the pharmacy: I would print that guideline and highlight that line that says OUTSIDE of active cancer treatment and let them know you are in treatment and you need your meds. Many medical professionals are so afraid of the DEA that they allow their patients to suffer for fear of what might happen to their license. With proper documentation in your records explaining why you need the pain meds, it would not be an issue in case of an audit. I hope you can find the relief that you need. glennie",

And flat as a pancake, that you are NOT having recon in the future.  I was not clear and I ended up with excess skin, cuz he thought I was having recon later on.  Now I have to face another surgery to have it removed, if I want to get rid of it. We are here for you. Ask any questions and we will try to help you. glennie",

I probably could have gone back after 3 weeks, but why push it?  Mine was outpt surgery, I was home the same day. One thing you want to think about is dealing with the drains. You might want to pin them to your blouse, or get some drain pockets to hold them. TLC catalog has a camisole with built in drain pockets, I bought 2 of those, that closed in the front with velcro and lived in them until I got my drain out.  When my male friend had BC surgery, I bought him a nail pouch from Home Depot. He could tie it around his waist and put the drains in the pockets, he had 3 drains and it had 3 pockets, so it was perfect.   Also your surgeon may or may not let you shower with the drains still in.  If you can,, you will want a long shoelace, or sash from a bathrobe, or something similiar so that you can loop that over your head and hold the drains up while you shower.  If you can't shower, Walgreens had these really great wipes in the medical section of the store. They are large enough that you slip your hand inside of it and you wash off with it, no rinsing needed. You feel very refreshed afterwards. I would say after the first 2 or 3 days, I felt pretty good. More discomfort than pain. It is hard to sleep on your side for a while though, and some have trouble getting out of bed. I got a bed wedge from Bed Bath and Beyond and slept on that for a while, cuz I have a hard time sleeping on my back, and using it made it easier to get out of bed.",

Some will say, use the arm for IV's and BP's that have had the least amount of nodes removed. Others want to use the legs. Your wife will have to go with her comfort level on this after reading up on it. And I would definitely read up on prevention tips.

You know how hard it can be sometimes to pin down the location of pain, but this doesn't feel like it's on my spine. wherria: with degenerative disc disease,, the disc starts collapsing and pressure is put on nerves, so it makes sense that you feel the pain, not in your spine,, but wherever that particular nerve runs to. I have it in my neck,, and I rarely have pain in my neck,, but I do have it running down my arm and in my shoulder area. It is possible with DDD that you might feel it in your back,,but also really 'normal' to feel it elsewhere. Can you get a copy of your MRI report? That would should tell you the level of the disc issue.",

Other non-hormonal meds are Effexor, Paxil, Neurontin. As far as swelly belly,,, I didn't have that issue. The gas should have been absorbed by now and I would check with your doctor about that. Likewise with the pain. How are your bowels?  Pardon me for being so personal, but they move them around to access the female organs and moving them back can sometimes cause issues.  Adhesions and such. There are PT's who are trained to treat that, if that is your issue. Any pain when you poop? Definitely check with your doctor about your symptoms.",

Good to have a baseline measurement for future reference.   And your dog is adorable!",

Biopsy is really the only way to diagnose Paget's. HOWEVER, since it is not really on the nipple or areola,, and the antibiotics seem to be making it better,, it is probably an infection. I only mention my story, cuz if it doesn't get better, then a biopsy would be in order. With your strong family history, I would recommend close monitoring. Have you had genetic testing done? Have any of your doctors suggested that?",

I will just add that in the TLC catalog there is a bra with the foobs already in it.  It is called the Especially For You bra. There are 3 different styles and multiple size ranges.  However, a bilateral with the foobs in it cost $100.  So for me, that's a lot for just one bra.  You can get less expensive foobs and switch them out from bra to bra. Also Knitted Knockers will send you a set for free. They are soft knitted forms with fiber-fill inside. VERY SOFT. Just right for filling up a bra cup.  They also send the knitting pattern out for free and many wonderful volunteers across the country knit the foobs and send them to patients who have requested them. If you care to send a donation for postage and such, they greatly appreciate it. They are a lovely bunch. Genie bras are wonderful. Nice and soft and easy to slip in a small form. I bought post mastectomy camisoles with drain pockets for after surgery. They came with soft fiberfill breast forms. I made them smaller and used them in the Genie bras. I got the camisoles at TLC also. Genie bras can be found at Target, etc or on-line. After your 6 weeks is up, I recommend that you go to a fitter and get sized. Get RX's from your MD and hopefully your insurance will pay for a certain number of bras/year and forms.  You may want to have a \"nice\" silicon set when you dress up. Best of luck with your upcoming surgery,  glennie",

You put on the patch and it lasts 72 hours and then you change the patch.  You may have to adjust the dose until you find what works for you.  The first patch will take 24-48 hours to reach a steady state level, and then it will keep a steady level in your body after that, with you changing the patches at the correct time.  You may still need breakthru oral pain meds, like oxycodone or hydrocodone or Dilaudid, but you should need them only 1-2 times a day. With pain management, using fentanyl patch or one of the time-released oxycodone or morphine products (oral), the goal is to find the dose that keeps your pain manageable most of the time. What number on the pain scale do you want to be?  Let's say a 3.  So the goal is to adjust your long acting med,,, fentanyl patch,,,, to reach that goal w/o giving you excessive side effects. Drowsiness and constipation are the usual ones.  You usually get used to the drowsiness, but the constipation will have to be dealt with,,,, fiber, stool softeners, laxatives,, Maybe the side effects are too much,,, and you can only tolerate a dose that takes you to a level 5.   Then you have another oral med that is immediate acting, like oxycodone, etc,,, to help with the breakthru pain.

Facial expressions, crying, etc. Can she communicate by pointing to a picture? There are charts with faces ranging from happy to very sad which can help with determining pain scale for patients unable to talk. Please talk to her MO and get a pain consult, or palliative care consult. There are many pain meds out there. She shouldn't have to suffer.",

They try to get all the gas out, but usually some stays behind and it will get reabsorbed by the body in a day or two.  The gas can get trapped under your diaphragm and irritate the phrenic nerve, which sends impulses to the right shoulder,, believe it or not,,, and so your right shoulder might really hurt afterwards.  For me, it was around the rib cage.     I had a complete hyst.  everything is gone.  Removed thru the vagina,,, so my vagina was kinda sore from the removal process.  Peeing was a little irritating on the sensitive area at first!  And it might take a while to get the bowels back to normal,, I recommend taking prune juice mixed with apple juice 2-3 days after surgery if you have not pooped by then.   Are they having you do a bowel prep?  Mine wanted me cleaned out in case of accidental nick on the bowel. So you will be empty,, and then it will take a few days to get everything moving again. You might be able to walk around but you will probably get tired fast, so probably don't plan to go far. My GYN wanted me out of bed and walking around, but I'm not sure how far I would have been able to trick or treat. Break thru pain, is the pain that you have in between regularly scheduled doses of pain meds. She wanted me to take the Motrin on a regular schedule,, and then if I have more pain, to use the Percocet.  Had some bleeding/spotting,, but not much. Only had to use panty liners,, not regular pads even. ",

It is estimated that 6-10 million people in the United States have lymphedema, yet the condition is poorly understood and often misdiagnosed. Dr. Rockson cited a study that found less than one hour was spent on teaching about lymphedema in more than half of the four-year medical curriculums in the U.S. About 25 percent of medical schools spent a total of less than 15 minutes on the disease. At the Stanford Center for Lymphatic and Venous Disorders, Dr. Rockson said he sees about 300 new patients every year. runnergirl26:  Is your white hot poker pain constant?   I have that at night, and was just diagnosed with carpal tunnel. The right side (dominant arm, but not LE)  has the hot pain, and the LE side is much milder,, just numbness.  MD thinks that the swelling from the LE has contributed to the carpal tunnel on the left side even tho the swelling is barely noticeable in my arm. (truncal is the big problem for me) He explained it like a pregnant woman might develop carpal tunnel during her pregnancy due to the extra fluid in her body. I guess it makes sense, although when I told my LE therapist she seemed a bit skeptical.  I haven't had time to really research it either.  Meds that work for that type of pain include Neurontin (gabapentin, available as generic)  and Lyrica.  My doctor likes Lyrica better but my insurance won't pay for it, so he gave me a bunch of samples.  I just take it for sleep cuz for me that was the only time I was getting the pain. So I'm wondering if your hot pain could be carpal tunnel or any other nerve condition,,, and not just the LE?",

      "Content": "glennie19 wrote: Hi all,, I'm going to attempt to summarize what my LE therapist told me today about the conference. There was a big debate about MLD. Should MLD be taught for prevention or only as a treatment? There was a retrospective study showing that for prevention, it was not worth the time, (I'll have to look and see if I can find a PubMed article on this) Also, there was discussion about our quadrants. According to what I'd learned: we have 4 quadrants, across the waist and down the middle of the body are the dividing lines to give us 4 quadrants. \"Experts\" says that doing MLD down the body, across the waist quadrant did nothing to move the lymph down there. Across the body,,,, from left to right,,or the reverse,, yes,,,, but not moving lymph from chest area to below the waist. Below the waist is part of my MLD routine, so that is a change!! Reverse node tracking: So when you go in for your Mastectomy, you get the dye put into your nipple and it moves down to your sentinel node. Well, they can also put dye in your hand/wrist and it reverse tracks up the arm. This tells them when nodes are primary nodes for draining the arm or draining the truncal area. Apparently there are primary and secondary nodes for each area,,, if the primary nodes are removed, the theory is that those people are more likely to develop LE. If the secondary nodes are removed, less likely. Now the surgeon on the panel said, that he would just be taking the nodes that light up from the breast end of business, as he is more concerned with any positive nodes. But I feel this is really important. I already have LE on my left side. If I needed to have another MX on the right side,,, to reduce the risk of developing LE on that side too,,,, could the dye be tracked from both ends and they figure how which nodes that were be better to keep as they are primary? Don't know,, but found it interesting. For me: in addition to removing my sentinel node,,, my BS took 5 more nodes, because \"they were in close proximity\". You have to wonder,, if he had only taken the sentinel,, would I have ended up with LE? There was a lot of discussion about surgical procedures which we didn't really talk about as I'm not doing that. UF Shands (where I go for therapy) does do the surgery, so my therapist sees those patients so it was of a lot of interest to her. Wish I had more details, or links. I will look for articles on these topics and if I find any, I'll post in this thread. glennie Fibromyalgia and Truncal Lymphedema,,, some of the fun things I live with.

When I had seroma, after he drained it with a needle, he then wrapped my chest to put on compression to help keep it from coming back. Ask if a breast binder would be helpful.  Here's a link to the one that I use.

If you want to be flat,, say so on the day of surgery, ,or before. Even if you go flat and decide later that you want recon,, it can be done according to the PS that I consulted about removing the excess skin. ",

And look for other surgeons who will cooperate with you.    Another website:  breastfree.org    And I should say that sometimes it is not easy to make you perfectly flat on the first go.  Sometimes there is an accidental dog ear. Ariom can tell you about that.  But you should not be left with a lot of excess skin (like me) which will require another surgery to make me perfectly flat.  Keep us posted.",

Not cool, mind you, but we installed a ceiling fan -- and DH sleeps with his head under the covers in the middle of summer, bless him! If only one arm in involved you may not need the snaps, but for bilateral it's impossible to get both sleeves on if they're attached to the jacket. (I know that doesn't make sense -- you have to be there to get why it doesn't work!) Also, if I have one arm wrapped for a flare it's a relief to be able to unsnap the sleeve and leave the bandages on over-night.\" On this post from back in 2010, you mentioned a vest and sleeve that snap together.   Can I ask more about this product? What manufacturer?  I'm currently wearing a sleeve and using Swell spots but I'm not sure that I'm getting compression everywhere that I need, especially in the axilla area. I haven't found a compression shirt that works for me yet, they are either too big or too tight.   So I was wondering about this combo that you mentioned. Thanks, glennie  ",
