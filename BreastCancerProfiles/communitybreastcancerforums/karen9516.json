I wanted to know so I could tell my family and niece's and sister if the gene was in our family. BRCA1 and 2 only make up 5% of breast cancers but if you have it your chances are >90% of getting breast cancer and a slightly lower chance of getting ovarian. She said that some women who don't choose an oopherectomy can take the birth control pill and that decreases the chance of pre-menopausal ovarian cancer. Having the gene increases the chance of having all kinds of other cancers too. I didn't have the gene and that was a relief. You probably won't either but that will be one thing you can celebrate and if not you will know.",

In the fall of 09 I had another lump removed in the same place that had started to grow almost immed after the first one was removed.The radiologist at my breast center did an ultrasound and she said it was a cyst and not to worry it could be drained and but it would prob grow back so she would just watch it. It kept getting bigger and I told my surgeon and she said lets get it aspirated. When they did the ultrasound it was a mass. It was removed and it was 9cm! It came back a benign Phyllodes tumor. They don't consider Phyllodes tumors cancer unless they are malignant. The problem is it can keep coming back and they usually do. Malignant tumors of this type do not respond to radiaiton or chemo and are deadly if they metastisize. I had another surgery to get clean margins because the ultrasound said it was 2cm and she didn't expect such a large tumor and didn't want to remove my entire breast without asking me. In Nov I had a BPM and it was nipple and skin sparing. I have had many other biopsies and was over it. Were yours malignant? Even if they aren't they will probably keep coming back and they could change to something more serious. I would seriously consider a mastectomy if I were you. Your mother has breast cancer so you may have the gene. You should probably get tested for that too. This is allot of information for you at such a young age but this Phyllodes tumor could be something that saved you from getting a more serious form of cancer. There is allot of info on the web about these tumors do allot of research",

It is present because when you kill bad bacteria you kill good bacteria as well and the you develop another infection. C-diff is usually not seen after a single course of antibiotics. It is seen more with long term or multiple antibiotic dosing. It is a very contagious and painful infection and the lining of the colon becomes very inflamed (Colitis). We put people in isolation almost every time they develop diarrhea if they are on antibiotics until we send a culture and it is negative 2 times. Also with C-diff you will have diarrhea stools 6 or more times a day. Not just once, as this can happen from taking antibiotics.",

Attitude does make a difference in that respect. I know I want to avoid cancer more than any other illness. I think anyone knows there are complications with any kind of surgery. I worked oncolgy for 2 years. I have seen allot of suffering, but none more than with cancer. There are so many psychological aspects of cancer or even the fear of it. Yes we all know we could get it sometime but when you have been told you have it or you have a very high chance of getting it it brings it home. I agree that some people should have counseling but not everyone.I don't think counseling is what I needed to help make my decision. There are complications we have heard people talk about them and that isn't caused by bad attitude I know that. The good news is with atypical cells you don't have to do anything immediately. Make sure you are willing to take all the risks mkd1061 before you do it because there is no turning back once you do it. This surgery isn't for everyone I just know it was for me.",

She got in there and it was huge.  She didn't want to take my whole breast and have me wake up without it. That biopsy showed ALH and it was then I decided to do the PBM. I had a skin sparing nipple sparing and I have done really well so far. I am having my exchange tomorrow. YEA!!! I had really dense breasts and many fibrous cysts. I didn't want to watch and wait. A phyllodes tumor if it is benign wont turn cancerous but it usually comes back. From what I have read a malignant Phyllodes tumor will never become metastatic but can keep coming back too.These are not cancer and never become spread outside the breast. they are very rare esp the metastic ones.",

My surgeon insisted I have them removed because if you get them at an older age the chances of them containing malignant cells are higher.

You can't be 100% sure you will never get cancer even if they take your entire breast you could get it on the chest wall. My surgeon said if I get it on my breast now I will notice right away because I only have a thin area of skin to examine and nipples. Just examine your breasts regularly and relax.

I also did research on my own and found there are very few if any lobes or ducts in the nipple and if the surgeon is skilled then what tissue is there can be removed. Cancer can occur with any type mastectomy because you can never remove all the breast tissue. If all you have is ADH then you should be safe with one. I am sure there are other surgeons with different opinions but removing over 90% of your breast tissue is going to decrease your risk more than doing nothing at all. As far as the nipples go if it is important to you than it would be worth trying. Some people have trouble with necrosis but I still wanted to try. They can always remove them if it doesn't work.",

My post op path report didnt show anything else bu ALH and if it did i might have had everything removed. I felt like what I was doing for my diagnosis was drastic enough I didn't want to loose my nipples if I didn't have to. I am happy with what I did and wouldn't take back one day.

My surgeon wanted to take it out for the same reason. If you only take a little peice of the tumor you won't be able to tell if it is a phyllodes tumor. The malignant one is considered cancer but benign or malignant they won't become metastic and spread outside the breast.However if you don't get it all it will come back. He may have just wanted to be sure he got enough tissue so you wouldn't have to come back. My second surgery may was a benign Phyllodes tumor. The radiologist told me it was a cyst. It was in the same area as the last one. It kept getting bigger and bigger and I told my surgeon and she said lets do a cyst aspiration. They went to do the aspiration and it was a mass. The radiologist said it was 2 cm and when my surgeon took it out i was 9cm. She had to take me back to get clear margins. The second sugery came back with atypical cells. She did take me back to get all of the phyllodes tumor. I then decided to have a skin sparing nipple sparing prophylactic mastectomy. I am allot older than you. I have a son your age, I am 45. But I had so many things goin on in my breast I was over it. If you have good insurance it should pay for plastic surgery to fix the problem. He doesn't sound like a very considerate surgeon and I would be pissed too but on the other hand he is aggressive. I know a girl who is 25 with breast cancer and if you get it at you age it is a serious problem. My surgeon got a second opinion on my biopsy that came back a benign phyllodes tumor. She said it was very common to get a second opinion. He should have gotten one before he started chopping on you. I would consider a different doctor since you he kind of blew your trust in him. The bruising will go away I promise. I had alot of bruising my second surgery. It was green, purple, yellow and burgandy and lasted about 2 weeks.",
