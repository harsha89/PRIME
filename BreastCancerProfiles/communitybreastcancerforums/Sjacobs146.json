If time was so critical, they wouldn't do that. I'm Sorry to welcome you to the club that you never wanted to join, but you'll find that the best people are in it.

There are a ton of great people on these discussion boards. I personally did not get a second opinion since my hospital has a tumor boards where all the docs look at every case and make recommendations together, so I felt that I had multiple opinions built in. If you are trying to decide between lumpectomy and mastectomy, I'd get the second opinion before surgery. They do learn more after surgery. For example, I did not think I'd need chemo, but since one of my nodes was positive and I have an intermediate Oncotype score, I ended up needing it. So if you're only going to do lumpectomy, you might wait until after surgery for the second opinion.",

You are in excellent hands at Dana Farber. While I was not treated there (I only have \"garden variety\" BC), I have a good friend who has been treated there for many years. Don't worry about MRI or PET scans. Sounds like yours was visible on a mammogram, so less worries about a mammo missing something (which is typically why they do MRIs). PET scans can only see tumors greater than 1 cm, since they found your Cancer at an early stage, you likely don't have mets. Once they do chemo and surgery, more will be known. I'm sure Dana Farber won't miss a trick. Good luck to you",

Different doctors may have learned that certain techniques work better for them (e.g. molds). I have a bolus that they tape on every day. I have a fold in my skin on the right side. My RO said that the fold could cause skin issues. The bolus is a small roll of bubble wrap that they tape to my Breast to lift the skin and reduce the fold. My RO said that they use bubble wrap because it is mostly air which allows the radiation to pass through. I joked with the techs that we should give it a name, like Joe.

Then I remembered that my RO told me that they were not planning to radiate me very high on my chest, and I wonder if they are going high up toward your neck, maybe head placement is more important. Im not erected in what a rads tube is. Are some of you enclosed in something? I'm on a table, and the machine has a long arm that rotates around me, so no feelings of claustrophobia. I watch the machine, there are shields inside that change the shape of the beam so I watch how the shields change when it is on my left side. Once it rotates to my right, I can't see the machine any more because I'm supposed to keep my head turned toward my left a bit",

I was also diagnosed at age 48, and I decided on a lumpectomy. There are no wrong choices here, but this is why I decided lumpectomy: 1. Mastectomy does not guarantee that you won't have a recurrence. The cloud is still there. They can't get every single breast cell. Being fairly young, I didn't want to give my breasts up with no guarantees. 2. Survival rate is same for both procedures. 3. Location of tumor meant I'd have a good cosmetic result with lumpectomy. 4. Lumpectomy is a miuch easier surgery with fast recovery. Mastectomy with recon meant possible multiple surgeries and possibly not a great cosmetic result. I'm sure some other ladies will be on line soon to give you their thoughts. Also there are many existing posts discussing this topic. Good luck with your decision",

Be sure to get a wig befor your hair starts falling out so that they can match your natural color as closely as possible. I visited the wig shop prior to chemo, then once my hair started falling out, I went to the salon where I purchased the wig and they shaved my head for me in a private room. I did not want anyone in my family to shave their heads because I thought that seeing bald heads everywhere would depress me and remind me that I was bald too. You generally have 14 days post treatment before your hair starts falling out",

This was caught at a very, very early stage. BC In General is very slow growing, so waiting weeks or even months is not going to change your outcome. You don't say what state you live in, but it might be worthwhile to get a second opinion at a large hospital that does research and deals with a lot of cancer. So sorry that you're having to deal with this at such a young age.",

I don't recall if you mentioned your age, but younger women have dense breasts, and mammograms are basically useless for them. Even some older women have dense breasts and mammos don't treally work for them either. If an MRI would ease your mind, it can't hurt asking for one, but be prepared if they say no, MRIs are pretty expensive. It's pretty common the have fibrocycstic breasts, and actually pretty uncommon the have Breast cancer. You should definitely do your follow ups and even second opinion if you want, but try not to worry so much. The chances that this is BC are infinitesimally small",

Luckily the hospital was 10 minute drive from my office, so I was able to do it during my lunch hour. The first treatment takes a bit longer because they're trying to get you lined up in the machine just right. After that, the treatments themselves are very quick, you're only in the machine for 10-15 minutes. Most of the time is spent getting you positioned, and getting the machine to change positions. The first three weeks were pretty uneventful. I saw my RO once a week where she checked in on how I was feeling and carefully checked my skin. After 3 weeks, my skin started getting dry even though I was careful to moisturize. I had to use a bandage over a spot that started to crack. I did not find rads difficult. Once rads were over, my skin healed quickly. Good luck during your treatment",

Mine went very quickly as well, I had the biopsy right after my diagnostic mammogram and US, in fact the radiologist did the needle biopsy while I was still on the table for the US. My doc also called me late on a Friday to go over the results of the biopsy. I went for re-do of annual mammogram with not a worry in the world on my part, to US to biopsy within two hours. I'm very thankful that things moved so quickly and I did not have to wait weeks as some women do. Good luck to you, keep us in the loop.",

Trust me, this is the hardest part, when you've been diagnosed, but don't have a treatment plan yet. After my biopsy I went straight home and looked at pictures of mastectomy scars for hours. I didn't sleep well for weeks. I highly recommend using a hospital that has a dedicated Breast center if possible. My hospital has a tumor board, and all the docs are on it and decide treatment, it's like getting a second, third, fourth opinion all rolled into one. I suggest getting a copy of the pathology report. There are pages on this site that will help you to read it and understand what it is saying. Most of what happens next depends on the path report. Once you meet with the surgeon you'll know whether you'll need chemo first, or lumpectomy or mastectomy. Things look really bad now, but chances are that this is going to be just a small bump in the road of life and a year from now, you'll have put the whole thing behind you.",

By definition, Grade 1 is the least aggressive type of BC. Are you being seen by a Breast specialist, or just a general surgeon? Have you had genetic testing yet to see if you're positive for the BRCA gene? I would run, not walk to another hospital, ideally one with a Breast center that specializes in Breast cancer. I was only 5 years older than you when diagnosed, and my tumor was more aggressive and I had a lumpectomy. I did have a positive node, and an intermediate Oncotype score, so I also required chemo, but we didn't decide that until after the surgery. In fact, going in to the surgery, my docs were not thinking that I'd need chemo because we caught it so early.",

Everyone reacts differently, your mileage may vary. Check out the thread Tips for Chemotherapy which folks are kind enough to bump to the top from time to time. My hair started falling out 13 days following first treatment. I had no scalp pain, tenderness, etc. it just started falling out. In MA insurance covers wigs, so I already had one, and the salon where I got the wig styled it and cut my hair for me when it started falling out. I work FT and continued to do so during treatment. I did have a few rough days though. I had me treatments on Fridays, and I usually started feeling bad on Mondays following. I had pretty severe diarrhea the first round, but was able to manage it with Immodium the rest of the rounds. My husband was very supportive, he did everything during the weeks tha I felt the worst. My boys are teenagers, and they helped quite a bit around the house as well. Worst thing for me was the taste changes. I found it very frustrating not to have the desire to eat anything. Luckily, it only lasted 1 1/2 weeks so I was able to enjoy food for a little while before the next treatment. I was also lucky that I had absolutely no nausea. They gave me something pre chemo that prevented nausea for three days, and that did the trick. Good luck to you. Chemo is not fun, but it is survivable.",

In other words, my BS did not say: \"which do you want, lumpectomy or mastectomy?\" She said, \"I recommend a lumpectomy.\" With the chemo, my MO said that the it was close, but the tumor board recommended Taxotere and Cytoxin, but that she wasn't going to prescribe Adriamycin because she felt it was too risky since it can cause leukemia. But she did tell me that they weren't going to handcuff me to the chair and that I could certainly choose to not do it, or to stop doing it.

When the u/s showed something too, they asked if I wanted to biopsy it right away or come back another time. I did it right then. They numb up the area and they use the ultrasound to guide the needle. I felt some pressure, but it didn't hurt. They will leave a tiny metal clip at the spot where they do biopsy to make the area easier to find in the future. I took motrin and put ice packs on the biopsy site for the rest of that day.

You are very young to have BC, and to have a recurrence within 6 months! Are your docs breast cancer specialists? Perhaps your husband would be more reassured if you got a second opinion. I'm a bit shocked that you didn't have rads after your first lumpectomy, that is the standard of care. There are many different types of chemo regimens, I suggest searching breastcancer.org for information about all of them. Some are harsher than others, and there is the possibility of permanent side effects. That said, if I were in your shoes, I'd throw everything I could at this beast. You don't say if you have children, you can have eggs preserved if you want to have children after treatment. My MO is great. I had so many meds to counteract the SEs of the chemo. Meds to prevent nausea, Benadryl in case I was allergic to the meds, meds to boost my immune system. It definitely wasn't as bad for me as what you see on TV and in movies, but it wasn't pleasant either. Good luck with your decision and your treatments",

When I went through treatment, I had one child in HS and one in college. They were independent and didn't need much support from me. My husband did all of the cooking and he took me to my chemo treatments and to my surgery. He also had to drive me to two radiation treatments due to severe snow storms (he has 4 wheel drive). I had a lumpectomy, so recovery from that was very easy. I actually worked full time through treatment. I also had to go to the ER one night due to an infection. Luckily my high schooler was old enough to leave home alone and he could get himself to school on his own. If your husband will be able to do all of the things for you, I'd say his support is most important. If his job will not allow him to be there when needed, then perhaps being with family would be better. As for size of hospital, I had your basic, run of the mill breast cancer. I was treated at a small hospital in spite of the fact that I live in Boston with access to the best cancer centers in the world. The smaller hospital was best for me. I got excellent care, and the hospital experience was less overwhelming than if I had been at Dana Farber. I know this because a friend of mine was being treated at Dana Farber for Stage IV BC at the same time. That said, in case of something unusual happening, I had the option to go to DF.

Ultrasound is one of the safest diagnostic tests there are, they use it on unborn fetuses all the time. I had never heard of elastography before, from what I read, they have to heat the tissue a bit to get results, perhaps that is why you had discomfort. When I was diagnosed, I had mammo, US, and biopsy all in the same day, but I was out of there in less than 2 hours. I'm happy that I had the biopsy that day, I wouldn't have wanted to wait longer for results. Unfortunately, what's past is past, but if you find yourself in this spot again, you may want to slow things down a bit and ask more questions. I didn't ask any questions because I was scared to death too, luckily for me, everything turned out fine",

My husband seems to be taking the news fairly well.  He's not an emotional guy, and he's not very comfortable dealing with emotion.  His coping strategy is to wait until I get most of the tears out of my system before showing up :-(.  He will be coming with me to go to the appointment with the surgeon.",

For anyone out there experiencing heartburn, I highly recommend Prilosec. I take it in the morning, and my nurse said I could take it again in the evening before bed if I still had problems. Taking Claritin for the first time this go round. Last treatment they did not give me Benedryl, and I think that contributed to increased bone pain from the Neulasta. For prevention of mouth sores, I rinse with Biotene a couple of times a day, starting on day one. I haven't had any problems with mouth sores. Becca, I feel your pain about the taste changes. I literally force myself to eat during the week following a treatment. I find salty foods to be best. I eat toast for breakfast, chicken soup for lunch, and white foods for dinner (chicken, rice, potatoes). I am happy that chemo will be behind me and hoping that rads isn't too bad.",

Neulasta shot was a piece of cake.  It can burn, so she went slowly.  It's the after effects that get ya.  My advice is to keep up with the Tylenol or Motrin.  Don't let it wear off.  The last hour before next Motrin was a killer, so I started takin 7 hours apart instead of 8.",

If you have such a place nearby, I highly recommend it. My hosp ordered oncotype with the biopsy, I assume that they do he same for everyone. I am oncotype 23, intermediate. My doc said that I would not have had to do chemo except for they found Cancer in one of my nodes. That combined with the oncotype indicated chemo. I don't know what they would have done if my score was low like yours. Most important thing is to have confidence in your doctors, which is sounds like you lack.

You may be having pain because of all the poking and prodding. It's good that your doc is doing a biopsy out of an abundance of caution, but its a good sign that the radiologist thinks that it's nothing to worry about. When I had my mammo/ultrasound that led to my diagnosis, the radiologist told me right away the it looked like Cancer.",

I wear my hair short anyway, so the loss of hair was not as traumatic as it could have been. On the upside, I don't have to shave, and I'm on the way to the Brazilian Wax look without actually having someone pluck hairs from my nether region. Definitely join one of the Chemo threads when you get started. You'll see them on the Chemotherapy - Before, During, and After board. There are a lot of great tips there. It is totally normal to be scared of chemo, you have no idea what to expect. Everyone has different experiences. Once you go through one round, you'll know what you're in for. My second round went much better because I was prepared and I changed some behaviors to compensate for SEs. They give you a lot of meds to help prevent side effects. As my MO said when she gave me a list of SEs to expect: \"These are the possible side effects. You will not experience all of these, but you will experience some.\" Good luck!",

At mine every doctor looks at every patient and they come up with the treatment plan as a team, like a built in second opinion. If that is not what your hosp does, then go for a second opinion. I am oncotype 23 as well, but I has a positive node, so I am In chemo. Perhaps your age, or grade, or hormone receptors have something to do with it. Your doc should explain why he/she thinks chemo is a prudent course of action, but in the end, it is your decision. Also, once you start, you can stop if you want, they don't handcuff you to the treatment chair",

I received an order yesterday, and she put a sticker that said \"You're Beautiful\" in the card. She ships things very quickly via priority mail. I can't recommend her enough",

Somethimes things are not always black and white, there are shades of gray, that's why there are multiple tests that must be done. No matter what the radiologist said, you have to wait for biopsy results to be sure of anything. What you are feeling is totally normal, I could hardly sleep either while I waited for my biopsy results. Try to keep busy to keep your mind off things. Try Advil PM to help you sleep.

Chemo is no guarantee that it won't come back, and neither is mastectomy. Chemo comes with its own set of side effects, some types of chemo increase the risk of developing leukemia, some cause heart damage, not to mention neuropathy. The best thing to do is not to over treat. I wish I could have dodged the chemo bullet. My doc told me that they are developing new and better treatments for Breast cancer all the time, and even if I have a recurrence, there will likely be something even better than we have today to deal with it",
