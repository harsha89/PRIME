Since the she had a failed try with armidex then moved to xeloda for 2 years and the last year she is on falsodex and Ibrance 100mg because she cant take the 125 due to blood smear. Recently the CA 15.3 started rising again. The onc suggested to do a biopsy to see if the issue is due to a mutation or because falsodex or ibrance run out of gas. Personally I am very confused and I dont know how to help. There are so many combinations of 1. Ibrance and Femara 2. Ibrance and Aromasin 3. Afinitor and Aromasin - onc suggestion 4. Afinitor and falsodex is there any way that you can pick the one that could work ? are there any similar experiences ? Please help Thanks so much Log in to post a reply",

Whats the main criteria to chose either Afinitor or Ibrance you think? She just got her scans and there is no progression. the mets is only on bones. Looking forward to your response",

After she removed this and being without ibrance for a month the ca153 went down 20%. We are still having issues with her RBC that fluctuating a lot. Any suggestions for this will be great.  Thanks so much all",

The options out there about giving this to cancer patirents are different. What do you think ? Thanks",

The last 2 cycles has stopped after the 2nd week. The issue is that the CA15/3 increases from 668 to 698 due to this. It\u2019s a minor increase but still increase. The doc suggested to be 2 weeks on - 1 week off Which means that in a months time she will get 3 weeks of medicine but not consecutive. I found this a bit strange because the ibrance dose management said to start again once the patient recovers - for which 1 week might not be enough Any thoughts ",
