    "Content": "purple_shmoo wrote: I was just diagnosed Monday with IDC. I found a lump in my left breast. I have had pain for 2-3 years in that breast and kept being told it wasn't cancer even after 2 diagnostic mammos and an US. I even did PT because the doctor thought it was muscle pain. Within a week of finding the lump I went to my GYN, had a mammo/ US and a core biopsy. Monday I was told over the phone by the biopsy place that I do have IDC and to make an appt with a breast surgeon. I am a wreck! I am 45 years old with no family history a and a 5 year old daughter! BC wasn't even on my radar. I had appts set up with 2 surgeons next week but one of them got my records yesterday and called to change my appointment to today. While I am happy to have an appt today I am so scared that things are much worse that I think since she wants me in so quickly. I'm stressed, I'm scared and I'm not sleeping. I don't know what to expect today at my app or what questions I need to ask. Any advice or a support is greatly appreciated! Dx 3/30/2015, IDC, Left, 3cm, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
