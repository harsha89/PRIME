SIL letting me know she was going to \"have work done\" the day of my grandfathers memorial service and in between chemo #4 and #5.  The day before her surgery she was upset because she was not getting the type of support she thought she should be getting from everyone.  The only time she came around my house after my surgery was to let her kids play with mine....now why couldn't we do this at her house?? SIL was fifth women around my age (30's) who in our first conversation about the bilateral with reconstruction said \"I have always wanted to have a boob job too\".  I have had to hold on to the small amount of self control that I have left not to pull up my shirt for the whole world to see this is not a \"boob job\" Thanks for letting me vent!!! ",
