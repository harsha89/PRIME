She had a lung biopsy today as they noticed a few spots on her lungs, so they think it's likely this diagnosis will change to a Stage 4 diagnosis once confirmed. Because she is 80 years old, they said chemo is not an option and neither is surgery. Although 80, she is in very good health and still works everyday. Her cancer is treatable with hormone meds and they hope to get some relief and hold the cancer at bay this way. She did not ask the doctor today what survival rates are, but we are obviously concerned and would like to have some idea what lay ahead? Does anyone have experience with Stage 3/4 IBC that has not had chemo? She is actually OK with the treatment plan as she really did not want chemo or surgery. However, I want to know just what this means. She feels and looks great except for a swollen arm. Any feedback is appreciated. This is such a scary thing! We're praying that the medicines are effective for a long time!!!!!!!!!!!!",
