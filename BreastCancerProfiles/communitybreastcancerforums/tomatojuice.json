She spent all of a half hour with me, and just wrapped my arm.While doing the wrapping she commented \" I can never understand what it is that makes women so upset about this\". I couldn't reply, because I felt like I was having a nervous breakdown, while watching her wrap my arm, and also trying to figure how I was going to do this. When I woke up this morning, my hand was hurting. In any case I was able to shower half hazardly.After rads I searched for a drugstore that had 1 inch gauze to wrap my hand. Seems they only sell 2 inch. I would have to probably go to the surgical store for the 1 inch. But I am too tired to travel anymore today. Had to take off the wrapping when I got home to apply ointment to the rash. Can I use the 2 inch gauze to wrap my hand? She is not seeing me until next friday. She also told me to go tuesday and buy the sleeve and glove.She is the one and only therapist at my hospital, that takes my insurance There is also this tape she used to tape the bandage that looks like ace bandage, but isn't. I can't figure out what kind of tape it is, or if it matters?.",

Le therapist showed me how to do it,and gave me an instructional sheet.Honestly though I don't feel as though I am going to be able to do this. Saw a dermotologist yesterday, who said it was okay to wrap over the rash I have. The dermo also gave me a new ointment. I'm going to sleep with this tonight, and go to rads in the morning. Then when I get home I will remove it, because I have to put the ointment on the rash. Then I guess if its still swollen, I will try to wrap it. When I first got home I put two plastic bags over it-did my dishes and cooked dinner. Amazed that I was able to get everthing done. Every morning I take a shower. I plan to try and cover it in plastic tomorrow morning. What a big pain in the butt! Glad something is getting done though. Le said I have a mild case.Need to buy a sleeve, can't wait for my insurance. Tuesday I will get the sleeve and glove.

All of a sudden as of last year my insurance does not cover any of these things. My old sleeve is not the right size and actually caused swelling when I tried to wear it. Had an infection last august that came on with a lot of pain in my entire arm, followed by a rash that traveled very fast. Had to go to the ER, where all staph infections, including lymphedema, are treated as if you had Mersa, until blood work comes back in 2 days.So I was given a new and powerful antibiotic, that made me nausea for a week. This whole event could have been averted , but the physical therapist at my hospital was inept. The hospital I go to touts be the best in the nation, but they no longer have a lymphedema specialist.In any case my old sleeve and glove no longer fit. I have searched the city to no avail to find a specialist that takes my insurance. I wear rubber gloves when i do dishes, and clean. I do lymph drainage that I learned when my insurance did cover a therapist. The thing is, this past 2 weeks I suddenly have discomfort under my arm, and in the outside bend of my elbow. I feel it everyday, just bringing a cup of water up to my lips. Sort of feels like mild cording(I had cording, a few years after surgery). Does anyone know why all of a sudden I feel this. Is it normal for lymphedema? Could there be an infection going on, without the rash? I have a emergency supply of antibiotics. Do not want to go to ER again. I have found Lymphedema life(as I am sure many do)and all the do's and don'ts difficult to adhere to. But I try. to not carry anything more than 10lbs, to not rub and scrub in my kitchen. As I write I realize I also have pain in my upper back, a kind of pulling, and this is not new. It started years ago. I am supposed to visit my daughter in Hawaii in beginning of July. Last 3 times I flew there without sleeve(no problem)But, I am concerned because the last infection was much worse than the others, I have had over the years. And now this aching pulling under my arm, in my back, and my elbow has me concerned. Dx 2/26/2008, IDC, 2cm, Stage IIB, Grade 3, 3/18 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

Today I broke out in an even redder rash, sort of spotted with maybe small amt of raised bumps on my inner arm. I looked real good in the mirror-I also have a few red bumps right under my arm, in my arm pit, and a light rash that travels down to the one on my side.This is not from herceptin! I am scared.

First she told me about my echo-she said it was great-the herceptin not effecting it. So I'm good to go on march 4th for herceptin # 15. She did say something about my heart-an artery that has a little plk buildup, that I should exercise and eat better. I already am exercising my butt off-because I have osteopenia. I asked about the ct scan. She said there is no cancer found in my liver. Whoopy I felt great. Then she added that they did see some little things. They think they are probably little cyst. My dr. totally creeps me out. We do not have a good relationship. Anyway she is a fellow or something, and not a real doctor. She'es leaving in May. Then I get a new fellow.Anyway she can't figure why my alp is elvated.So she's not convinced with the results of the ct scan, because she's scheduling me for an ultrasound. Oh well! Also they found a cyst on my ovary. So I have to see a gynecologist. I take klonipin to sleep. Have been since chemo started. I read that it can raise your alp. So I have decided to go off it. Actually my gut tells me that it is the herceptin that is elavating my alp.I'm feeling better though. Just hearing those words-no cancer in your liver. My sister passed away from breast cancer in 2003. I remember how it spread from one organ to the other very quickly.Within a year of diagnoses she was in crippling pain.

Are you seeing a physical therapist for your arm. Might be a good idea to get in touch with a therapist, because of the swelling. Also  you should find a LANA certified therapist, because having 19 nodes removed means you are at risk of developing lymphadema. Hopefully that is not the case, but to be on the safe side, you should have your arm checked. Also there are exercises(stretches) that you should be doing post-op. A LE therapist can advise you about certain exercises, and also simple life long protective measures to help prevent swelling or infection.",

For me I have felt pretty much okay, til about the third day-then I got a little emotional, and felt kinda wired. I think the steroids made me feel that way. Also had a metal taste that lasted for a couple of days.I did not have any nausea. They put zofran in the I.V. to prevent this. My Onc also gave me a script for phenergan, but fortunately I have not had to use it. Around day 10 I had a mild case of diarrhea in the mornings for a couple of days. By around day 12 I usually feel great. The third week is great. Its like a little vacation before the next treatment. All in all Its way better than I expected. So I'm hoping the next 4 treatments is more of the same. Because it is just so doable. I have also been able to carry on as usual throughout the first two treatments -shopping, walking around the city. Doing my part time job. Even exercising-walk eorobics, and a bit on the treadmill. I know evryones different, but I think with the antiemetics and the steroids that chemo se's are not as bad as they were years ago. Hopefully, and probably it will be okay for you to.",

Have read different opinions about staying on probiotics while on antibiotic therapy. I actually went off for the 7 days, then resumed at the end of treatment.

I have been on the keflex three days now, and the red streaks are still on my arm. They have not gotten any worse, but they have also not gotten very much better.I am concerned. Will be calling my onc tomorrow morning. Tuesday is simulation day for me with rads. Wednesday I am having a ultra sound of my arm to look for blood clots. Thursday will be the last day on the keflex.My hand is still swollen more than usual. I was told while there is an infection, no exercise, and no massage. Basically just been keeping arm raised up on pillows for intervals of 45mins.",

Said they thought it may be an infection and that I should start on some Cephalexin(antibiotic). And if that does not clear it up that I should get an ulltra sound to check for blood clots. So I suggested why wait for the ultrasound since this problem has been aroun since chemo#3.Started the cehalexin yesterday. Ultrasound on Monday. They asked if I had a sleeve-which I don't .I have a prescription for itbut have not filled it.They said to really limit the use of my arm. Went a concert outdoors at Licoln center last night. It was elctronic dance music combined with the Joshua light show from the 60s.It was great,but I kept noticing the swelling in my hand. This morning I woke up, and its more swollen than last night.I am scared and depresed about it.I tried callling the le therapist , but she never called back. Its the weekend now and I don't kow whatelse to do. But I am worried.They told me to continue with le exercise,but don't overdo anything. Now I am unsure exactly what to do. Rover I canot really explain cording, eexcept that it looks like cords running down your arm(maybe look up Axillary web syndrome) and that should explain it. I am sure someone else on her can explain better.",

Keeps me busy at least two days every week. The people I work for also thought I should get to the doctor. Just called the doctor on call at my hospital-he didn't know what cording was -and he said to put warm compresses on it and some tylenol. He said I would probably be fine until tomorrow morning. Tomorrow I will call my doctor first thing. I'm so creeped out. Was celebrating today, because today is my first day out since chemo#6. Been pretty sick and weak every day since.My blood counts are the lowest that they have been.Oh man I hope its not cellulitis!My stomach is still all messed up, and my gums hurt around my bottom teeth, especially one tooth. It looks like the gum is receding down away from the tooth. I wear a partial denture on the bottom, but I have not been wearing it-hoping the tooth will heal.Thank you all so much-don't know what I would do without you-my sisters-maybe I would have put off calling the doctor?",

It was on the under side of upper arm.  When it happened, it woke me in the middle of the night(the Pain). In the morning the bruising was there. But they went away within days. What I have now are red streaks that run don my arm-from elbow down about 3 inches long. This really all happens fast. My hand was pretty swollen this morning when I woke up. Was hard to make a fist. It has come down a little. I found out from the surgical druggist where I need to go that the person I need to see about a sleeve and glove will not be in til Monday. My insurance will probably cover it, but it will take about two weeks to get it.The le specialist I saw after chemo #3, made me feel as though ther was no rush to get the sleeve. I tried to reach her yesterday, she didn't call back. I remember now she told me she only works part time.I am really not comfortable with her. But I don't know what I can do about that. My insurance is specific to only my hospital. Anything I need, I have to have done there.For me to request another therapist would be very arkward.I have good doctors. My rad onc in great. So far she is the only one that from the beginning I have not been comfortable with. I am sorry about going on and on. My feelings about her could just be-that from the very moment of diagnosis with bc I have thought of the possibility of getting lymphadema. I will probably spend the weekend with my arm raised  up on pillows-just sitting around. I am a little freaked because I cannot do my exercises. Exercising keeps me sane. I am in shock that my hand is swollen.Like everyone else I will learn to deal, but right now my coping mechanisms are dwindling.",

I have had it for over a year, and numerous doctors have looked at it(saying they know not what it is). But I have been persistent. It has been treated with Keflex twice in the past year and 1/2. Still there. So I decided to go back to my dermatologist. I go to a clioinic, so the initial Dr. that checked it out, gave the same diagnosis. But he then brought in his superior to have a look. A very old Asian Dr. (dermatologist- oncologist). He examined me and had no trouble finding what it was. He said I have a Lipoma(a fatty tissur tumor, thats usually benign). He felt it, and had the other doctor feel it. I am a little more freaked out. Usually doesn't mean never. I have been watching the rt. side of my stomach grow bigger than the left for a year now. The last thing the doctor told me is it is going to get bigger. Somehow I keep thinking it has something to do with my surgery, because it sits right below where my breat was removed. I am seeing my oncologist this friday. I want to have an MRI. To find out its size, how big it will get, can I have it removed, and is there any possibility of it being cancer. I have read online where swollen lymph nodes were mistaken for Lipomas and where other types of tumors were also mistaken by just touch. Well thanks everyone for your feedback, on everything.",

You have put it into to words, so well.This is exactly what I have been thinking, especially after reading today \"breastcancerupdate\" Dr. Stephen Jones, Mar 2008-after 7 yr. followup of the san antonio trial-they found chance of dying w/TC is 31% less than w/AC,w/wo node involvement. They mentioned something about a hazard ratio of .69 (don't know what that means). Having my son take a look at this. I wrote your words down verbatim to read to my son, and maybe Onc-because I feel the same way. Thank you so much for responding. I am almost feeling the weight lifting, as I edge towards this decision. My first chemo treatment is scheduled for April 23.",

I am 58, divorced, very happily single, not looking at all.When I told the surgeon that I wanted a bilateral, she discouraged me,and urged me to see a plastic surgeon about reconstruction. She mentioned something about a big scar across my chest. So I proceeded to the plastic surgeon.From the minute he touched me and explained the possibilities-I knew immediately that I wanted none of it. I wanted to run out of his office. He was immensely insensitive, also. He said, step into my lab, and took a picture of me naked. Then he literally grabbed and pinched my stomach, and said I had enough fat for a diep, or something. I had to remind him that it was me he was pinching. The whole experience is one I definately want to forget.But it wasn't just his manner that made me decide against reconstruction. I am sure there are good plastic surgeons around. I just didn't want the extra pain, or possible se's. I didn't relish the idea of being asymetrical.But now it doesn't bother me at all. I have been fitted for a lightweight prothesis.But for some reason I prefer the little puff that the breast cancer society gave me in the hospital. I really like it, it feels like a soft little cushion to lean on, and looks great.Sometimes I do get nervous though about still having my other breast, so maybe somewhere down the road I will have another masectomy.",

I am grateful to you, as I have noticed my stress levels have definately increased due to the infection. I still have redness, no new spread. ITs just that it all seems very strange to me, because the redness emanates from the crux of my elbow, where the cords are very visible. Also it hurts to the touch in this area. My LE therapist suggested that I resume my stretching exercises and also to keep my arm raised on the pillows. I do the exercise to the point of resitance-but I keep somehow thinking(Is this maybe making things worse?). The LE therapist never did teach me the massage. I saw her twice. And I do not have a sleeve and glove yet. I went to be fitted, but they would not fit me while I had the infection. Then they gave me a lenghthy letter for my insurance, which I am waiting for my doctor to do for me. On Tuesday I have some phone calls to make-doctor & LE therapist.I do not have fever or warmth. All of this is happening when I am about to begin radiation treatment. Even though I have already done simulation, my team of doctors decided to get together to decide if I need it or not. There consensis was that I did, because I have an extranodal extension. Waiting for them to call me, I thought my head would explode. Thankfully though they did call on Friday before this long weeken. And I was able to relax some.I work part time(2-3days wk).I can't imagine what this like for women with children, and full time jobs, or who have to travel far to their hospitals. I woke up this morning feeling so emotionally drained, thinking that I need to do something to counter it. What that is I don't know. Just can't wait to be finished .",
