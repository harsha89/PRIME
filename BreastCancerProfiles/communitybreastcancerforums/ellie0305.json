Recon in may and started chemo in June.Its been nice to read that all my feelings and se's where \"normal\". I am a nurse and skin care specialist I wanted to add to the dicussion that you can get your eye browns tinted. The tiny hairs pick up the color, it helps with the \"sick\" look. I have also been using Latisse on my lashes and eye brows. They are alittle thinner but seem to be holding up well.My coworkers use it and have amazing lashes, so I am thinking around 2 months after my last tx (oct 13) mine should be looking good.",

I have also found that Eminence ( a professional product line) has a line called biodynamic.My stressed skin really likes it. I also started using Super seed, a fiber powder like metimucal but natural. I think it is life changing.Once I got my bowls working right the whole world seemed rosier. It has flax seed, chia seeds, probiotics and sprouted stuff in it. I mix it with 1/2 wateer 1/2 oj.  I have read that some of you are back to excersicing even running. I sat on my spin bike with very little resistance and just pedaled for 45 minutes. 6 hours later my hip hurt so bad that I thought of going to the ER. I have been on motrin and vicoden around the clock since Friday and its only alittle better. Whats that about??? My onc thinks its muscular, has any body else had this kind of reaction? Ellie",
