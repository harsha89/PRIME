Here are some good things to do: take the nausea pill reguarly for the first 24-48 hours after chemo. Don't wait to get nauseous. The first 24 hours worked for me. I never got sick. drink 10 - 8 oz glasses of water each day for at least 7 days after chemo. I started doing it every day, and still do if prone to constipation, drink one glass of metamucil or similar fiber drink each day for 7 days after chemo for 72 hours after chemo - rest. Let your body do what it needs to do. Sleep when you want to sleep. Be awake when you want to be awake. take short walks every day or do some type of light exercise daily eat/drink high protein foods. My favorite go-to was muscle milk, scrambled eggs, and peanut butter sandwiches the tast buds going wacky was the worst side effect for me. The only thing that tasted good was sweets, and you have to be careful with those. I kept a bag of low calorie mints with me at all times. And I drank flavored water because regular water was yuk. keep Benadryl and itch cream on hand in case you get hives. I only got them once. use Nail Tek daily on finger and toe nails Take Biotin and a probiotic daily get a night cap for your bald head, if you tend to get cold easy. Get a nice wig before you lose your hair. It will make you feel prepared. I bought my wig to match my hair color and style almost exactly. No one whould have known I had lost my hair if I did not tell them. I cut my hair very short before I began chemo, then shaved it when it started coming out in droves. You can expect to lose your hair 10-14 days after the first chemo. It might help to have your favorite hardresser on standby to do the shaving. Throw your hair a goodbye party. When I finished chemo I began using Ovation Hair Advanced Cell Treatment on my head. My hair has come back prettier and thicker than ever. I still use it now. hook up with a group on this board who is going through chemo at the same time, with the same chemo cocktail. You will learn from each other as you go throught he process. ",

My oncologist encouraged the mastectomy immediately, but I was tired from treatment. I did agree to a full hysterectomy/oophorectomy 6 months after I finished treatment (April 2012). I opted for surveillance on the breasts until November 2015. It was quite stressful. Finally my oncologist had a heart to heart with me. Her biggest fear was that I was going to have a recurrence, and it was going to come back as triple negative. I had the double mastectomy 10 months ago (4 years, 9 months after original diagnosis). I couldn't be more happy with my decision. A great weight was lifted off my shoulders. I did a DIEP flap, recovery was not as bad as I anticipated, and I look great.",
