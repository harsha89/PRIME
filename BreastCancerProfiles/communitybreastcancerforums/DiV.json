When I was first diagnosed in 2013 I had a mastectomy with immediate reconstruction tissue expander then implant and nipple reconstruction. Everything went well. Had a pain ball inserted in mastectomy to administer pain medication. Did AC+T chemo. Got through it all just fine. Fast forward to Sept 2016 cancer is back in the chest wall. Just finished radiation today. Finish chemo on Monday. My case is not typical in fact it is really rare. My tumor is wrapped around the brachial plexus nerve that controls your arm and shoulder. The only way to remove my tumor is to remove parts of ribs #2-5 and amputate my arm at shoulder. I will have a petscan March 14 and mri March 16 if cancer is still contained and hasn't spread my surgery will be March 20th. Needless to say I'm scared to death but staying positive that the surgery eradicates the disease. I wish you all good luck in the decisions you choose for reconstruction and a fast recovery.",

After surgery and recovery they are putting me in ICU I don't know how long I will be in there. After the amputation I will get a nerve block to help with the pain. I'm hoping and praying they keep me pretty drugged up and I sleep alot so I don't have to deal with the pain. Thank you all so much! You are all in my thoughts and prayers as you go through your journey. Meadow thats great news on the wound! Any news on Annie?",

I was discharged from the hospital on monday. They weren't going to release me cause my heart rate jumps up too high. (140+) when the pain hits. They brought in a cardiac doctor to exam me, gave an ekg. Doctor seems to think same thing as pain medication wears off before next dose is due heart rate goes up. Dr ordered dilaudid before being released and heart rate went back down. Cardiac doctor said heart rate increase during pain was confirmed, cause on thursday they turned my epidural off after 7 hours pain hit suddenly and heart rate jumped to 150. Every dr and nurse came into my room. They turned my epidural back on and within 20 minutes heart rate was back down. I also have a plurel effusion after 2nd chest drain was removed. Had 4 chest xrays on Thursday. Xrays showed several small effusions. Had chest xray every morning upto and including day of release. Xrays show it getting smaller. I had a rough day monday after release from hospital. Had a lot of pain until about 3am. I couldn't lay down and sleep. I ended up sleeping in twin bed sitting up in corner with lots of pillows behind me. Still in a lot of pain but it is more manageable today. Dr has me on oxycodone 15mg every 3 hours and gabepentine 300mg 3 times a day and baby asprin. Slept alot today. To all who have had surgery i wish you well and a speedy recovery. To those who have just joined I wish you the best. I'm praying for all of you. To the newbies welcome so glad you found us but sorry for the reason. There are alot on knowledgeable, supportive people on this site. Love, prayers and hugs to all!",

For all who have had their surgery I wish you a speedy recovery and take it easy on yourselves. As for my own up date 1 week after release from the hospital for arm amputation I'm learning to adapt to one arm. My pain is mostly in my scapula where the surgeon did most of the work to remove the tumor by cutting a window in my ribs #2-5. I also get shooting pains that runs length of amputated arm to fingertips like shock waves (phantom pain) hurts but I can deal with it. I will talk to Orthopedic surgeon on the 7th about pain management and finding the right drugs for me and my symptoms to manage the pain. I start a therapy group for amputees friday. The therapist mentioned a mirror program they do to tell the brain that the arm is no longer there, she said alit of people benefit from the mirror program. All in all doing pretty good considering. Raven I too can't wait to get my drain out. I had 4, 3 chest drains and I breast drain. Still have the breast drain. Hoping to get it out on the 7th. Hugs and prayers to all!",

Radiologist says i'll be in and out in 15 minutes. For the first 6 chemo treatments i will have to take my IV cart with me and get radiation then back to chemo room to finish chemo. My radiologist told me to use Aquaphor for a cheap cream (will stain clothes) or Miaderm L (has lanocaine in it). Bought both this way right after radiation i will use the Miaderm then use Aquaphor when i'm at home. Miaderm is expensive but she said its really good. Yes have to keep a good attitude.

I am on percocet but don't take it every 4 hrs like the dr wants. I am so afraid of getting addicted. Dr spoke to me and insisted that I take it regularly. Dr said i'm probably under medicating. I will do what the dr orders. I feel so out of it and loopy. I will be so glad for the weekend to come so i can have a break. On the up side my stomach feels much better today...yahoo! Hoping i will get some energy back for the weekend. Welcome to the new ladies. I am so sorry for your diagnosis. You will find great support and encouragement here. Most importantly you have to fight and stay positive and strong.",

I'm a machinist and was pushing on pulling setting up machine and i thought i pulled a muscle or tore my rotator cuff cuz i could only raise my arm so far and scapula was winged out. When i finally went to orthopedic and got mri that's how i found out my cancer was back and it was in axillary node and grew out of node and attached to chest wall and entwined in the brachial plexus nerve. Never in a million years would i have thought that recurrent breast cancer would affect my arm and range of motion. Never would have thought that i'd have to have arm amputated either. I am a Taurus (stubborn and bullheaded). I'm coming to grips with what has to be done and i know it will be hard but will get through it. For all cancer patients when something doesn't feel right get it checked out cause you just never know. Stick with your treatment plan your almost at the end! Yes taxol and neuropathy is common had the same thing. Be strong and hang in there. Keep us posted on how your doing. Prayers and hugs. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!",

I was 2 1/2 years cancer free doctor thought I was in remission. Wrong! Now i have a chest wall recurrence doing chemo and radiation at the same time then surgery. Worse part is the only way my tumor can be surgically removed is to amputate my arm at shoulder due to tumor entwined in brachial plexus nerve. My cancer is rare Metaplastic Spindle Cell triple negative. Also rare is there are only 23 cases of breast cancer patients having arm amputation due to cancer. Now that treatment has set in and knowing surgery isn't too far off it scares the hell out of me. Sorry for venting. Needed to get it out of my system.",
