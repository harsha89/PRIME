They knew something was going on because I had multiple dr appts (very unusual for me) and Dad went to a couple of them. Oldest would ask Dad questions about me. Once we knew for sure that I had cancer we told them, and then I spoke to them separately while laying in bed. They both seemed to respond well in this situation. They did not have to look at me if they didn't want and they actually asked a few questions. Surprisingly, they knew a little as well. Fortunately, they have never experienced a bad outcome with any type of cancer in our immediate family/friends, so they did not first think that Mommy was going to die. We had a few laughs and hugs and reassurance that we would get through all of this together as a family. I am anxious to find out what my plan of treatment is so that I can better prepare them for the near future. My MIL also found a few books that she sent to us. One is a compilation of pictures and stories from other children that have parents with cancer. One was kind of like a workbook that seems like it would help with their feelings. They are pretty honest so I want to know my treatment plan before doing these with the boys.......You know your children best. I am confident that you will handle this uncomfortable situation the right way.",
