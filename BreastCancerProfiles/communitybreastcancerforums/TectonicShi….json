Keep away from anyone in your family that doesn't support you and try to make you feel better. Stop calling, emailing, and texting for now. If they call, don't answer. Or have your husband say, \"She's doing pretty well but she isn't up to talking right now.\" Maybe later you can deal with them, but, my god, why would you add that stress to all you are going through? Try to keep the energy surrounding you as positive as possible - always - but especially when dealing with illness. Also please keep in mind that dysfunctional families are usually generations in the making. Those of us who deal with such a situation are at the tail end of a long chain of messed-up family dynamics. There are no magic words to fix it.",

Personally, I have no time or energy for toxic people who criticize me, or make me feel bad, or complain all the time, or who are simply selfish and self-centered, even if they are my siblings. Relationships are a two-way street and should make both sides happier. You and your happiness and health must come first. It's okay to walk away or cut off communications for a while - or forever - if you want to. You may need to. Google \"low contact\" and \"no contact\" for ideas about how to handle this situation. You are not alone in facing this type of situation.",

      "Content": "Nov 26, 2013 07:14AM - edited Nov 26, 2013 09:04AM by TectonicShift Yes, supposedly there is no formal study or peer-reviewed data showing outcomes change with early detection - and, by extension, early treatment - of mets. And yet, who wouldn't begin treatment immediately upon finding mets, even if asymptomatic? That is, who among us would say, \"Oh, I have distant mets? Eh, it's not convenient to go back in treatment right now. I'm busy, and since it won't make any difference in my survival time if I wait, let's wait a year or two or three before starting treatment. Might as well wait until the pain gets bad or organ function starts to be affected. Then I'll start treatment again. That way I avoid all the side effects from treatment for a while and I can maybe save up some money to pay the treatment bills. My life expectancy will be the same either way. Heck, it might even buy me time since theoretically the treatments will stop working later than they would if I started them now.\" Somehow I don't think anybody would say that. It's not intuitive. (Leaving out the people who don't want ANY further treatment on a stage IV dx.) Anyway I think that study is more than 20 years old, before some game-changing therapies and some game-changing diagnostics and tools like gamma knife and stuff like that. I think the data is behind the reality. My oncologist has been practicing for almost 50 years and he says it absolutely matters because an established tumor is harder to eradicate than a newly formed tumor. For example he says mets to the brain can be eradicated when small, and sometimes never comes back, but by the time the tumor is big enough to cause seizures, it's too late. He insists on periodic brain MRIs. Who would fund a new look at this question these days? There's no financial incentive for anyone to do it. Maybe NIH will take another look at it. It would be nice to have a definitive answer based on today's therapies, diagnostics, and tools. Until then, we all just have to go with what feels right. Fortunately there are a few oncs who do give routine scans to BC patients, for those of us that want them. I'm thinking of starting a thread where we collect names of clinics/hospitals/docs who do routine scans so patients can find a place close to home if possible. I wonder if stage III colon cancer patients are given four months of chemo and a month of radiation and then told, \"Good luck, call us if you have any symptoms.\" Somehow I doubt it. But maybe.",

      "Content": "Nov 25, 2013 08:16PM - edited Nov 25, 2013 08:21PM by TectonicShift Somehow this thread has veered off OP's topic. But anyway, to add to the discussion of benefits of finding mets early, I present this article. We now know that 75%-80% of distant BC mets have significantly more HER2 expression that the original breast tumor had if the original breast tumor was deemed Her2 negative. It is one reason some scientists now think cancer stem cells almost all overexpress Her2 even if the main tumor did not. In fact, ASCO has just changed it guidelines. Oncologists are now supposed to biopsy distant mets if possible and double check the Her2 status. It's also why they are doing a big phase III trial testing Herceptin on low Her2 (technically Her2 negative) patients. But then that brings us to this article: http://www.onclive.com/publications/oncology-live/2013/may-2013/revisiting-her2-recent-research-shakes-views-on-famed-marker/3 note from the article (emphasis mine): \"Another interesting finding from this study was that an increased level of HER2 expression was observed in bone metastases (a common site of breast cancer metastasis) in both mouse xenograft models and breast cancer patients. This phenomenon was not associated with HER2 gene amplification, but instead seemed to be regulated by the bone microenvironment. Thus, patients with advanced metastatic cancer may appear to be HER2-negative by conventional testing methods, but may still respond to HER2-targeted therapies as a result of HER2 expression regulated by the bone microenvironment. Importantly, however, appropriate timing of trastuzumab administration was vital. When trastuzumab was administered to mice when bone metastases were small, a significant decrease in the growth of breast cancer cells was observed, while treatment that was initiated after palpable tumors had become established was limited in its efficacy to tumors with HER2 gene amplification. These results suggest that, if administered to breast cancer patients before bone metastases develop, trastuzumab could help to prevent the spread of tumors.\"",

My friend is recovering from his third bout of head and neck cancer and doing well after about 8 years or so. I never would have guessed he would be doing as well as he is. Breast cancer is a bit different than these, especially luminal breast cancer. I don't want to minimize your fear. I'm scared all the time too and I assume I will die of b.c. eventually. But maybe not. There are a lot of treatments and a lot of researchers working on it. I do think knowledge is being gained exponentially these days. Try to read up on the b.c. news every day. Watch what's happening with trials, immunology, gene therapy, CRISPR, etc. It's pretty exciting when you read up on the latest. But yeah, it has been a rough first month of the year. ",

But if that's true, then when your doctor finds your stage IV mets, you could say, \"I think I'll wait a year or so before starting treatment. Let's wait until the pain gets bad.\" Or, \"Let's wait until I do my trip around the world. When I get back, then we'll start treatment.\" I doubt any doctor would go along with postponing treatment for stage IV mets. (I don't think any patient would either, that's just a hypothetical.)  My doc says it absolutely does matter when you find mets because when mets are immature the apoptosis pathways are still open meaning the tumors can be killed off. But eventually as tumors mature the apoptosis pathways close. But of course that is just one doctor's opinion. I wanted someone who was really aggressive in searching for mets because that is what works for me. YMMV. My regular scans - so far clean - have made me feel better for much more than a few days afterward. I feel good for months afterward. I do get nervous as the next scans come up, but I know if they do find something it will be small.",

You are \"starting\" all this at a good time, if I can be so bold as to say that. I mean no time is a good time, but treatments are much better than they were ten years ago. There are great vaccine trials going on right now that seem to really be reducing recurrences, especially in Her2 negative patients. Grade 1 is great. Yes there are some grade 1 people who go to stage IV, but not many. And they usually respond to treatment well and stay healthy for a long time. You need to get your head straight and start digging into the research into clinical trials. Be proactive. Do not miss a chance to do a trial. There are great ones going on right now. If you can do the one where you get Herceptin even though you are Her2 negative, I would recommend that one. At least that is the one I wish I had done. It was not offered at my hospital last year when I was doing chemo. I should have gone across town to a different hospital for chemo so that I could do that trial. I really think they are going to figure out that Herceptin DOES reduce recurrences in HER2 negative people. (Because most people, even the HER2 negative patients, have at least SOME HER2 receptors.) Even better is a trial getting ready to start or maybe started already that is combining Herceptin and the NeuVax vaccine. That one is going to be awesome. I would REALLY do that one if I could. It's a lot of extra time and work to do trials, but I really think you want to try everything you can. If you start chemo without being on a trial, you may miss your chance. If you have to go to a different oncologist in order to get on a good trial, do it. Do not be shy. (Your oncologist will only offer you trials that are going on at his or her particular hospital.) I was dx Oct 2011. Same sort of thing. Misdiagnosed earlier. By the time they figured it out, I was stage IIIc. So angry and I think I cried for about six months. But now I am feeling pretty good and do five miles on the treadmill most days. And my hair is long enough to put in barrettes. Am I high risk for recurrence? Yes I know I am. But I'm doing a vaccine trial, taking baby aspirin, metformin, and simvastatin. Exercising and cutting out sugar. Taking curcumin and fish oil, vitamin D and calcium. And Zometa infusions. And watching the science. The doctor in charge of my vaccine trial worked at NIH and she told me she is very optimistic about vaccines. She has seen stage IV patients go into remission just from the vaccines. There is much reason to hope. And FWIW, I think crying for six months was the best thing I could have done. I really had to let it all out. Don't let anyone tell you how to feel about all this, or how to act. You have a right to feel what you feel. BTW, I put off any decisions about reconstruction. I'm glad I did. I kind of like being flat! I just have to decide whether to have the other breast off and go totally flat! My friend is a breast surgeon. She said her happiest patients are the ones who do no recon at all. But you are young, and I understand your desire to have breasts. There is no right answer there. Just know you can always do it later. If you tell us where you are located (sorry if you already did, I have not read every post) we can help you identify good trials. YOU CAN DO THIS!! TS.",

From what I could tell from conversations with my onc, there is a lot that is not understood - or agreed upon by scientists and oncologists - when it comes to PR receptors. He says that many in his profession believe you are either ER/PR+ or ER/PR-. That's one reason emphasis is placed on ER. (PR goes hand in hand.) I don't mean to stress anyone. Obviously I have no idea if he is correct or not. There certainly seems to be a high number of patients who get a dx of ER+/PR- or ER-/PR+. And I never knew anything about cortisol until I started reading this thread. I've researched a bit over the last day. Very interesting! Thanks, Shikari!",

I am over two years out now and doing well (though still in treatment because I wanted extra treatment). One thing I wanted to mention to you - try to get a separate path report on one of your lymph node tumors. Sometimes it will turn out to be a different pathology than the overall breast tumor and that might affect your best treatment options.  It's strange when grade 1 breast tumors travel to so many nodes. My breast tumor was mostly grade 1 but there was some grade 2 material in there and THAT is what traveled to the nodes. Also my breast tumor tested out as HER2 negative but my largest node tumor was close enough to HER2 positive that I got Herceptin. I hope doctors start routinely testing the lymph node tumors. The pathology of the stuff that travels is more important than the pathology of the breast tumor. And surprisingly sometimes is different.",

      "Content": "Jan 5, 2013 01:55PM - edited Jan 5, 2013 03:05PM by TectonicShift Some tumors grow in the presence of Her2 because they have Her2 receptors in the cells. There are two Her2 tests: FISH test and IHC test. They give one of four results: Her2-0, Her2-1+, Her2-2+, Her2-3+. (Sometimes one of the two tests will give you one result and the other test will give you a different result. One of the tests is considered more accurate than the other, but both are subjective. I think they are both staining tests, where they stain a bit of your tumor with a reagent and then the pathologist sort of judges what percentage of your tumor cells have Her2 receptors, often with the help of a computer, but I'm not sure about that.) Her2-0 literally means no Her2 receptors on your tumor cells, hence \"Her2-zero.\" Her2-1+ means a small number of Her2 receptors on your tumor cells. Her2-2+ means a moderate number of Her2 receptors. Her2-3+ means you have a lot of Her2 receptors, also said you \"overexpress\" Her2, or it is also said that Her2 is \"overamplified.\" ONLY IN THIS CASE are you called \"Her2 positive.\" If your path report simply states your tumor is Her2 positive, or \"overexpresses\" Her2, or Her2 is \"amplified,\" that means you are Her2-3+. Her2-0, Her2-1+ and Her2-2+ are all called Her2-negative, but in reality Her2-1+ and Her2-2+ are Her2-low because they have a small number of Her2 receptors. It was previously thought that Herceptin would only help patients that overexpress Her2, meaning those who are Her2-3+. Now they are testing to see if it actually helps people who are \"Her2-negative but low Her2\" meaning Her2-1+ and Her2-2+. The small studies they've done so far indicate it just might. But it is controversial in the onc. field. That's why they are doing the phase III trial. Dr. Soon Paik is the researcher who has been spearheading this research for past x number of years. Her2-0 (Her2-zero) means Herceptin is definitely of no use to you. Neither are some of the vaccines currently in trial, because they operate on the Her2 protein. BUT nevertheless, to be Her2-0 is a great thing. Her2 makes your cancer more aggressive, and the more Her2 you have the more aggressive your tumor is likely to be. Patients who are Her2-0 are often 100% ER+ which has the best prognosis as doctors have really figured out how to stop estrogen in the body. I think at least 80% of breast cancers have SOME Her2 receptors. edited to add: Sometimes a path report will state the Her2 test shows an \"equivocal\" result of Her2-2+. That means you are on the borderline between Her2 positive and Her2 negative. It's not an exact science.",

You want to be on top of your nausea meds and your diarrhea / constipation meds and your neulasta / neupogen shots. I gave myself my shots the day after chemo. Keep antibacterial gel with you and use it. Stay away from people. Stay home.  AC is harder for most people than T. I was on the couch the whole time I was on AC. But I never got very nauseated and never threw up. Mostly just really, really tired. And I walked about a mile to and from chemo each time, except one time when I was too tired. I never cared one bit about losing the hair. I'm jealous of your 4 nodes.  I wish I had only had 4 nodes. ",

Then put in all the other things about the tumor and also don't forget to put her treatment. Then a graph will be created that will show mortality risk. The darkest red line is the one to look at, as that's the one that shows the risk of her dying from her cancer. This calculator doesn't talk about stage and doesn't ask for stage -- and it doesn't matter. ",

Not your spouse obviously, but everyone who is not your spouse or child? Just wondering. I think when the stage IV dx finally comes (see my post above this one), I'll keep it a secret from my family and friends. I think, why bum everyone out? It'll be sad enough for me and my guy. No one else can do anything about it, so why make them carry the sadness too? At least for a while, until I see how treatments pan out. If I do well and get to NED, who needs to know? I am very private and not everyone in my birth family is super supportive. As for my few close friends, I just want to continue to hang with them without them worrying or pitying or being bummed out. I guess I'd like to try to pretend I don't have stage IV BC for as long as I can. Just wondering if I'm an outlier thinking that way.

Doc says a new pathway has activated. I knew it would happen eventually. I just was hoping - with all the extra treatments I've been enduring for the past 2.5 years - that I could stave it off a good while longer. You know, give time for more research/treatments/drugs to hit the market. And to make matters worse the 28 cells are deemed to be triple negative. So that's new for me and not good to hear.

After that I think it will be the NeuVax vaccine for HLA type A2 positive patients to reduce recurrence, which is also only about one year in to the phase III trial. (And this year, 2013, they are starting a trial giving both Herceptin and the NeuVax vaccine to low Her2 patients at the same time!) The frustrating thing right now is that the science is moving much faster than the human trials can move. Vaccines, nanotechnology, new drugs based on gene mutations -- it's happening very fast in the labs.

As a stage IIIC patient, with 11 positive nodes and LVI and nodes busting open and other bad things - he started treating me as if I was already stage IV in hopes of keeping me from going to stage IV. I made it four years before these CTCs showed up, so I suppose we did pretty well. He's been giving me treatments beyond standard of care - after I finished standard of care AC+T, he put me on more chemo at stage IIIC based on my Caris Report. Also he used the Her2 equivocal status of my largest lymph node from a second path report on my lymph node to get me approved for Perception. (Primary breast tumor was Her2 negative.) He has a real interest in and understanding of the science - he's not just someone who likes the 9 to 5 of being an onc and just does what ASCO guidelines say to do. I really like that. But he's not very conveniently located for me and he's 75. And he has his own small clinic but does not participate in any clinical trials. So I'm looking for backup names, just so that I can be prepared for the future. I can go anywhere in the world, but prefer to stay in the U.S. or Canada. Europe is very doable for me too. (I have dual U.S. / E.U. citizenship.) But really I'd consider anywhere. I'm looking for someone who thinks outside the box a bit. I like that my current onc does frequent scans, TMs every visit, genetic testing from Caris and Foundation One, CTCs, treatment beyond ASCO standard of care, and isn't afraid to get on the phone with the insurance company to get treatments paid for. I also feel like he's really fighting for me. He's positive, and encouraging, and even with a high CTC count he says he's determined to keep me alive for 10+ years, and by then maybe there will be new treatments that will keep me going even as long as 20 years. Maybe he's blowing smoke - I don't know - but I prefer it to the somber oncs who say get your affairs in order. I'd also welcome someone who is in a location that does clinical trials as it seems like that will be a part of my future. And of course I'd like to find someone who has a lot of patients who are long-term survivors of MBC ! I'm not asking people to post names publicly. Please p.m. me if you have an onc or know of an onc you can enthusiastically recommend. Name and location, and anything you'd like to tell me about him or her or them. I'd really appreciate it. I'm trying to be proactive and do my research before I get the official stage IV dx. Of course you can toot your onc's horn publicly or at least the cancer center you go to, if you want to. Thanks, TS",

However, I just want to say that a tiny percentage of patients who have distant mets and are considered stage IV respond so well to treatment that they become NED and stay NED for the rest of their lives and live out a normal lifespan. It is about 1-2% of stage IV patients but it does happen. My own onc. has a patient who is stage IV and had mets in several organs and she has been NED since 2004 or 2005. Yes, it's true! He also says it's vitally important to kills cancer when it is as small and immature as possible because the apoptosis pathways are still open. It's easier to kill off small immature tumors than well established tumors. Also - very important - google oligometastases. And you will see that there is a subset of metastasis that may be considered curable. It's still in the debate stage but check it out. You may be one of the lucky ones who got the right chemo at the right time. I say hope.",

I guess it's because the aromatase inhibitors and tamoxifen work so well. And because there are no triple-negative cells to escape and wreak havoc. So I just wanted to see if some of you longterm survivors were in that category. I see you mostly were! But even though one-quarter of my tumor's cells were ER-negative I'm not freaking out. And those of you who have lower ER+ numbers shouldn't either. I figure the chemo will get the ER- cells if they are the ones that are floating around, and the Femara will get the ER+ cells if they are the ones floating around. That's my hope anyway. Still I'm jealous of you 100% ladies! ;-) ",

Are you inclined to look into any of the vaccine trials going on? I think there are some for stage IV patients. I'm in one for stage III and my doctor who's overseeing it was a researcher at NIH for a long time. She told me she is \"very optimistic\" about vaccines for breast cancer and she said she personally has witnessed stage IV patients go into remission from vaccine treatment and stay there -- so far anyway. I think most of the vaccine trials for stage IV require measurable disease, so it sounds like it may be too late for you anyway. ",

Most breast cancer patients don't have that many detectable mutations. That's not to say that it isn't great news and could lead to improved immunotherapy options for many more patients. I was very excited and happy to read it and super psyched for her. But I think it's important to understand she is maybe not a typical patient (according to my oncologist).

He says he's seen too many people recur after stopping the hormonal therapies. Unfortunately my big problem is I have the TP53 mutation - rather rare in ER+ BC - which is resistant to hormonal, chemo, and radiation therapies. And recently they found TP53 proteins in my blood, which could only have come from residual cancer. Probably micro mets somewhere in me. So my risk of recurrence is extraordinarily high.

Showed up on my Foundation One report (or maybe it was the Caris report, I can't remember.) They just also found it in my circulating DNA in my blood plasma (genetic test from Guardant Health) which I guess means I do have residual disease in me -- since TP53 can only come from cancer cells, not from healthy cells. So I guess Stage IV here I come eventually.... However, I will say this. I take Simvastatin because I read early in my journey that it might be cancer killing or cancer blocking. Now I read that it might specifically block the unchecked growth of TP53. If you have the TP53 mutation, you might google P53 and simvastatin and see what you think. ",

Linda, yes, I do know what the two new mutations are and there is a targeted therapy for one of them. I'm starting it right away. He's happy that we found the CTCs right away, before any distant mets showed up, and that we are going to target them right away. If people can get to NED from visible tumor loads, maybe I can get to \"NED\" from just detectable CTCs. For the other mutation that Foundation One detected in the CTCs, there are no drugs. But maybe the first one will work. I'm doing a few other things like fasting for a few days to try to stress the cancer cells and make them more susceptible to the drugs. We shall see. For now I'm saying my scans are clean and I'm still stage IIIc. What can we do but hang on? I believe there are new therapies around the corner. My onc says the clinical trials move much faster than they did ten years ago. Also he thinks we're close to being able to treat stage IV BC as a chronic disease like diabetes. I don't know about that. He's a glass-half-full kind of guy. These two articles give me some hope: http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/health-pro... http://www.wired.com/2015/10/fda-approves-first-vi...  And listen, everyone. If anyone in your life asks you who to donate to for breast cancer research, please keep in mind METAVIVOR.ORG. They are a small all-volunteer charitable organization but they give most of the donations they receive to carefully chosen researchers working towards finding a cure for stage IV BC -- and that funding is desperately needed. (Unlike Komen which if I'm not mistaken has given less than 20% of its grants to research. I would never give to Komen.) Onward.",

And you are being diagnosed now, in 2016, not in 2011. Things are even better now. Everyone is scared, everyone cries (I think), everyone freaks out and can't believe it is happening. But most people do well and survive and even thrive. Not everyone, but most people. You have some hard jobs ahead of you, but this is life. You can do it. So come here often, ask lots of questions, and hang in there. SOOOOO many people have gone through what you are going through now. No one can promise you everything will be okay. But take it one day at a time and don't borrow trouble. You don't know what you don't know. There is so much reason to be optimistic. ",

I met a man in infusion last week who had three tumors on his pancreas - the dreaded and deadly pancreatic cancer - found in 2007! Yep still going strong six years after a pancreatic cancer dx. Not disease free but still going. Another BC patient I see in infusion was one to two weeks from dying in early May. Literally her organs were shutting down. Her liver function was 15% when she came to see my onc. Within three weeks he had her liver function back up to 40%. She is still going strong. Not feeling that great because of all the high-dose chemo cocktails he's giving her, but alive and coming into the clinic every day and getting good scans showing stability. This is seven months later! So a little bit of bone mets - bah! I bet you and your onc will swat it away and you'll get on with your life. I bet your onc goes for the cure. You are always welcome on these boards.",
