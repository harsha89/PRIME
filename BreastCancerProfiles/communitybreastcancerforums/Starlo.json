You'll find that triple negative is unique in its aggressiveness and may find the Triple Negative group helpful. One piece of advice I have to add is to suck on ice chips while you're receiving chemo that causes mouth sores (like A/C). It's a similar concept to cold capping (reduces blood flow and therefore chemo drug/potential side effect buildup). Not every treatment center will offer, but it is standard protocol at mine and I didn't get any mouth sores (hurray!). Good luck on your journey!",
