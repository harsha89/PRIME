Life has been busy, and back to normal. I ended up having a hysterectomy (kept my ovaries) in July because I was having horrendous periods and endometrial thickening. I have recovered beautifully from that, but am on to the next issue. I have had pain in my right femur for about a month. I gave myself longer than the two week rule, and finally went in once I couldn't sleep at night b/c of the pain. I had x rays done and the doc called and said there is sclerotic bone where the pain is. She has ordered a bone scan for Monday. I am beyond scared. More so than when I was first dx. Getting through this is hard, and I am asking for prayers for a clean scan. Anyone else have this happen? Love, Hugs, and Hope to you all. Shannon",
