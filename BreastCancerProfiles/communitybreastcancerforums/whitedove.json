Why is it that I often get the sense that many of us feel like we have to reinvent the wheel with each step of the process?  There should be a more streamlined line of communication. As far as insurance coverage, Genomic Health , the oncotype testing company, had to fight for my insurance carrier to pay for the testing. I had not requested the test, it was automatically ordered, as was Braca Testing.  To add to the whole surgery/TE/cancer experience, I had to wait to find out if I would end up with the testing unpaid.  Suffice to say it caused much dreadful anxiety. Finally, after much deliberation, the company paid, stating that as the patient, I was not in a position to refuse the test. (duh!)",

The \"total eradication of microscopic cancer cells\" echoes the old way of thinking behind the history of the brutalizing radical mastectomy that used to be the industry norm. Women would have their entire chest muscles, all lymph nodes and all their breast tissue *gone* after waking up from surgery for even the most minimal breast cancer. Today things are fortunately so much more forward-thinking. The path report is what ensures the NSM is clear. Of course you cannot measure every last skin cell, but by factoring in clean margins, BRACA testing,  oncotype score, and sentinel node biopsy, the doctors can better weigh the numbers. BC is never about being 100% certain, no illness is, but is about odds, weighing in for the more positive outcome. Each one must respect one's limits but I believe it is helpful to be open to possibilities. Now we know that NSM can not only preserve the breast but become a lifesaving procedure that minimizes the physical and psychological trauma to the patient. I would definitely recommend that women who are eligible should research & consider it.",

I know & agree that NSM is only offered to those who are eligible. Women should  inquire whether NSM or SSM is available to them and not assume that because one surgeon does not do it that their options are null! How many times have I heard of patients and even doctors who know little about NSM or didn't even know it existed! Let's continue to spread the good word about NSM and hope to help more women find the cutting edge treatments that maximize success with their treatment and minimize BC's assaults to one's body image. Correct - Not everyone will be considered to be a good candidate for NSM.",

I would hope future recipients contemplating this do not get discouraged by that statement.  It is also untrue that most NSM recipients need constant monitoring after surgery. This reason alone is why I chose to have the NSM/BMX. I kinda just wanted to be done with BC so factoring in my prognosis, I chose a BMX. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18291263 Nipple Sparing & Skin Sparing Mastectomy with Immediate Breast Reconstruction is safe with a comparatively low local recurrence rate and the same distant recurrence rate as for breast conserving surgery and total mastectomy. Moreover, it results in objective cosmetic outcome and patient satisfaction as good as those for breast conserving surgery, and greater patient satisfaction with body image than that for total mastectomy.",

I am not sure if you are getting NSM, but the post-surgery advice is really helpful there.  You might also want to check out \"Exchange City\" for there are many wise sisters there! I had a BMX this year and finished my exchange this summer.  Hang in there! Hopefully soon you will forget you had surgery and will be feeling back to normal. I know I feel like that and it's only been 3 months since exchange. 1) Clothes that helped with drains: Several sets of  Yoga Pants with Front Pockets; Matching Hoodie with inside pockets (from Target). Easy dressing and great for carrying drains when going out. 2) Have someone to wash your hair for the first few weeks if you can. If not, treat yourself to visits to the hairdressers. Moving your arms will be tough. 3) Shower hose + small stool to sit on in tub for bathing 4) Alcohol prep pads to help \"milk\" the drains. Grip the drain with the pad & slide them down the drains and they clean easily. The nurses in hospital taught me that great trick. 5) Several supportive bras (for day and night) that have front closure. I used sports bras with zippers and hooks in front. 6) Pajamas & clothes that open in front 7) Good quality scented soaps, shampoos and creams to make you feel pampered and pretty. 8) Several new bedsheets + pillowcases to stave off bedroom boredom. 9) DVDs of shows you love; good books. 10) Small laptop table with wheels to put near bed so you can have a \"bed-desk\" (IKEA) 11) Variety of small pillows of different firmness. I slept with arms and legs supported by pillows for a few weeks. I am sure I this list is not exhaustive.  Best wishes to you and may your surgery and recovery be filled with comfort and positivity.",
