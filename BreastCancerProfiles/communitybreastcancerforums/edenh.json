    "Content": "Mar 6, 2010 11:51AM - edited Mar 6, 2010 11:52AM by edenh I too wanted to miss a day because of a field trip at my son's school. I just rescheduled the time of my treatment. So, I didn't end of missing any time. I have finished 10 out of 33 so far, talk to your doctor, I'm sure you can miss one day.  Good Luck ",
