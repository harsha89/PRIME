Your post clarifies things. Just finished 6 of 16 treatments.  I am sticking with my Fruit of the Earth 100% Aloe Vera Gel.  I will be trying some Lansinoh for my cracked irritated nipple though.  The nipple thing has been the worst part for me so far-am wondering whether anyone else experienced this and whether they used the Aloe Vera Gel on their nipples too or a different product.  ",

Just out of curiosity, why would you consider having a mastectomy to avoid radiation? I would consider the mastectomy to get out of chemo but from what I've heard radiation is easier. I have not been to see a radiation oncologist yet since I just had my surgery 3 days ago, so I'm probably not aware of what all the side effects are at this point.",

      "Content": "Jan 2, 2012 05:30PM - edited Jan 2, 2012 10:44PM by anne67 Hi Everyone, just had my lumpectomy for DCIS on 12/30 and was told I will start radiation in about 3 weeks.  My mom had breast cancer at 48, colon cancer at 58 and a few incidences of skin cancer since then.  I knew cancer would find me one of these days but did not imagine that it would be at age 44. That said, I feel lucky that my cancer was caught so early.  My mom had a 50/50 chance of survival 23 years ago, and thanks to great doctors, very agressive chemo and an unwavering positive attitude she is in excellent health at age 68. Looking forward to getting advice and support from others who are going through this too! I am lucky in that I do not need chemo, but I will be starting tamoxifen, so if anyone has any advice for preparing for radiation or knows what side effects I can expect from tamoxifen, let me know.",
