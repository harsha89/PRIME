In OctoberÂ  07 I had my first followup mamogram scan and ultrasound to check on a lump. The thing is that I didnt notice much in the way of after affects of the radiation untill after the mamogram. The breast und underarm area has become more tender verging on soreness since then. I am due for another followup mamogram in two weeks , and I am concerned about the outcome re increased pain or tissue damage . I can deal with the discomfort if I know it is normal and is not caused by further damage. Has anyone else experienced increased pain following radiation then mamogram? Log in to post a reply",
