I'm looking at 2nd diagnosis of dcis stage 0 in the other breast and have been given the option of partial breast rad.  Already hadfull breast radiation  on the right in 03.  Feeling very uneasy about doing whole breast or just partial.  Onc said he would let me do it if it meant i chose that over no radiation, but now i'm wondering.... Anyone out there been looking at this?  Insurance won't cover the brachiatherapy/ seed radiation thingie.....but still with partial i would only have to go for a week in total 2x's a day..... I think i'm ready for a sex change operation LOL!",
