      "Content": "Apr 28, 2010 11:52AM - edited Apr 28, 2010 02:08PM by fg2000 Hello ladies, Had my first dose of A/C on 4/23. Days 1 - 3 following infusion were actually pretty normal, much to my surprise, with the exception of some difficulty sleeping the first couple of nights. I took Emend, Zofran and Dexamethasone the day of and two days following the infusion. The drugs seem to have done their job as I did not get sick once while taking them. Haven't taken any of my other drugs for naseau yet. Felt a little queasy here and there, but haven't actually thrown up. Yesterday (day 4) was a ROUGH day. Pretty scary. I was extremely achey all over and had no energy whatsoever. Literally felt like I had been hit by a truck like so many others have said. Thankfully, though, still no throwing up. . . Got up this morning - day 5, and feel like a totally different person. It is amazing what a difference a day makes.  One of my nurses told me day 9 is usually the roughest. I sure hope she's wrong. My question is have some of you gone up and down as the days have gone on? In other words, have you felt fine, then crappy, then fine, crappy etc? Or once you had a crappy day or two, was it uphill from there? Good luck to all of you going through treatment. We're going to get through this!",

I have found that I can make some beautiful wraps very easily with my serger in just a few minutes. Basically, I have been buying about a yard of material, then I cut it to either 32 or 34\" squares and simply serger the ends. I love vintage costume jewelry, rhinestone pins in particular, and have found that these work nicely as accents on the headwraps. When I get some time, I will post some pics of the ones I have made and also some of the storebought ones I have purchased. In addition, scrunchies work very well with these. Just pull the tails through the scrunchy to keep the wrap in place.",

I haven't told him about my illness yet as I do not want to upset him during his exams. He has so much on his plate the way it is. I think the biggest fear for me so far has been breaking this news to my kids, husband and other family members. If I am fortunate enough to feel and look well during his visits, I will be so thankful, as I know it will be so much easier on him.  He is only a couple of hours away and will be coming home regularly throughout the summer months too, as he'll only be taking classes a couple of days a week over the summer. So far, my daughter seems to be doing fine, but I too worry about her, once I begin to lose my hair and get further into treatment.",
