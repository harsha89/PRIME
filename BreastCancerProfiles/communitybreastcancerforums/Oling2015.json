We been had 5chemo done but her cancer is already spread. Hurt to say her liver is not functioning anymore couses of hard to breath. She is in my country in Philippines so I can barely help her except try to cover financial needed... Her doctor was supposed to do last chemo last month April 20 but coz of her situation they cancel and the doctor not sure if he still gonna do a chemo on her until she will not able to stand and can handle the chemo. Now my 2sister taking care of her at home but they are not traine to taking care of cancer patient like my sister. We don't know how to help her, encadrage her to also try to be more strong which is we know she is. She feel the most terrible pain the whole time.
