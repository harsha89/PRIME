I had my rock bottom days so often now, Hugs!!!! 🤗 🤗🤗🤗 I have an uneventful Long infusion day, when I got home it's almost 4 pm. I'm going to try to eat smaller meals and make sure I have something in the stomach this time hopefully I don't have nausea anymore. Trying to eat good so my wbc won't drop so much. Not sure what to do but will try. I tried to make an appointment with ear and nose specialist but the front desk won't make it until she can talk to the doctor. I really dont understand why? I saw him before! Hope everyone have a good weekend and not much SE .",

Now I have to do manual massage daily and it isn\u2019t effective at all. I got my fluid back and I know I have couple months of PT ahead of me now. I'm going #20 of my 30 radiation today. Skin turned red and breast became tender, also I have a small break on my nipple. RO gave me telfa pad to put on top so nothing can rub on it. My fear is today radiation on the break would it be painful or not? I forgot to ask yesterday. As Teese said, this is manageable, just pray won't get worse. I'm on FB a lots and I do come to this website daily, I'm trying to help the new comers as I got helps when I first came here. Now I'm thinking more about the future after radiation, I might go back to work part time again but I know my husband doesn't want me to. I'm still trying to figure what to do. ",

My sister in law told me to eat liver also, ok I might give it a try this weekend. She told me to make liver water with ginger so I drink the water instead of eating the liver.

Today I can't, it happens close to the end of taxol infusion. My heart beats went to 101 so I informed the nurse so they stopped the infusion and let my heart slow down to normal before they can finish up. So next round they will slow down the drip speed so it might help. I hope every have a good weekend",

I actually have Zofran and Compazine, I take Zofran every 8 hours and Compazine as needed. Compazine actually made me sleepy. For temperatures I usually measure my temperature on my bad days make sure I don't have infection. I was blessed I only had 99 and I felt fine so I didn't take anything, I got half of the cvs in my house, also I use a lot of epsom salt I soak my hands and feet every night.  ",

So you should have less SE. When you have taxol or taxotere, neuropathy doesn\u2019t mean tingling only, numbness is one major SE. I didn\u2019t have much tingling but all my fingertips got numb so did my feet. If your numbness got so bad, you might lose your balance. Also neuropathy damage might be permanent damage that\u2019s what my MO told me. You can read about neuropathy permanent damage thread in this website.

On the third and fourth infusion, your body is pretty weak it will be hard to work for the first week after infusion. That's my experience, everyone SE is different, maybe you have minimal SE. ",

As SDKB said try to do some stretching that might help some. That\u2019s terrible to suffer all this pains plus your itchy head. Hang in there, you are closer to the end. SDKB, congrats closer to the end of your chemo. Please keep in mind, the last chemo kick butts. Many ladies got sick after the last infusion, it hits the hardest. I finished 20/30 radiation and skin turned red and nipple got very sensitive. My RO only wants me to use Miaderm lotion for my treated breast so I can\u2019t use other. Sometime I put Aquaphor on top of Miaderm at night. I load up lotion 4 times a day only 10 more sessions to go. I will keep you ladies posted so you can get ready.  ",

I finished my chemo 11/10 with AC + T, I will share with you some of my experiences if you have time you can go back to visit the threads so you can see how our journeys. AC, my major SE was fatigue, GI issues, mouth sores, lost all my hair and appetite. Other people had joints pains due to White Cell shots and nausea. Keep in mind, stay on top of nausea, take your meds before you feel uncomfortable. Also take Claritin before your shot so your pains will not be that bad, mouth sore, you want to use baking soda/salt as mouth wash for every meals. I use a soft toothbrush during chemo time. Your mouth will get very sensitive. My bad days for AC was day 4-6. Keep in mind more you move around less fatigue. So do your walking as much as you can, hopefully daily. If you want to know about taxol SE, I can come back to let you know. Believe me there is light at the end of the tunnel. I\u2019m doing radiation now, and almost half way there. If you feel emotionally down, do take Ativan and vent in here, we all understand because we are going through the same path. ",

From what I saw, it is mostly lost of appetite, bone pains and constripstion also. You might want to pick a soft toothbrush because your gums might get sensitive.
