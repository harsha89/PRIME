They would rather me be here for a few more years, with a poor quality of life than live a year with no chemo-fueled side effects. i dunno. death doesn't sound so bad to me sometimes\u2026but the guilt in admitting that to the couple folks that love me is stifling. ",

Diagnosed with DCIS in right breast, had a sentinel node dissection and a lumpectomy and intra operative radiation, and that was in 2003. I was fine for 10 years - I was a goddam Amazon! No one was stronger or more athletic than me in my age group (40-50) I was physically fit and so carefree...sigh. I ate healthily, we're talking tofu and veggies and brown rice and  I exercised every day for decades, rode my bike, walked, lifted weights, although, I did drink a lot of beer and smoke weed with my sister when I moved in with her in 2012 (then we'd eat decedent munchies and giggle like little girls) so I wasn't perfect.  Then, in 2013, right before my 50th birthday, I had what I thought was a bad cold. Must be too much pot, I thought. I was Coughing a lot, my lungs ached, and I was bringing up blood. And this super annoying aching in my right shoulder, plus, shoot, I couldn't run my daily 5 miles without getting winded. That was weird.  So I went to the doc, and he ordered a chest x-ray. Called me back that afternoon with the bad news. Dozens of lung mets. Get yourself to the Onc, asap.  I was shocked. Me? I'm a Friggin' Amazon, this can't happen to ME!!  That was over a year ago, the mets spread to my liver and here I sit humbly in my beloved rumpled bed, after 3 failed treatments during 2013-2014, with the same painful ache in my right shoulder, (plus lymphedema, thanks to my ignorance in what arm to stab when going through all this) a chronic pain in my liver, and I am \"looking forward\" to the next round of Gemzar (chemo) which will hopefully prevent some of those sneaky cancer cells from chewing up the rest of my insides.  Oh, and my long-term lover also decided to make wedding plans the day we found out cancer returned. I moved in with him after losing the debate of the futility of that scene. He thinks he has limited time with me, so he wants me next to him for as long as I live. I didn't want him to see me like this, physically...He says he loves me more each day.  so, yeah. I was cocky too. Not anymore. Sheesh, what a tough way to learn humility.  I gotta go make some brownies.  hugs to all you beautiful ladies. ",
