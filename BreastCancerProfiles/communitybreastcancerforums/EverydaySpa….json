I started on this journey on Dec 3rd when I went to my ob/gyn when I found a lump in my left breast. I'm a Medical Assistant so of course my mind went running but I honestly didn't panic until I was told I needed to have a biopsy. My head started spinning and as the radioloigist talked to me I couldn't believe what I was hearing.... cancer, stage, surgeon, CANCER!! That day feels like forever ago but when I think about it, it's not really that long. I've researched and learned so much on sites like this. I've educated myself on the medical stuff and the real life experience stuff but the best thing I've learned here is that there are a lot of survivors out there!! Take things one step at a time... don't look too far into the future. Staying strong and positive depends on not getting stressed and overwhelmed. That goes for anything in life but especially something like this. My thought and prayers are with you :)",
