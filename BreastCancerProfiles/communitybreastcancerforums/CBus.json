Although the procedure was painless and the immediate discomfort less than I expected, I had a lot of swelling. In the first two weeks it was a cherry sized lump at the needle insertions site and a 1+in swollen oval area deep in the breast where the needle had penetrated. I had no redness or fever. I found that heat helped make the breast feel better at this point. The lumps are getting noticeably smaller now one month out. The core biopsy needle is not small and it may take more time than you think for the site to heal. When I breast fed my breasts were swollen and lumpy too. That may add to your feeling of swelling. I hope you continue to recover.",
