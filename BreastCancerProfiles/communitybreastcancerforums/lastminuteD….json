What about calling your oncologist and speaking with him/her - speak to a nurse to push the phone call?  Who usually sends you for scans?  Do you have a regular physician that you could call for info?  Seems like EVERYONE that I've ever seen gets copies of my tests. I had the BRAC test (whatever the letters are) way back in summer 06 and the results were back in a couple weeks; my oncologist called me with the results and that was it.................. I believe the counselor just goes over your family history etc to see if the test is warranted and then over the results and any recommendations.  Not sure if it's different where you are. I'm sure someone more knowledgeable will be along soon, but I would be on the phone being insistent!! Big hugs!  Let us know what's going on - you KNOW we're all in your corner!! Dawn",

I am in the June 2007 Chemo group - had 4 rounds of A/C (once every 3 wks) and am having #4 of 12 weekly Taxol/Herceptin tomorrow morning, will continue the Herceptin and have 6 1/2 weeks of rads.  So far, so good.  I can say that I had more side effects with the A/C but I also have to say that I didn't have nearly as many as a lot of the girls in our group.  The T/H has given me some heartburn and some bathroom changes but overall my head is clearer and my fatigue isn't too bad.  I'm still working about 6 hours a day and have been able to keep up at home.  I have no clue about the Taxotere................... For me, the time spent at appointments (bloodwork on Thursday afternoon and treatment on Friday - I'm using vacation days for all 12) is the biggest problem and that's mostly mental - feels like I'm rushing through everyday to get to the next appointment.  Guessing rads will feel similar with the everyday appointments.  Can't wait for all this to be over and can't wait for my hair to grow back!! :) Best of luck, Dawn",

DebbieM - I am dealing with a local recurrence right now.  It was very hard to hear that I had cancer again but my .2cm IDC w/no node involvement didn't warrant chemo last year so when I found the new lump in my reconstructed breast just as I was finishing up with reconstruction that turned out to be 3.5cm IDC - now my oncologist is hitting me with all the chemo and rads and I'll be doing herceptin till next summer.  Hopefully, this will do the trick since my PET scan was clear, BUT, I know from reading that many women live and thrive with whatever stage they have and even continuing with some kind of chemo forever and I have to hope and pray that I continue on.  I certainly have moments of despair (my poor husband usually gets to hear them!!  ) but I am a glass half full person and go on.  Don't get me wrong, I'm scared of what the future holds but I'm determined to fight till the end, whenever that is.  I look at my 85 year old grandmother and wonder if I'll make it to that age and then I think I better take better care of myself since she has arthritis pretty bad.....totally forgetting about cancer for the length of my thought.  Anyway, it is scary but please don't let it consume you.

Garnetanne - congrats on the step aerobics!!  I've been averaging a half hour - 3x a week on the treadmill and my onc said to aim for at least 5x when I whined about gaining weight...................It does make me feel better the days I drag my butt out of bed!! Hope everyone is having a good week!  I'm so glad that fall is finally here!!  I have #9 of 12 taxol/herceptin this Friday!  Dawn",

Cyndi - so glad the UTI is gone!  Terry - I had a small opening after my re-excision this past April for the recurrence that took almost 6 weeks to heal - wasn't big enough to postpone chemo but if it hadn't healed the surgeon would have re-opened it a bit, removed scar tissue and stitched it back to allow it to heal correctly.  Let us know what's up! Debbie K - Happy Halloween indeed!!  More than once I have hoped it was April Fools Day!!  :)  Let us know what it's like!! Trish & Watson - Thanks for checking in on us!  Congrats on being survivors - it's so good to hear! Gracie & Kathleen - when I was first dx, I didn't want to do more surgery than needed and left the healthy breast.  I chose reconstruction with the mastectomy (surgery was 2/9/06) - I just couldn't see myself waking up with a D on one side and zippo on the other.  That surgery was the only one I had to stay overnight in the hospital for, but I was not in pain and I started the stretching asap and had no issues with my shoulder.  I chose a silicone implant and my ps filled it with 200 ccs during the surgery.  My pathology came back with a .2cm IDC so on 2/22 I went back in for an axillary dissection - 5 nodes - all clear.  No chemo because .2cm is so small and no rads since mast.  Started Tamoxifen.  Fills went well except the one that she put 100ccs in and I was pretty sore the next few days so we did 60 ccs at a time for the rest - went to 750ccs.  Finished fills and \"rested\" for a couple months.  7/18 had the exchange surgery and a lift on my healthy breast for symetry.  Outpatient - no pain, even my healthy side.  Only problem I had was the tegaderm that was covering both breasts because my youngest made state all stars for baseball and we went to see him play in 90 degree weather and I was sweating and the tegaderm drove me nuts so I had to take it off a few days early!!  Had nipple reconstruction in mid October - outpatient - very weird but not painful.  My ps has patients keep a hard cover over it for two months for protection - she uses part of a syringe - where the finger holds are - sort of like a hat.  Worked great but looks horrible under clothes!!  the tattoo was done in her office in January; she numbed me cuz I'm such a baby and then I had her touch it up in early March.  That is when I found the lump that turned out to be a recurrence when I was putting lotion on...................... I also did the BRCA test because I don't know much about my biological fathers side - mine came back negative.  Big relief! Let me know if anyone has any questions or if I confused you!! Dawn",

YEAH!!  The benedryl seemed to hit me harder this week since the steriods weren't fighting back as much so I was more tired the rest of the day.  Oh well - I'd rather be sleepy than getting chubbier. So far I've lost about 3/4 of my brows and lashes.  Hopefully the rest will hang in there so I have some kind of guide for my pencils!!  I never really stopped shaving my legs - but the time between sure was nice and now it's getting closer and I'm growing everywhere else again too.  Oh well. It is so nice to hear family stories and about how everyone is doing.  Thank you all for continuing to share and being there.

I'm glad to hear that your daughter is okay - scary when they call you after an accident.  My daughter had one several years back and the car was totaled but as long as they are ok - cars can be replaced! I am so ready for spring as well.  My oldest sons gf is doing weight watchers - she has lost 25 pounds so far.  Of course, she's only 22 so I think it is easier at that age (I think I remember back that far!)  The nurse practitioner I saw today just got back from an obesity conference - they were going over how women with breast cancer going through chemo with steroids gain weight especially around the middle faster than women just going through menopause.................... we of course could have told her all that!! Anyway, I told her to let me know what she learned when we can have more time or by email. Bonnie - your ps sounds like mine - calms me down quite often!  Our boys are pretty close in age.  I miss my daughter but she lives close by so it's not too bad.  enough typing.............work is going to be rough!  Lots of backspacing to fix typos!!

Definitely a balancing act.  The other hard thing is all of the conflicting info out there!!  UGH.  Check in about your side and what you find out about nutrition! Dawn",

Linda - I can't wait to get this port out either but I can't think about that till Fall - after I'm done with herceptin.  let us know how your tests go. I went to my oncologist with my mom and dad yesterday.  Mom has metastatic pancreatic cancer.  Since it has already spread she is stage 4.  She'll start gemzar infusions on Monday - 3 weeks on, 1 week off.  Will do scans after 3 cycles to see if the cancer is shrinking etc.  Onc explained that people feel better doing the chemo than not doing the chemo and it's all about quality of life at this point since it's not curable.  I read that most pancreatic cancers aren't found early stage because the organ is behind other organs and pains are usually attributed to other things until it's too late.  I gave my parents a tour of the infusion center and my two favorite nurses came running out to hug me.  They were very welcoming and gave mom some info on the gemzar.  Whole room was totally empty since it was almost 5 pm but I remember all too well the info overload and deer in the headlights feeling so I'm hoping to make them as comfortable as I can.  Guess we are in for some heavy conversations.................. my 86 year old grandmother (mom's mom) is beside herself.  My uncle (her other child) died of a massive heart attack back in 98.  I can't imagine outliving one of my kids let alone all of them - or at least that is what it seems will happen. One of the girls on the December radiation thread said I win the Rudolf award with my burns............................ I love Christmas so I said I'd take the award with a big grin!  My skin is tender and still peeling in a couple places but it is healing and I'm able to wear clothes without having a cushy pad in between.  I go back on Tuesday the 29th (my 46th bday - OMG!!) and I think she'll release me then.  I didn't get the bath salts made last weekend - will have to get that done this weekend.

With my first dx I had the mast, axillary dissection, reconstruction and tamoxifen.  Just as I was healing from a tattoo color touch-up to my new areola and reconstructed nipple, I felt a bump near my scar tissue that just didn't feel like the rest of my scar tissue.  Had a biopsy within two days and found out I had a recurrence that was much larger than my first cancer.  I had a clear PET Scan and headed into surgery again to remove it and then had chemo (herceptin through August) and radiation so my timing is different than most.  Radiation was harder for me than chemo - sounds weird I know.  My rad onc was very aggressive with my treatment - ended up with 28 full treatments with the use of a bolus every time and 5 additional full treatments (these weren't boosts, just didn't do more of the supraclavical area) also with the bolus every time - I had 2nd and 3rd degree burns that have healed nicely and gave me a very interesting tanline that is fading!!  I was quite toasty!!   My implant seems fine to me and I'm guessing I'll have another breast MRI later in the year to compare with the one I had in November before I started rads.  I was supposed to see my plastic surgeon in January but since I was just finishing and sore as you know what, I haven't been back yet.  Plus, I'm having a new issue with pains under my ribs (same side).  Going for a chest/abdominal ct scan Friday - several nurses have said gall bladder............. as long as it's not cancer again.  Going for an xray of my wrist this afternoon - hurt it moving a couch - thought I just sprained it or whatever but it's been a couple weeks - spread a small blanket through the air and heard a crack so I think I may have a fracture now - it never ends and this was my own fault!! hahahaha I'll let you know what's up!!  How is your DH doing by the way?

Mom's ct scan showed progression - previous lesion a bit bigger, new one started so the onc gave her the choice of doing nothing or trying Xeloda - she chose to continue fighting!!  3 pills 2x a day for 2 wks, off a week and repeat.  Rescan after 9 weeks unless she starts having more symptoms. Me - what a game it's been.  In a nutshell:  1st ct scan showed fatty liver, other organs unremarkable, healed fractured rib with rounded density headed into lung.  Onc asked for pet/ct scan since tumor markers were skewed; I asked for thyroid test - tired, weight gain etc.  Insurance denied pet/ct - onc asked for biopsy - hospital said no cuz they'd have to go through my back or through my implant - onc argued w/ins - ins gave in - pet/ct came back negative for metastatic - says rounded density is a lung contusion associated w/rib fracture - will repeat ct scan in July to check on it.  Normal thyroid is .3 to 3.5 (was 5.5 but has changed) - mine is 128.95 - major hypothyroid!!  had T3 & T4 tested, sent for fasting cholesterol panel - 436 total (not a typo!) started 100 mcg Synthroid 5/1 and can see a difference in my face already (puffiness gone & color better) and my energy is a bit better.  I go 6/4 for a repeat blood test for all of it to see how it's going.  Meanwhile, we are doing a semi south beach diet but I haven't ventured to the treadmill - kind of afraid to till I know my heart is okay!!!  If I walk fast or do much outside - I can FEEL my heart and it freaks me out!!  So, taking it slow.  Oh, and I have an appointment with an orthopedic hand doctor next Friday since my wrist/forearm is still hurting.  Whatever!!!!  At least it isn't anything to do with cancer!!!  Gracie - how is DH?  what's up with your side?  Did you google IBS and find some info?  What about getting an upper endoscopy? Too many questions, huh?  Bonnie - so glad your exchange surgery is over and done with.  I was much more comfortable after that!!  What happened with your exams? what's next?  Melody - allergies suck!!!  did you get some meds?  How was graduation?  Debbie - sounds like you are full speed ahead!!  Lots of info online about different restaurants (some of them are scary!!) and picking healthy foods when dining out. Terry - sounds like we have a lot of the same stuff going on - weather not cooperating with planting flowers!!  graduations!!  woo hoo!!  My oldest son graduates from the Art Institute 6/11 and my youngest son from high school 6/13.  Hope Mother's Day was wonderful for everyone!  Hugs, Dawn",

Insurance sure is a pain in the butt.  I'm hoping you can find coverage easily with low cost! The graduations are this week and the party this Saturday.  We've spent the past couple of days straightening - the kitchen will wait!!  We are all tired but excited with so much going on.  We've been in this house for almost 21 years and have done a lot to the house and yard but waited for the kitchen.  I want to use it for a couple years before we decide to sell it and downsize since all my kids will be out by then. I saw on another post that your PET scan is today!  I'll be thinking about you!  I believe the report gets to the requesting dr within 24 to 48 hours.  Do you need to see the dr for the report or will they tell you over the phone?  I think you should call them so you can find out by the end of the week.  The wait drives me crazy!!  I'm still waiting for my blood report, but I'm not very worried about it.

(OMG - almost 2 years) and then of course I smacked myself because I thought about the women that have been dealing with this for YEARS and will for the rest of their lives!!!  THAT scares the crap outta me!  Thank God the detection and treatments have come this far and only looks like it will improve! This Friday will be #6 of 12 and as long as I stay on track will be done 11/9 and then about a month later will start 6 1/2 weeks of radiation................................are you having rads too? It's so easy to be overwhelmed with all this and you shouldn't apologize for being a downer - we are all here to share and support each other and sometimes we just need a kick in the attitude!!

      "Content": "Oct 2, 2007 06:18PM - edited Oct 2, 2007 06:24PM by lastminuteD Wow!  I go away for a few days and come back to a gazillion posts!!  Actually took a day off from work that didn't involve chemo - spent the weekend at my sister-in-laws bayhouse, went out on their boat, visited friends in VA Beach, saw the sand sculptures at the Neptune Festival and did a little relaxing.  Nice long weekend.  NEED to do this more often! Cyndi - I did not have herceptin with my first dx.  All of my doctors were amazed that the .2cm IDC was even found during pathology since it was so small.  The Hope Coach sounds awesome - hopefully they will expand across the country soon. Terry - I am surprised the tests are so soon after treatment.  Congrats on finishing!  I know you are doing the happy dance!  I can't wait to get my port out - next FALL!   Hope you're feeling better by now from your last treatment - sorry you missed the wedding.  Cancer sure makes us miss out on some fun for awhile but we need to focus on the future! Shrink - Are you receiving decadron or another steriod with your taxol?  Your symptoms sound more like a reaction to those than the benedryl according to the explanations my nurses have given me. Denise - For my 2nd dx - the tumor was in the scar area and my surgeon said he had no doubt it was a local recurrence.  I used to have both of my dx in my signature line but since the board has changed and has the questionaire, I haven't figured out how to add the first one back in!  There is always the possibility of a new primary either in the same breast or the other even w/a mastectomy.  Scary huh?  The longer the time between diagnosis, the more likely it is a new one I've read and they can tell from the pathology report also. Debbie M - losing my typing happens to me A LOT!!  I'll bet that watermelon was yummy!!  My nurse said the herceptin takes 10 minutes for weekly infusion, 20 minutes for bi-weekly and 30 minutes for every three weeks after the first few infusioins which take longer so they can make sure you don't have any reactions and there are no pre-meds!  I think every 3 weeks till next August will work out okay, it just seems so far away!  I will be doing radiation too - 6 1/2 weeks but fortunately the office is a lot closer than Garnetann's!!  One good thing about both of my dx's is no lymph node involvement - I had an axillary dissection w/the first and the pet scan was clear except for my reconstructed breast with the second. Kathleen - I know you are breathing a sigh of relief that it's \"just\" a UTI.  Heal quickly girly.  Hope your counts are jumping back up with the Neupogen. Bonnie - YEAH!!!  You did it!! Love the pictures!  So sweet of your kids to make dinner & dessert in celebration. Garnetann - the 18th will be here before you know it and you'll be doing the Happy Dance!  I can't imagine driving 75 miles to radiation, but you will handle it and the time will fly.  You should bring a recorder to record your thoughts because you will be doing a lot of thinking and planning during the drive. Gracie - Congrats on finishing the Taxol!  You have tests right away too?  I guess I just thought there would be a break..........port out too!!  I am so jealous!!   I know you will find a way to give back - we all will.  Saying a prayer that your scans are clear. Teach - Welcome to our awesome little group!  Good luck with your cousin - hopefully she'll listen soon but I know you'll be there for her when she's ready.  I think you should be assertive about getting your port out - don't let them be wishy washy!! I'll bet your grandson is adorable.  What a book!  Hope I didn't miss anybody.  Wishing everyone a wonderful week!  I feel like I'm on the down side of my taxol/herceptin since this Friday will be #7 of 12!  woo hoo!!

Shrink - I had the steriods during A/C too - not sure if the amount was the same as now with the Taxol/Herceptin but I ask a gazillion questions of my nurses (they LOVE to talk too!! :)) and that is where I got that info about the steriods.  Denise - I guess since my weekly labs & onc appts (once a month) are on Thursday and my infusions are on Friday, my days don't seem as long as yours since you do it all the same day.  Interesting how different offices do different ways............................ Cyndi - skipping rads till after the holidays!  You lucky girl you!!!  My onc said rads would probably start for me a month after the end of Taxol which is 11/9 so this holiday season is going to be CRAZY!!! and I read that if you skip a day, you make it up the next day - one tx in the am and one in the pm!!  Guess that's what they'll do with Christmas and New Years....................UGH.  DebbieK - great to hear that you are feeling good!! Let us know about rads........... Garnetanne - I'm so sorry you are having a rough time - one more to go - you can do it!! :)  Hot flashes suck!!!  Day and night ones!! Gracie - prayers for clear scans for you!! Please let us know. I had #7 of 12 taxol/herceptin on Friday.  Heartburn is probably my biggest complaint, plus weight gain!!  I've been pretty good about hitting the treadmill about 3 times a week - my onc said push for 5.  UGH.  Oh well, maybe it will become a habit!  So far no neuropathy but my feet are drier and itchier although I'm not sure those are side effects.................anybody hear that they are?  5 to go!!  love that number getting smaller!!

Trying to catch up with you all - such a busy time of year and all the radiation treatments on top - UGH.  Christmas was nice - we have lots of family around and used to be able to have both sides over on Christmas day.  Used to.  Now we have several get togethers each year - this year we have 4, one more to go this Saturday. My daughter (25) and her little dog moved out again this weekend as well.  I'm excited for her but you know the count down is on!!  My oldest son (21) will graduate from the Art Institute in June and hopefully will be going to California for an internship with Sony and my baby son (17) will graduate from high school in June and hopefully off to college.  Busy, busy, busy.  I need a nap.  Sounds like everyone is heading in a better direction - especially you shrink!!  Cyndi - taking more drugs is a bummer, but you will get past this too and feel beautiful again. I am so tired of wearing something on my head but until the top fills in like the back and sides all I see in the mirror is that I look like a man!  Better than seeing me as a BALD man but I'm so done with this stuff.  My lashes and brows seem to be growing back as well.  I'm very curious to see what my brows do.  I had them waxed when I was 16 - not sure what the girl did but most of them never grew back and I've had to pencil them ever since (which was good practice for not having any!).  I'm seeing growth where I don't remember there being any and hoping I'll be able to NOT use a pencil but of course have to wait to see.  Hurry up and wait.  Had radiation #23 today!  I'm seeing a light at the end of this part of the tunnel at least!

Mom is doing fairly well, some chemo changes because she came down with bronchitis so they changed her to every other week instead of the 3 weeks on/1 week off to help with counts and she gets a neulasta shot each time as well.  The tissue infection is still a problem but the doctors are trying to get a handle on it. My liver counts were up at the end of January so I'm going Tuesday for a liver function blood workup and see the onc on Thursday.  Hoping and praying it's something easy to fix and not that my cancer has metastisized.  Trying not to think it but you guys know how hard that can be.

You might remember that I'm dealing with a recurrence and I was pretty much done with reconstruction when I found the new lump......... Rewind to last summer when I was scheduling my expander exchange to my silicone implant and planned a lift to my healthy breast for symentry....... I told my surgeon I wanted a mammo on the healthy one cuz I didn't want to have it lifted and then find out from the pathology report that I needed another mastectomy - he thought it was a good idea, gave me the order and off I went.  It was strange just to be having one squished (and a relief!!) but the time between taking the pictures and hearing what the radiologist had to say brought up so many memories of the original diagnosis that I was in tears until I heard that everything was okay.  Forward to this past June when I had the annual mammo on that breast and those 10 minutes or whatever were very stressful again.  I didn't break down till I got in my car..........but my stomach was in such a knot.  I'm guessing every test from now on will be the same - hoping and praying they find nothing but the what if's singing loudly at the same time.  I'm telling myself - one day at a time - enjoy today - yada yada yada but sometimes......................................

The itching I was describing was because I was sweating under the clear tape bandages - but I was on Tamoxifen for 15 months and found it to be very drying to my skin.  Maybe try extra lotion especially after those HOT showers!  I kind of figure the Arimidex has similar side effects as well. My first cancer was er+/pr+ and my recurrence was er-/pr- and both were HER2+++.  Onc isn't concerned with putting me back on hormonals at this point - I guess since I had a recurrence the tamoxifen didn't cut it and she feels that herceptin is going to be my best answer - I'll finish that up by the end of August.  No clue why the change - I did read that sometimes cells become resistant to the tamoxifen.  I trust her immensely though so I only questioned her a gazillion times till I was happy and she was laughing at me.  We have some interesting conversations!! Menopause sucks.  Got a copy of my hormonals, looks like I have less estrogen than an adult male................ and of course, that situation creates others that make for interesting conversations as well!! hahahahaha   UGH! Hope everyone had a good weekend - they are NEVER long enough!  I vote for a 2 day work week and a 5 day weekend!!!  Dawn",

Terry - glad your tests went fine - totally understand about telling them numerous times!!!!!!!!  Sometimes I just want to hold their faces in my hands and make them look me in the eye like I've done with my kids!!!  If you lost weight before, you know you can do it again.  I think I'm a little more determined to get healthy so I can have a better shot at staying that way but it sure doesn't take much to wear me out!  I was go, go, go during all the surgeries, chemo & pretty much rads and it seems to have caught up with me - DANG IT!! Yes, I've injured the bne - this wrist thingy holds my thumb and wrist still and is driving me nuts!!  The weather is beautiful and I so want to play in the yard -  I had my boys spreading mulch in the front bed that I weeded a few weeks ago and it looks better.  Guess I have to wait to plant stuff in my pots too.  Oh well. I had the chest/abdominal ct scan on Friday - had to drink barium (orangey but still pretty gross) and they injected dye into my vein as well.  I'll see my onc on the 18th for a 3 month and get the results then.  I would think if it's serious she'll call me and tell me to get my behind in there sooner! Sat long enough - off to iron a sheer curtain to put up in the guest room and then maybe a nap!!  Hope you both have a good weekend!  Take care of yourselves! Dawn",

My liver counts came back better but not normal yet so my onc sent me for that chest/abdominal ct scan - I'm definitely having \"scanxiety\" and instead of scheduling a week after appt I chose to wait till my appt on the 18th. Of course I'm now thinking I will go nuts waiting but I really think if it comes back and she wants me to see her asap that she'll call.  You KNOW I'm going to be ROYALLY pissed if she doesn't!  but, I guess I really don't know if she looks at them before the appt gets here................... grrrrrrrr. I am glad you did not wait till the 22nd to see your onc - hopefully your counts will be fine and they'll send you for a scan or something.  All of my nurses think mine will be my gall bladder - sounds much better to me than hearing anything else right now!!  I'm not sure what body parts are on the left side under the rib cage - seems like there are a lot cramed inside of us!  My oldest son had his large intestine removed due to ulcerative colitis back in 04 - if I remember correctly they are 5 feet long!!  The small intestine is around 23 feet!!  Reminds me of the new car engines that fill up the space so much more than the old cars did!  I'll be thinking about you Gracie and waiting with you!!

I'll be seeing my onc next Thursday and I'm sure the Arimidex will be discussed as well.  My first cancer was er+/pr+/her2+ and the second was er-/pr-/her2+ so I'm not sure if we are still treating the first one or not.  Those pill holders sure come in handy!!  I'd forget what I'd taken if not for the holder!!  Get a colored one - just to be different!  Let us know what happens with your MRI - I saw mine, pretty cool seeing the outline of the implant in the one boob and all the scar tissue as well.  I was relieved that both were fine! My dh and I went for my unwrapping this morning.  YUCK!  They wiped off all the dead peeling skin (OUCH!), put aquaphor all over and re-wrapped me.  No treatment today.  They want me to soak in the tub for awhile tonight, air dry and air overnight and come in to see them in the morning.  I think they'll still do the last two boosts but I guess we'll see what they say. Off to the tub, Sleep well everyone! Dawn",

Bonnie - hope things are well with you and DH.  Hopefully you can check in soon to let us know. Debbie - good news about your BRCA test!  Normal sounds wonderful but - weird!!  Terry -  hopefully your side effects settle down soon! Ellie - you are so right - God bless the ordinary day!!! Thank you all for the continued prayers and hugs.  My mom had her first chemo last Monday - steriods kept her up and then dropped her in the middle of a busy day. She wasn't happy about that but was happy that she didn't have any extra nausea from the gemzar.  Mom has #2 tomorrow - not as nervous as the first one of course and I think she feels like she's doing all she can right now.  She knows the chemo is just to make her feel better till the end.............. Blows my mind, but everything will be okay - at least that is what I'm telling myself. I saw my rad onc last Tuesday - I'm healing well and have to go back 2/14 again.  She is taking a position at a cancer center in Rehobeth Beach - I'm glad she was here through my treatment though and she said to look her up when I'm down there and we could double date for dinner. I did get the bath salts made - very cute and everyone one was surprised that I had made them and were planning to soak that night.  Guess I'll find out when I go in how they liked them.  The receipe made a lot, so I am going to try some and give a jar to my mom & gmom to try as well.  I think when I go back in I'll take a cake for them like I did at the chemo center back in November.  Another lady on the boards did a cake for her rad center of a woman from the neck, with big boobs, down to her blue jeans - laying a napkin (think sheet) over the boobs like you lay on the table for rads!  She did an awesome job!  I told her I might copy her idea but I'll have to see about time. Sure hope everyone is having a wonderful weekend and a good week ahead! Dawn",

Next time I have one, I will ask them to do the iv stick part as soon as I'm on the table even though they don't need it till later - when the tech came in to do that, I didn't realize that most of me was in the tube and I lifted my head off the rest and bumped it on the tube!!  Started to freak out but got myself calmed down pretty quickly by lowering my head and realizing it was \"stick\" time!!  The other funny was that they gave me ear plugs to block out the machine noises but then they talk to you and expect you to hear them!! As with other tests and scans, the more still and calm you are, the faster they are over with. Dawn",
