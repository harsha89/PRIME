It could also be due to a possible heart condition, so I made an appointment with a cardiologist for next week.  I also asked my onc if it could be due to just plain old fatigue--just about any activity saps my energy--and he said that was possible, too.  Then again, sometimes it happens a few hours after I have a glass of wine, so maybe it's a wine allergy...  Who knows... But I'm glad it's not a brain tumor!   Leggy,   I'm fatigued, too, but I've only been out of treatment since November.  I hope you can get to the bottom of your fatigue.  My thyroid and Vitamin D tests were both okay.
