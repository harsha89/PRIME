I was diagnosed in 2009 with metastatic breast cancer that spread to the bone.  I received Femara for two  years and it stopped working, so on to Faslodex double shots.  Saw the onc yesterday after my scan and he said there is more progression in the bones.  NO ORGAN involvment.  (Yeah?)  While I was having the consultation with him he said that he had a call into the Specialist to decide whether to do one or two more rounds of Faslodex or to switch the medicine.  Now here comes the trickey part.  I asked him what is the medicine's name and he said it's too new it only has a number.  The Specialist did not call while I was there and my doctor told me that he would call me when he confered with him.  No phone call yet, as of this time.  He also mentioned to consider going on Zometa.  We had the Zometa conversation before and the first time he held off because he said that I was doing so well on the Femara.  The second conversation about Zometa that he brought up last year, I said that I read that it does not increase survival, therefore I didn't want it.  He said okay.  Now I think that he should have explained the Zometa a little more, and perhaps I would have had a different take on it last year. Okay, that's basically my story.  Please get me some input.  By the way, all of my blood work is normal, but my CA 27-29 is significantly higher.  That's how this consultation, that I requested happened yesterday.  When I called for the results of the blood work he only gave me the good blood numbers and I had to ask him for the CA 27-29 results, which I finally got the number yesterday.  On the phone he told me he didn't have it in front of him.  I asked for the Scan.  I was due for one anyway, this February.  That's another thing, we scan once a year.  I asked about that yesterday too.  I presented it as that I have heard that other women get scans more often.  His reply was, \"You protested and were upset when I tried to talk to you about it.\"  I am so confused.  Please help.
