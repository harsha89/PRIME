I've had a horrible time on it, and have taken a few breaks (with oncologists OK). I was 41 at diagnosis. Even though I know this is a milestone, and am grateful for being here today, I can't help but feel a bit panicky about the whole thing. Anyone else feel this way? I will soon stop seeing the oncologist, I'm guessing after I stop the Tamoxifen. Maybe I'm having some PTSD, as it seems I'm reliving the dreaded phone call-after the biopsy-which I knew, too was going to be positive for cancer. At any rate, I wanted to say congrats to you and everyone else out there fighting this $#$## disease. D.",

I'm the same way with my asthma-usually only being around cats triggers an asthma attack, but for the last 2 months (4 months post radiation) I've been short of breath and feel like my throat is closing up like in an attack. It's pretty scary and I have a feeling it's from the radiation.",

My oncotype came back in the grey area and I chose not to do chemo. My oncologist wanted me to at first because of my age-however he agreed with my decision because chemo could've only lowered my chance for recurrance by 2% and may have actually not helped at all. It was a long and hard decision and a very personal one. My grade was 2, though but my tumor was 3cm. I did surgery, 33 radiation treatments and am now on Tamoxifen. Whatever YOU decide, good luck to you.",

I was 41 when diagonosed-stage 2A, no node involvement ER+her2-.  I couldn't decide if I should do chemo, either. My onc originally suggested I do it because of my age. When I was hesitant, we did the oncotype score and it came back in the grey area too-25. I was given a possible 3%, but also a possible negative outcome of 5%, as well. They just do not know what is right for those of us in the grey area. At the end of the day it's your deciscion to make. With my oncologist's OK/agreement I decided not to do chemo. I did 33 rounds of rads after surgery (clear margins) and Tamoxifen. Dec will be my 2 year 'anniversary' since diagnosis. Once I made the decision, I havent regretted it, because what's the point? If it does come back, at least I can still go the chemo route then, but I'm hoping it doesn't, as we all do! Good luck to you. I know everyone is different and it's a very personal, and sometimes agonizing decision to make. Deborah",
