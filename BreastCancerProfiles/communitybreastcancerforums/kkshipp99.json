I also had a larger than expected 6.3 cm removed it was lobular breast cancer. Sometimes when I woke up in the morning I would have to hold my breast. I ended up having some lymphadema treatments for several weeks because of fluid retention. I also had 6 wks of radiation which caused a hard calcification which has been pretty darn sore. I'm 10 months out from radiation. Pain only lasted a few months. But my breast is still sore but feelsmuch better than at 6 months. Also I was really tired physically and depressed from the tamoxifen I was on they just changed me to the Aromatase Inhibitors and it makes your joints ache but Im over 70 and they don't like the side affects of blood clots and strokes for women over 70 on Tomoxifen so I agreed to change.. I have had all Wonen Oncologist for my Cancer if you don't like your doctor find one you do like....",
