It does help to read it...I promised myself yesterday after looking at the american cancer website that I wasn't going to look up anything else the entire weekend! Family birthday dinner tonight, so I will try and hold it together.  In addition to having DCIS they told me I have well differentiated invasive carcinoma... does this mean I have 2 things going on? I think it does... I guess well diff... means grade 1. Looking forward ( sort of ) to my appt on Tuesday. I still can't believe this is my life right now. My oldest starts first grade in September and I will be starting radiation? Or having a BMX??? ",

Margins were clear with biopsy and I had the dye yesterday and it showed nothing new. They will biopsy the nodes when they do the mastectomy. It is SOOO crazy to me that this is happening and I know it sounds aggressive to a lot of my friends. I think they are in shock and it hits to close to home for them. I have done some research but am trying not to overwhelm myself. I am NOT getting a second opinion... I really feel good with the people I am working with. Is that crazy? I mean my gut tells me this is the right choice for me, and getting several other opinions will only cloud the issues for me. I trust my Doc and have no reason to believe she doesn't have my best interests in mind, or that she doesn't know what she is doing. She has been in practice for 20 yrs and is very well respected in the NW.   I have implants now, so what do I care if I get new ones? I am NOT attached to me breasts now and just want what is best for the long term. I will be getting my oldest started in first grade on Sept 6th and then have surgery 9 days later. At least I will be available his first week of school. ",

I just spent the last 20 min looking at the cancer.org site. What a crappy way to spend a sunny saturday morning. Sometimes I don't want to read anything about it or event talk about it. It is hard not to think \"why is this happening to me?\" ",

The most and only reason I had the test done was so my children could plan their futures with all the facts. It cost $3k but my insurance covered it.  Good luck with your research and give it a lot of thought. MS",
