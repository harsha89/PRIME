I'm curious too about whether or not this is the best way to go. He told me that the 12 weeks is for older adults who wouldn't tolerate a higher dosage as the dosage is less and since I did well with DD AC we could do the Taxol Dose Dense too. Below is what I posted on the chemo dec 2013 forum. Let me know what you decide or if you find out anymore info.  Holli --------------------- just saw MO. He suggests Taxol every 2 weeks for 4 cycles rather than weekly. You get the same total dosage of Taxol. Supposed to help reduce incidence of neuropathy. All I have ever seen is it done weekly. Anyone have any thoughts on this ?? Last red devil on Thursday. So glad to be getting that behind me. Anyone staying on Claritin to help with aches and pains associated with the Taxol?",

At the time of my decision all they thought I had was DCIS and IDC in right breast. They were sure there was no lymph involvement and sure nothing on left side. I'm 37 and I just wanted them both gone. Didn't want to feel like I was looking over my should the rest of my life. I'm so glad we went with BMX. Everyone is different - but after my surgery they found additional tumor (ILC) plus positive nodes on right side. They also found extensive LCIS in left. So we were very thankful we chose the BMX.  The PS we used actually preferred doing the DIEP with a BMX. Of course now I have to have radiation which may mess up my reconstruction but my PS thinks it will all be manageable. ",

I'm in the states and agree with LIL... I love my biotene. I use the salt/baking soda. Then I use biotene toothpaste on a child's brush (it's very soft) and rinse with biotene mouth wash. I also use biotene gum if I need to during the day.  I was the same way as you after my initial diagnosis - very project like. It felt like it was all happening to some one else. I had surgery 4 weeks after diagnosis (now in chemo) About 3 weeks after surgery it \"hit\" me. These are all grieving stages. I think every stage is good to go through ( sometimes more than once). But don't be afraid to seek someone to talk to. This is a huge thing we are going through. Talk to your MO too. Maybe they can guide you in the right direction.  I also have 3 children (9,5,2). We have chosen to be as open about my diagnosis as we can without being scary about it. It helped that I told them that they couldn't \"catch\" it from me and that they did not do anything to cause me to have it. My 9 year old is struggling with some anger issues regarding my cancer and my 5 year old is having separation anxiety. Here in Texas there is a group called Wonders and Worries. They offer free counseling for children whose parents have cancer. I just talked to them this week and will be utilizing their services to help give my children the tools the need to get through this time. ",

      "Content": "RHGSR wrote: Hello. I am newly diagnosed with Breast Cancer. I am 37, no family history, and bf 3 babies until they were 2 yrs. Found a lump in July while still BF my son ( I have 3 young children). Kept thinking it was a clogged milk duct. Went to OB in October. Mammogram and US on 10/16 - Showed possible IDC (lump) and DCIS (other areas they saw that I was unaware of). Biopsies 10/22. Confirmed IDC and DCIS. Double mastectomy (even though only in one breast) with DIEP flap scheduled for 11/20. Then followed by 4 months of chemo. Not sure what I am feeling. Disbelief, shock. I know the grief stages. Afraid of not traveling through them very well. Not wanting the enormity of this to hit me all at once - or when I wake up from surgery. I noticed at the bottom of some posts were information about their cancer. I think mine is stage II (won't know about lymph nodes for sure until after surgery), HER neg, ER and PR +...not sure about the grade...maybe a 2? I will have to look at path report again. Would love a hello from the community. Any advice would be great too. How did people prepare for surgery? Thanks! RHGSR :0) Diagnosed at 37 while still breast feeding. What I thought was a \"clogged milk duct\" turned out to be stage IIb breast cancer.
