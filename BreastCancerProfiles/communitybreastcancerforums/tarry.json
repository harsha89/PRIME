      "Content": "Dec 17, 2011 05:35PM - edited Dec 17, 2011 05:36PM by tarry I finished a four week rad schedule about 4 weeks ago. It was at md anderson in houston. The protocol is still considered experimental in the States, but since they are doing a big study on it, they felt safe in using it on me. The daily dose was stronger, but for some reason, the results on the web suggest it is easier on the skin. I think it was pretty much a breeze, though everyone was quite amazed at how well my skin withstood the rads. I now look fairly tanned in the area that got an extra dosage for the tumor bed with the booster but otherwise it seems fine. My husband thinks it slowed me down, but I didn't have the fatigue I've heard a lot about. 2 weeks after the rads ended, I went on a demanding 3 city lecture tour in England. I've arrived home with a good sense of energy, and no bad experiences traveling, unless you count about 15 hours of British buses and trains bad.",

They,ll give you first class treatment, but you may feel pressurized to go with their alternative, as opposed to what you really want. I had a several months long disagreement with a number of drs. I wanted a lumpectomy, but they were really insisting I have a masectomy with implants. There's an idea that recovery involves getting as close to your pre-cancer look as possible. That might be what you want and, if so, you'll get the best there is. Otherwise, insist on what makes you feel best, as long as it is medically effective. There is another problem. Once you are through the initial treatment, it can be hard to get to see a doctor. I have't seen one since dec 2011, even though I go for 6 months checkups. You are stuck with nurse practitioners. I ended up going through patient advocacy to get to see a doctor ",

Try to find parts of your life you still can control and work on what they need. At least that's helped me. Cancer is very scary, but you will have more strength than you realize.",
