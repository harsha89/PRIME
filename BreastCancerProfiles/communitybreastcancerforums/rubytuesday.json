      "Content": "Dec 7, 2007 03:24PM - edited Dec 7, 2007 03:25PM by rubytuesday Sue, I feel for you having to make this decision.  I was in pretty much the same boat almost 2 yrs. ago.  I had bc 10 years ago and had 6 nodes removed, all negative.  Then 2 years ago, I had a new primary in the same breast.  I had SNB and micromets in the node.  I was soooooooooooooo upset.  I didn't want to have more nodes removed, and didn't want to do radiation with the added risk for lymphedema.  I struggled with the decision, set up the surgery and canceled it the morning of the surgery.  I had decided to talk to the radiation oncologist to see what his take was on it because by then I was determined that it was going to be either surgery OR radiation BUT NOT both.  The rad onc said 4 or more positive nodes and he would recommend radiation.  Then I went to see my oncologist who I thought would recommend node removal so that he could see how many were positive for treatment options (chemo).  Instead, he said: \"In my opinion, and I have nothing to gain from this, surgical removal of any cancerous nodes is FAR superior to radiation\".  I made my decision based on his statement and went ahead with the surgery. My BS didn't consider less than 10 nodes a good sample (the gold standard of 'treatment') and I told her as they wheeled me into surgery to not go nuts in there and take a bunch.  I also told her that I'd get over it if she only got 8 instead of the flip side where she took 15.  She miraculously ended up taking just 10 which were all negative.  Best wishes!",

Affected lymph nodes have not yet stuck to one another or to the surrounding tissues, a sign that the cancer has not yet advanced to stage III. (The tumor in the breast can be any size.)",
