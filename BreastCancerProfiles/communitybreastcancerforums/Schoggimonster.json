My mother (diagnosed at age 49, and died at age 60), grandmother and greataunt died from breast cancer. My maternal aunt (the sister of my mother) also has breast cancer (diagnosed at age 48), and she is currently 8 years breast cancer free. I was tested shortly after my mom's death for the BRCA1/2 gene, and was tested negative. I was recommended that my aunt gets tested too since it would be more meaningful since she has had breast cancer (eg. if she were BRC1/2 positive it means that I did not inherit the breast cancer risk, if she were BRC1/2 negative it means another gene mutation causes the cancer in our family). Unfortunately, my mom passed away, and thus can't be tested. I've asked my aunt a few years ago (about 7 years ago), and she did not want to be tested at that point. She also has 2 daughters, and they both did not want to know my test result (thus they don't know that I am negative).  I have now found a lump after an MRI, and am currently waiting for my biopsy result. I guess this brings up wether I should approach my aunt again to see if she has changed her mind, and would get tested since it would affect my risk and about possible prophyliatic treatment I might undertake.  I understand that not every person wants to be tested, but maybe I should ask her if she could just get tested, and only give me the result?  I have a good relationship with my aunt, but I am not sure if I should ask her again. These are difficult things to talk about, and bringing the topic up might create anxiety and reminding her that my mother passed away from the disease she has too. Also, my aunt lives in Europe where genetic testing is a bit less common, so I am not even sure if she understands the issues and positive aspects of the test. For me, it would really help to know if there is a gene who causes our breast cancer in my family since it would give me a better picture of how concerned I have to be. If you were in my situation, would you ask my aunt again. I don't want to appear selfish but this is affecting my health. Thank you for any help you can give me, or personal experience.
