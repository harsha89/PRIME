I just noticed tonight that my nipple is inverted and the areola around it is thickened. I'm going Wed morning for a needle core biopsy. I'm wondering if I even have a chance of this not being cancer.  My dad's mom had breast cancer and his sister has had it twice.... I never even knew until I found my lump and started asking questions.  I'm feeling rather overwhelmed. Log in to post a reply",

I'll get the official results tomorrow when I see the surgeon again.  I talked to the nurse at the breast clinic before I left though. She told me that the surgeon would be removing my lymph nodes also. I'm not sure how many are involved. I have Invasive Duct Carcinoma. The tumor is 6cm. A little bigger than a golf ball.... I kept saying that it felt like a golf ball. Because I have HIV (got it from my 1st, now deceased, husband. He got it from his IV clotting medication )also, it's automatically an aggressive cancer. I keep getting sharp pains in that breast. I can't blame it on the biopsy or clip. It was doing it before. I'm wondering if I am feeling it grow. I know that the surgeon wants me to do pre surgery chemotherapy. I'm guessing that he is going to refer me to an oncologist.... depending on how long it takes to get into one will determine who will order the bone or pet scan. The surgeon might order it so the oncologist has the results when I first see him/her. I'll be back when I know more...",

It's a very large lump. Life kind of feels like a roller coaster... or maybe the tilt a whirl.  Log in to post a reply",

Just one dose wiped out my white cells and I ended up in the hospital with neutropenia, severe diarrhea and a fever.  I lost 9 pounds in one week.   So I was switched to taxol and herceptin on a weekly basis.  I was feeling great.  BUT my oncologist decided to add perjuta because it's supposed to have good results when combined with Taxotere.   So I have been taken off my weekly and put on every 3 weeks of Taxotere,  Perjuta, and Herceptin.  Ugh!!! I just got out of the hospital Monday.  Neutropenic again.  Diarrhea again.  Fever again.  Only this time my throat hurt so bad that I couldn't eat or drink without severe pain.  Needless to say I was dehydrated.  I lost almost 10 pounds in a week.  I still have diarrhea.  From my understanding I will have it as long as I'm on Perjuta.   I would ask for my old regime back, but the cancer mets in my lungs have spread more.I have an \" innumerable\" amount of new nodules in my lower lung.  I'm going Monday for my next dose. All I can think is that I HATE THESE NEW MEDS!!!!!!  Is anyone else on Perjuta?  Does it get any better?  Log in to post a reply",
