I was dxed in 2004; IDC & DCIS left breast 2.5 cm; Right Breast DCIS. I had a total bi-lateral mastectomies, reconstruction and opted for no additional treatment. I have also had Hodgkins Disease (in my teens); Thyroid Cancer (2000) and numerous skin cancer problems due to my treatment of HD in my teens. I also had a TAH-BSO this past June-no cancer found (hallejuhah). Have any of you discovered any lymph nodes in your neck post treatment? I have a hard (nodule?) midline, cervical posterior for about 2 weeks. I saw my ENT surgeon and had a CT Scan. I see him on Monday to go over the results (not sure why they don't call-every other physician I have had does). Just curious if any of you have experienced this. Thanks again, Lorie Dx 4/4/2004, IDC, 3cm, Stage IIIA, Grade 3, 0/4 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

My son sends me these flowers on special occassions. Additionally, where is Lincoln in CA? I grew up in Los Altos (bay area 45 minutes from SF).  Sorry for my ignorance, I should just mapquest it! Okay, I think your questions are very insightful. I have some very strong opinions of radiation therapy as a whole. I had radiation therapy back in the stone age of 1975-1976 for Hodgkin's Lymphoma.  They called it mantle radiation.  I was irradiated on my chest, back, & pelvic area. I developed a host of latent side effects from this radiation, skin cancers, thyroid cancer, & most notably the breast cancer. While I was not a candidate for radiation therapy again, I would not of taken it if offered. Your DX is very similiar to mine; except my tumor in the left breast was larger & I also had DCIS comedo with IDC in all quadrants. (the right was full of DCIS as well). The point was for me, I did not see the benefit fo having radiation or chemo for that matter because the difference in recurrance was less than 7%. And, every doctor that I had told me point blank that the past radiation exposure was highly responsible for me developing breast cancer. Treatment decisions are a tough call to make. I think they are all highly personal. I did alot of research like yourself and still feel that I made a right decision.  Am I at higher risk of recurrance? Yes. Would having radiation if it was available to me make a difference? Who knows. Personally, they still do not know the entire ramifications of radiation exposure, nor the toxicity of chemo agents. Everyone reacts differently to these regimens. I wish you great success in finding what the best course of action to take.  I thank you for starting a very interesting thread! Take care, Lorie",

I apologize in advance if this is not the correct forum to post my question, but I thought I would post this inquiry here so that maybe one of you could share your thoughts/experience? Since about 3 weeks ago I have developed a very painful tailbone ache; with what seems like rectal pain as well.  Without getting too graphic I am also feeling as I am not having a full evacuation. I have a long history of cancer, Hodgkin's DX; Thyroid Cancer and Breast Cancer in 2004.  Have any of you ever had this ailment, is this a symptom of bone mets in the tailbone area?

My best-friend unfourtunately passed away from a gliobastoma Stage 4 Brain Cancer, and I have not been able to get to the doctor for this horrible tailbone pain.  I am planning on seeing a specialist at St, Joe's in Ann Arbor, MI this upcoming week. I have not contacted my oncologist because I would presume if their is a problem, she would be notified.  As you know, I am familiar enough with cancer but do not have a clue about Bone Mets as a concern in the tailbone area.  It is terribly miserable to deal with..as it effects every aspect of movement and sitting. Hopefully, we will be able to figure out what/where the problem is. Thanks again for giving me suggestions and good wishes~I will check back after we determine what the cause is. Lorie",
