I am about due for the next check up, I just feel like a crazy person going back in since we had all that testing last year that turned up nothing. The breast specialist told me last year that her patients have cancer and she doesn't have time to deal with someone that clearly doesn't due to the negative test results. I felt like a loony toon, so I haven't revisited the issue with anyone since. I keep thinking about why in the world I would have this big indent, but no sign of anything causing it. At my first appointment, she said it wasn't a normal breast change, but then said it was normal after everything came back negative. I suppose I could call for a second opinion with a different BS, if I can get over this feeling of being crazy. Thanks again for the reply!",
