I exercise every day 15 to 30 minutes, eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, never smoked, keep my alcohol to 3 or 4 glasses of red wine a month, do not drink water from plastic bottles, keep stress level low and love, love, love.  I also take plenty of vitamins, and love each day I wake up. Last, but not less important, have a great faith in the Lord. God bless you.",
