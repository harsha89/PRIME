My 2nd opinion said I should do some chemo but CMF is probably fine, followed by hormone therapy, instead of AC or TC type therapy.  CMF would be 6 months (vs. 3 of DD AC) and I was planning my expander exchange before that! They are not the most comfy things... BUT i am supposed to go back to work in Jan and really thought I could keep most of my hair and not get so sick again... Does anyone even get CMF anymore???  I really do not know how I am going to decide if have a choice of regimens... Any advice is appreciated.

I was dx august 8th and am finally getting around to having BL mastectomy oct 22nd!  My breast felt no different the first month after diagnosis, but over the past several weeks I definitely feel it is bigger and I have tightness in my back, lots of tingling in back ands along collar bone, and some soreness under my arm (not in the pit but more over the ribs).  My surgeon says it feels the same as last month, this is just hormonal and tension.  Also occasional pain in the breast, surgeon says this could be delayed post-biopsy healing pain, or a nerve grew in there. my core biopsy in aug showed widespread insitu and some invasive component, ductolubular, grade 2, er+/pr+, her2-. MRI 6 cm enhancement, PET/CT showed 2.5 cm in the breast.   I am paranoid this is taking over since my hormones are raging from the stress.... Anyone with similar symptoms, should I be worried???? Also, should I be concerned that a SLN biopsy was not done on me once the original dx came in? YH in NJ Dx 8/8/2007, IDC, <1cm, Stage IA, Grade 2, 0/6 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

For me on TC every 3 wks  x 4(did 2nd round past thursday, hey half done!), first round I crashed on sunday, so this time around I made sure the fridge was stocked and all errands and laundry done before, and made childcare arrangements for the crash day, which actually did not really come this 2nd time around.  BAd now is the dry mouth, no taste, and dry eyes.  some mild tingling/numbness in toes too.  hair thing sucks too FUBC. can't wait till it at least all falls out so my head slides on the pillow.  Got my franken boobs blown up for the final time day before chemo too, so that does not help..... Sorry gals I was out of the loop for a while, hope we are all going strong!  Anybody have stuffy ear side effects??? -Yuyubear",

Will have to insist on them using my leg for BPs next time.  Steriods totally pumped me up so when I thought I would come home and crash, I went to the supermarket to stock up on stuff, today i am off the decadron so we will see.  Last Emend today, no queasiness so far, just eating lots of veggies and protein.  Yesterday got the Neunasty (neulasta) shot so just waiting for some of those side effects...
