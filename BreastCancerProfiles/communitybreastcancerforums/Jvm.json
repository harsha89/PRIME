I was told that attitude can help a lot. I just wish the biopsy results were a lot quicker. I also am not sure what to ask when it does come back. I know nothing about breast cancer and just found out recently that it is in the family. I wouldn't know the first thing to ask the doctor when they call with the results which was already stated to me to be highly suggestive of malignancy. Log in to post a reply",

Just don't want my kids to see me upset yet as I haven't told them anything until I know for sure and even then probably after Christmas. You have helped me with just responding and letting me know I'm not alone. Thank you so much",
