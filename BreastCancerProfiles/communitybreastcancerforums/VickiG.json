I'm picturing little cells w/ tiny whips & chairs like lion tamers.  Part of the reason I was very optimistic about this trial personally is because I have extensive skin mets, and since skin is a major GVHD complication, the thought was that I would be going into this w/ significantly improved odds of response... I do realize that it has yet to work for us, but someday it WILL, and I am not opposed to being the first success story with it.  I hope that sort of explains things ~ believe me, I have gathered a LOT of info on this lol.",
