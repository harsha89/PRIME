Needed to wait through 12 weeks of targeted therapy before radiation begins. See RO 2/17 and guess the sim will be scheduled at that time. Left breast, being told we'll use the breath hold technique...Being told to plan for 4 weeks away from home, living in an adult \"Ronald McDonald\" style house near the UNC Memorial hospital complex. In many ways I am more concerned about being away than the therapy!!!! Thanks for everything I've learned reading your journeys with rads!!!! Maggie",

(in forum Stage IV and Metastatic Breast Cancer ONLY). I follow this group but have not posted given the request at the top of the page. I want to respect the request, but wondered if the forum might help other T-DM1 ladies. The ATEMPT clinical trial is the first that opens T-DM1 to Her2 (3+) breast cancer that has not (yet) shown to be metastatic. I'm one of those. Thanks for giving this some thought. I understand if you wish to keep this closed to non Stage 4. Maggie",
