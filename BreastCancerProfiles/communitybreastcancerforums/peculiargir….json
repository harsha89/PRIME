I'm on the high end of that scale, and while *I* can tell I'm not wearing a \"real\" bra, my husband says I look fine, and it sure feels better than wearing a sports bra. My Rad techs suggested them, and I'm so glad they did. Today was #25 of 33, and I'm one of those people who haven't posted because things are going well. My skin is really red and starting to peel, and I don't do much in the evenings after radiology and working all day, but it's manageable - and NOTHING like chemo fatigue. Probably the \"worst\" side effect I've experienced is trouble swallowing - when I'm eating or drinking, it feels like I've taken too big a bite/drink. So it takes me twice as long to eat as anyone else at the table, but again, it's not that big a deal. My RO says it's because the rads are hitting my esophagus due to the location of the (removed) lump. This journey is getting old, but I try to focus on the end goal - radiation is lessening my chances of recurrence. Good luck to everyone- Kathy",

Had my 2nd radiation this morning, and it went much better than yesterday. 2 down, 18 to go! :) Took a benadryl last night and finally got some sleep, which sure makes a difference! Kathy",
