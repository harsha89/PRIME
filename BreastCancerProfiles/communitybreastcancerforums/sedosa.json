You have to make the decision with which you are most comfortable. Have you spoken with an oncologist yet? A double mastectomy sounds like a good way to get rid of the problem permanently, but it is very serious surgery and shouldn't be taken lightly;You have caught this cancer very early and it is non invasive. See what your oncologist recommends. Read as much as you can and then make a decision. I was given the choice of lumpectomy or mastectomy and I chose mastectomy for the same reason you are expressing, however, mine was stage 3 grade 3 invasive. I have undergone chemo and am presently involved in radiation. So far there has been no sign of recurrence. Wishing you the best on your sailing. steffi",

The shaking and worry is very normal and we all have done it. Bx means biopsy, dx = diagnosis, bc= breast cancer, tx=treatment. Just remember you have a 90% chance of not needing any of these abbreviations. Two things about your letters caught my eye. One, your name Steph, I am Steph also. You have several times called yourself a wimp. I always feel as if I am a wimp. However when I step back and look at it what I call a wimp is just expressing that I feel scared or that I hurt. That is NOT a wimp (i tell myself). That is just expressing feelings. Somewhere along the line of our upbringing you and I got the idea that expressing feelings is being a wimp. It is not. You have come to a very safe place to rant, cry or what ever. Your friends who say it is nothing do so because they also are scared, don't know what to say and hope it is nothing. I hope you keep telling us how you feel. We need to share this. We can't handle it alone. Also you will not be alone tonight or tomorrow night. You can write here or join the chat room. There are many ladies (and a few men) who are in so many different stages of this fight. Sometimes they are goofy and laugh a lot. It is good to see that people who are fighting cancer can laugh. I agree with the other ladies who advised getting some medication to help you through this. They really help. Ask for either antidepressants of anti anxiety medications. You will be glad you did. Friday will go much more smoothly. If you need a biopsy, you will be able to accept it with calm and because of this it will go much easier. The only pain is the quite small needle for numbing up. As far as decorating. jesus came to bring us hope. Try placing one small decoration out to show your hopes. Just remember we are with you all the way. Lots of hugs, dear. Steffi",

BUT when this cancer came and my sister was diagnosed the same day with an unkown cancer that was in her spine and hip, I was stunned so much all I could do was pray for her. I visited with her shortly after my mastectomy and she remarked,\" I have never prayed for health.\" I stopped and thought... neither have I. I still don't pray for my health. I guess it is because I really believe that I have no control over what is happening to me. I didn't do it, God didn't do it. It just is, because it is. The cancer will go away if it is meant to. I will die with cancer, as did my sis, or I won't. Either way I will die. But until that time I will live each day to the fullest, helping others and looking for joy for myself. Take care. Steffi",
