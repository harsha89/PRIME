My name is Kathy, and I have been reading your posts for over a month, everyday.  You bring me such comfort on this roller coaster, as I too believe that despite all of the love around me, no one really understands.  Knowing I am not alone, and most of all NOT CRAZY, I can find peace. I am very lucky that my SE are very minimal, and I am fighting with all of my might.  Do you know that the American Cancer Society has a 24/7 phone number that you can call, if you dont want to bother the doctors or seem like you want to call them for every little thing?1-800-227-2345     I hardly ever get sick, but I find myself feeling every twinge and pulse since my diagnosis, and think I am turning in to a hypochondriac.  I am constantly molesting myself, looking for another tumor, though I know that after 2 treatments of T/C, any cancer cells in my body are running scared or discinigrated. Again, thank you to all of the women before me, and beside me....this too shall pass!  Find joy in your day, and hug a little longer. Kathy",

I had a rough week.  My rads consulation scared me, and sent me back to the surgeon to talk about getting rid of the girls.  But, the people with MD after their name say that breast conserving therapy is the right choice for me, even though my gut tells me otherwise.  Can't believe how much I let fear control me! I had my first tatoo, and start rads on the 19th.  My center has a limited schedule so I will have to miss a half a day of school.  I have the sick days built up, but it is hard to be away from my kids that much.  I know I will survive, as well as my students.

I have started to round the corner after #3, and think I will have almost 2 weeks of feeling good, other than a little tired!  But, I have to say, I crashed pretty hard the day after treatment, and think I will have to strap myself down if I have another roid rage the night of my last treatment.  I over did it, and was miserable. Heather, I have started looking in to the paraben free products, and it is hard to find them in everyday stores.  My friend just became an Arbonne consultant, and has said that her products are paraben free.  I am going to check out the ingredient lists online and see about trying some.  I also think that Bare Minerals has a paraben free line, and is sold at specialty makeup stores.  I am also currently using a deodarant by Tom's of Maine. Hard to tell how well it is going to work for me, b/c I think my body chemistry is changing, and I have not had a \"good\" workout to test it with my stink factor.  Summer will tell. I am disappointed, but understanding about the time line for radiation that people posted about. My doctor has been pretty quiet about it, as the focus is getting me through chemo without losing my mind.  I just assumed radiation would start about 2 weeks after my last chemo, and I could get on with the show. I have signed up for my anniversary race at the Cleveland half marathon at the end of May, and I am hoping that I will be done, and able to pick up my \"WOG\" training in March.  I am still questioning my decision of whether I made the right choice for me with the lumpectomy.   My head was spinning so fast, that I just wanted the crud OUT OF ME, I am not sure I thought everything through.  I have large breasts, and feel pains that send me into a panic attack, and then I feel the fibrous tissues, and I panic some more, and, and,and....see what I mean?  I am so thankful for everyone who posts!  I do not post often, but I read EVERYDAY!  I feel like I belong hear, and dont have to worry about straightening my wig :) Enjoy your day!  Kathy",

I have been following everyone's posts, but have been keeping to myself.  6 rads down, trying to find my new normal. Bailey- Great big HUG!  I can totally relate to how you feel.  About 2 weeks after my last chemo, I was starting to feel pretty good, and I wanted to be \"normal\" again so badly.  I stopped reading, posting, blogging, etc anything about cancer.  I put my wig on daily, but that was about it.  I even stopped taking my depression medicine...I wanted to be better, done being sick, done being a patient, done with C!  When I had my rad consultation I flipped out!  I was an emotional mess, questioning my path again.  I called my surgeon as soon as I got home from the RO and made an appt for the next day.  I wanted to know more about getting rid of these breasts that are killing me.  They have always been too big, in the way, uncomfortable, and now \"full of disease.\"  He went through all of the info about having my breasts removed.  I toiled about this for days.  My \"superman\"  asked me, \"If you have your breasts cut off, aren't you going to worry about getting cancer anyways?\"  I had to be honest with myself...yes I will.  I will always worry about it. I had to accept that I did not have a medical degree, and the professionals around me were telling me it was my choice, but they were recommending breast conserving therapy.  The first rad was rough. I was shaking and quietly crying.  I was so scared, and felt so alone.  I pray each time they say hear we go.  I pray that the techs have me set up right, that the beams can find the cancer cells, and that the healthy cells live. I have accepted, and am only allowing my mind to believe, that I am on the right path.  There is no looking back.  I need to have peace in my mind. I was lucky to meet with a nutrionist on Fri at my center. She was so nice to me.  She  is a 15 year BC survivor, and just found cancer on her tongue 2 months ago.  I have been concerned that I have caused my cancer, I am over weight and do not make the best choices.  I have been driving myself (and husband) crazy with trying to figure out how I gave myself cancer...silly huh?  I have to learn to relax, life is too short for all of this worry and I definitely do not want to go to medical school. I hope that everyone had an uneventful Mon. I am counting down the days, without wishing my life away. Take care of yourself. I am so thankful you are here with me. Kathy",

Heatherw - congrats on your goal!  I am signed up for the Cleveland half marathon (3rd anniversary) and I am looking into joining one of the charity/training teams this year. I told my doc that he had to have me patched up so I can start training soon. My bro wants to do a 3 day event in Aug for a total of 60 miles.  Sounds like a lot for a turtle, but my motto is slow and steady! I hope that you find joy in your day... call/talk to someone to cry on their shoulder (you deserve the release and it is a sign of strength not weakness), do a random act of kindness (always makes my heart smile), take an extra nap, exersice (walk in place for 5 minutes, do a few squats in the kitchen while you are waiting for something, situps), or google find joy in your day ...http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/now-is-everything/201106/50-ways-add-joy-your-day.

I am so surprised what everyone is eating.

Thank you for reading, and I hope everyone felt loved today!  I know that I did! Take care Kathy",
