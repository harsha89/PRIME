I also have PASH and it does not put you at a higher risk for breast cancer. From what I have been told and have read Tamoxifen will not stop the PASH or make it go away. I think treatment for PASH depends on if it has grown or changed. The Cleveland Clinic has a program that you can use to submit your scans a radiologist will interpret them and give you an opinion. Might be worth it.",
