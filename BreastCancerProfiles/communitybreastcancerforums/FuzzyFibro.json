I had a CNB recently too, following mammo/us, that too, was extremely painful like yours. I don't get my results until April 13th (I'm in the UK) and I'm dreading the appointment. I haven't started a thread myself, but have been glued to this site for some time and reading about others really sucks, but reassuring for me to know we are none of us alone. Thank you all brave sisters (and brothers) for sharing your experiences here. I think I'd go nuts if this site didn't exist!! Love to all here",
