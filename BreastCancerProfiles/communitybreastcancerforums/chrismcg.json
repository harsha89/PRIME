So relieve that I found some people who are in the same predictament as me.  I was told I'd have a FNA biopsy on Friday, when I got there it was totally different news to me... I had to get a core biopsy with guided u/s.  Now, I know I'm young and my age plays a good role of my \"solid mass\" being benign, but I still go back and forth with \"Could it be cancer\".  To make a long story short.  My mass was deep in my breast... I have big boobs as it is 42D, so I knew somehow maybe it would hurt. But wow I almost fell off that table and closed my eyes the whole time, and wouldn't let go of the nurse's thumb (not hand, thumb, mind you), but it was horrible.  I tried to be positive, but it was awful.  I wish they would just knock us out!  Anyways, I am also waiting.. I should hear by tuesday.  I do have a question... \"Could they tell by the tissue if it's suspicious or just fibroadenoma?\".  They are not saying anything, only that it's suspicious!  Is that a bad thing?  Please help!  Thank you all and God bless!!!!!  Good luck!",
