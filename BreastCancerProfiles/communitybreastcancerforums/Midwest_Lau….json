      "Content": "Apr 18, 2017 04:56AM Midwest_Laura wrote: Hello, Limonia.  Sorry that you have to be here, but you have come to the right place.  I had DD chemo, although it was a different flavor than you are getting.  I was able to continue working near-full time.  (A few days might have been a bit short, but basically full time.)  To add to that, I was able to keep my travel schedule for work.  I fly out to my client every other week.  My MO scheduled chemo to be on my \"home\" weeks.  As RuthBru indicates, Neulasta gives you the confidence to face the world without picking up every little bug.  Keep the hand sanitizer handy, and you'll be fine.  The diary that Felloco suggests is also a great idea.  It will help you predict your personal schedule of feeling crappy / poor / blah / not too bad. You are right that the hair issue makes everything public.  You will have to find your own comfort place.  I bought wigs, long scarves with cute ties in the back, beanies, and simple bandannas.  I finally settled on the simple bandannas because they matched my casual style, then I bought them in lots of different colors and patterns.  You will need to find what works for you.  This is a very personal and individually unique decision - with influences from the weather.  I suggest buying a few inexpensive options and try them out before making any big investments.  If you think you might go the wig route despite the heat, take a clip of your hair now and save it.  This will help the wig shop to know the target color, texture, and length.  I'm a few weeks PFC, but I still need to draw on my eyebrows.  It took some practice, but I can do it in less than a minute now.  (I practiced while I still had eyebrows to compare.)  I bought false eyelashes, but haven't used them.  I find that eyeshadow and eyeliner are enough.  Do I look like a Cancer Patient?  Yeah, I suppose so.  But for casual \"grocery store\" contact, no one seems to notice.  You would have to really inspect my eyebrows or check to see if there was any stray hairs sticking out from under my scarf to make the determination.  From a distance, I just look like someone who didn't bother to do their hair in the morning and just wanted to cover it up with a bandanna.  I understand your desire to hide from the world until this is all over.  I think that we all have those feelings from time to time.  But this is going to be a long journey - not a 2 week stay-cation.  As with any serious disease, we discover a bit more about ourselves during the process.  Now is your time.  You need to find something on which to focus.  If you are working, that's an easy answer.  During chemo, I basically woke up, went through my morning routine, went to work, came home for dinner, watched an hour of bad TV, then went to bed.  There wasn't time to think about much else.  If you are not working now, then I suggest finding a new \"work\".  Spring is here - how about some serious gardening or spring cleaning?  Something with which you can pace yourself and sneak in the occasional nap.  It really doesn't matter what the distraction is, it only matters that you find one. Hang in there, Limonia.  You'll get through this.  There are plenty of great women (and men) on this site to help you.",

Regarding the concern about infection: I don't think its any worse in the chemo room than it is at the grocery story or other public location.  There are no germy kids running around touching everything either.  Its actually probably cleaner at the chemo facility because everyone is using hand sanitizer at every opportunity.  Regarding the concern about HIPAA:  Your privacy was blown just by sitting in the waiting room.  We all know why we are there.  We are all going through the same thing.  My suggestion is to embrace it.  Just like on this forum, the chemo room can be an opportunity to talk with people who are eating the same sh*t sandwich as you and compare notes on what condiment goes best with it. ",

I walked to the grocery store (twice), to the book store, to CVS, picked up the dry cleaning, and grabbed a pizza to go. All without my usual coverings. No one stared, pointed, or laughed. It was very freeing. The first time was rough, but I just gathered my courage up in a ball, didn't make much eye contact, and went out to face the world. Each time, each interaction got easier. Each time I felt more confident. By the end of the day, it felt good to tell the world: this is who I am. This is what I look like. If my appearance makes you uncomfortable, well honey, you don't know uncomfortable! Let me tell ya'.... I do have to make two caveats to my story. 1) I'm a light-skinned black woman. There are a few examples of black women rocking the super short or bald look. This is an advantage to me. 2) I'm 800 miles from home, traveling for work. The chance of running into anyone that I know is quite slim. Even with the caveats, I'm proud of myself. I did something that was hard for me this weekend. I declare a small victory for me.",

I know that I'll slack off when winter arrives here in Wisconsin. I think that the best option for me is a treadmill at home. (I know that I'll find excuses to avoid the 10-mile drive to the gym.) Put a treadmill in front of the TV and log into Netflix, and I know I can put on the miles. Can anyone recommend a specific brand? Are there certain features that I should look for? What other home equipment should I pick up before the snow falls. ",

I have mets throughout my spine and into my ribs. I started yoga earlier this year when I was on big-guns chemo. It seemed like the logical thing to do. After I moved to Letrozole & Ibrance my joint pain increased tremendously. Not just in my back, but all over. I assumed it was the letrozole and the lack of estrogen that the was responsible. Then in late June I started to slack off on the yoga and never got back to it. Surprise, surprise. I started to feel better. Now, Im just a little stiff if I've been sitting too long. I thought yoga was going to be the great cure for the missing estrogen. I never considered that it could make me feel worse. Maybe I'll try Tai Chi instead.",

I connect via Bluetooth to my phone or iPad to record my workout because I like to track my time, distance and calories. There are lots of preprogrammed workouts. Hills & valleys, calorie goal, distance goal, time goal, random intensity, and 30:30, which is my favorite. (30 seconds slow with low intensity followed by 30 seconds of fast, high intensity. It\u2019s supposed to simulate a walk + run sequence) You can adjust the intesity of all of them. You can also design your own workout including the number of intervals along with the time and intensity of each. Finally, this model comes with arm and leg boosts. You can click the button and the machine ratchets up the intensity of your arms only, legs only, or random intervals of each. Pfew! Those boosts are intense, but they come in very short cycles. I thought they might help you to relax your foot while keeping your arms on shape. No matter your condition, you can always leave the feet or arms off the machine altogether. (It comes with a foot rest for an arms-only workout.)  http://www.octanefitness.com/home/products/recumbe... ",

Sometimes a required medication for another condition can influence the prescription of particular meds or chemo regimines as they can increase or decrease the absorption and efficacy of the cancer drug. Regarding the blood levels, I Had poor red and white counts before I started chemo. My MO prescribed a Neulasta shot for the WBC problem, but there was nothing to be done about the RBC. I took an iron supplement and maintained a high protein diet. My RBC tanked anyway. My MO said that all we could do was gut it out. I was 47 when I started chemo and came dangerously close to needing a transfusion to get my blood out of the danger zone. Perhaps your mother's MO is either a) not confident that she can get through the tougher chemo, b) looking to the surgery and any follow up drugs to deliver the final blow, or c) doesn't feel that the harshest of chemo is necessary in the situation. You need to consider quality of life as well. If the chemo really knocks your mother out, she won't be able to get the necessary nutrition and exercise that are an intragal part of fighting this disease. You can't just throw drugs at the problem. Your mother needs her body to be functioning as well as possible. Sometimes a softer approach produces a better result. Your next step should be to go back to the MO and ask, Why? And there's nothing wrong with a second opinion. Just be careful that you're not simply Doctor shopping until you get the answer that you want to hear. You want the *right* answer. Good luck",
