My oncologist said ultimately I was probably diagnosed 2-3 years before I would have been had I not pushed for the biopsy.  She said what would have likely happened is that they would have looked again in 6 months, things would have been roughly the same, maybe slightly different but DCIS in general is so slow growing that mine has probably been there for some years already.  Anyway at some point down the line I would have been biopsied and it may well have been worse (like possibly invasive cancer). With regards to the \"simple\" versus \"complex\" issue: a complex cyst is one that has septations (little strands of tissue) dividing it into different parts, or it appears to have areas of solid tissue in it as well (versus being liquid filled).  Mine were so small they were just called a \"microcyst cluster.\"  As far as I am aware however you cannot make a definitive diagnosis without sticking a needle in there so things can appear to be radiographically benign but there is a judgement call there. I don't think you are being paranoid although it is most likely that you are fine.  But what is the harm in making sure?  The thing to realize is that there is no one who is as invested in your health as you - I have learned that you have to truly be your own advocate and speak up if something doesn't feel right.  I would personally get a 2nd opinion on everything with a breast surgeon at a National Cancer Institute certified (NCI) Center. http://cancercenters.cancer.gov/cancer_centers/cancer-centers-list.html take care and feel free to PM me if you'd like... ",

Anyway, my understanding of the three possible results from BRCA 1 and 2 testing is: positive for mutation known to be associated with breast/ovarian cancer in BRCA 1 and/or 2 negative for the above variant of unknown significance \"VUS\" I think the last category has got to be pretty tough to deal with b/c they see something different about the way your BRCA 1 or 2 (I guess BRCA 2 is what you mentioned?) gene looks BUT they don't know if it is associated with cancer or not.  From what my onc said, Myriad, the lab in Utah that does the testing, is compiling a list of these \"VUS\" mutations and at some point in the future IF they are able to link more definitively to breast/ovarian CA may be included as a positive BRCA test result. These VUS mutations could also be red herrings and not associated with anything though. So it truly is a shoulder shrugger unfortunately because I don't think anyone knows one way or another.  I do have a friend who has a VUS and her doctor is taking a more conservative approach with her - she is enrolled in an ovarian cancer screening program where she gets bloodwork and pelvic ultrasounds every 6 months (actually I am in it too just due to personal hx of BC at a young age). I am sorry if you are having to deal with this uncertainty too, on top of BC.  It sure isn't fair.  (((hugs)))",

For MMR, another live virus vaccine (that can cause serious birth defects if administered during pregnancy) they usually say if someone is considering pregnancy they need to wait 4-6 weeks post the vaccine before becoming pregnant to clear the virus from their bodies so perhaps that is a similar time frame to the zostavax or shingles vaccine to clear from the body.

And I got a L prophy MX (I had R multifocal multicentric ER/PR - DCIS at 34). But I thought I would pop in to comment Re: recovery after breast reconstruction.  I think that this is very dependent on who does your surgery as well as what kind you get done.  I went with a perforator flap, and I was pretty busty before (DD++) and am overall happy that I did.  I certainly however had some significant complications at the time of my surgery at well known chicago based National Cancer Institute center. If I had it to do over again (and were choosing the flap again, which I certainly would), I would recommend that you do research and pick a top group to start with.  I have had 3 surgeries now, and the pain was very deal-able with each of them (and the urinary catheter was out within a day pretty much before I even noticed it and the IV catheters were not painful at all). And had I started with a better plastic surgeon to begin with I would only have needed 2 surgeries instead of the multiple I am ending up with now.  Check out the following websites and also the FORCE website as others have mentioned about to see what is possible with reconstruction. A prophylactic nipple sparing mastectomy may be an option for you if P BMX is on the table. It is a sucky decision to have to make, but even with my complications the experience, while incredibly emotionally difficult, has been very doable in my opinion.  Best wishes to you.  www.breastcenter.com www.drmarga.com  www.naturalbreastreconstructio... ",

My arm is not red, but definitely feels very heavy and full.  It is a small area that is burned (maybe 1cm x 0.5 cm) and doesn't look infected but since my heaviness and fullness symptoms have gotten worse I am looking for advice - should I be doing exercises?

Frankly though, even without a family history a lump deserves to be investigated (mammograms miss ~10% of breast cancers).   In my case, all my family history is all on my dad's side - his sister (locally advanced BC at age 28), and 3 of his great aunts (breast for 3 and ovarian CA for one in addition to breast).  Interestingly his mother died in her 90s of a totally unrelated ailment. I was 34 when my mammogram came back very mildly abnormal.  The ultrasound picked up 2 small microcysts 3mm and 7mm. I self referred to a breast surgeon and insisted on a biopsy which everyone assured me would be benign (the radiologist actually told me it would \"make my anxiety better\" while they were doing it!) and, oops, lo and behold I did have early stage BC.  In both spots.  A subsequent MRI revealed an additional 9x8x5 cm area of more multifocal DCIS!   I am BRCA 1 and 2 negative FYI - my personal opinion is that there are other breast cancer genes out there that just have not been identified.  My GAIL model score for developing breast cancer in 2010 was 0.04%.  Long and the short of it - after reviewing my family history my onc also thought that I probably had some sort of hereditary BC issue. If your doctor won't work with you, find another one who will - preferably at an NCI affiliated center. It is your body and your life, and no one else can or will advocate for you in the same way as you can.  Now, I don't want to freak you out overly much with my story, but I remembered feeling much the way you are describing - when I came home from my diagnostic mammogram I was crying - I knew something was wrong and I couldn't believe they were going to try to make me wait 6 months to see. I'm glad I didn't wait.  You shouldn't have to either.  (((hugs))) ",

Re the biopsy: I was able to drive myself home post ultrasound guided core biopsy, but I didn't need to have any pain or other meds before hand.  I think if I had taken something for pain or anxiety I would not have been able to drive.  I noticed some soreness in the spots that went away after a few days.  If you have an excisional biopsy that might be different since the area removed might be bigger.  If you think however that you would be too nervous to drive, or to even get the procedure done, is there anyone who could go with you for moral support? Hoping for this to clear up and for B9 results for you if a biopsy happens.  Take care! ",

I had a BMX 4/14/10 with R sentinal node and immediate free TRAM reconstruction for multifocal DCIS.  Still pretty nervous about saying the very abnormal looking 8 cm area in right breast is just DCIS based on all of 5 slides done of it (I had DD boobs - only 11 slides done per side per my path report - is this normal?!).  Anyone heard anything from their BS/onc about post BMX screening MRI/PEM/mammo?",
