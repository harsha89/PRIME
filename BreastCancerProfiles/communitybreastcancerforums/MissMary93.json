      "Content": "MissMary93 wrote: I'm twenty years old and until recently my breasts have always been relatively the same size. Over the past six months or so, I've noticed that my left breast is getting considerably larger than the right. At 18 I was wearing a 34B bra but I put on a little weight in college and ended up in a 34C. Now, since its been growing, I'm wearing small D cups. My left breast is overflowing out of the bra while the right barely fills it. Meanwhile, my left breast is much more sensitive and aches nearly constantly. I've felt it, but I never really thought about it growing up so I'm not really sure if there are any lumps or anything different as far as that, sorry. My cleavage and shirts are very uneven because of this. Cancers seem to be very prevalent in my family, so I think I just need reassurance that I should be worried or not? P.S. I don't know if it matters or not, but I keep getting what feels like a swollen lump of tissues on my left shoulder between the shoulder and my neck, above my collar bone. It keeps getting very large and then shrinking a bit. The larger it is, the more it hurts. Usually, I can't let anyone touch it without crying. Thanks in advance for any answers.

I don't drink caffeine either. I didn't like the way it made me feel so I quit about a year ago. I haven't really looked too much into it but I was talking about it to a friend whose mom had it and she got me all worried since it does run in my family fairly heavily. I appreciate your help.",
