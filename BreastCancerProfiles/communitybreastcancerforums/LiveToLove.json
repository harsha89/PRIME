This is my first post.  After more than two months on Faslodex, my oncologist started me on Xeloda.  My malignant pleural effusion had started in the left lung, after a pleurodesis on my right lung.  The oncologist's suggestion is to stop Faslodex. Has anyone out there continued Faslodex while on Xeloda?  Dx 8/2005, 2cm, Stage IIB, 6/25 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Surgery 8/31/2005 Lumpectomy: Right; Lymph node removal: Right, Sentinel, Underarm/Axillary Chemotherapy 9/30/2005 AC + T (Taxol) Radiation Therapy 1/16/2006 Breast, Lymph nodes Hormonal Therapy 4/30/2006 Femara (letrozole) Dx 7/2014, Stage IV, ER+/PR+, HER2- Hormonal Therapy 8/10/2014 Faslodex (fulvestrant) Chemotherapy 10/13/2014 Xeloda (capecitabine) Log in to post a reply",
