Well about two weeks ago the side and bottom of the same breast became sore its even sore to touch. i had a pap test done in march and went to the doctor monday and they said that the pap had come back abnormal. I told them about my breast and she looked schocked and said that i whould have said something earlier. i have to see another doctor about both, but i dont go for another 2 weeks and i am really worried and scared can somebody help me?

I am 22 years old and about 6 months ago my left nipple became inverted and about 2 weeks ago the same breast became sore on the side next to my arm pit and on the bottom under the areola. It is really sore to touch and every now and them my 2 year old daughter will push on it by accident and a sharp pain will shoot through. I am scheduled an appt. in two weeks but i have worried about it and I could use several opinions. If anyone knows what might be wrong please help me. Thank you for taking the time to read and answer my questions, and I am sorry for bothering you all again. Log in to post a reply",
