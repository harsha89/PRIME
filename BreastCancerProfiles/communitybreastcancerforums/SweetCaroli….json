I just had a biopsy after 2 small tumors were discovered on MRI in my nonoperative breast. I had a mammogram only 5 months ago that did not show anything and I could not feel any lump(s).Thankfully, I received news last evening that the growths are benign, but the 5 days of waiting for results were absolute torture. My only comfort during the wait was knowing that most biopsies come back benign. I hope your results are as good as mine.",

MRI gives a much more accurate measurement of ILC tumor size. ",

      "Content": "Aug 18, 2012 03:57PM - edited Aug 19, 2012 05:25PM by SweetCaroline2 Some people are totally clueless. The day after my first chemo, my DH (who was desperate to do something to save me) took me to meet someone who believes that a raw vegetable juice diet cured her ovarian cancer. He bought the $400.00 juicer and $300.00 blender she was selling and then hired someone to buy organic vegetables and come to our house twice a week and make juice for us. Then he threw out everything else in our pantry and refrigerator. If I were healthy, it would have tasted awful, but with the mouth sores, fatigue, aches, neuropathy, nausea, etc., it was undrinkable.When I complained to my sister, she said \"If I were going to die, I would want to eat whatever I wanted.\" I couldn't believe that she would say to me that she was sure that I would die.  Ayway I tried to drink the juices for a couple of months, to make my husband feel better and less panicky, and then told him I couldn't do it anymore. He was convinced that if I stuck to the diet I would not need chemotherapy, surgery or radiation, but finally accepted that I was the one with cancer and that I had to make my own decisions. It was difficult enough to get through chemo and SE without having a spouse who felt that it was unnecessary and the wrong choice. ",

It feels good to be able to share tips and encouragement with others who are facing or have been through a similar situation.  I was I started on neoadjuvant CT on March 22. Taxotere + Cytoxan x 6. My final treatment is next week, thank goodness! My tumor is lobular, 6.5cm x 2.5cm. With chemo, the tumor did shrink somewhat- it is now 5.5cm, not small enough for me to be able to have a lumpectomy instead of a mastectomy. I never felt a lump, but noticed a change in my breast shape and a noticed that a dimple had appeared on my areola. I have clinically negative lymph nodes- no enlarged lymph nodes can be felt under my arm, and none show up on the MRI either. My mastectomy with immediate reconstruction is scheduled for August 28. Because I am a DD and I will need radiation post-op, my PS recommended a latissimus dorsi flap with a TE. He is also going to try to do a nipple-sparing mastectomy. He warned me that there is a good chance that some or all of the nipple and areola might die due to lack of blood supply (because blood has to travel farther to the nipple in big breasts), but I feel it is worth a shot. Has anyone else been through this? I am having a sentinel node biopsy, but I refused an axial lymph node dissection (ALND) because from all the research I have done, I note that ALND is used for staging and does not seem to have any therapeutic value. Since I am already getting \"the works\"- everything that they can throw at me, I see no reason to risk LE in order to be accurately staged.  God Bless and Hugs to you all! ",

I didn't think that it was something that I would ever be able to laugh about! It seems that the whole medical establishment regards LE as a nonproblem. I was in treatment for arm LE and mentioned to my Lana certified LE therapist that I was sure that I had breast LE as well. She hadn't noticed or asked me about LE anywhere else. (In fact, NO ONE had asked me about any symptoms of LE, EVER- not my Breast surgeon, my PS, my PCP or my oncologist) My breast LE is actually much worse than my arm LE. The compression bra really helps reduce the edema and my breast aches if I do not wear it. However, it  is hot, uncomfortable and it is hard to find clothes in which is does not show.  I looked on the AstraZeneca (makers of Arimidex) website for Arimidex. They list LE as one of the SEs of Arimidex, so I am asking my onc to switch me to another AI that does not have this SE (if there is such a thing).  Cookiegal-thanks for the tip about the Danskin shelf bra- I have been looking for something that I wear at night that would help.",

I have been feeling like a whiny baby because I have had such terrible muscle/joint pain and exhaustion since starting Arimidex that I can't seem to get much of anything done. However,my MO says I must continue to take it. I know this is because my tumor did not respond to neoadjuvant chemo, and many ILC tumors have a better response to AIs than chemo. I would like to try Tamoxifen instead, though. Please let me know how you do with the change to Tamoxifen. You can send me a message. ",

My PS hasn't voiced any concern about the radiation causing problems with the TE or the latissiumus dorsi flap (LD flap). I would prefer to have a DIEP flap, but am not a candidate for it because of previous abdominal surgery that left me with a big midline scar. I just had my first appointment with my radiation oncologist. He said that the flap should do fine with the radiation, but I couldn't get him to comment on the TE (not a good sign, I know). I think that there is about a 50% rate of contracture with implants after RT, and I am gambling that I will be lucky. Otherwise I will have to have the the implant removed and the other breast reduced from a DD cup to a B cup to match the reconstructed breast, since the LD flap without an implant can only give me about a B cup. The LD flap is supposed to provide a sling that helps to prevent extrusion of the implant and covers it to help protect it.  Good luck on your upcoming reconstruction-I hope it all goes smoothly. ",
