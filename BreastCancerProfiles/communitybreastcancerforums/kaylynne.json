After calculating all the cost, it would be over $10,000 because there's no way in hell I would go alone. It was something presented to me by a very loving friend who is there now. She was diagnosed stage one a year ago, had a lumpectomy and radiation and is now cancer free. She is also an osteopath bodyworker (not a DO) but her DO that she trained with recommended this shaman and says he has a 60% success rate. She went to clear other things in her body. She's 50 years old, slim, a runner, a yogi, eats mostly vegetarian diet,and is beautiful inside and out. I think the altitude there alone will generate new red blood cells and she will feel fantastic. I pray that it all works for her and am happy that she has had this opportunity and believes in it. I, on the other hand, am 54 years old and a little fluffy. When I was first diagnosed in April with stage 3, I watched The C Word documentary which led me to the book AntiCancer, A New Way of LIfe. I began adapting the principals and eating according to the book. In July, I was diagnosed stage 4. I continued to watch my diet and added walking, almost every day, to my schedule. The only other exercise I enjoy is yoga. When taxol failed, I was off treatment for 5 weeks waiting for a trial. During that period, my tumor count went from the original 2 in my liver to multiple (I counted 7 on the CT scan) with the largest being 7cm. I hit a low point. I began letting some foods back into my diet that I had eliminated (flaming hot cheetos was one) and used the weather as an excuse to stop walking. Since being on gem/carbo, I've gained 7 pounds, and my body is swollen in different spots on my left side. I guess what I am saying is that I now know diet and exercise play an important role in my overall health and reduce side effects from chemo. I am pledging to get back on track but not to the point that I feel guilty for eating a cookie or two. I gave up wine for pete's sake. I did this because I could feel the difference in my liver after drinking. Reality...there is no quick easy answer and no cure right now. I just gotta keep on doing my best and forgive myself when I screw up. It is what it is and I do have so much to be grateful for in my life. Kay",

They sent me for a special test (I can't remember the name) to see if it was broken but it was fine. My nurse also talked about the skin growing over the flap as well.  Yesterday was my onc appointment. I've had way too much liver progression in the last few months. I asked her if I don't have any treatment at all, how much time do I have? She said, three months until your liver fails. BAM right in the face. It was heartbreaking to see my daughter's face when my onc told us that. I am starting Xeloda next week. My word for 2016 was Intuition and I have connected with that inner voice. Her words didn't really surprise me. My word this year is Believe and I am working on it. Love you all so much.

We all have so much going on and I want each of you to know that although I may not respond to you individually, it isn't because I don't care. I think of our group every day and pray for successes. I'm coming up on a year since my original diagnosis and not one single treatment has slowed this crap down. My onc tested for MSI, whatever that means, and I am not eligible for Keytruda which I think is the only immunotherapy option that is currently approved for breast cancer if the MSI is high enough. Mine was negative. I will find out on April 16th if Xeloda has made any progress. So if it hasn't, what do I do next? I mentioned Y90 to my onc and she had no idea what I was talking about. She just said radiation isn't approved for my type of cancer. You know, I am just really sick of all of this. Sick of nothing working, sick of people telling me I can heal myself if I only believe, sick of staying positive, sick of not knowing when not if I will die. I have been \"so brave\" to this point, keeping a stiff upper lip for the most part and kind of in a semi state of denial. One year later, I am scared shitless. I don't want to die. I'm not ready to leave my loved ones. I have things to do. I'm too damn young. I need hope but can't find any.",

The first one was a Phase II gem/carbo adding G1T28 or trilaciclib to protect my bone marrow from damage by the chemo keeping my immune system strong. The second one was the one I went down there to pursue: Phase III trial of IMMU-132 vs treatment of choice by physician. The doctor suggested I take the first one since I haven't had gem/carbo yet. I agreed but this trial has three arms: gem/carbo alone, gem/carbo with drug all on same day, or gem/carbo day 1 and new drug day 2. The trial is randomized so if I am selected for the first arm, I will opt out and do gem/carbo here in Oklahoma City. The good news is I can try for the other trial after gem/carbo either way. The issue with the second trial is that it's 50/50 that I will be selected for the IMMU-132. If I am not, I can keep trying to get in until I am selected, at least that is the way I understand it. Doc is ordering a brain scan because I have been have headaches off and on and ear pain in my left ear. Please please don't let me have brain mets! Once that is clear, I will go to Dallas for CT and Bone scans and blood work. I find out the day before my scheduled first round of chemo whether I receive the trial drug. So here I am waiting. I haven't had a treatment since Oct 31st. Since the Taxol was ineffective, I am concerned that my liver lesions have increased. One thing I am doing is using my time wisely and doing exactly what I want to do. I am praying for each and every one of you.",

I reported earlier about my having an ultrasound and CT scan to determine if I had a blood clot. Both reports indicated that I have \"multiple hepatic metastases measuring up to 7.1cm in segment 2 and have all increased in size.\" The CT report went on to say \"Moderate diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver is present. Small gallstones are in the gallbladder. A 1.2 cm left adrenal adenoma is unchanged. Multiple left axillary lymph nodes measuring up to 1.6cm in short axis have decreased in size. Mild thoracic spondylosis is present. A 1.1 cm soft tissue lesion in the inferior right breast at 6:00 position is unchanged. Surgical changes of the left breast are demonstrated\". I questioned my onc about these results because 1. I didn't realize I had anything going on in my right breast. The cancer was in my left breast and is now NED. 2. I haven't had surgery other than a biopsy and marker placement in my left breast. 3. How many is multiple hepatic metastases? 4. Are you sure these are my results? She asked another radiologist to read the results and he came to the same conclusion. Answers to my questions. 1. It's been there from the beginning but is the least of our worries. 2. The radiologist was referring to my biopsy. 3. Multiple means there are too many to count. 4. Yes these are your results. My liver enzymes yesterday before chemo were AST-93 and ALT-123 which are basically stable from 2 weeks ago. This week before chemo, I was experiencing sharp pains in my upper abdomen and felt very full after eating. I was also foggy brained, teary and fatigued. I understand I the cancer is progressing and I know none of us have crystal balls, but damn I am worried that I won't make it to the 33 month average. What are your thoughts on these results? What else can I do? I asked about milk thistle and really already knew my onc's answer...it won't help but it won't hurt. I am feeling anxious and somewhat defeated. Kay ",

I saw a oncologist here in Oklahoma City but opted to get my direction form MD Anderson in Houston. I received 4 doses of AC chemo over 8 weeks. My last chemo treatment was July 13th. An ultrasound showed about a 10% decrease in the size of the tumors. I was supposed to start Taxel next but my intuition told me something wasn't right. I asked for a PET scan. My original tests were CT Scans, MRI's and ultrasounds. The PET revealed another small tumor in my liver and the biopsy at MD Anderson confirmed it as TNBC and now stage 4. I had horrible side effects with AC chemo. I wasn't myself and I couldn't do anything to stop the crying, depression and feeling physically crappy overall. When I found out I was stage 4, I immediately signed up for a trial that was anything but chemo. My markers came back negative for the trial so I am ineligible. If the flood waters recede, my next appointment in Houston is Sept 7th to have CT scans, etc. then follow up with my doctor on the 8th. Bottom line, I don't want to do chemo. My fear is that I won't have quality of life and why extend it if that is the case? What happens if I do nothing? How long will I have? These are the questions I will ask my doctor. I am open to feedback and your experiences.",

When I have faced obstacles in the past, I have hunkered down, made the needed decision and executed the solution. This time there isn't a permament solution. I still haven't wrapped my head around that but I have decided whatever is in my power to do I will do. I've been an on and off again yogi for 3 years. I've decided to be on again from now on. The breathing, the poses, the oneness with the group all help with my healing. I also embrace Reiki treatments. I had my second dose of Taxol on Monday. I have been walking a mile or two a day to stay active. Last night I attended yoga and after received Reiki from 4 wonderful women. Last week after my treatment, I had horrible cramps and pain during the night that lasted a good 24+ hours. This time I have a few pains in my hip area. I believe the yoga and Reiki made the difference. I'm also reading Anticancer A New Way of Life by David Servan-Schreiber, MD, PhD. I came across it because I found a documentary on Netflix with the same title. This book is so informative and from a cancer patient's viewpoint who happens to be a doctor as well. If taken to heart, I believe it's a life changer/extender. The movie (documentary) is The C Word.  I am not hopeless or helpless in this fight. I am grateful for the love and encouragement I receive from my friends and family as well as the sistership with group. Kay",

On top of that, I have bone mets in my right ribs, right scapula, right hip, upper and lower spine and left ribs. No wonder I hurt like hell. Why didn't the CT scan detect this in February and again mid March when i went to the ER? Are the machines outdated, the radiologist inadequate?? Im still doing the trial but I'm losing hope",

So now it's in my breast, liver and bones. Apparently I have a fracture in my right hip's ball and socket. To top it off, I have a tooth infection. This all happened this past weekend. I woke up Sunday and couldn't walk. I went to the ER and because my immune system was zero, I received 2bags of platelets and a bag of potassium. I dropped the trial because this happened after one infusion. So now I go to the hospital every afternoon this week to get a shot that will boost my white blood cells. I will also receive radiation on my hip daily for 2 weeks so I can walk. In the meantime watch out for the candy apple scooter. Once my blood work is normal I will start another trial but that won't happen for a month to 6 weeks. I would appreciate your love, prayers, and light. You all lift me up every day. 💕✨💙",

I went down a few days later but not completely normal. Yesterday, I noticed what looks like little red worms under the skin of the same hand and today it si puffy and swollen again up to my elbow. I have not had any surgery. It is the same side as the lymph node involvement under my arm. My oncologist is out of town at another clinic today so my nurse says to go to the emergency room. Hell no!

So I had another ultrasound of my arm, shoulder and upper abdomen and a CT scan of my chest yesterday to try and find what my onc thinks is a blood clot. Didn't find one but discovered that I've gone from 4 tumors to 7 tumors in my liver, the largest increasing from 4cm to 7cm. My last PET was Nov 2nd. I was without treatment waiting for a trial from Oct 31 thru Dec 7 then went on gem/carbo. My onc thinks the growth happened during the time I was not on treatment instead of while I have been on gen/carbo. I feel like she is giving me false hope. She wants me to do 3 more treatments and then another PET. I am waiting on my liver enzyme results to come back today. Last week they were around 110 and 228 I think. She put me on 2mg daily of Warferin because she still thinks I have a clot that can't be found. What are y'alls thoughts about my progression?",

This will be an iv chemo every other week and a pill taken twice daily. Biggest risk is low white and red blood counts. Waiting on scan appointment and also have to wait another 2 weeks to get Xeloda out of my system. I have no idea other than the markers is X was working or not. I think my MO was tired of dealing with me. I really like the new MO at Stephenson Cancer Center. They have added me to the waiting lists of all immunotherapy trials coming up as well. I should hear back later today from the IR regarding Y90 for my liver . Anxious to learn his opinion. ",

My CT scan from Friday shows that I have significant progression with innumerable lesions in my liver, the largest measuring 5.7 x 7.8. So Xeloda did nothing. On top of that, I have bone mets in my right ribs, right scapula, right hip, upper and lower spine and left ribs. No wonder I hurt like hell. Why didn\u2019t the CT scan detect this in February and again mid March when i went to the ER? Are the machines outdated, the radiologist inadequate?? Im still doing the trial but I\u2019m losing hope",

So now it's in my breast, liver and bones. Apparently I have a fracture in my right hip's ball and socket. To top it off, I have a tooth infection. This all happened this past weekend. I woke up Sunday and couldn't walk. I went to the ER and because my immune system was zero, I received 2bags of platelets and a bag of potassium. I dropped the trial because this happened after one infusion. So now I go to the hospital every afternoon this week to get a shot that will boost my white blood cells. I will also receive radiation on my hip daily for 2 weeks so I can walk. In the meantime watch out for the candy apple scooter. Once my blood work is normal I will start another trial but that won't happen for a month to 6 weeks. I would appreciate your love, prayers, and light. You all lift me up every day. 💕✨💙",

      "Content": "Dec 1, 2017 09:14AM - edited Dec 1, 2017 09:23AM by kaylynne kaayborg, Cancer SUCKS! When is your next treatment? I was offered two trials at Texas Oncology. The first one was a Phase II gem/carbo adding G1T28 or trilaciclib to protect my bone marrow from damage by the chemo keeping my immune system strong. The second one was the one I went down there to pursue: Phase III trial of IMMU-132 vs treatment of choice by physician. The doctor suggested I take the first one since I haven't had gem/carbo yet. I agreed but this trial has three arms: gem/carbo alone, gem/carbo with drug all on same day, or gem/carbo day 1 and new drug day 2. The trial is randomized so if I am selected for the first arm, I will opt out and do gem/carbo here in Oklahoma City. The good news is I can try for the other trial after gem/carbo either way. The issue with the second trial is that it's 50/50 that I will be selected for the IMMU-132. If I am not, I can keep trying to get in until I am selected, at least that is the way I understand it. Doc is ordering a brain scan because I have been having headaches off and on and ear pain in my left ear. Please please don't let me have brain mets! Once that is clear, I will go to Dallas for CT and Bone scans and blood work. I find out the day before my scheduled first round of chemo whether I receive the trial drug. So here I am waiting. I haven't had a treatment since Oct 31st. Since the Taxol was ineffective, I am concerned that my liver lesions have increased. One thing I am doing is using my time wisely and doing exactly what I want to do. I am praying for each and every one of you. ",

I am probably just fooling myself. My tumor markers will be available this morning and that may tell us something too. Are you feeling well enough to spend time with your family? How are your girls and hubby doing? How are you emotionally? I feel like we spend so much time talking about trials and numbers and stats and white counts in order to keep from thinking about how we feel in our heart and soul. I rarely allow myself to cry and if you had known me before, I was a huge crybaby. It's so weird that I don't feel like I can cry now. it's a strange strength or denial. Thank God for friends and my girls for keeping me busy and going all the time. I know at some point I will have to deal with the real shit going on in my head. Please update us when you can. You are in my thoughts and prayers. Sending love and light to you. Kay",

It will be interesting to see what my liver enzymes and tumor markers are now. Each time I have had the gem/carbo treatment, a few days later I feel bloated and have minor stabbing pains. Did you experience that? What have you found out about the trial? I read that you will find out about randomization on Monday meaning whether or not you get the drug? A weird thing happened this week. My left hand, which is the side the cancer is in my lymph nodes and breast, swelled up. I have not had any surgery so it can't be lymphodema. I had an ultrasound and it's not a blood clot. It has gone down some but it's still puffy. Anyone had these side effects? ",

It's wonderful that you have an oncologist that goes the extra mile and truly listens to you and answers your questions. Sometimes I feel like mine just sees and expiration date on my forehead. As far as I can gather, she is old school. Her nurses do all the legwork and she doesn't even look at my chart or test results until she sits down in the room with me. But honestly, I don't know if it would be any different anywhere else. I started Xeloda yesterday. I have about a year's worth of hand and foot cream so this stuff better work! I am hoping and praying that gem/cis reduces those bad boys and keeps you stable. hartish: I am praying your treatments kicks into overdrive and you see tumor reduction and not just stabilization. April isn't too far off but I know the waiting and wondering is the worst. Hugs to you.",
