It sounds like your DH is supportive and wise. Hang in there, Karen in Pittsburgh",

On Oct. 27, I had bilateral mastectomy with DIEP free flap reconstruction and axillary node dissection. 9 out of 20 were Pos. So, I saw my medical oncologist yesterday and will be starting 6 rounds of TC every 3 weeks. He was concerned about some redness on my new right breast and won't let me start until the PS clears me. I see him on Thurs. I have also elected to do acupuncture before each treatment to help with nausea and vomiting. I had a really hard time with them 17 years ago when I did AC. I am a special education teacher at the primary level and am concerned about going back to work. My paid sick leave will be over in Jan. What most concerns me is being around little kids who are still learning good hygiene habits as this will increase my chance of infection. I would rather not go back during chemo if I can help it. Any thoughts? I am making myself a wreck thinking about this, and getting the chemo, etc. I am still swollen from the reconstruction as well. Don't I sound miserable! Its not that bad really, I guess. I would love to continue to be on this thread. Next time, I won't write as much. Karen in Pittsburgh",

They gave me Benadryl to avoid any allegeric reaction and I actually fell asleep during treatement. The first day, I was really tired, runny nose and slightly elevated temp. plus a headache.  I thought I might be tired from the Benadryl.Friday was a little better, but still had the headache. Yesterday, was okay and today was pretty good. I am having some taste issues, bathroom issues but no real nausea and NO vomiting! They do have better drugs now and I had acupuncture before TX. What is the butt cream you guys are using? I could use some. My hair guy cut my old wig to make it more stylish (it is 17 years old) but I still hate it. It doesn't look anything like my current hair. I think I wll make an appointment with \"Hair Enhacements\" at the cancer center where I get my chemo. I am still swollen from my reconstruction. My belly is really tight and nothing fits. I want to go out, but the sweat pants don't always cut it. Boy, am I complaining or what? I think I'll find an Ativan and try to get some sleep. I was given Neulasta, and so far so good. I guess everyone responds differently. Well, here's to better days and nights for all. Karen",

I'm not sure I have someone to stay with me that night and am alittle anxious. When I had chemo 17 years ago, I just threw up all night. It was hellish! I will be getting TC this time, not AC like last time. I've heard its not as bad. What was everyone else's experience. I've heard this a thousand times, but it still rings true; The anticipation is the hardest part! Hope everyone is feeling well tonight. Karen in Pittsburgh",

I am very sore and can't wait to get these awful drains out. It is SO difficult to get comfortable. On Thurs. I see my PS and hope they will be gone. I have been living in my recliner and hope I can sleep in bed with some comfort after drains are gone. I had an axillary lymph dissection which turned up 9 out of 20 Pos. nodes. They also found +nodes in R using SNB. I suppose I was somewhat prepared for that. My onco said after the first stereotatctic that he had a feeling I would need chemo. I had chemo 17 years ago when I had a lumpectomy and hear its not quite as rough now. But......right now I am trying to focus my energies toward healing from this surgery, so I am not too concerned about chemo now. Vicadin is great! It helps me sleep and be almost free of pain. HOpe everyone else is doing well.",
