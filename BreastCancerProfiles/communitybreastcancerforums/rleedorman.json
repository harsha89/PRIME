I have a cyst that my PCP knows about, it can felt and was on mammo 4 years ago said to be benign....it hasn't changed so that isn't my concern; the concern is there is not one single mention of this cyst at all on either of my reports from yesterday's imaging. Stated in the mammo is \"breast parenchyma is heterogeneously moderately dense\" and no significant findings. BI-RADS is Cat 3 probable benign findings. Impression on ultrasound is \"negative bilateral breast ultrasound. Dense fibroglandular changes. I am beside myself right now because even the obvious was not noted on either one of these - really need some advice.....this just frustrates the life out of me! Log in to post a reply",

Sherburton, you are in my prayers so please keep us posted! ",
