I must say I am amazed at the speed of which our American sisters are processed - start to finish is much quicker.  Do I think we are in jeopardy of having a lesser standard of care?  No, absolutely not.  I've learnt to deal much better with the time buffer allowing me to educate myself on all aspects of benign and early stage BC conditions.  I'm ok. I will agree with most posters about the waiting though - it's tough.  I found a couple of visits to a therapist to assist me with viewing the glass as half full, not completely empty has helped tremendously.

My case was interesting that while the docs were focusing on my right breast for a small amount of DCIS and subsequent finding of LCIS, my left breast was not tested. Screening mammo caught the tiny calc clusters originally in my right breast - I am a very small breasted woman, so no lumps or abnormalities were ever felt or discovered by me. I was sent for a breast MRI due to the surprise finding of LCIS during the excisional biopsy, to see if anything else might be lurking. Something small and vague showed up in the left breast, but the doctors weren't overly concerned. I'm freaking inside and asked if they would do an ultrasound and needle biopsy on it, after the doctors suggestion we monitor it and re check again in six months. They scheduled it pretty quick and there followed a total shocker. Left breast had DCIS and IDC. You could have knocked me over. I feel totally responsible for saving myself. Had I waited another six months, the tumor would have required me to have chemo. I missed this by 1 mm. Just sayin... And no, you're not overreacting.",

My worry about ADH and the risks/monitoring did not last long - I was diagnosed with DCIS and an incidental finding of LCIS after an excisional biopsy and lumpectomy on September 22, 2011. That lead to an MRI post surgery to see what else was going on, for which they found something suspicious in the opposite breast. This little something was also making a joint appearance in an earlier US - one that I insisted on as I wanted both breasts tested. The LCIS/DCIS had made me a little nervous, but I was told not to worry too much about the new findings, likely some benign condition like a fibroadenoma, but it warranted a biopsy due to the busyness of the other breast. Incidentally, this new finding was never seen on any mammogram and it turned it to be a small amount of DCIS with an invasive component (IDC). A second lumpectomy on December 23, 2011 removed this new lesion and I had 7 lymph nodes removed via SNB. Nodes clear, thank goodness, but compromised margins on lesion removal. I have just finished up radiation therapy to both breasts with additional boosts to the invasive side. I survived and it wasn't all that bad. I paused in January to experience a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Survived that just fine too. There's a girl on these boards that has her signature quote something about if you fear the worst and it happens, then you've lived it twice. By the way, my recurrence risk is high, about 18% with my two primaries, so I will be taking my chances without hormone therapy because of the blod clot and stroke risk. my advise, relax and get on with living life. I tell everyone \"I'm happy, I have no complaints!\"",

Well, at age 51&1/2, I had a recall for digital mammo, that went from suspicious calc cluster on digital, to ultrasound (findings multiple cysts & fibroadenoma), stereotactic VA core biopsy (findings ADH), then excisional/lumpectomy (findings DCIS 2.5 mm, LCIS 3 mm - LCIS was incidental finding).  Clean margins, but then on to MRI, both breasts (findings suspicious area on opposite breast), then ultrasound guided core biopsy.  OK - enough and we're still not sure the extent of what I have and how I will be treated (if at all).  Still waiting for latest biopsy results. My surgeon calls this \"the wild goose chase\".  How far do you go and once you have information, how do you act.  Depending on what you read or who you consult with, it is either cancer or pre-cancer.  Too small for radiation, but now high risk of possible future breast cancer warrants high risk surveillance for the rest of my life. My point is, on the one hand I'm grateful for the early detection, but on the other hand, the physical and psychological trauma for this ongoing wild goose chase is hard to take.  It's such a grey area.  I will bet the cummulative cost of all of these procedures is a lot on our social health care system.  The hardest thing about it all is if I had done no screenings or diagnostics, there is a very good chance that I would live out my life never getting BC, nor dying of it.  But now, I have the information.  What will I do with it?",

This is the risk up to age 80. Of this 12% risk, 2% occurs by age 50. From 50 to 70 the average woman's risk of breast cancer is 6% and from 70 to 80 it is 4%. The 2% plus 6% plus 4% add up to 12%. As a woman goes through each age without a diagnosis of breast cancer, she leaves behind the risk associated with it. To put risk in another context, you are not at risk of being in an accident on a road you traveled yesterday. You can only be at risk for today's roads and the roads you'll travel in the years ahead. The article explains how risk is actually assessed and how it is often misleading to the layman in how the results are displayed. It's not specific to DCIS, but most studies that produce percentage results. ",

Anyhow, I thought this case study was interesting:",

Because of this condition, one never knows who will get a recurrence or worse, and who will not, so I'm often torn between doing nothing from this point on and taking my chances, or doing everything such as PBMX.  I have to have a referral to the cancer clinic for consultation.  It is unlikely I am a candidate for radiation as the lesion was so small, but I'm not a drug person either.  Would opt for more surgery before having to take a hormone therapy.  Quality of life I guess is a personal decision. Anyhow, will keep you all posted. Take care.",

I rarely come here anymore, as although I went through some challenging times, more so with my aneurysm than the cancer - I struggle more with the psychological after affects of having gone through breast cancer than the actual treatments themselves. Just trying to put it in the rear view mirror and move on in life, but it's hard. Ann, of \"But Doctor I Hate Pink\", wrote an excellent article on surviving cancer in her blog. Anyhow, just reporting that I'm just over a year out of treatment and doing ok. Here's wishing calm minds free of worry.",

If there was an 80 or 90% chance of good news, I swung the other way. It's very hard mentally. What they did to my body was only 20% of the whole picture, my mental end of things was most affected. I found it helpful to talk with a counsellor at the Cancer Agency. I must now learn to live with my high risk of recurrence as the tamoxifen is only predicted to give me a 30% reduction to about 12% recurrence and has too many risks and side effects for the small amount of gain. I did not require chemo due to my \"lazy\" cancer's mitotic rate, but grade 2 with necrosis, so thus rads for both sides. I also found it helpful to consult with a naturopathic oncologist for ways to improve my diet and add some beneficial supplements. I have chosen this over drugs and perhaps the ADH ladies should look at doing prevention diets and gaining peace of mind that they are doing all they can. I have an excellent book from the naturopath onco, if anyone wants the title, please PM me.",

I was expecting worse, now one month out after having both sides radiated, you wouldn't be able to tell by looking at me. The SNB was the worst of everything they did to me. The area is full of nerves that get damaged during the procedure. I was doing too much too soon and ended up with a stubborn seroma which needed draining a couple of times, but it kept returning. Mostly better now, six months out. So take it easy. A big hug for ya and keep us posted. There are lots of good threads in this site to offer support. Take care.",

      "Content": "Oct 2, 2011 04:55PM - edited Oct 2, 2011 04:55PM by Chickenpants Hey... I can sympathize with you.  I've had all of this done and more, but just not in one day.  I totally understand the pain grenade too.  I'm not sure how I would have faired if I had to go into all of these tests unprepared.  It's scary.  Do you have close friends or family you can talk to.  It's good to have that support.  I call these people in my life my \"posse\". It's good to keep busy, so unless you're physically ill, go into work and the time will pass quicker until you know the results.  I think it's not proper for the hospital/lab staff to scare you that way.  Support is one thing, but it's your doctor's responsibility to talk to you about your condition - at least that's what we do in Canada.  None of the x-ray or ultrasound techs discuss my findings or give an opinion and they tell me that, even though I'm likely to ask anyway. Not only is this a good venting space, it's great for support.  I, myself, like to be informed, so I do research on my own condition.  I find it helps when I meet with my surgeon to discuss findings and next steps. I'm sorry to hear about your dad.  These things never seem to pick a good time to occur... Take care of yourself.",
