      "Content": "KatieT wrote: Stereotactic biospy came back ADH; excisional biopsy was last Thursday. What do you think of getting a 2nd path opinion regardless of what the 1st one says? Given the lack of agreement about ADH and DCIS, even if the 1st one comes back ADH, I'll wonder if they missed something or had lower standards.  With Hopkins so close, it seems like a no brainer to let them have a 2nd look. (esp since my insurance will cover it!) Too much worry?  Is ADH after an excisional usually right?  As far as a second opinion, I'd also be looking for confirmation, not just a different opinion.  If 2 reports give me the same answer, I'd be much more at ease. Thanks ladies! Your posts here are so helpful :-) Log in to post a reply",
