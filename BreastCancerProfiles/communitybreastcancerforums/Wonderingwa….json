BS said that what I may have been experiencing was a minor infection (ducts still open from nursing).The antibiotics seemed to work! She did not feel any suspicious lumps (lump diminished in size) and that the discharge is, in fact, milk! I asked how long this would continue, and she said up to a year (especially since I nursed my kids for so long).  She also suggested to get a screening again if anything suspicious continues at 35 (or sooner) and definitely at 40. Glad the news is good. Thanks everyone for your support! I wish you all well. Stay strong! ",

On a side note, i've been experiencing dental problems (gingivitis) and I am wondering if there is any correlation to my breast issues? My oral hygiene has always been good, but when I went for a checkup the dentist told me that I need a special cleaning because of gingivitis. My gums get achy sometimes and other typical gingival symptoms.  It just makes me wonder if what is going on with my body is systemic, as that would sort of make sense. I'm no doctor or medical professional but my body has been out of sorts for months now. Especially since last month when my breast all of a sudden started radiating with pain. The itchiness, nipple discharge, etc. I remember I had issues with my breasts last year, however, I was still nursing and used an antibiotic and fungal pill/ointment which seemed to resolve the problem (I think?)  Also, there have been bouts of unexplained nausea and tiredness.  Could be hormonal, or something else. I will try and remain optimistic in the meanwhile before my appointment when I should find out more. I thank you and others for your words of hope and insight. I wish everyone well. Take Care. :)",

I remember you stated previously that an infection was the most likely cause of this. I hope you are right. It just surprises me that it would take so long for it to appear AFTER I stopped nursing (4-5 months is somewhat of a distance in timespan).  I am surprised that she didn't prescribe antibiotics first, as well. I think she was concerned because of the lump and the pain that I was experiencing (by the time I went to get seen by her, I was already having this problem for several weeks). Also, I may request that they take the nipple discharge to get checked for infection. That makes the most logical sense to me. I really would prefer not to have to biopsy (at all). I'm also wondering what to expect if the lump does not go away? Why is the lump there to begin with? Can the lump be excised or drained? If what I have is an infection, will the lump go away? Thank you for your help and support. Wishing everyone well.",

I am experiencing similar issues (stopped bf'ing 5 months ago) so my pcp is suspecting mastitis, possibly. I am also on an antibiotic for 10 days. My symptoms are slightly different though. Err on the side of caution here. ",
