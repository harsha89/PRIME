I had a lumpectomy, 05/11/09, now I am trying to make my decision with radiation, either Internal Radiation/Mammosite Radiation or External Radiation.  One procedure you can get these treatments over and done with in 1 week with 2 treatments a day. The other conventional radiation -7 weeks 1x per day for 5 days.  I am reading about these treatments.  My question is how long over years is the cancer kept away with these treatments? Does this last 10 - 20 years? or less?   Maybe I am confused.  So much information.  I saw my radiologist oncologist yesterday and he said something about years.  My brain was trying to absorb so much unti I believe I get the info mixed up. Any feedback would be great. Thanks. joyB.",
