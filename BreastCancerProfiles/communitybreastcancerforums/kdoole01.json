MarieK has some good advice and you will get your \"plan of attack\" in order to settle in for the marathon. I once met a lady at chemo who told me that she had just had her 7th recurrence! I was aghast, but she then said to me \"I have lived over 25 years with breast cancer. Back in those days they didn't tell you anything and you just did what you were told to do. Now I'm and old lady (as she laughed out loud) and bring my own hot chocolate to chemo and things to keep me busy while I am here...but I am still here!\" And I'll tell you something...she looked damn good! So I know that people are put into our paths to teach us a lesson. Cancer is a marathon...so you need to pace yourself. Give it the time and attention it needs, but get back you your like asap. It doesn't deserve the best part of you, so give it as little as possible! Good luck!",
