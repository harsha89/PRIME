I am 4 1/2 weeks into radiation - 2 1/2 weeks to go. \"Boost\" is focused radiation is where your tumor was.  Regular radiation does your whole breast. I just had my first few \"boosts\" - I am getting 27 regular sessions and 8 boosts. But everyone is different.  And everyone's experience varies.   I'm using Udderly Smooth for a cream.  You can buy it at CVS or online or many places.  No joke. Its cheap ($3 for a tube which lasts longer than your whole treatment). Dont spend too much money on creams. Its NOT worth it. Udderly Smooth isn't my perfect thing because I'm an eco-girl and I'd rather have things that are organic, but its good and feels good. This was the recommendation from my radiation folks here in LA.  Oh, the strange remedies we use. Who knew.  First few weeks I had no side effects, except a little soreness. Now, getting pretty tired on and off. Sore breast. Feeling it in my armpit.  Key is to keep stretching. Take Advil or something  if you have swelling.  I'm also getting acupuncture, too. Its good.  Keep walking every day, even if you're tired. Eat well... really important to keep up the protein, vitamin E, Omega 3s, all that stuff.  Starting to get a strange taste in my mouth.  Apparently that doesnt happen to everyone.  Wondering if anyone in this group is having that reaction. I'd really love to know. Mostly, I've been fine, but just this week and last I'm feeling it.  But only 2 1/2 weeks to go, and heck, its so much easier than chemo.  And, its just on and off. Ask your friends for rides to places. That way, if you get tired, you aren't far from home and having to drive yourself.  Oh - get soft camisoles.  No underwires.  No bras made of synthetic materials. It feels SO much better to have soft, natural fabrics, and nothing tight.  Ditch the tight clothes until radiation is over! Thanks everyone, for sharing. Its good to be able to come here. I got a lot of good advice from friends so happy to share it.",
