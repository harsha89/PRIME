We have received many awards, including Magnet Status, and only 2% of hospitals in the country receive award. I'm not trying to be biased because I'm an RN there, but I KNOW I'm in excellent hands. The surgeon who is performing my bi-lateral mastectomy specializes in breast surgery. I love her! She's very caring and understanding, and totally agrees with my decision to do the bi-lateral mastectomy. Also, my oncologist did not tell me DCIS isn't cancer, she said it's referred to as a pre-cancer because it's \"in-situ\". I guess it's just a matter of the terminology an oncologist uses to describe it. My sister was diagnosed 4 months ago w/DCIS, had a bi-lateral mastectomy at the end of March, and is \"all clear\" waiting to go for her exchange surgery on August 7th. I'm going to be going through the same treatment regime for mine as she did with hers. Her oncologist referred to it as breast cancer, though.",

I met with my oncologist today for the first time and she said DCIS is referred to as a \"pre-cancer\" since it's non-invasive. I called the nurse at the breast care center to confirm what I heard and what I've been reading. Has anyone else on here who had, or has, DCIS been told by their oncologist that DCIS is \"pre-cancer\". The nurse at the breast care center said it is termed \"pre-cancer\" or \"non-invasive\" because it normally does not spread to any other body tissues. I just feel horrible for telling my friends and family I have breast cancer when the oncologist said it's referred to as \"pre-cancer\"! To me, it's in the duct, which is in my breast. I really feel the information needs to be changed and this should not be considered a \"pre-cancer\" since anatomically, it IS breast cancer! I fought like a girl and I won!!! LET'S GO MOUNTAINEERS!

Like it was said earlier, this is not a competition. We are all here to show love and support for each other as we go through our journeys. :) Â Much Love!!",
