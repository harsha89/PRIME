I totally get your feeling about the lump being more noticeable. I can't see mine, its too small but since all the poking and prodding with needles for biopsies, I can feel it now - its a weird stinging sensation and hard to ignore. I had a rough day yesterday, was super teary and emotional. I had to tell my work about it and withdraw from my PhD which was due June 30th. On top of all that I got confirmation of HER2+. All these things on their own are manageable but they all happened within 2 hours of each other. Last night, I booked a mini holiday with my husband for next week, took a Phenergan (antihistamine that causes drowsiness) to make sure I got a good sleep and I feel much better about it all today. Day by day, remember: Inhale/Exhale repeat\u2026. xo",

Several biopsies later, I got my diagnosis yesterday and am in full planing mode to eradicate this from my body. I'm 41 and the cancer is very small which is a very good thing. My only concern right now is that there could be other very small affected parts that cannot be detected via ultrasound. I have elected to get an MRI to investigate further but want some advice on whether people have had good success with this and if it changed their treatment or surgical options. Cheers Aged 41 at diagnosis. The little lump that changed it all.

Here goes: There is a node near the cancer mass that was biopsied by FNA at the same time as my Vacuum Assisted Core Biopsy of the mass. It is borderline suspicious and will be removed during surgery. I will also be having a sentinal node biopsy. Which I should have mentioned earlier vbishop, my bad. I have In Situ and Invasive Ductal Carcinoma which is e-cadheran positive. The Oestrogen + is 90%, Progesterone + is 80%. HER2 is 3+ and a SISH test is being done. Vbishop and ElaineTherese, I have found out more about mastectomy and now understand what is involved. It has changed my mind and now I realise that it was a knee jerk reaction. I've had some wild thoughts running through my mind! I'm much more informed now :) gerrib, hello fellow Aussie! Wow $350 is a bargain, it was going to cost me $550 and I have already spent more than $1500 on imaging with only a bit of that back on Medicare. I was advised by the Clinical Nurse Consultant at the hospital to wait and see if the surgeon recommends it and it will then be free. I'm guessing now that if I have Chemotherapy it will blast all the cancer cells left in my body, which would mean and MRI, (knowing the limitations and benefits), would essentially be redundant. Please correct me if this is wrong. Next step is snagging an appointment with the surgeon, who only does consultations on Fridays and you guessed it, Easter Friday is looming. I really want to get in this week or it will be a big wait. Thanks so much to all of you who have chimed in, I know so few people in my circle of friends who have had breast cancer and don't really have lots of people to talk the specifics with\u2026 Cheers",

I'm already thinking about a double mastectomy to reduce my chance of future cancer and will be taking any advice from the surgeon about this. LisaAlissa: Great to hear you didn't have more lesions! SpecialK: My lump was invisible in the mammogram and at first, everybody thought it was a fibroadenoma as it is very hard and moved around during the two FNA and one Core Biopsy I had. Great advice about the limitations of the imaging, Ill keep that in mind. My radiologist is awesome, he has been so informative and despite the huge shock this news is, he has personally provided very detailed information about all the possible scenarios my diagnosis presents - so I trust that he would not suggest it if he thought it was not worthwhile.",
