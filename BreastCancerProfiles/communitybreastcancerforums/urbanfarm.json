I had my annual mammogram a few weeks ago and then was told I needed a breast ultrasound. Then the radiologist came in and said he saw a small spot and wants to make sure. So I\u2019m scheduled for a biopsy. I am truely scared so I called my dr and asked her opinion on the reading. She said the pea size spot is small but solid. That\u2019s why he wants to check it. It doesn\u2019t have any blood flow to it. Just a spot about 7mm. So she said don\u2019t worry too much. If it is cancer, it\u2019s good it\u2019s small. I\u2019m 47 and in menopause. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s nothing.",

I cried and have been a wreck since Friday. Have to wait a week for biopsy. I\u2019m in menopause so hoping it\u2019s related. I\u2019m gonna call tomorrow and see if they can get me in sooner.",
