In fact, if I had stayed after my mammo and ultrasound I could have had the biopsy right then, but my head was spinning. I think the best thing, the only thing that got me through the week long wait for the biopsy, was to NOT think about it, as difficult as that is! Try not to google too much, I did that and scared the pants off myself. Find ways to get your mind off things, like everyone is saying, and institute your girlfriends into a support network. Having my closest friends in on the \"secret\" made it so much easier for me. Every time we got together, which was often, I would completely forget. It also helped to talk to them and see their biopsy sites/excision sites and hear everything went just fine despite how frightened they were. When I got the news, we met up only an hour later and partied and laughed and cried and hugged a lot. I am so thankful for them! Ignore statistics, they really don't mean anything. Seriously. Just a bunch of numbers someone cranked out. They don't take into account the entire population of the world, your own personal medical history, yadda yadda, they are just a random sampling, many times from just one clinic and one area of the country or from a bunch of random research articles.     Sending you lots of good thoughts and wishes.

At 8 pm a voice message came through from the doc \"I am not sure I have the correct number but if this is you I wanted to let you know there is nothing to worry about and I have been trying to reach you to talk to you and please call my cell phone\" No idea why the phone never rang!!!! so I called her cell phone and no answer. I left her a message saying I am glad to hear nothing to worry about, I would try to reach her again after the holiday\" Phone tag sucks! She called back, but by then I was at a party, she left a message saying she would like to follow up in 6 months. So I don't know what the results truly are but \"nothing to worry about\" sounds a-ok to me. I will call on Monday and get a copy of the pathology report. I had to dance holding my breast tight to me, hahaha. It is really bruised today, more so than yesterday, but I have no pain anymore. Yay!  Nervous1 let me know how it goes for you. I am keeping my fingers crossed. Happy New Year! -Elly",

      "Content": "elly wrote: Hello all. Have been lurking here for a week or so. I am 40 y.o. and went in for my baseline mammogram last Wednesday at a fabulous breast  clinic in Rochester, NY. Never expected them to find anything, I am a nurse and massage therapist, my palpation skills are top notch! Yet, I missed a lump. They found it on the mammo and after a bunch of extra views, being called back in multiple times, I knew something was up despite them telling me \"this is routine, you just have really dense breast tissue on one side\". So then they call me into a room and tell me they need to do an ultrasound. No one said why, but everyone was so nice and caring and making sure I was comfortable. I even got a 20 minute chair massage while I waited! Ultrasound tech didn't say a word but I could see her measuring the lump on the screen. The doc came in shortly after and did her own ultrasound and used something that colored the areas and measured again, speaking very quickly told me I needed a core biopsy to determine if it was cancerous but that I would be sore and since it was the holidays I may want to wait. I was so nervous, I decided to wait and I finally went in yesterday to have it done. Anyway, they tried the sterotactic machine but I am fairly small and there wasn't enough breast tissue according to the computer. I was scared to death of some machine doing the biopsy and was greatful when they said it couldn't! But after laying in that machine for over an hour while I was squished every way possible, I was sooooo sore and my neck and shoulder were stiff. Yep, I am being whiney. They took me into an ultrasound room and did it that way. The procedure went off wtihout a hitch, everyone was so wonderful and caring, the only part that hurt (barely a sting) was the lidocaine and usually I am a HUGE baby. When it was done they inserted a marker in the shape of a breast cancer ribbon. How cute. Followed up with a final mammo to check placement of the marker and I was out of there (4 hours later!)  So here I am today, sore as can be but thankful the swelling went down (so I can wear my new years eve gown tonight!), miserably awaiting my results. I am lucky that I get the results today after 5 pm, unlike some people who have to wait. But every time I think of the phone ringing my stomach jumps and I want to cry.  Thank you for listening to me vent. Keep your fingers crossed for me! Elly Log in to post a reply",

I was going braless last night but read on here somewhere to wear a sports bra and that has helped tremendously. I took my bandages off this morning, steri strips still in place and wow, what an impressive looking bruise! (Doc said she hit a blood vessel when she gave me the lidocaine, not to be surprised if its a big bruise) Sorry you have to wait so long. I will keep my fingers crossed for you! What did they see on the diagnostics? I have a \"thing\" for lack of a better word (they didn't call it anything in particular) that is only 7 mm. My birad was 4. I spent all day yesterday searching \"by rad\" till my sister found out it was\"birad\" lol. Not happy with that, but whatever. Trying to stay positive but instead I am worrying myself to death.",
