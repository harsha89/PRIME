Numbness and tightness, especially over the incision site but range of motion exercises really helped with the tightness. As you can see, I hardly ever post but do lurk off and on. These forums have been so helpful and informative, hopeful and supportive that I finally decided to have DIEP flap reconstruction. I'm scheduled for this Tues, May 15th. I'm finally more excited than scared, nervous. Time to wrap this experience up and move on. It's getting old. Duckee, as in 'Well, isn't that just...'         ",

I was told they would call @ 9:00 am and trying to cope with those results all day would have been impossible. So I told them to just leave the results on my voicemail and I would pick it up later in the day...which is what I did. A couple of extra hours or days will not make a difference in care. Enjoy your day with your kids.",

I guess my biggest memory was, after my first tx and associated symptoms, I thought I had it all figured out how I was going to feel after the second tx; guess what, it was always different! In terms of muscle/bone fatique, overall fatigue, taste changes, appetite (actually decreased). The biggest surprise was a case of shingles, just a small group of dots that I thought were bug bites or spider bites and I happened to show them to the derm doc who said, nope those are shingles. Looked nothing like the extreme case they show on the commerical. I was extremely tired by the third day, and would slowly start regaining stamina so by the next tx, I felt pretty good then to be knocked down again but I did walk just about every day for at least a mile ( it was summertime) . SOmeday just as slow as a turtle but I got outside. My dog loved it.",
