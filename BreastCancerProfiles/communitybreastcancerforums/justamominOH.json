To make a long story short I see a PA for nipple discharge.  She does a super thorough exam and since I am post-menopausal just with the nipple discharge she wants me to see a breast surgeon.  She also found a lump as well & my areola is pulling in a little off to the side & there is a dimple along with that.  She said that before I see the surgeon I needed another mammo (had one in Jan 2012) and diagnostic mammos. When I go for the mammo the woman who does them asked me what my problem was & I told her nipple discharge & a lump.  She does a regular mammo on both sides & takes it off to the radiologist.  She came back & said the mammos looked the same as last time so I didn't need any diagnostic mammos. I go to the breast surgeon & she wants to take out all the ducts.  She did NOT even do a cursary breast exam other than squeezing my nipples.  I have had three fibroadenomas removed and as I recall all the doctors did a thorough breast exam.  She did not mention the mammo & since they told me that it looked the same it didn't even occur to me to ask about it. So......I did not schedule the ductal excision because I just didn't get a good vibe from the doctor.  I realize that I have fibrocystic breasts but that has never caused my areola to dimple & pull in when I flex my chest.  The dimple is visible all the time, my nipple pulls downward and in & there is also dimpling below it in the lower outer quad.  I was so shocked that she didn't even do an exam that I didn't even show her.  Yes, this was dumb and I should have asked her about it.  So........yesterday I get a note from my insurance plan that says I need further followup based on my mammo results.  WHAT?  Has this even happened to anyone else?  The radiologist said I should have followup for the nipple discharge but the report says the followup is for more testing based on the mammo? I am just so confused. Log in to post a reply",
