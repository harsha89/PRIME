It gives me courage and hope to deal with BC when I hear from others who has same diagnosis. I had Bil- mx, AC+T dose dense, rads, and tamoxifen. I was diagnosed at age 40 and had lots of LN positive. When they did LN biopsy found nothing comses surprise at surgery. I was diagnosed on 11/11 and it will be 1 year of tamoxifen On April 24. I visit this website often. I had been wondered if that nasty chemo was worth it to take. But that was what Mayo clinic had for me. Before chemo therapy they said my grade is I to II  after surgery they said 95% tumor had grade I, basically very low grade. A lot of things I didn't pay attention on the begining, it was totally shock to me to have BC without any family history. It is almost one and half year from the diagnosis, I think body and mind some how start to heal after i finished active treatment. But back of the head i am always thinking about BC and makes me scare if it comes back. Having two little one at home makes very sad and panic to think about tomorrow.  I am using massage, yoga and accupunture and which has been very helpful. I have to tell that if i didn't find this site i could have gone crazy. Listening to other survivars gives me hope and courage and do my best for my body and mind.",

I went throught same treatment plan that you are going to have. Looking back, now i feel way better. I didn't sleep for almost a month and when i got ativan boy i felt so good. Take every day as a new day. When you are on chemo make sure to stay healthy-prevent from getting around sick people and stay away from crowd. Make sure to eat enough protein and iron and maintain your liver health. I ate lots of vegetables and drank a lot of juice and water. I still can't eat some food because i ate those during chemo. I couldn't eat some food after couple of chemo, i didn't like the taste. I will encourage you to talk to councelor where you can talk your fear and anxieties. I encourage you to listen music that calms you down and also do meditation. stay calm and make a determination you have to be there for your kids. You are on my prayers.",
