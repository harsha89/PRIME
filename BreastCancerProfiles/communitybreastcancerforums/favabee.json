She hasn't always gotten the best care at her hometown oncologist (this is her fourth time with breast cancer) in Wisconsin or at the hospital in Madison. Thanks for any ideas!

She's been in chemo for 10 weeks, Avastin and Taxol, and her liver tumor shrunk by half, but her lung tumors (many) neither grew nor shrank. Her tumor markers are way down too. Should we be happy with this result? She's scheduled for 4-6 months of chemo total. I just feel anxious that her lung tumors seem to be just sitting there waiting until the chemo is over. At what point does a second opinion make sense? Thanks. Tamara Log in to post a reply",
