Have you tried reaching out to the triple negative clinical trials matching service for info on clinical trials that you might be eligible for? You can fill out a profile online or call them and they will take your information by phone. They will send you a list of trials for which you are preliminarilyeligible. You (or maybe your MO) would then contact the coordinator for each trial of interest for further details. The website is www.tnbcfoundation.com and phone is (877) 769-4827. I hope this helps.",

I'm now on halaven and have been stable since January. My mets are to bone, lymph nodes, lung, liver and bone marrow. I'm glad to have found you all. Robyn",

I just learned that my triple negative breast cancer has spread to two spots in my spine and to lymph nodes in my chest. I have read that xeloda can be effective for stage IV, but what is its effectiveness for triple negative Stage IV? If you are on or were on xeloda, how long did it work for you? It has been about a year since I finished prior chemo for triple negative Stage II and with this new diagnosis, I'm trying to understand what to expect. Thank you for your thoughts.",

The immunotherapy drug initially looked pretty good and my tumor markers went down some, but about five months into the trial I developed pneumonitis (lung inflammation) from it and also my cancer started to grow again so I was removed from the trial. Still, I wonder if the immunotherapy may have contributed to my success with halaven. There's so much we don't know about immunotherapy still. I find halaven to be a bit rougher than some of the other chemos I've been on - hair loss, nausea, fevers, fatigue - but it is working so I'm all in. I'm so glad to have found you ladies. Robyn",

Once these are completed my oncologist and neurologist will determine if I'm well enough to have the Ommaya Reservoir placed and then move ahead with methotrexate. They will hold on more halaven which I've been on for other mets since February. Is this timeline and chemos similar to those others have been on? Brain cancer is anew met for me and I'm not sure what to expect. Thank you for your feedback. Robyn ",
