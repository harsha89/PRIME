My advise after going through surgery and chemo is to keep your normal life going as much as you can.  My kids just had a big hockey tournament and I had a great time.  Wouldn't have traded it for the world.

He did come up with an interesting question that hadn't been brought up at Stanford.  Because I had a breast reduction on both sides when the lumpectomy was done, he feels it will be hard to find the exact area to do a \"boost\" on.  All of the tissue has been rearranged, so there is no real markers to where the tumor was.  That is the bad news.  The good news is that without having to worry about the cosmetic results of the lumpectomy, I have HUGE margins of 1.5 cms all around, so maybe not having the boost won't be a problem. He did say one weird thing that freaked me out a bit.  He asked if I considered a mast., because if I did that I wouldn't have to potentially worry about 6 weeks of radiation.  What the heck??? Hope this is not a big red flag.  Not sure if he hadn't read the notes that I already had all this work done or what.....Yikes.  I told him if I was going to go that route, I sure would have done in months ago.  Can't imagine a new surgery at this point to not deal with rads!!!   ",

I'd love anyone input on this question.  How important is the role of the radiologist?  After my consulatation at Stanford, I already know the course of treatment I think I want to pursue, so I would be using this local facility more for just the radiation itself.   Does the radiologist really do the treatment himself, or is it mostly techs that do it?  I'm also thinking that it might be worth the extra drive and just continue at Stanford, even though it will add an additional 1 and a half hours a day in drive time for 6 weeks.  But, then I don't have to hassle with having all the records going back and forth, which so far is a big pain.   Any thoughts would be appreciated!!!  Thanks,      Lisa Dx 6/10/2008, IDC, 2cm, Stage IIA, Grade 2, 0/7 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Thanks for your input! Lisa    ",

No pathology is back yet, but with a Grade II, 2.3 cm tumor, I might have to do chemo.  Do you have any idea when this would potentially start?  My husband needs to go out of town in September to visit his 83 year old ill mother, and we're trying to figure out a good time for him to leave.

On another note, my oncologist, who is very well regarded at Stanford, was very strong in saying that the Oncotype DX was just one part of the puzzle.  The Adjunct! model showed a much higher chance of problems than my Oncotype score showed.  Also he noted things from the pathology report such as necrosis around the tumor, which shows that it is growing fast enough that the blood supply can't keep up.  So, here I am with the A/C plus T.  And, I have to say, with the drugs that help control side effects, I make it through the A/C part pretty easily.",

For example, the day after my surgery the plastic surgeon's resident took out the drain.  Later in the day the breast cance surgeon asked why the heck the drain was already out.  Bottom line is that they are out, and it seems to me that they shouldn't be.  Did anyone else have bleeding under the incision after the surgery?   Would this still have happened even if the drains stayed in longer?  Also, nothing that I got from the nurses said I should be putting any ointment on the wounds, so I guess I shouldn't.  I feel like I didn't get much after surgery information as there wasn't one doctor officially in charge. Also, my fact sheet says that I can shower in four days.  Does this mean four days after I got home from the hospital or from the date of my surgery? Thanks!",
