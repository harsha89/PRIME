Of course there are scars that will never completely fade, but I can live with that. It took me longer to get used to the change in sensations. I'm sure you already know this but only a very small percentage of people get any feelings back on their nipples. I got a lot of the usual skin sensation back everywhere, but my nipples feel totally numb. It feels weird when my husband kisses them because if I'm not looking I can't even tell that he is doing anything to my nipples. I used to actually freak out a little bit at first and told my husband not to touch my nipples. But as with anything, you get used to it. Now it's a turn on for me to watch my husband make love to my nipples. As for the \"headlights\", they do become erect with temperature change, or sometimes for no good reason it seems. I can't go braless for that reason. I wish you all the best with your surgery. Remember it takes months for the swelling to go down and for your breasts to settle, so don't judge your breasts at first. Don't even look at them if you can help it. Just focus on healing and being good to yourself.",
