Here is my situation and would love any feedback that can be offered. In January I noticed some dimpling on the underside of my right breast. At the time I didn't realize it could be a symptom of BC until I started to research it. I went to the OB in February and I was referred to have a diagnostic mammo and they did an ultrasound which found nothing and I left with peace of mind. I noticed it getting more noticeable and after reading a lot your posts, found that many had been missed on the ultrasound and mammos. I called the dr again who referred me back to the breast center. My appointment was yesterday. The physician didn't feel anything and didn't notice the dimpling so much till I showed her a picture. The breast surgeon came in and again didn't feel anything and told me that it is caused from \"having birthdays and babies\". I asked why it would just suddenly show up now and why would it be getting more noticeable, and again she said basically from getting older. I'm 38 with 3 kids by the way. She did an ultrasound and again it didn't show anything. She said insurance companies don't like to cover 2nd mammograms in less than 6 months and said that without having good reason insurance companies also won't cover an MRI. She said because of the dimpling I'll have to come back in 3 months to have it monitored. I don't really know what else I can do. In your opinion is it ok to wait 3 months? I also have some pain in only that nipple and occasional sharp pains in only that breast.Thanks in advance Log in to post a reply",
