I do not recall fatigue being touted as a symptom of breast cancer, yet in retrospect I remember being exceptionally fatigued prior to a separate primary breast cancer diagnosis 15 years ago.  How quickly we forget our history. I believe fatigue is a symptom that might wisely be \"talked up\" in our everyday conversations.  I agree with DFC1994.  We gals need to realize something! is running amuck in our bodies when we consistently feel fatigued.",

I discovered this posting on another forum:  DCIS. posted by swalters It confirms what I heard my surgeon say; however, note the word some, so while some surgeons/oncologists may recommend radiation for DCIS, and some not, a recommendation depends on specific diagnosis/pathology. CMG Lumpectomy alone without radiation is now standard of treatment for some DCIS patients. I chose this option in 2007after consulting with Dr. Michael Lagios, a world renowned DCIS expert and pathologist. He is one of the inventors of the Van Nuys Prognostic Index and has a consulting service that anyone can use.  Using the VNPI he calculated my risk of recurrence as only 4 percent, which made me very comfortable in omitting radiation and tamoxifen. This might not be the right choice for you, but I think it might be helpful if you knew your chances of recurrence with and without radiation.
