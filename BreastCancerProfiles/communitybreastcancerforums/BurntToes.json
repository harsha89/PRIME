It can costs you lots more money, it can mess up your holidays. They started my chemo on December 17, so it wouldn't mess up my holidays ( their idea). I couldn't reach my MD Anderson doctors a week before Christmas, when I started having problems, and had to go to the ER on 12/23, locally, cause I was dying. Spent Christmas in the local hospital, Never heard from my MD ANDERSON Dr. Until after Christmas. It was the last Christmas my mom was alive. I was in isolation. It was awful.",
