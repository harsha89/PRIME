I have read so many things about muscle lost that I am not willing to change my life enough to compensate for those issues. Example, I read about not being able to canoe,(paddling) That is my leisure activity. My husband and I also remodle houses, I need my muscles.  Thanks again for reinforcing my decision. Marjorie",
