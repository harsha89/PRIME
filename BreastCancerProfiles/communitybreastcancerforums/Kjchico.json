I thought I was just called back for further testing because of very dense breasts. I was dumbfounded to hear I have a mass. Last year I had a great report. I guess life is full of surprises.",

      "Content": "Kjchico wrote: Hi, I am 66 and had my biopsy two days ago. Received my final mammogram and ultrasound report when I was leaving the center. I'm just anxiously waiting for the results which were promised me for tomorrow afternoon. This is what the report said: Left beast/axillia: 2:30 7 cm from the nipple there is a round hypoechoic mass with internal vascularity that appears to correlate with the mammographic asymmetry detailed. The mass measures 8 x 7 x 7. Impression: Suspicious 8mm mass seen on ultrasound that likely correlates to the suspicious asymmetry within the far posterior left breast. Ultrasound guided biopsy recommended. Bi-Rad Category 4C: High suspicion for malignancy. Tissue diagnosis is needed. My mother had a small breast cancer at 80 and my older sister had breast cancer five years ago at the same age I am - 66. I don\u2019t know how this one will turn out. I keep telling myself benign because I am one of those with the mindset that nothing will happen to me. What I wrote for the report above is confusing, not sure if it is favorable or not. At least the mass is small, I was completely unaware of it. Help! 🤞😎 Dx 4/15/2019, IDC, Left, <1cm, Stage IA, Grade 3, ER+/PR-, HER2- (IHC) Log in to post a reply",
