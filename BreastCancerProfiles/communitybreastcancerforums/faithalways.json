Last fall I flew in Canada to do a mammogram (as in USA I don't have health insurance) and as expected it didn't look good, but they require further examination. Therefore another mammogram. I am looking for a program under which I can do a FREE MAMMOGRAM here in SF Bay area.Â  I know some, but they are for women after 40. Waiting 5 years is not an option, obviously. Is there anything you are aware of? If not free, then at least low cost... How much can it cost? Thank you so much for your suggestions feedback. Log in to post a reply",
