I've done that with myself and my kids. I don't want to do that with something this serious, but you do need to be informed and have it checked out. Praying it's nothing to worry over for you anymore! Let us know how things turn out.",

What they are telling me is that there was a known fibroadenoma and they feel that they came in from a different angle or something and picked up on it. However, there's nothing even remotely suspicious about it. The BS said we will check with US again in 3-4 months. I can live with that.",

Has anyone ever had a suspicious area on an US show up that initially started the need for a biopsy disappear in a follow-up US? Well, that's what happened. The one I was concerned about the most didn't show up, but they had discovered a spot on my other breast in doing the follow-up. That is the one we biopsied instead of the one which first showed as suspicious. Anyway, all is well just sore and swollen. I should have results by Wednesday. Log in to post a reply",

I know I have a fibroadenoma in the left breast. It's scary that things don't show up on the mammograms. I'm extra cautious since my mom was diagnosed with BC a year ago.
