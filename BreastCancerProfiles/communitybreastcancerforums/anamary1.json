I'm not sure what they will be in my case. You girls with nausea, get more meds!!! IV and pills. It is manageable. Took me till my forth treatment to get that all straightened out and by then, I was done with treatments. I take it all now, I don't even know if I get nauseous cause I just take everything but the kitchen sink. Ohh, something I realized, if you take antidepressants like an SSRI with certain nausea meds, did you know some nausea meds block serotonin, there for canceling each other out! I have to talk to my phyciatrist about that. Have a great weekend! ",

      "Content": "Nov 11, 2009 11:22PM - edited Nov 11, 2009 11:27PM by anamary1 I hope I'm not being repetitious, I already posted on some other threads but since I'm starting chemo in Nov. I wanted to get on here also. Let me start by saying, boy you girls have a lot to say. I am not able to go back and read all you've posted already, but plan to. I hope it's okay to be here since I am a recurrence and not a first timer.  I was originally diagnosed in Nov 08 with carcinosarcoma in the breast. Had Mod rad mast, 8 act's, 7 weeks of rads..... pet ct a few weeks ago showed activity in the lungs. Two biopsies later, my pathology came back. Somehow they still didn't get enough tissue for all of the tests. I guess that is a good sign because it so small they can't get much of it. 9 tumors in my mastectomy side, two in the other with 1 large +node. The sarcoma aspect of the tumor has been ruled out. Now it is a poorly differentiated carcinoma. It is now considered a Triple Negative Breast Cancer mets to the lungs. They were not able to test for the HER2 receptor because of the lack of tissue but the Doc believes strongly it would be negative. The Doc gave me a few different options including a clinical trial in Birmingham (its all over the country but that's the closest.) 4 hour drive... If excepted, depending on the drug plan I would be put on, it would be a twice a week trip to B'Hama week or once a week. This trial includes a new drug that is in stage III testing called a PARP inhibitor. It shows a lot of promise when combined with gemzar and carboplaitnum chemotherapy. But it is not recruiting yet! So, instead of waiting, I'll be starting my treatment here at home, Friday the 13th. I'll be getting Abraxane every week and Avastine every two weeks. The length of my treatment is undetermined. It's different than what most of you 1st timers are doing for treatment. And not sure about the side effects yet. I hear its easier than ACT. Wish you all the best and I've been through the ACT and then some, if anyone has questions.  ",

Melinda, yes, your bottom has dropped out. I'm on different chemo and my bottom hasn't dropped out but my doc told me it would take a few cycles before I it did. I get mine every week and so its not as intense as some of you other girls, because it is spread out more. It will get bad, just not as soon as it did for you. My next treatment is Friday and I get Turkey week off... I'm not telling anyone so that I can get out of cooking, lol. Feel better soon! Anamary",

Got a bunch of pre-meds, steriod, atavan, aloxi, emmend and then my chemo drugs. A few friends came my to visit. And I feel fine today. I'm also taking cough medicine for this unexplained cough. Doc says just take this cough med and wait and see what the chemo does. I think it was from my biopsy that I have the cough. I take emmend, reglan, and zofran at home for the nausea. I learned this the hard way during ACT so this is my chemo cocktail stated above. I didnt get it right until the 3rd or 4th cycle. Let me know if I can help any ACT girls!

I've been dealing with it for two months and still can't deal with \"permanent chemo\", is what I call it. But it hasn't been that bad. I am on Abraxane(a taxol) and avastin for 5 treatments come Monday. I just get winded and tired and can sleep a lot if you let me. Really not bad se's as far as I am concerned. I did NOT shave my head like I did the first time. It started  coming out day 15. 6 weeks later, I still have a lot of hair. It doesn't look very pretty, looks fried and kinda dead but it's still there on my head. It's not falling out the way it was the first few weeks. So, you might just want to wait and see on shaving your hair. Just cut it real short for now. Last time I shaved it cause it was just annoying me, this time I thought I'd try to deal with it and see. If and when you are NED on this protocol, my doc said he would keep me on avastin for a while, not exactly sure why, I know it kills the cancer cells abillity to make new blood vessels so I guess they want to keep it in your system for a while. The se's are not bad from the avastin. I sure hope I get to that point! Good luck! Ana",

I'm glad because after two months, I still have most of my hair. I had it colored a few days ago and you really can't tell that I've lost as much as I did. I have A LOT of hair to begin with. I am Latina  and so I have lots and lots of thick hair. Keep your nails short and clean, normal chemo protocol. Mine have started to get dark lines and they separated a bit during taxotere so I'm sure they will with this also. These last two weeks I have been tired and nauseated. I get aloxi and emmend in my IV and emmend at home plus zofran and reglan. Thats the one side effect I always had the most trouble with. As far as the acne, I did some research and had the doc prescibe Clindamycin Phosphate and it helped a lot. I still have a bunch of red spots from where the acne was. I still have a slight breakout on my forehead and a bit on the back of my neck but it's more under control with the clindamycin so go ahead and get a script before you start. As of last week, my pet scan showed no hypermetobolic activity !!! My lymph node has shrunk along with a few other large tumors. The doc said it means the tumors are dead. I'll be having a few more cycles and then another pet. I hope it keeps working !!! I wish you the best of luck, may it work as well for you as it has for me. Ana",
