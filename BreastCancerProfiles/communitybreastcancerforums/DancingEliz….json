The sentinel lymph node is not only positive, but has \"extracapsular extension\". I'm having an axillary lymph node dissection on Tuesday - to dig out more bad nodes and biopsy them. (I'm still not sure why the BS did not do this during the mastectomy but maybe because of the reconstruction). Anyway....so I'm in a very scary and sad place. And, am worried it might have already spread to other parts of my body because of the extracapsular extension. That part really freaks me out.. I sent my BS an email - asking if he could order a PET and/or CT scan for me because I want/need to know and this is so anxiety provoking because I feel like the news just keeps getting worse. In the meantime, I was wondering if anyone here (who is Stage IV) can pleas tell me - if there are physical symptoms of mets??? I don't have any bone pain. But, I wouldn't be surprised at anything - at this point! Let me know - what you think....",

Then - he took 2 more pictures - of my trunk area (this time he did both sides). So - I'm freaking out because I'm not sure why he specifically wanted that view with my head turned to the left. I'm thinking maybe he saw something suspicious and needed another picture taken - with that specific view??? I'm so tired of being so scared (like my user name).   ",

My MO was saying that - also - when I saw her on Thursday... (she actually doesn't think its radiation recall)... DivineMrs.M - I can totally relate to what you're saying about anxiety...it is so paralyzing... I'm glad Buspar has worked so well for you!!! I tried it when I was first dx'd last year and I think I might have been on too high of a dose because it caused dizziness. I think I'm going to ask for it again - to see if a lower dose might work. I have leftover Ativan - but - have been trying to *save* it for upcoming scans (as my MO wants me to have these routinely done for the next 5 years)... Anyhow- as I was telling Deanna - my MO doesn't think its radiation recall and wants me to have an ultrasound on the area. Its scheduled for 4/11. (She thinks I might have done something involving my right expander). I remember yanking hard on my back-pack about a month ago and feeling like I hurt something in that area. I'm having a very hard time though - as this whole experience with BC started on exactly 4/13/16 (after a breast ultrasound). So - having an ultrasound scheduled for 4/11 - is really making it hard for me to function. I know they say Xanax is addicting...but I feel anyone whose had or has BC should have a lifetime supply of it! Living like this - in a world of unknown and anxiety is not really living... .",

And, am (also) on Arimidex. I read somewhere that AIs can potentially raise ALP levels...but I am definitely not an expert. I have achy knees - too. (Have had bad knees for the past 10 years - so nothing new) But - I do feel they are a little more achy since starting Arimidex about 6 or 7 weeks ago... From what I understand...mets are VERY unlikely to go to the knees (much less start there!) It's great news that your other labs are normal and your left breast came back benign!!! That must have been very stressful to endure.... I don't know if stress raises ALP - but would NOT be surprised!!! I sometimes wonder - if lab values - normally fluctuate - but we would NEVER know this - if it weren't for the constant monitoring of our lab values... Anyway...I am glad your MO ordered the scan... For what it's worth - mine was completely normal but my MO wants to do another one - one year from that one....anyhow!",

Its where you develop all the same symptoms from radiation (redness, swelling, pain) - months (or sometimes longer) AFTER you've completed radiation. The RO said: If it isn't cleared up by April 17th - he wants me to off the anti-estrogen pills - for 2 weeks - to see if that clears it up. Because, he strongly suspects this is due to my anti-estrogen medication. (I'm on Arimidex). And, would then have me take a different anti-estrogen medication. What FREAKS me out is: what if EVERY anti-estrogen pill does this and I can't take them????? I feel like this is my only REAL protection from Stage 4 and I am VERY high risk. And, if I go to Stage 4 - then I wouldn't be able to take this med? WTF. I am beside myself with sadness....",

      "Content": "Dec 7, 2016 01:15PM - edited Dec 7, 2016 01:17PM by DancingElizabeth Hi All, I was told by my current MO the bone scans (to check for mets) are routinely done one year after the first one. But, my previous MO told me - the protocol is bone scan to check for mets - ONLY - if there's something indicating mets in the bloodwork and/or you are having symptoms (and, if your last bone scan was abnormal).They, also, said repeated bone scans can increase the likelihood of leukemia. So - I'm really confused and would much rather have the bone scan - ONLY - if I have symptoms and/or something shows up in bloodwork... Scans take my anxiety level into a whole other dimension of anxiousness.... But, then, I'm wondering if my current MO wants me to have one after one year - to be extra vigilant due to it being Stage 3?",

But, in my case I'd rather her *not* do them as this test truly scares me. It's giving me a great deal of anxiety because I feel like there must be *some* cancer hiding out somewhere in my body. I feel like I'd rather not know...as I'm not in any pain and rather have a mental break from BC until my scan that is scheduled for July... Genny - I'm sorry I don't have any answers for you...just know you're not alone in this TM torture...(((hugs))). As for me...I had the dreaded blood work done on 2/20 but still no results. I'm worried (also) that my blood work might have gotten lost because at had it done at another medical facility (because it was easier to get to). I guess I probably should have had it done at the same facility as my MO's.... ",

I remember being so worried - that I emailed my BS - to see if it could get biopsied. And, he said it was way too small for biopsy! Hang in there. One thing that helped me - I actually got a second and third opinion (as I was sure it was mets and really needed to hear it from more than one MO that it wasn't)",

I take Arimidex and my MO monitors my hormones and still very much in menopause. It helps my mood, but doesn't do much for the hot flashes - though. Still get them all the time - but - that helps me know the Arimidex is doing it's job. LOL. Hope that helps!!",

The problem I found with telling people - is you might find yourself having to reassure and comfort *them*. It takes a lot of emotional energy having to do that while trying to manage your own feelings. I found some questions that (well meaning) people asked - to be incredibly invasive and plainly excruciating. Especially since I was dx'd as Stage 3. That's how I got thru it. But, do what makes you feel Ok!! Everyone is different. Some people feel better telling others - but telling others made it worse - for me. :-( Please do whatever you need to do during this time - to take care of *YOU*!!! (((Hugs)))",
