Little bit of discomfort but not as much pain , taking tylenol as of now. As per doctor , surgery went fine and to him lymph nodes looked normal but we will know for sure in pathology report Today i wanted to take shower , since i have vaso vagal syndrome , i became light headed while looking at the drain site :) will shower tomorrow now. Just want to get my arm back in motion and get over with radiation too. I am also planning to start taking biotin for hair growth , eyebrows and eylashes( 4 weeks out of chemo) , Its been a long journey and still going on..waiting to look and feel normal again :)",

I just got call from my BS office regarding pathology report. I didn't understand what she said initially ,but what i could make out is that out of 30 lymph nodes 6 were effected and Doc was able to get all the cancer out :-D ..so officially i am 'cancer' free. I am not able to find out what does the number of lymph nodes effected means for future treatments or recurrence?",

As far as side effects are concerned , the first day of infusion was yucky , feeling drained out and energy less but it was still better than the last one. Today is 2nd day after infusion and i feel little less side effects as compared to first infusion ( knock on wood) The things that i have been doing constantly that i think is helping : drinking lots of water , having dexamethasone right in the morning (for 3 days) , claritin , biotene mouthwash , going for walk and eating whenever i can. Apart from that i am keeping my brain busy , doing puzzles , office work and now will try to start mediation as well. Wishing and sending all the positive vibes to all of you who are about to start or undergoing infusions , have less side effects and great quality of life P.S My hair has started to come out so got a short pixie cut today . I guess i am going to loose all in coming week.I will be wearing wig when out in office or any gathering , other than that caps /scarfs at home",
