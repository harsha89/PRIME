I have other conditions that make any procedure somewhat challenging, so I asked if we could do anything else first in hopes of preventing any unnecessary procedures. He agreed to a Breast MRI stating that a biopsy may happen after that. So, I get the call that my referral is ready to by picked up for the MRI from my first Dr. Of course, I ask if they received the results from dish mamm & US. \" 7 Cm Oval hypo echoic mass.\" Makes me think that biopsy, and much more, is inevitable. I'm not very good at this hurry up and wait. Log in to post a reply",

Recommended to repeat MRI in 6 months unless I choose to do the biopsies earlier. After imaging, now only need 1 biopsy on left and 2 on right when/if changes are seen. It scares me to wait 6 months, seems like a lot can change in that short time span.",

I'm going for a consult with another Dr in a couple weeks (only as I have to get all those images on cd and I'm in overload with everything hitting from every possible angle right now.) I can use all the prayers I can get right now as it isn't looking good. The whole family history thing doesn't help my stress level. I think the waiting has to be the hardest part of this process. Test and wait, next test and wait some more. Too much time for the mind to wander and question everything. If my family weren't being hit in so many ways right now I think Id be sitting in a room with padded walls. Lol",

After the MRI, the suggested biopsies switched to only 1 on the Left and now 2 on the right. (I have to be very careful with any injury to my body even needles/surgery can cause my other condition to spread.) So, my pcp received report. Wasn't happy with almost conflicting reports from the different tests. Wants me to see a breast specialist. Called to scheduled. Found out they're a breast surgeon. Is this really who I want to get to look over all my images for a second opinion? Seems odd as they make their money by operating. Thanks Log in to post a reply",

Guess it has been hard to picture a surgeon looking at these several thousands of images and not finding something to 'take out.' I do completely like the idea of being proactive though. Maybe I was hoping I'd seen enough medical drama already the past few years that I'd get a break from this body. Lol Oh, how I hate not being a step ahead. Waiting, patiently. Never been me. The calendar with a piece of chocolate a day until Christmas as a kid...never lasted until Christmas! Lol",
