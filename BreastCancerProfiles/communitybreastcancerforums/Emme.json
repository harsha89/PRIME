I have just started working for a few hours a week.  I hope I am going to be able to get back to work and get out of this mess. thanks for listening Emily",

I'm not sure if I have shared any of this with all of you or not...If I have please bear with me, I'm having wicked chemo brain lately. This is my second roun of chemo.  My first was Jan and Feb.  My hair loss was my worst fear.  I felt like I had to take control so I shaved my head before my hair fell out on its own.  Buzzing my hair empowered me...like it was my choice versus a side effect of the chemo in my body.  I kept telling myself that hairloss is a sign the chemo is working. My scalp was sooo painful.  It felt like I had worn my hair in a too tight ponytail.  To make matters worse I was taking lapatanib (tykerb)  and it gave me a horrible acne like rash all over my face scalp and chest...gave me a renewed empathy for the teens.  This time around my hair is only an inch long...I hate to see it go again....it is just a tiny bit of normality that I am clinging to.  This time around I don't have that bad rash...so I hope it isn't as painful when it does fall out again. Ohhh and when I was bald I still used shampoo on my scalp...it felt funny using body wash or facial soap so I just stuck with the shampoo.  I hope this helps.  We are all beautiful...hair or not Emme",

I too went to the LGFB class this week.  It was a small class of 4.  We all had differnt kinds of cancer and were in different places in our treatments.  We all sat and talked at the end of the class.  It was nice to share and be understood.  I would really recommend this to everyone.  I didn't wear any makeup because I knew we would be applying new stuff!  ANDDDDD what lovely makeup and skin care products were in that  bag!  At the end I tried on a blonde wig and wore it home!  I will try to post a couple of pics of my wigs. I had my second treatment of  AC yesterday.  I took Emend this time and no vomiting last night.  thank goodness.  I have a port, and I am very glad I had it put in.  Initially my port was tipped.  Once the nurses realized this *the first sccess was a hard day)  they adjusted the position of the need and used a little longer needle.  After having the gallbladder issues and having lost 40 pounds in the process....this round of chemo my port magically tipped back to the proper position and it is smooth sailing. Even with the difficulties I encoundered in the begining, I woldn't trade my port for my arms.(I have a year of herceptin to follow this round)  It truly is much easier. On to my hair...Curious One last time I had weekly Taxol so my hair thinned gradually, not falling out in clumps like I anticipate this round.  It took about a month for all my hair to be gone. Every day it looked like I had a mini toupee in my turban.  My scalp was very sore...it felt like I had worn a too tight pony tail all day. My head started to hurt yesterday...that same feeling.  But no hair has started to fall out yet...I keep doing the fall out test - I try to pul out a few strands between my thumb and index finger...sounds silly, I know but I can't help myself...and so far no hairs have come out.  I have about an inch of hair regrowth from February. I am wondering if I should shave it closer.  It is really odd to me....but this time the thought of losing my hair isn't bothering me.  I have just accepted it as proof the Chemo is working and it's attacking any cancer cells that might be floating around in my body. I know some of you are experiencing Nausea. My first round of AC I had some vomiting, diarrhea and nausea that was mild but persistent with all three anti nausea meds.  My Onc. had me come in for fluid and a steroid pack...it made all the difference in the world...I felt refreshed...and no more nausea.  If I have any of these symptoms this time around I am running not walking to get those fluid again!  A word of warning...the steroid can cause you to become constipated...so stay on top of that with a stool softener. :) I hope all of you have a day free of SE.  Enjoy your weekend! Remember, Fight like a girl! Emme",

I have been catching up on the post for the past few days.  I have been tired, but trying to work a few  hours in the mornings.  I am going to try and post a few answers to some questions you ladies have had. Neupogen Shots I have used these thru both rounds of chemo. When I was having weekly Taxol Tx I used 5 per week and they kept my counts up. This time DD AC, I use 8 per cycle. The bone pain gets bad for me on day 9.  It is the worst for me in my breast bone and lower spine/pelvis.  The pain is a throbbing pain.  I use advil or darvocet.  It doesn't take it all away, but it does help.  I keep reminding myself that it means the shots are working. I am not sure of the cost, my copay is $30 for 5 injections. I inject myself in my belly too  I let the syringe warm up for at least a half an hour prior to administering the dose, it really reduces the stinging sensation.   I hope his information helps.  *************************************************** Before I started each different kind of tx I had to meet with one of the Chemo Nurses to have a chemo teaching.  At that time the nurse went over each medication I would be receiving.  They went thru the possible SE and gave me all kinds of information on what to expect during the infusion.  At my teaching for the Taxol, I was told that I need to have a ride because I was going to have benedryl.  And boy i was glad that I did have a ride!  That benedryl knocked me for a loop! ************************************************** I haven't had any sores in my mouth. I have cracks in the corners of my mouth.  Almost like chapped lips except my lips aren't chapped.  There are just cracks in the corners.  It hurts like hell...and I'm not sure what to do for them.  I keep putting on chap stick. I have developed a bad taste in my mouth too.  My mouth tastes like I have been sucking on a wooden spoon.  YUCK!  For those of you who have a metallic taste try using plastic utensils, that really helped me last time. It made me feel better when I keep reading that everyone else is getting increasingly fatigued on the AC as our treatments progress.  It comforts me to hear I am not alone and that what I am experiencing is normal.  Thank you so much ladies for sharing.  This board has been such a support to me.  Some days when this battle seems so huge, so overwhelming, I read these posts and find encouragement and strength to forge forward.  God Bless.

Can we talk Expanders for a few? I am getting fills every three weeks.  I am currently filled to 700.  My expanders can go to 850 and the plastic surgeon said he would push it to 900.  That will put me at a full B cup.  I really wanted to be a C cup.  I am 6' tall and on my frame a B cup isn't enough.  The plastic surgeon said he could go in and put in a larger expander and continue to fill until I get to a c cup.  I feel like I have been thru so much I should get what I want for an end result.  I should mention that 5 years ago I had a breast reduction from a G Cup to a C cup.  What do you ladies think....is it worth having to have another surgery...am I just being vain?  So many decisions....UGGGG!

SGJ05- I have had port issues...when it was placed as it healed it tipped...I have a power port too. The first time the accessed it I had to have radiology access it under flora after they tried 6 times in the infusion room.  Shortly there after I lost 40 pounds when my gallbladder issues wreaked havoc on me....miraculously my port was fine!  That was in feb.   This week after my last expander fill, it is tipping again.  I have a year of herceptin as well.... Ask for a prescription of Emla cream, It numbs the area prior to being accessed.  This helped me a lot. Welcome Georgigirl---Sorry you had to come to us, but so glad your here.

Last round I shaved my head prior to all the hair falling out...It made me feel incontrol of the situation. My hair is just about 3/4 of an inch long so this time I hope that piece of the puzzle is easier. I feel like I'm losing all of my femininity.  I am wearng makeup and cute hats but it's hard to have no breasts...I'm just not used to it yet.",

I have found through this whole damn experience that I have been so misimformed or downright uninformed.  When I was in the hosptial after my  BMX...I wasn't given any information on LE what to look for, or post surgical exercises to help with ROM.  I thought LE looked like elephantitis in my minds eye.  I had no idea that the small amount of swelling near the inside of my elbow, and the forearm pain was LE.  Good thing I call my BS...they thought I had a clot.  I did end up seeing a PT/LE specailist...she was wonderful.  I now have a compression garment that i have to wear for a few weeka and when I need it there after. Since I have been stretching and doing the manual drainage the cording is less painful...and I have continued to swim/float  for exercise as well.  I am thankful. Have a great evening...hell at this hour I am compelled to say sweet dreams :) Emily",
