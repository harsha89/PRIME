I was on the dose dense, with a Neulasta injection the following day. My side effects started the day after the infusion, and I had almost 2 weeks of all sorts of miserable reactions. I developed mucositis, which has been just awful. The \"miracle mouthwash\" has been helping. After the oncologist took a look inside my mouth he decided to change my regime. I will now have my A/C infusions every 3 weeks, with no Neulasta injections the following days. He assured me that changing from 2 weeks to 3 weeks will have absolutely no impact on the outcome of the therapy. I was prescribed Promethazine (Phenergan), Ondansetron ODT (Zofran), Prochlorperazine (Compazine), & Dexamethasone...all to help with the nause. Of course I didn't take them all at the same time, but I followed the nurse's suggested routine and got NO relief. The Compazine didn't even begin to make me sleepy - was hoping to be able to sleep off some of the nausea. I had to go in to the clinic to get an anti-nausea infusion to help calm the discomfort. The only pill that did seem to make any kind of difference was the steroid, Dexamethasone. They gave me only 10 pills, but after taking 8 I was feeling better. For the last few days I've been feeling pretty good...just tired. I have my #2 A/C on Dec. 11 and I know I will probably have to go through the same side effects again. I bought a package of emesis bags from Amazon so I can take one with me if I have to go out.  And, now today my hair is starting to come out. I sat in the bathroom and cried. I know all of this has to happen, but sometimes it's just so much to deal with. Thanks to all who here who provide their stories and their continuing support.",
