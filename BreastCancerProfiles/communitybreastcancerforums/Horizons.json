I had a mastectomy couple of weeks ago. Even though my OM strongly recommends chemotherapy, I asked for the oncotype test. I am waiting for the results. Should I also have asked for the mammaprint? How long do I have before they need to start treatment? Thank you so much! I don't have to describe how the last couple of months have been. I am so glad I found this community!",
