      "Content": "round1 wrote: In Sep. i found a lump in my breast, not the first. My GYN also felt the lump. I had a digital mammo 2 days prior to finding the lump, mamm did not see anything. Had another mammo, negative, the radiologist could feel the lump so i had a sono done at the same time. Because of the irregular margins he wanted a core biopsy  (US guided), result OK, but because of family hx. (mom died of bc, 2 aunts with bc, 1 with bc also have ovarian cancer), he recommended  breast MRI, which i did, now waiting. The radiologist who read my mammo and did my sono told me, mammo would not diagnose me unless it was calcified. I am 41, had my first mammo at 21 when found first lump, over the years in the same breast i have felt the lump, mammo negative ,no sono done, the other radiologist prior to this one seem to blow me off, even suggest the lumps i may have felt was a rib, after 40 years i don't  belive we grow ribs, i do my SBE monthly. For anyone who was diagnosed, prior to diagnosis, did you have pain or weakness in the arm on the side of the cancer? Log in to post a reply",

I can still feel it, she said it was the tissue in my dense breast that form to imitate a tumor/lump. Since the MRI nor Mammo saw anything, except for the sono, and the biopsy show dense breast tissue, then it's most likely nothing. I have no faith in these test, if i can feel it, why can't they see it. See it then tell me it's ok , don't say it's ok and you don't see it.  Option is to remove it or watch it for now? frustrated, don't want to find out down the line oop! we made a mistake.",
