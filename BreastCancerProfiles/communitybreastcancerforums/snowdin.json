I asked the tech about it, and he said not to wear a bra.  So I'm not going to, but I honestly don't see how that is going to help.  I'm glad to have the weekend off, maybe it will be back to normal by Mon.    ",

I know that sounds cold, but it made me laugh, because it is somewhat true.  No mention of creams or lotions, or really anything else now that I'm reading these other posts.  Are you supposed to not shave? I feel a little unprepared for this.",

Having the weekend off will probably help, it did for me. I'm on #7, and they gave me a sample of biafine to help with the nipple redness. Irr4993 - I feel so bad for you that your treatment is getting interrupted by the weather.  That has to be pretty stressful, hang in there! I live in Alaska, snow and ice are nothing since we have the tools to deal with it, but for those of you in the southern states .. good luck!  ",
