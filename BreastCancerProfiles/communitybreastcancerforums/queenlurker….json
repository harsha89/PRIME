Have heard many good things about Dr Zannis but he may take a while to get in . (if you are looking for peace of mind. ) I was very disapointed in Mayo Clinic Scottsdale-please PM me if you are planning to persue them.  Although I have heard good things about reconstruction there. Good luck in whatever you decide.",
