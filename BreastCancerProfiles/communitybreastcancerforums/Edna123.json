      "Content": "Edna123 wrote: I had a mammogram and sonogram yesterday that showed I have a solid lump in my left breast. I also noticed, just within the last week, that I have a dark red bloody discharge coming out of a single duct in that breast, in the section of the nipple that corresponds to where the lump is. I have a sonogram-guided core biopsy next week to find out what the lump is, but I am trying to find out more about what my \"chances\" are that it is cancer. (I am an academic research librarian can't help trying to research this as much as possible!) From what I can see from searching PubMed, etc., \"pathologic bloody discharge\" seems to be associated somewhere between 3-10% of the time with a breast cancer diagnosis. Much more often, it is associated with benign intraductal papilloma. What is hard to figure out is what the chances are of it being cancer when it appears in conjunction with a single, solid lump like mine (see below for more details). The lump that I have does not look at all like an intraductal papilloma, based on what I saw in the ultrasound. It's looking to me like it's very likely that it's cancer given my family history, what the lump looks like, and the combination with the bloody discharge. Is there anything I'm missing here? Could it still possibly be a fibroadenoma? I will have to wait about two weeks to find out the results of the biopsy. More details: I am 35 years old. I have a history of breast cancer in my family descending through multiple generations on my mother's side, through her great-grandmother and grandmother. My mother was diagnosed at age 48 and survived. One of my mother's female cousins with the same lineage was diagnosed at age 28 and died in her 30s. I have been preparing for a possible genetic test but haven't taken one yet. I have very fibrous breast tissue, especially in the area near where the lump is. I first noticed the lump about 6 months ago but waited about 3 months to see my doctor because I thought it was fibrocystic. I haven't noticed it changing at all since I found it, and it doesn't hurt. It feels like a solid, rubbery ball.  The lump is in my left breast at about 3 o'clock, about halfway between the nipple and the underarm. The sonogram showed it is oval, about 1.3 cm across and approximately 1 cm tall. The technician did not say much about what she thought it looked like, but to my untrained eye it looked like a smooth oval with no branches. The mammogram results aren't in yet. As mentioned above, the bloody discharge is coming from a single duct in the same breast as the lump, on the side of the nipple that corresponds to where the lump is. It appears when I squeeze the nipple very gently. I haven't noticed spontaneous discharge but it's possible it has happened (I tend to wear dark-colored bras). I am pretty sure it would be classified as a \"pathologic breast discharge.\" I haven't been able to discuss the sonogram/mammogram with my specialist yet, but in an email last night he called the discharge \"an interesting development\" and said that even if the biopsy is negative for cancer, they will probably need to do more tests to track down the source of the blood.

Went to talk to the breast specalist for a long appointment to go over all the test results and plan next steps. I'm writing this down in case anyone else has similar symptoms. I'm feeling pretty OK about this right now, I think because I already went through freak-out mode a few weeks ago. ",

I'm going to be meeting with the breast specialist soon to talk about the results from all the tests so far. I think I'll be doing more tests to find the source of the discharge (it's probably a papilloma from what I have read). From what he has said in emails, he might want me to get the fibroadenoma taken out even though it's benign. They're looking at things very carefully since I have a strong family history. I'm going to keep what Carol57 and the other posters with similar symptoms said in mind when looking towards next steps. I feel like I dodged a bullet on this one but have to stay vigilant.",
