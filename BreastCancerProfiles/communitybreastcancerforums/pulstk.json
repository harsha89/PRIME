Confirmed my IIIA staging with 5/7 nodes being positive after my BMX and Axillary dissection. The only treatment that changes is the radiation will now include my left armpit in addition to my left chest. I am healing quite nicely, at 8 days post-op I was able to get all 3 drains out, yay. I have been having alot of burning, shooting nerve pains as well as muscle spasms in my chest and neck, so i did get a script for Flexeril. The Dr. gave me some very simple, non strenuous exercises to increase range of motion, but still says not to pull, push, or lift anything over 10 lbs for 3 more weeks, then on to radiation. Continuing to pray for you allüòö",

The surgeon said everything went perfect and he will have the dissection results, etc. At the follow up appt next Thursday. I will be honest, I hurt, but it is manageable with the Norco they sent me home with. Make sure to be completely honest with hospital staff and your doctors about pain levels, no reason to be in agony at home when there are meds to help. I have a fantastic support system that includes my hubby, mom and sister. This makes a huge difference, and if you are blessed with people in your life who want to be there for you, this is the time to let them. I tend to be a control freak, so chemo was a quick lesson in how to let others do for you. It will be much easier to focus on healing when the home, kids are being taken care of by others. I am praying for each of you on this board, and thank you for your prayers also‚ù§",

I finished dose dense AC/T chemotherapy May 10th and am scheduled for a bilateral mastectomy with removal of left side axillary lymph nodes as well. I am a bit nervous, first major surgery I have ever had, plus concerned about recovery, pain etc. I will not be getting reconstruction for many months down the road as I have radiation up next on the plate. This summer should be interesting, thank goodness for central air. I am participating in our Relay for Life coming up this Friday, but this time as a survivor instead of a family member, so crazy. Prayers are appreciated, and I will be praying for all those on this board. God Bless!!",

Not looking forward to the surgery, but looking forward to cutting this cancer out of my body. Since ending chemo, I have already noticed some regrowth probably due to the triple negative status. Agressive little jerks. I am scared, but anxious to get it done quickly. I will br praying for a good outcome for all you lovely June Surgery sisters. God bless, oh and Relay was a blastüòÅ",
