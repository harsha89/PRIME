Right now I think I will ask them to stay thru Friday morning (it is a 6 hour drive for them to go home so I know they will want to leave in the morning rather than evening), then I have a friend who will take the boys (10 yo and 7 yo) that afternoon and hubby will be home over the weekend. I should be able to arrange some help on Monday if I need it but I guess it'd be good to plan ahead with next weekend being a holiday weekend and all.. My oldest son can be quite a bit of help if I ask him to do things for me, so that is good also. I have a meeting next Monday that I will need to either find a ride to or cancel so the range of motion issue is definitely something I need to think about as I'd involve driving on the highway. I guess I will see how many nodes are removed and decide after surgery what to do about that...",

I didn't have an MRI after surgery, just beforeit, so I'm not sure if the radiation oncologist will need it or not. I don't know why the book suggest getting the consult right after rx - some people end up not doing radiation if they have a full mastectomy.  Also, just wanted to point out that you may be going to radiation treatments daily for up to 7 weeks, so you may want to at least consider a place closer to home. With DCIS, if it is small enough, you might be able to do the mammosite treatment (my tumor was too large for that so it's not an option), so you may want to ask about that - that treatment lasts only a week or so I think.  My oncologist sent on any info the other dr's needed to have and I would think that if you told your onc who you are seeing they could take care of transferring info for you.   Best of luck to you.",

In my case, the genetic testing is b/c of my age. The genetic counselor I met with told me that it's fairly standard with women under about 50 who have breast cancer and that my insurance (and most in the U.S.) would cover it based on my age of getting breast cancer alone. A part of me would like them to just get in there, grab what they see and be done, but I don't want to have to have a second or even third surgery b/c they didn't know all the info going in so I\"m trying to be patient.  HANG IN THERE!",

I was rx'd just over a week ago. My core biopsy was done at the other branch of this same center so they should have all of my records, etc. The oncologist (not assoc. technically w/ this group and I love him), sent me there primarily b/c this location is close to my house (all others would be a 20-30 min. drive, most likely). I AM NOT GOING BACK THERE EVER. First, I get there and the lady at the front desk can't find my info, asks for my order from the dr. (which was faxed to them), gives me a hard time. I was about to just leave and call my oncologists office, but they suddenly figured it out.  Take me back and have me undress, put on the hospital gown and pants, take me to put my clothes in a locker, then sit me in a chair in the hall for 15 minutes. I fill out a bunch of paperwork, half of which I KNOW this office already has b/c I filled it out less than a month ago for my mammogram. Finally put in the IV thing, do the MRI.  All during the MRI, the guy keeps coming on the speaker thing asking why I'm having the MRI. BECAUSE I HAVE BREAST CANCER AND MY DOCTOR WANTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BEFORE SURGERY!!!! DUH!!!  Get out, he quizzes me again about any new symptoms, why are they doing it, etc. That's all in the paperwork.  Finally, he hands me the clipboard with my paperwork back, says \"Here ya go. Take that back to the front desk.\" and walks off. What?!?!?! I was still in the hospital gown, etc. I put my shoes back on, pick up the key to the locker and flag down one of the workers rushing thru the hallway to show me to my locker. She points me in the right direction and walks off. I finally just lock myself in a random room, change and leave. I will not be going back to that place ever. It was awful!

She seemed really upset that I had two problems in one day there!  Hopefully that means they will do something about it.  I may try the plant trick since I'll be seeing her so much the next few weeks. She seems really mad every time  I've been there, so maybe she just hates her job or something.  SueinOhio, yeah, I'm \"only\" 39...  That part would probably have been funny if I hadn't already had the other problem. I am glad they wanted to get it all right. Seems there was one angle where that wasn't an issue but it got my breastbone in the ray and they didn't want that either. It  was kinda akward, though - at one point I had 4 people in there moving me and padding around trying to get it all just right.  Wish me luck tomorrow. I really hope they actually start this time.",

Thanks everyone for the well wishes. Things went well today. I barely talked to the receptionist, but I did get my treatment done and she didn't say anything rude. I think I'll just stick with saying as little to her as possible. Today lasted about 30 minutes b/c of the xrays, but they said it will take 5-10 min. from now on. ",

Like others, I've heard that no news is good news and I hope that is the case for you. I'd give the dr. a call on Monday and see when you can expect to get results.  Hoping you get a b9 answer!",

      "Content": "Aug 14, 2009 12:08PM - edited Aug 14, 2009 12:44PM by Anxiousmama Hi everyone. I haven't posted in awhile. Just had #9 of 33 and so far so good. No redness to speak of. I've been using Curel cream for now - drr. said I could put any type of lotion I wanted so long as I did it more than 6 hours before treatment.  I have treatments in the a.m., so I put some on right after treatment and some just before bed. I'm very tired, but I don't know if that's the radiation or everything else in my life - car broke down Sunday, Air conditioner has been out all week (during a wave of 100+ highs) and kids are crazy with the last 2 weeks of summer vacation. I've been having to take my younger one with me this week and they've been very nice about it. Well, everyone but the mean receptionist. I heard her complaining to the nurse that I  had him there, so the next day the nurse caught me on my way in and said she was so sorry that they were no trouble and if I wanted they could come sit in a chair by her workstation while I was in the treatment room. =)  Ed. to add that I  am having some issues with my markings wearing off. I'm a little frustrated b/c they tattooed the dots so I wouldn't have to worry about it (we go out to the lake alot in the summer), but now also hhave to have a big X across my aerola which isn't tattooed, so I still have to worry about it. Any tips on keeping it \"fresh\"?  I swear it rubs off every day. Right now I'm at an inflatable playland while the kids play so I can just sit for awhile.  Good to hear most everyone is doing well. It may be another week before I find time to check in here. ",

So far, my MRI, PET scan, CAT scan were all clear except for the one mass that was malignant.  To me it seems unliikely that the oncatype will be high, but wondering if it is or is not related to all those other factors. I'm not set to meet with the oncologist until a week from Monday, though he may move the apointment up if the test is back earlier. Also, if I call and find out those results, can anyone tell me what is normally \"good\" or \"bad?\" Stage 2A, ER/PR+, mama to two active boys Log in to post a reply",

It is, however, unlikely that the insurance will pay for it. My insurance company does not pay for screening mammos for anyone under age 40, so I'd inquire about cost before making the appointment or going.",

My radiation oncologist said that it's fairly common, but just try to eat foods that don't upset my stomach, etc.  I'm not having any redness, but some itching on my breast. Also a wierd sensation - when I scratch I can't really feel it on the skin but it hurts underneath.  Hard to describe but wondering if anyone else has that. I had no. 18 of 33  today and I'm getting soo tired of it all.  Not too much fatigue, but I've been taking better care of myself than I normally do.
