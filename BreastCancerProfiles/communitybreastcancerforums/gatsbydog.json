I put on my wig, went out with my husband, went to three Halloween parties the next day.  You may start to feel a bit of tingling in your scalp, and a bit of pain, and then all of the little nubs will fall out.  You have the power to accept this loss as a temporary collateral damage in your successful battle against this disease.  My hair has returned thick and curly.  I colored it when I had about three inches of growth.  It's looking a bit like Barbra Steisand in A Star is Born--that seventies poodle look, but I think it will calm down as it grows and gets some weight.  You will be fine.  Last year, I was right where you are.  The hair returns; your strength returns.  You will have moments of incredible joy when you get past this.  You may even look back on the process and think about how much you went through and how well you persevered.  And, you'll be amazed at how wonderful other people can be as they support you. ",
