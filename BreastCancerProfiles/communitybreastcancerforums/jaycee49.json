My dog, when a puppy, took Panacure C for gairdia. He had diarrhea. That, I cannot have. Thank you all for trying this. I see no ulterior motive by the guy who wrote the blog. None at all.",

They may be instructed to do that. And you have little Miss Sunshine here (Cure-ious) to boost your spirits. During the trial, wouldn't you have support from the trial people for help 24/7? Even my MO's office has that. Even on a long holiday weekend. I'm glad you are not starting this weekend but still. I follow this thread because I love your attitude toward big pharma and medicine in general. I lived in NYC for ten years. I miss the sass. Doesn't go over so well here.",

He was the only one of my doctors connected to my hospital system that had no electronic communications at all. No e-mail and you could not send messages to him on the portal. He only released blood work results to the portal. That was his token concession to modern paient/doctor communication. Notice I am speaking of him in the past tense. He is no longer my MO. I got a new one who is probably not as scientifically smart but she is much nicer. That is a trade I am willing to make. Plus, they are in the same practice so they mostly do the same treatments. I thought it would be harder to change MO's but I lucked out in that this practice allows changes within the practice. That was new to me because I've never been able to do that before. Most practices I have been to do not allow changes within the practice. Maybe you could ask if it would be allowed where you are going. I did and have been really happy ever since. Micmel, I had the same thought as others as soon as you said he was sleeping in your house. Make some noise. Music was my first thought but vacuuming, etc. would work, too. Make a statement ... a loud one.",

(Searching on this forum is a struggle since you can't search a thread, only forums. I've discussed this with the mods but they are clueless.) The joy of the support and friendship against the crushing blows of loss. It's like walking a tightrope but the rope is a razor blade. After reading your post (I read lots of threads, don't think I have ever posted here) that one really rung true, as so many of yours do. I decided this balance is similar to the treatments we take (the support we get from BCO) and the side effects of those treatments (the losses we suffer for being here). I go away for weeks at a time to escape the losses but always come back when I need some people who really get it. That is such a warn out expression but it best conveys what we need. Thank you all for giving that to me.",
