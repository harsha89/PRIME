I was struggling over what decision to make since I was diagnosed on November 2nd, and on December 31 I had bilateral mastectomy. I am really happy with my decision and it would not have been possible without the impute I got from many ladies on this and other threads.   My pathology report is back and they found three different cancers, two on the right and one on the left. Both breasts had Usual Ductal Hyperplasia Multi focal. Luckily, the nodules were all very small (2mm, 4mm, 1.5mm), no lymph nodes involvement, and very clear margins. So, the report is nothing to be happy about, but it is a very happy day for me because I went against the medical recommendation, found courage and a lot of encouragement on this site and went with my instincts.  I can clearly see that I eliminated much pain and many sad days of my future. I was out of the hospital the next day, and have been going on long hikes since the second day. Drains were removed 8 days later.  I got 300cc on each TE's during surgery, and they're not nearly as bad as I was expecting them to be. I actually have a nice cleavage with them!  Next week I will have my first fill and my PS said that I should be done with only two fills which will make me a size C cup.  I was a small B before, so a C is a nice gift and I don't need to go bigger! As for pain, I took Vicodin for 3 days but they made me nauseous and I started on 200mg of ibuprofen every 4-6 hours for 7 days, and now I am completely out of meds.  It is still a bit uncomfortable to sleep but it is getting better each day. Now I should proudly wear a tee-shirt that says -\"Dam right they are fake! The real ones tried to kill me!\" (I didn't come up with it! I am borrowing it from someone in one of the threads on this site, and I think it is very funny!) Thank you and best wishes to everyone!",

On November 2nd, after being diagnosed, I felt like my world had turned upside-down, and I quickly realized that I had to take full control of what I had to do instead of relying so much on the Doctors. I am not complaining about them because I think they are so gifted to do what they do, but they also follow the medical guidelines too closely. It is hard to find one who's more progressive and willing to step outside their safety box. I tried very hard to have nipple sparing mastectomy because I knew they can check for abnormal cells in that area during surgery but they wouldn't do it because I was diagnosed with IDC type!  Even though I was aware that with nipple sparing there is a 1-2% increased chance of recurrence  I was willing to try....Now with the pathology report showing so much more then I originally expected, maybe it was good to remove them, after all. Right now don't think of my nipples or my breast anymore and I've been seeing pictures of reconstruction that looks amazing, and I am focusing on being free of cancer and to have perky new breasts in a few months! By the way, the tee-shirt logo is not mine! I borrowed it from Val61 because I thought it was hilarious! It brought me and my family great laughs! You can find her and many other very knowledgeable ladies on Exchange City thread.  If you have not found them already, I encourage you to also check that thread for information. They're great! Best wishes to you and please stay in touch.  Let me know if I can be of anymore help to you. I am happy see that you are following your heart, and you'll do just great! Erika",

They don't really know of the benefits of it for women who have had bilateral mastectomy while ALL tumors were smaller than 4mm. I also do not fall into the Oncotype DX  category since all 3 tumors found were 4mm or smaller and insurances do not pay for this expensive test unless tumor is 1cm or bigger. She recommended that I take it as a preventive measure, knowing that it would improve by 1-2% but she'd be OK with my decision if I decide not to take it! Again, it is left to the patients decision....This is wearing me out!!  My first reaction is of not taking it! How much improvement can 1-2% be compared to all the side effects??  On the other hand, I don't want to contribute to the possible growth of Mr. Cancer cells either! Ladies, if you have any light to my confused mind I so greatly appreciate it!",

Because it was so small lump all my doctors didn't want me to do mastectomy. But because of family history of breast cancer and painful fibrocystic breasts for years I decided to go for bilateral mastectomy, prophylatic for left breast. Doctors thought  was being too aggressive....Pathology report came back and I had 3 diff IDC in the right breast, and one DCIS in my left breast plus pre cancer cell formation in both breasts...It was a hard decision for me but it was the best one I made in life. It worked for me but I understand all the difficulties one can face in making such decision. I was also faced with anger, confusion, sadness and all. Today I'm very happy because I didn't need radiotherapy or chemo and no lymph nodes involved, and reconstruction of my breasts is coming out beautifully. It seems to me your were able to catch it very early also and most likely lymph nodes will not be affected. Hang in there, try to be positive because you'll come out of this one just fine. You'll find many ladies here and other threads that will help you, and if you need more info from me let me know. Best of luck to you. Erika",

Yes, it is possible for you not to have any treatment depending on the final diagnose. For me, I know at this point (from the biopsy results) that my tumor is .4mm, ER/PR+, HER2-, grade 2. This puts me at stage 1, but only during surgery and pathology report is when they'll have the final picture and full diagnose! So, I'm hoping for the best and no lymph nodes involvement! My Dr is 98% sure that diagnose will not change. They didn't want me to go with bilateral mastectomy because I am at a very early stage and they found it to be unnecessary, but my decision was very personal as I have had family history with BC and long painful fibrocystic history, and as I mentioned, the anxiety of another lump and so much screening would put me over the edge... I will be having TE's (tissue Expander) plus final implants 3-4 months later, and the final touch will be the nipple+areola recon in 6-8 months. Please keep in touch! We can exchange information of our progress. I wish the all best to you and also good luck with your surgery! Happy Holiday! Erika",
