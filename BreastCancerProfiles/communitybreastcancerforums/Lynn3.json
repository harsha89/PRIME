Get as much information as you can stand and then breathe and look through the stuff again. You will do fine. Been through it this year so I can help if you want.",

It is a lot to take on, but it will get easier. Ask, ask and ask questions. Call the doctor if a question arises that you need answers to. They are there to help you. We are too. Prayers are bounding your way. As for your children, I always felt that children, no matter what age, can deal with what they know. And their imaginations cause a lot more harm. With knowledge comes power.......but sometimes in small doses. Concentrate on yourself for awhile and we will help you through this. God bless you.",

I had to mess with the drains but had help with them and they were out soon enough. Also had help showering especially with the drains. A CNA who wanted to earn extra money came to help. I am sooooo glad I did that. I am soooo glad I was able to do that. It has worked for me. Let me know if you need anymore experience/advice than you are already getting.",
