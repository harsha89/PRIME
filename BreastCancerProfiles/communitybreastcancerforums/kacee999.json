I was told that is done in order for the surgeon to locate the sentinel node for excision.  It works like a gieger counter.  He locates the \"beep\" (or whatever it does) and he knows where to cut. The wire was used to pinpoint the location of the mass for the surgeon to remove. ",

I was diagnosed 4 days after my 60th birthday Nov. 2011 with IDC and DCIS Stage 1. I think I actually had about 30 minutes of \"freak out time\" where my brain just went numb.  Then it was, okay, now what? Business mode. I didn't have a history in my family either. I have a wonderful husband who is sticking with me through this all and I don't think I could do it without him. People consistently ask me \"How do you remain so upbeat?\" and I say, So what am I supposed to do, crawl under a bush in the backyard? You do what you gotta do and fight the fight the best you can. Kick ass and take names!",
