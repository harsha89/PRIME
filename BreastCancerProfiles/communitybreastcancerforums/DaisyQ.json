Once I met with my team (BS and MO) and got my treatment plan, I was so relieved! I was stage 2 at DX as well. And like you, my tumor measured just about 2cm. My docs did not recommend a PET or bone scan, but my MO said she would do one if I was losing sleep over it. She said the results would not change the treatment plan, so I decided to move ahead without either. Like many of the ladies posting, I had a complete response to chemo therapy--nothing left in the breast tissue. The surgeon could not find any evidence of a tumor in my breast and the pathology team examined the tissue extensively and found nothing. My docs feel that if any rogue cells got out, chemo probably took care of them. I like ml's advice. Take it one minute at a time and remember to be kind to yourself. Hang in there! Amy",

I am assuming the insurance company is saying rads are not medically necessary because of your pCR status after neoadjuvant chemo? My BS and MO both explained that they are seeing more and more complete responses with TCHP, but it is still such a new combination that there really aren't any well established protocols for radiation yet. If there's any node involvement (even micrometastatic as in my case), then rads seem to be the emerging standard of care. Rest easy, focus on treatment and healing, your RO will get it resolved. Sadly, they probably have lots of experience with this..",

I used that time to seek a 2nd opinion from a surgeon and oncologist at a cancer center affiliated with a medical school nearby. I was able to get an appointment within a week of my diagnosis. In my case, I am glad I got a second opinion. My initial breast surgeon wanted to do surgery first--even though I did turn out to be Her2+. The cancer center docs recommended chemo before surgery. Even though I wanted the tumor out ASAP, I chose to be treated at the cancer center. They offered the best treatment plan and got started very, very quickly! I was impressed how fast things fell in place. To help with the freak out moments and get decent sleep, I got a prescription for Xanax. It has been very helpful. I found several breast cancer support websites, but honestly, BCO is the best of the bunch. You'll find lots of information and support here. Hoping you get the answers you need in the next few days.. Hang in there!",

As anxious as I am to have my hair grow back, I am having some fun going against the grain of what our culture's definition of a beautiful woman. The physical and emotional nightmare that cancer is, and the fact that I am here, whole, smiling, loving my kids and husband, living in the moment..that is beautiful.

I am sure a wig shop has something to cover your scalp to address the itchiness and to keep the wig more secure. I was surprised how many wig options are available and that you can take it to a stylist to make it look just like you want. Ditto on the fast growing tumor. I had a mammogram 6 months before my dx. It was not seen. With what I know about grade 3, HER2+ cancer, I get it. I was in a high risk group and was pretty vigilant about self exams. I totally get the \"you are so brave\" comment! Seriously, if they could spend a day in my head.. Ha! The other comment that makes me laugh is, \"You look so good!\" Hilarious, really. But, I understand the intention and completely appreciate it. I am sure I have said the same things in the past, but never will again. I have better things to say to be supportive now. ;) My cancer center has so many resources to help patients and families handle the diagnosis and treatment. I jumped at counseling opportunities. Where else can you get free therapy sessions? And there's no better time to clean up the mental house than when you're shaken to your core with a cancer dx. I am also seeking out support groups and meditation classes. All available through the community. Do you have a date yet for your port surgery and when do you start chemo?",

Don't spend too much time googling stuff. It will just feed your fears. If you are anything like me, you'll hyper-focus on the negative. This is a good place to read about your diagnosis, and get support. Do you have your biopsy report? 2. Get ready for your appointments. Get a list of questions together. Like others have mentioned, you should see a breast surgeon and a medical oncologist. Where do you live? Are you near a comprehensive cancer center? Research where you can get the absolute best medical care in your area. If you aren't sure, try asking here. When I was diagnosed, I called the comprehensive cancer center affiliated with a medical school here for a second opinion. I was seen in a matter of days and they made back-to-back appointments for me. I left with a port placement surgery date, and chemo treatment plan. I knew that was the right place for me. 3. Bring someone with you to the initial appointments. There will be a lot of information to remember. I became overwhelmed, and was grateful my husband was with me. 4. When I was first diagnosed, I could not sleep and eventually started having panic attacks. My MO gave me a prescription for Xanax. It helped me calm down and sleep. I assume you found the lump yourself? So many young women don't do SBE or will ignore a lump. You felt something was wrong, you saw a doctor. Way to go! Stage I and clear lymph nodes are both good news. Hang on to that. Sending you a virtual hug. Send me a PM if you need to talk.",
