I have just finish my second weekly sesson of taxotere, carboplatin and herceptin out of four and my scalp is still very tender and sore esp. after treatments. How long does it last? I still have hair but it is very thin now. My RN told me that I will lose all of my hair becasue two of the chemos that I am taking is one of the side effect. Will the tenderness and soreness go away after all of my hair fall out? 2. What is your favorite kind of wig? The real hair or the synthetic?  Living here in South Texas and summer is coming it sure does get very hot and I want to be as comfortable as I can. Any information or advice you can give me would be wonderful. Hugs, Deb smilingdeb Dx 3/9/2011, IDC, 6cm+, Stage IIIB, Grade 3, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

If any of you want to know how I did it PM me and I'll be happy to tell you what I did. To make a long story short my ex husband divorce me a year and half ago for another woman and took me off of everything. I had a job that did not pay good ($8.25 hr) with no insurance and once I was dx with cancer they let me go. So now I will be able to keep my home and pay my bills. Please understand what a relief this is for me. God took care of me!!!!! I got my results back from my PET scan/CT and the tumor is strinking but the cancer in the lymph nodes has gone up. Not good but it hasn't spread within my body. I will continue with my aggressive treatments and have radiation treatments M-F for the next 4 weeks. I can do it and I will do it. I am fighting this cancer with all my heart. I will keep you posted on how I am doing with all of my treatments. Also I want to thank you all for you love, prayers and support. YOU ARE WONDERFUL!!!!!

      "Content": "smilingdeb wrote: Hi Sisters, Have any of you had a MUGA Scan? I had a double mastectony on Oct. 7th (cancer was on the left breast) and will be done with my radiation treatment on Monday the day after Christmas. I am schedule for a MUGA Scan on Jan. 9th and all that I know and read is that it is to make sure that the heart is not damage and healthy. Next to radiation I am also having Herceptin once every three week for eight months and taking Anastrozole aka Arimidex. Will this scan also check my left lung for any damages since I am having radiation? If you have had this scan please let me know what to expect. I would really appreciate it.

I am looking into having my treatments and surgery at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, TX.. I have looked at their website but it really doesn't give me much information other than it is the Best of Texas and it is about 5 hrs away from my family. I was wanting to know if any of you wonderful ladies and men have been to MD Anderson and if you can tell me about your stay there and treatments.
