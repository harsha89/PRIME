Does that take longer to return from Pathologist? I am acheduled for a mastectomy on January 26 (my choice not to have lumpectomy). I would love to have all the facts prior to surgery. Does the appointment with the oncologist usually follow the surgery. I assume if I end up being triple negative it will mean chemo also. Any input will be greatly appreciated!
