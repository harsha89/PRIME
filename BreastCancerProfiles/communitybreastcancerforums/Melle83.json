I have to say I'm not one to write, only read. It's hard for me to put myself out there. So it's amazing that you all do that, I dont know what I would do if I couldn't read all these post. Actually, I do, I would probably believe whatever I read on the net. Which most of it freaks me out, so I thank you and all the wonderful people who do.",
