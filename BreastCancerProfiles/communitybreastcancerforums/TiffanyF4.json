So they do use it as a first chemo sometimes. Or maybe even write down your questions and ask her to have the doctor or nurse write down the answers. Maybe she us overwhelmed and forgets, I am bad for that.",

Anyway I am almost finished with chemo and will begin my lovely 33 rounds of radiation soon. I know that my friends and family mean well, but I constantly hear \"It's almost over\". Do they not realize the IT will never be over for me. I will always wonder will it come back. I see all the pink ribbons and survivor gear and I just don't feel like I have survived anything. I feel like I am getting up everyday doing what the Doctors tell me and hoping for the best. I am generally a positive person, and I have been told I am an inspiration, hero among many other things. I just don't feel like any of those things. Just because the pink ribbons are pretty doesnt make this disease pretty or trendy! It's hell and I don't want to have to SURVIVE anything especially cancer, I just want my life back!

I tested positive for the BRCA1 gene mutation which means this raises my chance for ovarian cancer. I am scheduled to have a hystrectomy in may. I realize it's hard when you have lost a loved one I understand trust me! But Medicine has changed now you can beat this!! Take each step of the journey at a time don't jump ahead. First things first once you feel comfortable with your choice of surgery whether it be mastectomy or lumpectomy get through that don't think about the rest of it yet. Think about each step as it comes that's what helped me. I got through surgery healed from that and then when it was time for chemo I read up on that and asked doctor alot of question until I felt informed and then dealt with that and then I did the same thing with radiation.  One step at a time!",
