Brenny and Sue - I also plan to work thru the treatments.  Its encouraging to hear that you were able to work. Lisa - Sorry to hear about the hair thing.  I'm preparing as much as possible for losing my hair but I know it will be traumatic also.  Got to try to keep our sense of humor though the whole thing.  Your son certainly has the right perspective.  I've jokingly asked my friends to shave their heads also to show support but so far no takers.  LOL.  I ordered a wig from TLC but the shade was a bit too light so I'm returning it for darler shade.  The wigs definitely need some styling.  I'm taking it to my hair stylist to have it shaped and make it look like my currently hair style.  Hope it works out. Well, I'm so ready to start and want to get the 1st treatment behind me.  My 1st treatment will be on 1/8.  Its seems that I've been spending the last few weeks preparing and waiting. ",

YearoftheHat - I also will have 12 weekly Taxol (Paclitaxel) after my AC treatmetns.  We seem to be on the same regimen.  From what I've been reading and hearing the side effects are not quite so bad and tolerated well.  Let me know what your onc says.  I haven't even gotten there with my onc yet. Here's keeping our fingers crossed for both of us.  I think you job situation sucks.  But, you know, things happen for a reason.  Maybe there's a better job waiting for you after this is all over. Renrel - Glad to hear that you're starting to feel better. rsben70 - I know what you mean about cancer putting things in a different perspective.  Things that stressed me at work before don't bother me at all now.  I figure that things will manage to get done whether or not I'm here.  Someone will just have to step up and do it.  I don't work in a field that involves life and death so why stress about it. If the job doesn't get done, nobody is going to die. ",

Got a Neulasta shot on Saturday.  I took a Claritin before getting the shot.  A little while later I started to feel some achiness so I took 2 Aleve and it seems to be keeping it in check.  I also found that walking helps alleviate the pain.  All in all, this tx has been really tolerable.   I'm tired and don't have much of an appetite but no nausea.  Hope the next 2 will be the same. Well off to watch the Super Bowl.  Not really into football but I like to watch the halftime and commercials!",

Can't say I haven't had any SEs like you but they haven't been that bad.  Are any of you having any bouts with depression?  It seems that just when I get over the worst of the SEs and start feeling a little better, I get depressed.  I keep thinking am I only going to feel worst as time goes on, how am I going to get thru 2 more AC txs, will I be so fatigue I won't be able to do anything, etc.  Any suggestions on how to get out of this mood?  I try to keep in mind that this won't last forever but we all know that wehen you're going thru it, it feels like an eternity.  After Chemo, I still have surgery and probably radiation although I think this part of the chemotherapy is probably the hardest. ",

I just completed my 3rd tx. My first 2 tx were A/C but the Cytoxan gave me so much problems that my onc is now only going to give me only A for the last 2 treatments before 12 weekly taxol.  I'm also not going to get a Neulasta the shot after every treatment since the last time I got it I was sore for over a week and my WBC was still low.  My onc is going to see if my body can bring up my WBC by itself since she feels the Cytoxan was causing the porblem.  She said that it wasn't worth the long term effects that might result if I stay on the Cytoxan.  I asked her if my treatments would still be effective and she reassured me that it would be.  It seems that the doctors blast you with all they've got and then pull back if your body cannot tolerate it.  Makes you wonder if they aren't overdosing us unnecessarily. Well I have faith in my onc so I'm hoping she is doing the right thing.  Anyone know of anyone else only getting A? I must say that this treatment with only the A has been a lot easier.  However, its only the first day so we'll seen.  Berkleykim - I have 1 more treatment before I start my weekly taxol.  Please let me know how that goes.  Its supposed to be easier.  Lets keep our fingers crossed!  When I read our earlier postings in December/January I realized what a long way we've all come from all the anxiety about starting chemo to now almost finishing up our combo tx which is the hardest part of the treatments to me. When I think that time is not going by fast enough, I read the earilier post and realize that maybe we're going to make it thru all this after all.",

Shaved my head yesterday and had my hair stylist style my wig.  It looks great and I'll probably be wearing it to work instead of the scarves.  Got the wig from TLC after reading suggestions from other posters.   It was very reasonable and the wig moves and feels like real hair.  If anyone is looking for a wig check out tlcdirect.org.  I've been wearing a night cap to keep my head warm but after I shaved all my hair off, my head has been really warm and I had to sleep without a cap.  Anyone else have this problem.  Its even warm when I wear scarves.  I want to just go bald but I'm not quite that brave. Diane - I had the same experience a few nights ago with waking up and sweating profusely.  I think its night sweats.  I had it the first time I went thru menopause.  I'm 56 and looks like I'll be going thru menopause again! Knots - I agree with ddlatt - Walking at least a little really does help.  Even when feeling nauseous I went for a walk and while walking felt a little better.  I know it really helped with the achiness from the nuepogen shots.  Also that lump in your throat feeling could be heartburn.  I had that and took some antacid like tums and it helped for a bit.  My onc said she had meds for that so I may ask her for that.",

I haven't posted for a while.  I been having some significant challenges and side effects that even my onc has not expereinced with her other patients.  I have recently developed 6th nerve palsy.  I have double vision especially when looking in the distance.  My opthalmologist thinks its the chemo.  I mentioned this to my onc and she ordered a brain MRI to see if there was an underlying cause, like a brain tumor.  Fortunately, the MRI came back normal so that was a huge relief.  She believes that it was a viral infection that damaged the nerve. I will probaly now have to wait because a lot of these cases resolve themselves in a few months. Anyway, got to do my last treatment of Adriamycin today and then I start on 12 weekly placitxel,  I feel okay right now but usually the side effcts don't show until 6 hours or 2 days after treatment.  The last time I was fine for 2 days and then really sick for the next 3 days.  I'm hoping it will be better this time.  In any case, its the last of this! I will be going to Los Angles in a few weeks for the World Figure Skating Championships and looking forward to it.  I just hope that I'll be feeling well enough for the trip.  I'm going to think positive although, I have to admit that I'm starting to get tired in the afternoons. ",
