My mother died from breast cancer when she was 42, she was diagnosed about my age (her sister the same, and few other of her cousins). my genetic testing showed a rare mutation on braca1. Anyone living around New York area can recommend a good breast and reconstruction surgeon? Do you mind sharing your experience? i am a little scared! Thank you! Log in to post a reply",
