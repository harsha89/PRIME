I have strong family history of Breast Cancer, 9 people on my mom's side, my mom is one of 9 kids, 8 girls and a boy. 4 of which have had cancer. About half had the gene mutation BRCA2. I was told after I requested a genetic test years ago by a gynecologist that removed an ovary due to a large cyst that I did not carry the gene mutation So I did not worry and did not go for any mammograms after that.. For some reason, I wanted proof. My doctor sent me to a oncologist for a genetic testing. Turns out I am positive for BRCA2. They immediately told me I need the other ovary out, and post breast removed due to strong family cancer. That was all around August. I had an MRI and no unusual masses or anything found. I went for a total hysterectomy and double mastectomy with nipple sparing at the same time and that was the end of October. I could not live with the unknown. I live with daily anxiety, and I couldn't deal with the constant fear. Its not the best choice for everyone, but for me it was. As it turned out, I had the surgery, (the hysterectomy was a piece of cake) the mastectomy was harder. Physically hard, and I went with reconstruction. Immediately put in 200cc of saline in tissue expanders on the same day. After the breast were removed, the pathology report came back with a 6mm spot of cancer under my left nipple. DCIS. I was told the left nipple would have to be removed. I opted for both, as I am extremely paranoid and OCD so can't be uneven. LOL. Expanders are uncomfortable, and maybe I am tough. But they had to unfill me for the second surgery 2 weeks after the first, A small set back. I have been routinely filled since 3 week after the 2nd surgery to remove both nipples, and am just over a week away from my real implants going in. YAY!!! Because it was DCIS, they said no cancer could have spread to other areas as of yet, but I plan to go for future MRI's. I need no more mammograms and no more periods! though hot flashes are a bitch. If you need any support, feel free to contact me. I feel good about my decision and would do it again.",

I had a double mastectomy in October 2016 recommended by an oncologist because of extensive family history and I have the BRCA2 gene. After surgery they found stage 0 cancer under a nipple, so went for second surgery to get both nipples removed. No treatment necessary after that, I did get implants put in later as well.. Anyway so now I am just over 2 years out. I still get the \u201citch\u201d under the implants so not reachable. I don\u2019t get it as often anymore. As far as pain, I had extreme pain under each armpit after surgery, including the burning pain. I attribute it all to the drain tubes and the scar tissue in that area. I will have days still where even the sports bras hurt even if they are not tight. It feels a lot like the pain when I would wear a bra that had an underwire that would dig in. I will physically get red welts. My PS told me to never be without a bra though to keep implantsfrom navigating and that\u2019s okay as I cannot tolerate going without one anyway. Had that pain tonight which is what prompted me to come here looking for answers still. My absolute worse pain though, is just in my little fat rolls ( for lack of a better description) just under each breast. That is where I had gotten much tingling sensation from the nerves, but when I am just standing at work and not physically doing anything like lifting, the pain is excruciating. Anyone have any of that pain here",

I have had no kids (not sure if that matters to saggy breast issues, but, mine were in such a place that I was a excellent candidate for nipple sparing. Just something to possibly consider as a reason?? Anyway, I am a month away from surgery. almost all my pre ops scheduled, need to have a ultrasound done now in my lower regions to make sure there is nothing abnormal and no biopsies needed.",

They told me when I go home I will receive a fanny pack that will automatically administer numbing agents to the breast areas for a while. hysterectomy wise for me, pretty simple and straight forward, robotic surgery, minimal recovery, but have to do a bowel prep the day before and cannot eat at all for 24 hrs prior to surgery.

I do not want to go through more surgeries than necessary, so if that means hurting all over at once then fine. I have always done well with surgery, gall bladder surgery and then my cyst, fallopian tube and ovary removed all a month later. I handled both well with pain meds. I am not sure about my aunts reasoning for sure. lh 1357, sorry about your diagnosis. Worst time of year to be away from work for our employers, maybe the best time for the employees? My boss is freaking out about me being gone through the first of the year. Oh well. I need as little stress as possible. I find it depressing knowing I have this upcoming major surgery, and worried that they might find something else, and time is going so fast!! I do not feel prepared. Hang in there. Sounds like we will be in it together.",

I only have the one ovary,but I feel like while they are down there, they might as well take everything out that I do not need. I do not know what condition anything is in down there, it could be both ovaries and my old doctor lied to me about removing the other one. With who I had for a doctor, my new doctor is expecting anything. My old doctor was removed from practicing due to being not sober during most surgeries, and she burned all the records she had. I have such bad anxiety that I will be constantly worried about getting cancer, and mentally, its the best option for me. Of course, I will talk to her before hand, and will get her opinion. But, the surgery is going to be the same either way, same holes whether I get the ovary removed or a hysterectomy, and time down from that is minimal anyway. Its the breast surgery that is the worst I have been told. Who knows, if she feels I do not need the total, then I wont get it. Its not set in stone, I just think I would feel better with it all out ",
