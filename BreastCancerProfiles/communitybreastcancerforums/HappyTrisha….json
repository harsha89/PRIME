      "Content": "Jul 14, 2010 09:50PM - edited Jul 14, 2010 09:52PM by HappyTrisha There is not a question in my mind that stress contributed to my breast cacer.  I remember people saying that tumors likely had been growing for 8-10 years before I was diagnosed.  Well when I turn back to 8-10 years before I was diagnosed, my mom was hospitalized with ovarian cancer, my dad was hospitalized with a triple bypass, and I was attending law school nights, after working full time days.  So my life consisted of work, law school. two hospitals, and then massive amounts of homework.  My life consisted of putting one foot in front of the next.  But I am a strong person and so just kept going.  But I had to have been internalizing the stress because I certainly didn't have the time to stop and deal with it!  Then my mom died and the understanding administrators at my law school decided that I should still take my finals.  They started 7 days after my mother died.  My grandmother, with whom I was extremely close - I was always her favorite grandchild -  died one month later.  She was my mother's mother and just couldn't deal with my mother's death.  She just didn't want to live anymore.  So she got sick and a month later she was dead.  It's pure science that when people are under stress they lose certain vitamins, especially vitamins B and C, and their immune systems are compromised.  It's also known that people with suppressed immunity are at risk for developing all kinds of sickness. My dad was treated for prostate cancer.  On the last day of his radiology, his radiological oncologist told him that the best advice he could give my dad was to walk away from stress. I'm comfortable thinking that I may have had other risk factors and that stress exacerbated the situation.   But there is no question in my mind whatsoever that stress was a contributor. I like trying to figure out what combination of factors may have caused my cancer.   If there are things that are considered scientifically credible and over which I have any control, then I will at least attempt to stay away from them.",

His smiling interview with Bob Woodward made me vomit.  I think he was as disingenuous as the day is long.  Should we be reading about his affairs in the news?  Well I guess it depends on what you feel you are entitled to know about the private lives of public figures.  I guess I find it almost \"refreshing\" to learn that the week before this vile creature put his name in the ring to run for President, he publicly denied having the affair.   I agree with whomever said that if this ends his political career then it will at least have been worth having to read about all this crap. And oh yeah, when he smiling assured Bob Woodward that this affair took place when his wife was in remission, and that sure she was very angry, all that went through my mind was that hearing that information from her caring husband probably pushed her OUT of remission. And how cute is this.  He welcomes a paternity test but the trailer trash loser with the baby has refused to submit the baby to one.  Now whyever would she refuse if the baby isn't his?  Because they had it all set up that he would agree and she wouldn't.  John Edwards is indeed remorseful - remorseful that he got caught.  Period. ",

A year and a half after my mastectomy I decided to have a prophylactic mastectomy of the remaining breast.  I did it for two reasons - one is that I was going to have reconstruction and with radiation, your options are limited.  I didn't have enough fat for a DIEP and was afraid to be under that long anyway.  My PS told me that with lat flap reconstruction, any weight gain or loss would cause the other breast to be a different size from the reconstructed breast.  Since I wanted even reconstruction I decided to go ahead and have the other breast removed.  The second reason is that I was always nervous when it came time for my mammograms.  So I thought it would be pretty cool not to have to worry about mammograms anymore! A year and a half after finishing radiation, I had reconstruction.  When I finished my year of herceptin I took arimidex for the next 6 years.  I started a clinical trial of lexatrol but didn't like the side effects (I didn't have any with arimidex past the first 6 months, plus I never had hot flashes with it) and so I quit the trial. I am healthy as a horse and intend to be around for a long time to come.  I don't regret one stick of the treatment that I had and would do it all again if I had to.  My bc was agressive so my treatment needed to be aggressive. Best wishes to all of you.  Trisha ",

Vasile and Becker.  Also, I still don't know if the person, if she did indeed develop LE elsewhere, ever told the Drs. about it.  I am an attorney.  Heresay is not admissable in my courtroom, ha ha. **************** nicotris, I don't blame you for being skeptical.  You are mentioning things that are physiologically oriented.  But talking to a doctor who has done this for 20 years really trumps all of that for me.  I am sure you can understand that.  There is risk involved with just about everything.  I probably wouldn't consider removal of nodes in the neck a \"decent option\" had I not been to see these doctors and had I just read this thread and peoples' opinions.  But that's just me.  Talking to Dr. Becker allayed a lot of my fears.  Again, whether anyone else trusts what she says or does not is of little moment to me.  We all have to make our own decisions and I would never encourage someone to go full speed ahead based on my impression of Dr. Becker!  I can only tell you that my trust in Dr. Becker was totally solidified after meeting with her. **************** Binney, thank you for the information on growth factor.  I will still take the time to read it, but with a little less enthusiasm. I guess I misunderstood.  I thought the study was being done at the University of Pittsburgh! ************ foreverhope, thanks for the information on the scar. Dr. Becker was pretty matter-of-factly when she talked about the neck nodes, and the thing Dr. Vasile kept emphasiszing was the scar!  So when Dr. Becker would talk about it, Dr. Vasile would follow up by saying (paraphrase) \"Realize you will have a scar on your neck.  Is that okay with you.\"  A scar on my neck wouldn't bother me in the least.  Again, I am figuring that Dr. Becker has done this successfully without any neck LE.  I didn't ask specifically whether you can get neck LE.  But since they said they hadn't any cases of LE, I guess I figured that was part of it.  Again, not that it isn't possible, just that it hadn't happened (yet?) on their watch. ************ I will now go and read up on Lymfactin!

I think someone else may have mentioned this in an earlier post, but Dr. Becker is on Youtube discussing the procedure.  There are various clips, each discussing some aspect.  I have to be honest with you, I had a real hard time with the accent so couldn't understand much of what she was saying.  But the most impressive part to me is reading the accompanying blurb with each clip, stating that she has performed more than 4000 of these lymph node transfers!!!  That is simply amazing when you think about it.",

I would guess that most doctors don't think about long-term follow up because the patient would likely be in contact if there is a problem, and otherwise, they just go on with their business. The great part about this surgery is that doctors who do it are doing as part of the reconstruction.  That's what they call progress, right?  When I had reconstruction, I doubt they were doing it yet.  And it is so specialized at this point that not so many doctors are doing it anyway.

I will feed back to you all as soon as possible. :) ",

Are you anywhere near close enough to either Dr. Vasile or Dr. M where you could go for an evaluation?  If not, I know that Dr. Massey is willing to do an on-line consult.  If I remember correctly, they send you some lengthy on-line forms that they want you to fill out.  I think they also want pictures if you can send them.  It might not hurt to have some kind of consult.  I happened on Dr. Vasile when I was researching the node transplant surgery.  There was an email form right on her site and so I wrote to her.  She emailed back and asked to set up a time where she could call me.  And she did.  We spoke on the phone for nearly an hour.  I'm sure she would do the same for you.  She asked me all kinds of questions and by the end of the conversation said that she thoought I was a good candidate for the surgery.  I asked her a bunch of questions also. I think it would be a good start, PinkHeart!  And you could ask any questions you have and provide thorough information about your situation.  I hope you consider doing it. I am going to wait to have a conversation with Katiejane's friend, and I will talk to Dr. Vasile again after that.  Based on what I find out, I will make my decision.  Again, I am now going in the direction of having it done. I'll be interested in your thoughts on doing an on-line consult with Dr. M. or having a phone conversation  with Dr. Vasile! I will definitely keep you posted on what's going on with me. ",

(Information that becomes important to the entire chain of events: On the day that I visited with Drs. Vasile and Becker, Dr. Becker told Dr. Vasile to add a third area to the MRI - pelvis.  Because I have had so many gynecological surgeries, they wanted to be able to see the configuration of lymph nodes in my groin area.)  ****************** When I called to make the appointment for next week's MRI, I asked how long it should take.  They told me two hours.  I asked how many areas they had scheduled and they said two.  I told them it should have been three and that I would call my doctor's office to see what the third one was (I had forgotten it was pelvis; my doctor's office informed me of that when I called them.)  I called back Weil Cornell Imaging and they said it would add another 45 minutes to the MRI.  Then they told me to be sure to fast (food and liquids) 4-6 hours before the MRI for the pelvis imaging.  Well, the day I went to Weil Cornell, I had the remainder of a chocolate chip cookie in my hand; because it was a very warm day in the City, I bought a soda to drink while I was waiting for my appointment.  THERE IS NO WAY I COULD HAVE HAD THE MRI EVEN IF THEY HAD BEEN RUNNING ON TIME BECAUSE I HAD NOT FASTED!  Dr. Becker added the pelvis imaging the day of the MRI, so nobody could have told me to fast!  So it all worked out the way it was supposed to. With respect to the person who told me about her friend having LE problems after surgery with Drs. Vasile and Becker, all I can say is that I made every attempt in the world to have the friend get in touch with me and it never happened.  Third-hand information coming from a BCO poster with whom I have had no prior contact (no offense to the poster), and then absolutely no follow-up from the friend in question, has forced me to have to basically disregard the comment.   And even if the person were to contact me at this point, I would consider it too much too little too late.  I will check it through with the doctor's office and if the doctor tells me it hasn't happened, I will believe it.  And if the doctor tells me it has happened, I will ask her what she thinks caused it, etc.  If the situation is not at all similar to mine, I certainly won't sweat it. So as far as I'm concerned, all systems are go.  I feel entirely confident that I'm making the right decision.  ONWARD AND UPWARD!!!!  I will continue to keep you posted.  And thanks for all the positive feedback and good wishes.  You all are the best!    ",

      "Content": "Sep 30, 2012 12:43AM HappyTrisha wrote: Very informative Q and A session with Dr. Becker on the Talk About Health website.  You can submit questions and she will answer them: (Corinne Becker, MD, is a plastic and reconstructive surgeon from Paris, France. She has pioneered microsurgical lymph node (LN) transplantation. Dr. Corinne Becker has done 4,000 lymph node transfers in the treatment of both upper- and lower-extremity lymphedema over the last 20 years in Paris.) I just had a 40 lymph nodes removed and am seeing early signs of lymphedema (early edema, productive seroma). Am I eligible for a lymph node transfer? Yes. Patients patients who have had a significant number of lymph nodes removed and are seeing early signs of lymphedema are candidates for lymph node transfer. I have performed numerous procedures in these cases. The next steps for you would be to have a consult with a lymph node transfer surgeon to review the details of your specific case.  1 Answer | 25 days ago  After surgery, you will stay 24h to 48h in the hospital. I suggest to stay quiet 10 days (real microsurgery, hematoma to be avoided).  1 Answer | 2 months ago  Are there any doctors in Australia that do lymph node transplants for lower extremities? In Australia, no one is doing this procedure. They were doing lymphovenous anastomosis, but certainly not for those indications. It is a logical approach to replace the lacking nodes in the fibrotic area. It is like a new road! And the nodes will fight the infections! Come to see me in Paris or NY, if you can. Try to do bandaging and send me photos and documents. 1 Answer | 2 months ago  Can you talk about the different techniques for lymph node transplantation as practiced today by micro surgeons? How do they differ? There is only one technique: a free vascularised fatty flap containing nodes. Till now, 3 donor sites: neck, thoracic, upper inguinal.  1 Answer | 2 months ago  What is autologous lymph node transfer? This is a transplantation. One has to look for a unit containing nodes. Anatomic studies show that several regions of the body contain nodes (nourished by artery and vein) that can be removed without disturbing the body or the drainage of the legs or arms. This nodes can be dissected on the vessels, then disconnected and reattached in the recipient area to similar vessels. The transplanted nodes are living.  1 Answer | 5 months ago  What success rates have you seen with lymph node transfer? 1. Clinically: 98% of all the patients are improved. Normalization in 40% of patients after 2 years after having moderate lymphedema. Rate of infections: 2% remaining for all chronically infected. 80% of patients have diminished or stop physiotherapy, garments etc. Quality of the skin, color, elasticity thickness is 98% improved. Perimetry decrease each month (1 to 10cm) especially the first six post op months. 2. Examinations: MRI lymphatic becomes normal in 40% of the cases. Lymphangioscintigraphy is showing uptake of the Tch in lymphatic vessels as well as new lymphatic vessels. Echography of the fat is showing reduction of the water in the fat. EMG of plexitis is showing stabilisation of the palsy. 1 Answer | 5 months ago  How do you measure success of a lymph node transfer? The patients are evaluated preoperatively by: Clinic evaluation (survey, examination, measurements, photos) Lymphangioscintigraphy (if MRI impossible) Lymphatic MRI EMG if pain Postoperatively: Clinic (survey, photos, measurements every month and after 6 months, each year) Lymphangioscintigraphy after 6 months, 1, 2 years MRI after 6 months, 1 year, 2 years etc. This examination is the best of all and allows us to follow the progress of the regeneration of new lymphatic vessels. Echo of the fat.  1 Answer 5 months ago  What are the criteria for a patient with lymphedema to be eligible for a lymph node transfer surgery? Criteria include: Lymphedema resistance to physiotherapy Chronic infections Pain Plexitis Lymphedema appeared after mastectomy, adenectomy and radiotherapy. Lymphedema appeared after extended hysterectomy, prostatectomy, lymphoma, tumors of the pelvic and inguinal region, melanoma. Lymphedema appeared after saphenectomy, excision of fat in the inginal region. Some congenital lymphedema (hypolplasic forms). Breast reconstruction desire combined with treatment of lymphedema. Now more and more young patients are suffering from lymphedema that can be normalized if the lymphedema is not too old and fibrotic.  1 Answer | 5 months ago  Where in the United States can a breast cancer patient with lymphedema have a lymph node transfer surgery? To date, few surgeons are able to perform this procedure because dissection of the flap is very important, dissection of the axillair region can be very difficult after radiotherapy, and microsurgery must be perfectly achieved. The most experienced surgeons in this field in the USA are fellows of Robert Allen, MD, with whom I am working. I come often to NY to develop a lymphedema center with Josh Levine, MD, Constance Chen, MD, Julie Vasile, MD, Rebecca Studinger, MD etc. who are also involved with the Eye and Ear Infirmary Hospital. The patients are seen by them, selected, and I come to operate with them, all together. The idea to create this center is very important.  1 Answer | 5 months ago  Does the lymphedema ever come back after the lymph node transfers are done? No. If the results are positive after 6 post operative months, the progress continues, month after month, year after year. 40% of the patients acheive normalization of upper arm circumference from moderate lymphoedema after 2 years. The infections decreases dramatically but do not always completely disappear in severe cases.                                                                            1 Answer | 5 months ago  What are the common side effects from a lymph node transfer? When we remove the external nodes near the iliac bone crest, a local seroma can occur, but preventive compression enables us to avoid it. Lymphedema does not occur at the donor site, because the nodes taken are not in relation with the drainage of the leg or the arm. Knowledge of the anatomy of the donor site is very important. The microanastomosis of the vessels performed under high magnification is difficult to perform. The vessels have a diameter of 1 cm. Thrombosis can occur if the quality of the vessels are poor (smokers, etc.). The microsurgeon must be very experienced. If there is failure, no results of the surgery can be observed, and the illness continues. But there is no worsening due to this operation! 1 Answer | 5 months ago  Is a patient who has had lymphedema for years still able to have a lymph node transfer? Yes, for sure. Patients who have had lymphedema for years, even with alterations of the skin, chronic infections, and pain are excellent candidates for autologous lymph node transfer. Autologous lymph node transfer may not result in complete recovery, but the improvement is dramatic in all cases. The number of infections decrease and the quality of life is much improved. A couple of examples: One patient I treated who had lymphedema for 20 years after mastectomy and radiotherapy had dramatic improvements. Another patient was treated after 25 years of lymphedema from total hysterectomy and adenectomy with excellent results.  1 Answer | 5 months ago",

I'm keeping my fingers crossed.   ",

I'm definitely going to check with Dr. Vasile on this because I would definitely be willing to have another MRI and have the results sent if it meant that they could know definitively whether the vessels were okay, meaning that I wouldn't have to risk being cut open only to find they couldn't go through with the procedure! (Here's a general question though.  Why would they want lymph node mapping if it has nothing to do with cancer itself?  Do you think it's entirely for the lymph node transfer surgery?  If so this is a huge step forward for LE, when the FDA gets involved!)",

I still hope to have the transplant, and I still hope that I am a good candidate when that day comes.  I know that they say the best success is for people who are more recent LE sufferers as opposed to having it for quite a few years - I think I'm going on 7 or 8 right now.  I like Dr. Becker's attitude.  I also feel that since she's done so many, there's a good chance that she is on the money with her responses.  And of course, there's risk with any kind of surgery.  So all we can do is go with what we feel is the best option and hope we've made wise choices. Please keep us posted.  I would love to hear from anyone else also if others here have already had the transplant (how are you doing?) or intend to have it. Be well all! ",

Anyway, I hope you are all doing well.  I think I will do a little internet searching to see if I can find sites that have personal accounts of people who have had LT.  It's been around long enough now that there should be more about it.  I'll let you know if I find anything interesting.

      "Content": "Nov 8, 2013 10:51AM - edited Nov 8, 2013 10:53AM by HappyTrisha Linda, I am a total novice at this stuff. I just reread Campisi's article and found these two quotes:  \"Clinical outcome improves the earlier microsurgery is performed owing to absent or minimal fibrosclerotic alterations of the lymphatic walls and surrounding tissues. Subjective improvement in our experience was noted in 87% of patients. Objectively, volume changes showed a significant improvement in 83%, with an average reduction of 67% of the excess volume. Of those patients followed-up, 85% have been able to discontinue the use of conservative measures, with an average follow-up of more than 10 years and average reduction in excess volume of 69% (Figs.4-8). There was a 87% reduction in the incidence of cellulitis after microsurgery.\"  \"This therapeutical association proved to supply the best and long lasting results combining the efficacy of non-operative methods with the results of microsurgical procedures and giving the patient the possibility to wear compression garments irregularly at the beginning and also to avoid the use of stockings and sleeves in the long run.\"   That's one of the reasons I'm a little uncomfortable with the surgery performed by Dr. Chang and some others. From what I can figure out, they are using a variation of Campisi's surgery. Could that be the difference? I too am being extremely careful in how I proceed. I wish I had someone to talk to about this so that I could totally understand it. I'm doing my best to try to understand the medical terminology and what all of it means! Please keep us posted on what you find out. I wish Dr. Campisi came to the US to train surgeons, the way Dr. Becker does. Then at least one could have a consult and ask the relevant questions to the man writing the article! ",

I think what really gave me heart in terms of the nodal transplant surgery was hearing Dr. Vasile say that Dr. Becker has been doing this for over 20 years and has not had one patient end up with LE elsewhere as a result of nodes being removed from a different area.  I know that's been a concern in terms of people who worry about long-term effects of any treatment. The fact that Dr. Becker will be participating in the surgery also gives me great comfort.  Hey if you don't have people willing to participate in experimental treatments, you never find out whether or not you're onto some new gold standard!  I don't mind being a trailblazer.  (And really, 20 years to me with the person who started the whole shebang isn't really trailblazing, right?)  Anyway, one step at a time.  I'm so happy that you and Tina are interested in the outcome.  I'll let you know what I know as soon as I know it!  Have a great weekend.        ",

I know that part of the reason that Dr. Becker insists on the specialized MRI (and if there are only two machines in the world, one in NY and one in Paris, it would seem to me that Dr. Massey's patients aren't getting that same kind of MRI?)  is so that she can see where the lymph nodes are most plentiful and then she harvests from that area.  Things that interested me from last year's article in the Times: I definitely intend to find out whether Dr. Becker has information and follow up on more than 24 patients.

BECKER  (this may be very boring)   Well I had my appointment with Dr. Becker and absolutely love her!  I asked her about her patients and her research and was entirely satisfied.  (It's pretty much what I thought it would be.) She has followed all of her patients but also explained to me that when someone is back to normal for years and years they just stop coming to appointments.   She has not had one patient who has had problems in another area, and the reason she has not published more research is that she said that research takes time away from surgery, and she would rather be doing surgery than writing.  I had no trouble whatsoever understanding that.  I think she and I are kindred spirits in that way.  When I told her that I was a nightmare patient in terms of doing all the suggested things to help my LE, she didn't seem to have any difficult understanding that either.  She believes in getting to the root of a problem and fixing it.  Everything else is temporary and has to be continually repeated.  I think that's why she is so excited about the lymph node transfer.  It's a permanent fix. She is extremely insistent upon everything being set up perfectly for success.  That's why they insist on the specialized MRI.  She explained to me that if there are not enough lymph nodes in a certain area, you don't go near that area.  She also said that if there are a lot of lymph nodes but someone cuts too deep, you risk creating a problem in that area.  So I guess there's a lot that goes into deciding the perfect spot from which to take the lymph nodes and the exact amount of cutting that needs to be done.  I asked about the surgery itself and the recovery and both are pretty painless.  But because it's microsurgery and every vessel needs to be connected perfectly, they need to take their time with it.  So it is probably more time-consuming for that reason. I can tell you that I went down there with a lot of hesitation because frankly I am surgeried out at this point, and the thought of having to go through that whole drill, and be far enough away from home, doesn't really intrigue me.  Add to it that my LE is entirely do-able.  After meeting Dr. Becker though, I am totally sold.  When I was waiting for my appointment, there was a woman in the waiting room and I started chatting with her.  She was there from Ohio with her daughter, and her daughter was in with Drs. Becker and Vasile.  The daughter's LE was in both legs, and they have no idea how she got it.  I didn't have time to ask her a lot of questions, and I'm not sure I would have asked more anyway because it's not really my business.  But when the daughter came into the waiting room I couldn't believe my eyes.  Both of her legs were totally blown up.  I wish I had gotten her name because she is having surgery on Tuesday.  I would have liked to keep in touch to see what her progress was.  I also got to meet with an anesthesiologist because being under horrifies me.  I've had some bad experiences in the past.  After talking to this doctor, I felt totally relieved.  Everything I brought up as a problem, she had a remedy for.  She took copious notes and assured me that they would take care of all of the things that had been problems for me in the past.   The final part of my journey didn't go as well.  They were running behind at the MRI place and to tell you the truth, that was going to be my least favorite part of the trip.  I am extremely claustrophobic and the MRI is 2 hours.  And it is a closed MRI.  The end of the trip had to be precision, pretty much, as  I had scheduled myself for the last train home.  When they said they were running behind, I got nervous because I didn't think I'd be able to make my train.  So I left without having it done.  (Relief on some level, ha ha.)  But I realize that it is a very important part of the whole thing so I know it's going to need to be done at some point. Dr. Becker is not back in the states (after this) until September, so that gives me time.  If September doesn't work for me, I could always push the surgery out until the time after September.  So I definitely have options. If anyone lives close enough to NYC to even go in for a consult at some point, and you are interested in checking it out, I would tell you to get in touch with Dr. Vasile and try to set something up for the next time Dr. Becker is here.  The worst thing that could happen is you decide it's not for you.  But you just might feel it is worth a shot. I think I am going to call her office and see if they will give me the name of the person from Ohio or at least give her my name.  I am going to be very interested to see her result.  I know that she will only be able to tell me about short-term, of course, but even that will fascinate me because she definitely had a very very bad case of LE. Hope I didn't bore you too much!  I will keep you updated on whatever comes next.  If you have any questions, ask away; or if you want to PM me at any point, feel free to do that too. ",

Vasile and Becker and that really threw me! I am definitely not as enthused as I was on Friday.  If I had the kind of LE that poor female had in her legs, I would probably try anything.  But again, mine is mild and definitely doable.  Is something from above telling me not to do it?  I'm not sure.  I do want to hear more from Katiejane and from her friend.  And I will definitely query Dr. Vasile about it.  (Katijane did say her friend is lacking a lot of lymph nodes that the normal system has.  I wonder how much - if at all - that played into her new LE?) I told my friend that some day it may be perfected in the US to the point that it is routine and maybe some doctor closer to home will decide to become an expert in it.  I certainly have time to let this become more perfected! Obviously I am in a quandry at this point.  No idea what I am going to do, though I am leaning more toward caution right now than I am toward heroics!  Will keep you posted.  Thanks for the information, toomuch.  ",

Will keep you posted!  Going to NYC the end up August for my MRIs.",

I am glad you asked all your questions and if you have more feel free to ask away!! I am going to answer each question has you listed them. My case is different because my lymphedema is in the right leg and it got so out of control that the leg became deformed. I gave up hope a long time ago but because my oncologist found Dr. Vasile I said what do I have to loose!! Not only did they do the lymph node transfer they removed alot of tissue to reconstruct the entire leg. My leg now is just about the same size as my other leg which never had lymphedema in it!!! My leg weighed over 75 lbs before and walking was very difficult but now it weighs the same as the left and walking is great!! Let me know if you have anymore questions or concerns!! I have been helping out alot of people with this horrible disease!! You can share my story with others! I hope spreading the word about this surgery can help anyone feeling alone like I did!! 1.  Who did your surgery?  Was it just Dr. Vasile, or did Dr. Becker assist?  Or did Dr. Becker do it? Dr.  Vasile and Dr. Becker along with 2 other surgeons preformed the surgery 2.  How long have you had LE, what caused it, where is it?  And was it a mild or severe case, or somewhere in the middle? I have it in my right leg for 20 yrs due to Stage 3 Melanonma and it was extremely severe 3.  How long ago did you have your surgery, and where?  (for example, in NY?) First surgery March 13,2012. Second surgery July 2,2012 NY Eye and Ear Infirmary 4.  Was your procedure out-patient? NO 5.  How long were you under?  (Anesthesia scares the life out of me.)  Did you have any trouble coming out of the anesthesia or did it make you sick? first surgery 9hrs, second surgery 7hrs. no problems at all 6.  If your surgery was out-patient, about how long were you there after surgery before they let you go home? you must stay at least over night I was there for 5 days(my case is very different) 7.  What part of your body did they remove the nodes from?  Have you had any swelling at all in that part of your body? first surgery left groin area transfered to right groin area. Second surgery left armpit area to right knee. No swelling in donor sites 8.  If you're not from NY, how long did you have to stay in the area before you were allowed to go home?  Did you have to go to Dr. Vasile the day after surgery? I am from Long Island,NY but do to my case I stayed at the Mircale House in Manhatthan(I can give you more info later) 9.  Did you have drains, and if so, how long were they in? First surgery 3 drains for about 2 weeks/ second surgery 3 drains 1 week 10.  Were you in pain after the surgery?  Is there discomfort? my case is very different so yes there was pain but talking to other patients they did great after surgery, one didnt even take the painkillers given 11.  Are there things you have to do for any period of time to help with the situation - have massage, wear special garments, etc.? I had to start lymphedema therapy and compression wrapping in Jan. to prepare for first surgery, 1 week after surgery in March went back to therapy( it felt great to be wrapped) got fitted for new compression garment then before second surgery did another 2 weeks of therapy had surgery and then went back right after for another 2 weeks of therapy. I am just now wearing the compression garment but I am wrapped at night 12.  Now for the million dollar question - did it work?  Has your LE resolved, and if so, did you notice it immediately?  Did the doctors say how long it could take to resolve completely? in my case YES it has worked, the new nodes can take up to 1 year before you see if its completely resolved 13.  Are you glad that you did it, and given the choice, would you do it over again? I am extremely glad I did it!! I  already did it twice and my third surgery will be November so yes I would do it over again!!!LOL  ",

He ended his email with \"I know we can help you.\" I like that confidence, especially since it's backed up with experience.

Dr. Graznow sounds really promising.  What really impressed me is that he studied under Dr. Koshima in Japan.  Dr. Koshima's considered the father of supermicrosurgery.   And when I told Dr. Chen in Iowa that I wanted to be sure to go to someone reputable, he said that I should consider going to Dr. Koshima because he created the technique and has performed over 4,000 LVAs!  (I told him I didn't think my insurance company would cover a trip to Japan, ha ha.)  You know, things happen for a reason.  Maybe I was meant to go through all of these hoops to get to this point when you would be telling me about Dr. Graznow!  This is from an article written by Dr. Neligan:  Lymphoscintigraphy, which is the traditional method of visualizing lymphatic structures, does not provide enough detail to visualize the subdermal lymphatic vessels, though it does provide useful information on overall lymphatic function and, specifically, lymph node function.1 More recently, techniques of MRI-lymphangiography have been developed, which allow better assessment of lymphatic vessels2 (Video 1). Indocyanine green (ICG) lymphangiography is also a useful imaging modality for mapping lymphatic channels and is more useful than lymphoscintigraphy.   Maybe I'll send that to that jackass Dr. Chang!",

He said there would likely still be fibrosis. So what he is recommending is that I have both LNT and LVA. He will use lymph nodes from my neck for the LNT. All I was waiting for was to see whether insurance was going to cover it, and I got word from his office last week that insurance approved it. So now I'm waiting to hear from the scheduler to see when I will have it done! It's been a journey, but I never stopped searching.  :)",

Vasile and Becker aware that your friend is starting to develop LE in her arm?  You can believe that I will be questioning Dr. Vasile about it.  If they are aware of this, I will be concerned on two levels: one, that it happened at all; and two, that I was misled when I asked the question originally. And it would definitely make me rethink my decision. I would appreciate any further information that you can give me.  Thanks Katiejane. (By the way, I thought that that the MRI and node mapping were the same thing.  I guess I haven't been asking the right questions!) ",

She has had two surgeries so far.  She said that with the first one, she didn't have any pain at all and didn't need to take any meds at all.  They used nodes from under one of her arms and patched them into her groin area.  She stayed in NY for approximately three days.  She had to wrap and have daily therapy for one month.  After that the therapy was cut down, and I believe she has to wear a compression garment at night.  Her second surgery was to take nodes from her other underarm and patch them into her thigh.  She said that one set of nodes deals with the lower leg and the other deals with the upper leg, that's why she had to have the two surgeries.  She will be going back in November to have a final surgery.  With her other leg, the swelling is only in one part and so she only needs to have one set of nodes transplanted.  They will take the nodes from her neck this time because they do not like to remove nodes from an area where they've already taken some.  She is fine with that. She said that the doctors told her not to be disappointed if she didn't see immediate improvement because the vessels have to grow and it can take up to a year for things to totally function.  She said that her calf is \"jiggly\" where before it was hard as a rock, so she is very excited.  And that surgery was only done three weeks ago.  So it seems that it is working. She absolutely loves Drs. Vasile and Becker.  She said that Dr. Becker's eventual goal is to build some kind of center in the US where doctors can be trained in the art of nodal transplant.    She said that if I had any more questions I was free to call her at any time.  We're also going to exchange email addresses so I can always email her any questions.  So if there is anything else anyone wants to know, just let me know. Well, that's all the news that's fit to print! ",

I guess that's the long-hand answer!  I am definitely going to do it.  I'm excited for you and hope your insurance company comes through!  Keep us posted!!! HAPPY 2013 TO ALL OF US!!! ",

I wonder if others of us would end up finding out that our lymph systems were somewhat compromised if we had total lymphoscintigraphy.  Since both of your arms are thin, you would never have guessed it, right?  I'm happy you insisted on it though.  I will be interested to see what Dr. Becker has to say.  Does slow uptake automatically mean that you would never use that site? Please keep us posted, and don't lose hope!  Again, they can always use neck nodes if you're willing to go that way. Trisha",

Will let you know how it goes. I am the prototypical lazy LE patient.  I don't wrap and I don't use my sleeve.  I want the magic bullet for everything.  So I'm willing to check out the newest stuff all the time.  I had cold laser treatment and that really worked well. My swelling is definitely on the mild side - when it happens - but if I can get it down to no swelling, well bully for me! I'M DOWN WITH CHEMO! Log in to post a reply",

Good luck with your decision.  Go for whatever you think is best for you. ",
