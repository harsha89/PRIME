Right breast had \"loosely associated calcifications\" and they had me repeat it this past July, last month. The results were essentially unchanged, no changes in the calcification morphology or number. They told me to come back in 6 months. So 3 days ago, I got out of the shower and after drying off I happened to look down at my right nipple (same breast that has calcifications) and I see some clear/semi-milky looking fluid on my breast, like a droplet. I squeezed gently and more came out. I have not seen anymore since then. Also, it was sticky. I called my OB-GYN today and he wants me to have a blood test to level my TSH (thyroid) and my prolactin. Not sure what the prolactin is looking for.  I know that certain thyroid conditions can cause discharge from breasts, and I am hypothyroid, but I am taking synthroid daily for that, and was checked in June, and my levels were fine.  I'm just wondering if I should be more concerned or ask the dr. to check anything else??
