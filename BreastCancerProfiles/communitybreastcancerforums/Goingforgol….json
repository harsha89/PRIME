She referred me to a surgeon but he had terrible reviews so I found my own that specializes in breasts. Appt is next week so now just to wait.  What concerns me is that I asked what my mammo noted/what was found and they said it found nothing, no cysts etc. how can I have a palpable lump and enlarged duct but mammo show nothing? Shouldn't that should have at least show up? Does that mean the mammo is useless? I'm so confuse",

I guess what I meant by useless is that the radiologist gave a \"benign\" result but didn't actually see my lumps of it he did he didn't note any other possibility for what he saw. So assuming he didn't see anything at all, how could he say they were benign. Part of me is worried because I don't have an answer but the problem persists. And the other part feels stupid for continuing to pursue it, if it's nothing then I've wasted others time and my money and worry, maybe I'm just over reacting and should settle for the benign/no findings result",
