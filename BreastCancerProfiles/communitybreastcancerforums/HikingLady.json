I'm worn out after 4. I finished 13 days ago, and I'm still SO exhausted. I can imagine that two more would be very difficult, but people do it.... they are made of steel,those people?

This is called Delayed Reaction, as you said, since it didn't pop up during the infusion--this has been explained to me, and it has to do with how our immune systems deal with allergens, and so \"delayed\" can happen, although it's less common than having a reaction immediately. Not only are hives awful (itchy, hurt) but of course, the NEXT step in an allergic reaction can be anaphylaxis, so my oncologist treated this as a Very Big Deal. In fact, it was recommended that I have an Epi-pen around, but there aren't any right now in the US. !!!! A supply problem. So, I took my steroid plan seriously. I was put on 8 mg Dexamethasone every 12 hours. Instructions were that if that didn't keep them down, move to every 8 hours or whatever works. After 5 days, I was tapered off. I ALSO took Claritin each day, just as one more insurance, and that was also recommended by oncologist. Then, for Infusion #4, my oncologist changed Taxotere to Taxol, in case I didn't have a sensitivity to Taxol, which is related to Taxotere but slightly different. Before Infusion #4, I also was given 20 mg of Dexamethasone two times (12 hrs apart) the day before (usual had been 8 mg, but this was to reduce the chance of an allergic reaction during infusion), and another 20 mg two hours before infusion, and then I-V 10 mg. I had no reaction on infusion day. However, on Day 9, I got all-over-body hives again. So, again, Dexamethasone 8mg every 12 hours. It worked and kept down the hives. Again, after about 5 days, I tapered slowly. My tapering schedule: First, I reduced the nighttime one (6 p.m) to be 4 mg, and if no hives, then next day 6 a.m. down to 4, and that evening, change 4 to 2 mg for the night, next a.m. 2 mg and then I was done. SLEEPING was a challenge. So, I always took 2 Benadryl + 1 Lorazepam on the nights when I'd had 8 mg of Dexamethasone at 6 p.m., and that worked. WORRY: I was cautioned to be always watching, and making sure that the steroids were working, so if I had to be gone out of town for part of a day, I took extra steroids along, just in case.... FATIGUE was huge for 4-5 days after getting off steroids, both times. This is very recent---my 2nd experience was just 2 weeks ago, by the way. At about Day 14, when I'd been on steroids for 5 days, I started tapering down, and I had no hives, and no evidence of them at all after that.",

That's a collection of research data that we all benefit from, where meta-data analyses are guiding ever-more-successful treatments and outcomes. He explained my chemo plan and which factors informed it, many weeks before we had the Oncotype DX score back. My chemo started 4 weeks after BMX surgery. He ordered the Oncotype DX after he'd seen the surgical path. report, because suddenly thought that there might be a chance that I would fall into a Maybe No Chemo After All category. My Grade 3 is a BAD thing. But, Node negative is a GOOD thing. Once the surgical margins came back clear, and also the node negative information was good news, and also the whole path report clarified that the tumor didn't have vascularization or lymphatic involvement, he was kind of hoping that my Oncotype DX would tip the other way, and maybe I wouldn't need chemo. So, he ordered it at THAT point. It's a proprietary test, but I'm guessing that it weighs the Grade 3 information quite heavily. And, that Grade 3 is my scariest dx fact, of course....",

RE: Flu shot after chemo My oncologist has specific instructions for me about when I can get my flu shot. He said not during chemo because immune system won't function right to build up the immunity, so it just won't be effective. After final chemo infusion, he's checking my WBC count at 10-12 days (lowest/nadir point after final infusion) and then he'll decide when I can get my flu shot, and when I can be fine to go back into the swimming pool. He thought swimming during chemotherapy wasn't a great idea, although I know some MO's have said patients can go ahead. He suggested that I avoid that kind of possible infection risk during chemotherapy. He said that if my WBC count is good enough this week, it will be fine to get a flu shot anytime. He predicted that at the latest, I might have to wait 3-4 weeks after final infusion. My final infusion was Sept. 4 and my blood draw to check is Sept. 13. He also explained that people having chemotherapy for blood cancers (leukemia, etc.) have a much more affected immune system during chemotherapy than breast cancer patients, because of the treatment plans and how they work in the body. That chemotherapy for \"solid mass\" (tumors) cancers are not as depressing to our immune systems as the blood cancer type of treatment plans. Once the chemo is finished, and once we have WBC counts back to normal range, our immune systems do okay with flu shots, etc.",

At night, I often take 10 mg and that helps me sleep. This works for me. Sometimes, I take one of them every 3-6 hours, and other days just once when it starts bothering me. Probably related to how much activity I do... This medicine also dries out mucous membranes and dehydrates, so you have to drink a lot of extra water. It's a muscle relaxant, often prescribed for back spasms, etc. 10 mg puts me to sleep, and 5 mg doses work fine for me in the daytime. It doesn't have any other side effects or affect my mood in any way, simply un-spasms the tight muscles. My surgical oncologist suggested this instead of Valium when we talked it over. She is 37 years old, and had a BMX and TE's and ACT chemo for her b.c. diagnosed when she was 32 years old, then implants eventually swapped, so she has LIVED THROUGH all this stuff. She could not be more compassionate, and she thinks the tight pecs are terrible, she remembers that well, and so she's suggested that I do this.

I am seeing a physical therapist who's working on this for me, and it is helping. To find her, I searched online in my city for a PT skilled with breast surgery recovery, and sure enough, she really is a specialist in this exact thing. Sometimes, breast surgeons can be sources for referrals to this kind of PT. She's basically doing skilled massage on me, specifically working on scar tissue, and also helping with stretching. She's also guiding my rebuilding of upper body strength. My insurance is paying for 8 sessions, which is probably about perfect for what I need. I've had 5, and can really tell that it has helped. I do have Tissue Expanders, and will have implant surgery on January 2. However, most of what she's doing doesn't have much to do with the reconstruction, it's really work on the scars, and also guidance for rebuilding my upper body muscles. In her massage, she's helping stretch my scars so they aren't so tight, and moving the adhesions so that I have better range of motion. My drain exit site on the cancer side has been VERY uncomfortable, and she's working on that scar tissue, for instance. My drain was in for a long time--4 weeks, so it probably developed a lot of adhesions. It's already much more comfortable because of her work. Not all physical therapists know about breast surgery issues. I hope you can keep looking into this. It's been really helpful for my comfort and also for rebuilding my strength safely. I didn't do much upper body work for the past many months, because I just felt too icky during chemo to work much on fitness, except some walking. So, my upper body is REALLY weak. My PT is also guiding me to prevent lymphedema. She says that after an axillary node excision, we're all at risk for that for a couple of years, so protection includes a compression sleeve while flying, and care to prevent injury on the affected side.",

FATIGUE DURING RADIATION: Fatigue was cumulative. I had six weeks of radiation in 2003, felt the tiredest 2 weeks after it finished, and at about 4 weeks I started to need about 11 hours of sleep each night, at the end also a nap during those final weeks. Drinking water helps with this and also with cell repair. I remember that about 3 months after radiation finished, I returned to feeling like ME as far as fatigue. I am now 10 days PFC, and dealing with a severe hives reaction. Im on mega-doses of steroids, which are working so far. Never a dull moment. This started on Day 9 of my #4/Final infusion. Same thing happened Day 8 after Infusion #3, so this final infusion time, I had a slightly different chemo med, (Taxol instead of Taxotere with my Cytoxan), and a huge amount of steroids before and during infusion day, but it has happened again despite those precautions.

It's a weird, awful thing that she got breast cancer so young, and odd and ironic that she's a breast surgeon. She was finishing her surgical specialization at about age 32 when she went through her cancer treatment, and that's about 5 years ago. She reports that once the \"swap\" to implants happened, they were very comfortable compared to the T.E's, and the tightness went away. The tissue expanders press against the pecs and are uncomfortable, and that makes the pecs tight. Since you've had no reconstruction, maybe your tightness is due to healing and scar tissue. If I were in your shoes, I would want the surgeon to advise, to check out my range of motion and healing, and hopefully then refer me to a Physical Therapist who specializes in breast cancer recovery. My friend who does exactly that (also lymphedema treatment), says that it's a very specific training and knowledge set, and not every PT specializes in this. A PT who does can guide you on getting back your range of motion and comfort and strength. \"Working\" on scar tissue can be really effective for the first year (after healing is completed), and after that, it's not as easy to smooth out and \"remodel\" scar tissue. So, there's a timeliness to solving tightness and scar tissue that constricts. This is often something that physicians and surgeons don't necessarily help with, so be sure to advocate for yourself about your discomfort. Warm wishes for good progress.",

My SO suggested waiting for 3-4 months after chemo. 3 months is right before Christmas, so I will do it about 4 months after chemo. My body will have had a good amount of time to recover from chemo before that next trauma. So, I will have lived with TE's for 7 1/2 months at that point. Ugh. And mine haven't had any complications. Although, I have healing SLOWNESS, since right side had radiation in 2003. I am just generally whiney about mine for no justifiable reason, and you have a lot of reason to be upset. Horrible. I'm so sorry about what you've been through. We do not need extra surgeries, on top of everything else!",

Based on your description, I'd choose staying with husband and kids, and getting through it in the same place as your own nuclear family. You describe that as an important support, being together under one roof. Unless you dislike the oncologist there, or it seems inferior in quality. Maybe family from \"back home\" can fly to be with you when you especially need help? I worked full time and also had two teenagers in 2003 when I had the lumpectomy + radiation, and I was 45 years old. I needed some help managing kids' carpooling, and people I barely knew stepped in and helped. Didn't need much help after the lumpectomy; fairly easy recovery. Tired during radiation. This time, I needed help for a week or so after the mastectomies--husband took time off from work to care for me. During chemo, there was one day each cycle of feeling pretty rotten, but that was only 1 day every 3 weeks. The other days, I was functional, but I got tired easily. I drove myself (10 minutes away) to every infusion, also to follow-up doctor appointments except the first 2 weeks after surgery. During chemo, I could cook, could do normal things, errands, etc, just slowly. Keep researching exactly what the choices are, and what your resources are for help, as you're doing. Very smart, and I wish you well on figuring out the plan.",

RE: nutrition and supplements + chemotherapy... My oncology clinic and all its oncologists, and their naturopath consultant for nutrition have recommended that I eat 80-100 grams of protein per day during chemotherapy. A similar high-protein amount is also recommended after surgery and during radiation, all to support the body's cell repair. So far, I'm fine on RBC count, hemoglobin. I am also on quite a list of supplements (also from my oncology clinic) to try to help with neuropathy. The standard treatment these days, from our local chemo clinics and oncologists, includes: alpha lipoic acid, B12, B6 + some other additives to \"potentiate\" absorption, and also L-glutamine. All because the normal absorption of those elements is wrecked by the chemo meds I'm given. I'm on all of these supplements, and perhaps it's helping w/ neuropathy, or not... These are standard things; they're all on the printed support information I got before starting chemo. The triage nurses support the patients at all times. When I reported neuropathy (tingling on soles of feet), they directed me to start all these supplements immediately. My friend who had the same chemo regimen two years ago, also in Portland, OR, wasn't told any of these nutritional supplement protocols, but she went to a naturopathic physician who suggested all the same things. Two years later, it's now incorporated into oncology protocols, at least for my clinic. ",

So, that wasn't so bad. I took Claritin for 4 days starting on infusion day, and that helped with the aching, and I also took an NSAID. I was instructed to drink A LOT of water the day before, and also for a day or so after the infusion, which probably helped my body manage it. After the infusion, I had diarrhea for a few days. I took Imodium to control it, and I started myself on a (good, expensive, refrigerated) daily probiotic. Who knows whether that helped, but the diarrhea calmed down after a week or two. This could just be me, not a typical side effect. The infusion did take 20-30 minutes---apparently, there's an ideal speed for the drip, just like for chemo. Too fast, and our bodies have worse reactions. I was given fluids/saline drip at the same time, as I recall.",

      "Content": "Jun 7, 2018 07:09PM - edited Jun 7, 2018 07:17PM by HikingLady I'm 2 weeks and 2 days past BMX with SLN and TE's. Final surgical pathology showed clean margins, and no lymph involvement in armpit or in breast tissue, and tumor size confirmed to be .9 cm. This puts me in a new category; these \"good news\" facts were better than expected, because my tumor is Grade 3. Therefore, my oncologist has ordered oncotyping, and results will be back in about 2 weeks, so that's how long before I find out whether I'll have chemotherapy. My \"good\" side was found to have LCIS, which makes me feel good about my decision for a BMX. Left side drain was clear-ish and low volume at about 10 days and was able to come out. Right side got a hematoma around 7 days after surgery, and drain bulb has been quite full still, and dark red, as it clears out the more-traumatized right side. My SO did the axillary excision through the breast incision, so I don't have an additional armpit incision, but the trauma inside my right breast area was extensive. Lots of bruising; still looks pretty beat up 16 days post surgery. Still plenty of torso swelling. Abdomen was swollen for a good 2 weeks, post surgery; probably from general edema + maybe also because of all the saline they put in, who knows! Right drain might take a few more days before it can come out. Thank heavens for that white surgical camisole, with its little drain-bulb holding pockets. My DH does a lot of laundry, including that item when there's leakage. Pain, or serious discomfort, is rather constant across my chest. I don't think post-surgical pain was really there after about 3 days, but the pressure on my pecs of the TE's behind them is quite difficult. I quit taking Oxycodone during the day at about 1 week post surgery. I still use Cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril) 10 mg at night, and sometimes Oxycodone, and in the day I use 5mg Flexeril occasionally. I take 600 mg Ibuprofen once or twice each day. I find that an active day (getting up, doing a lot, walking 1-2 miles) has to be followed by a recovery/rest day! I'm usually quite physically fit, but repair and healing is taking awhile at age 60, so I'm letting healing happen at my body's own pace. NOTE: My cancer in 2003 was considered Totally Cured (after lumpectomy, radiation and 5 years of Tamoxifen) by all of my doctors. My 2018 cancer has completely different markers and is considered a New Primary. My bad luck. Breast Cancer twice. It's helpful for me to go around this site and find stories about how people feel several weeks, months, years after similar surgery and treatment. That puts my recovery in perspective.",

I have constant, extreme tightness of pecs as the TE's press against them. It has definitely improved since surgery, but it is still uncomfortable, all the time. The spasming of the pecs isn't exactly pain, but it's definitely discomfort. My system: I take 5 mg of Flexeril (= Cyclobenzaprine) every 3-5 hours during the day, which calms down the spasms and makes the tightness feel much better for 2-3 hours at a time. At night, I take 10 mg + also 5 mg Oxycodone, to be sure I rest well and sleep okay at night. If I feel achy, I might take Ibuprofen or Tylenol, but usually it's been tightness, not pain, so the muscle relaxant has worked well. My TE's are 500ccs, and PS put 200 ccs in (each side) at surgery. I haven't had any fills yet, because my right side incision has been slow to heal. I'm in no hurry. The swap surgery will have to be in October or November, because I now have chemo starting in two days. I'm 60 years old, and I was fairly fit before surgery--had strong pecs and strong arms. I am not sure whether that has anything to do with patients' relative discomfort. I wasn't a candidate for the \"pre-pec\" type of reconstruction, because right breast had radiation in 2003, 15 years ago with 1st breast cancer--damage includes slower healing, less blood supply, and generally is more fragile as a result.",

I want to have her assess me in all ways, and guide me in how to regain strength, ROM, comfort, and protect myself from lymphedema, etc. I have very little downward pressure strength, so I can't easily open a childproof medication bottle. I have not been lifting weights or doing much exercise. I've been surviving chemo, and that's about all I gave myself as the project to accomplish for these past three months! Just finished chemo, so it's time to move forward on strengthening. I'm not having my implant surgery until January. This is because of personal obligations and family responsibilities in November and December. So, it will be 7 months of TE's before \"swap surgery\" for me. Ugh. They are SO uncomfortable. My healing was extremely slow after my BMX. It took 8 weeks for the incision to heal on the right side (which had radiation in 2003), and just 2.5 weeks on the left. And many weeks of a drain and also a hematoma. But, no infection, thank heavens. Since my PS told me already that he's going to re-use the exact same incision, I haven't really thought it worth worrying too much about massaging the incision scar. However, I'll get the PT's input on that question. My main struggle going forward is my worry about healing. I have stopped at about 300 ccs in TE's that will hold 500 (sized to my rib cage, so that volume information is not very relevant). Perhaps I'll end up with quite small implants. I fear that if I keep adding more saline, my compromised blood supply (due to scarring from the radiation) on the right side will be even more challenged to heal! No one has answers to this. The PS says \"let's just see how you do with more saline added.\" Which actually means, we'll find out, after the surgery, how healing will be.... My right side pec is like a brick wall. This is because it, too, not just the skin and other tissue, has (invisible but present) scarring, so it's not having a great time with TE's. I feel such compassion toward all of us. We've each made a journey through difficult lands, and some anguish along the way seems extremely justified.",

I have implants below my pecs, and there's a fair amount of discomfort mostly on my previously-radiated (2003) side. Some tightness at all times, and I'm 4 months past exchange surgery, so I think it's settled into how it will be. Sorry to hear that with all those therapeutic interventions, you're still uncomfortable. I would be wary of this new PS's suggestion. It could be a starting point for gathering more information, but, you know that very famous saying, \"surgeons like to cut.\" I'd get 2-3 opinions before making this huge decision. And, more opinions about how to solve the discomfort without surgery. Would it make sense to consult with a physiatrist? Trained as MD + also in PT stuff---kind of an interesting specialty. My PT friend shared with me that after every flap surgery there's a long recovery, and ultimately some loss of strength, due to how the muscles are separated or moved or fibers are compromised. Whether lat or ab. On the other hand, people say that the LOOK (fat grafting can be part of this and it feels more natural than an implant) can be best with this type of surgery. For the usual implant type, the implants are behind the pecs. Depending on skin thickness, there are also pre-pec (on top of pecs) implants, but I wasn't a candidate. My Tissue Expanders are set into a sewn-in pocket (made of Alloderm), behind the pec, and over the months of saline being added, the pecs and skin had to stretch. I found the pec stretching extremely uncomfortable, especially right side that had radiation in 2003. In fact, pecs usually lie flat against chest wall (original breasts are on top of them, not behind them), so they're unhappy at being made to stretch around a TE. You have skipped all that, and maybe at this point, the lat. flap. reconstruction really is the only way to solve your discomfort. But, I share your shock and awe at imagining that surgery is going to be a good solution. Surgery caused this problem! I'd want to know: If you formed keloid tightening scars after BMX, wouldn't you again, with next surgeries? How long will you be recovering from such a surgery? What compromises to lat muscles will be necessary? What if this same tightening and scar challenge happens again? Will first incisions be re-used and excised? Are you a candidate for hyperbaric therapy to speed healing, and does that help with this type of scar tissue healing challenge? I'd want to discuss this exact repair with people who had it, or read their testimonials, or call someone up who's had it. I'd look for a PS who's successfully solved your exact issue, if there's to be any surgery.",

Sometimes, I feel a bit of a stabbing in a rib, other times just hard stiffness all over. They don't love it when I try to sleep on my side, but I manage sometimes with strategic pillow placement. My pecs are uncomfortably tight ALL THE TIME, and I haven't had more saline added since the 200 each side at surgery. I sometimes take 5 mg Cyclobenzaprine 1-3 times a day, and sometimes 10 mg at night, and that helps a lot. My surgery healing has been slow. Due to 2003 radiation on my right side, that incision has a tiny section that's not quite healed, so that's why I've waited to add any more saline. Plus I'm also living through chemo right now, and I'm trying to minimize discomforts! For my back pain, doing a ton of different Abdominal exercises helps, and most of them are classic \"stomach strengthening to support lower back\" type exercises. On stomach, lift torso and legs, on back, do crunches or roll-ups. Physical therapists have usually given me exercise plans that have solved every muscle thing I've ever had, including my back problems, so that's where I'd go for an assessment and guidance. They're experts. It could be that a particular angle or position that you're getting into while doing the stretches is misaligning something else? That's stuff that PT's can help with. My own bad back pain has usually been helped in the short run by a heating pad, NSAIDS (Ibuprofen) and occasionally \"Flexeril,\" (Cyclobenzaprine) because it stops spasms. In the long run, ab exercises have solved my back complaints.",

My own experience is that my plastic surgeon scoffs a bit, and hasn't referred me to PT for any of this. I don't happen to have lymphedema, but proactively, I decided to see a PT who specializes in breast surgery issues. She's working on my pec to stretch it, working on the fascia for comfort for the TE and implant. My situation is a bit unusual. 15 years ago, radiation on right side. So, the right side tissue expander is having a harder time getting the fascia, pec, skin stretched, and she's working on it. My implant surgery is in 3 more months, so I have some time to get this work done. Meantime, she happens to also be a MLD specialist, and if that comes up, I'll go to her. Back to my super close friend. She has done this work for 25 years, and lymphedema can have solutions. The massage techniques, the \"drainage\" to learn how to \"pump\" the lymph, and of course compression and elevation and protection of the sites. For instance, I never have needle pokes on my right arm--I just don't chance it. I have now had TWO axillary node excisions (2003 and 2018) on my right side, so I just don't ever prune the raspberries or roses either, without super-gloves and arm cover protection.

My challenge is moving through the Forever-After Terror, and doing each day with some hope. I'm glad to have this supportive forum, glad to live in an era of evidence-based medicine and diagnosis of breast cancer, and I'm grateful for good treatment options. My family and friends are extremely loving and supportive, but people who haven't been through this cannot completely understand what we go through. Wishing you all a much better 2019. In April, near my cancer-versary, DH and I will have a week in Hawaii. I am excited to look forward to that. My exchange surgery went well, healing went fine, and I'm back to daily exercise and building back my strength.",

My husband is an RN and he's amazing about figuring out how to manage my pain. Unfortunately, I also had a huge amount of nausea yesterday. We had Zofran and also Phenergan suppositories which turned that around. He's alternating Tylenol and Ibuprofen each time w/ the opioids. Ibuprofen gel caps, slit a bit, can be suppositories! Since I couldn't take any oral meds yesterday afternoon and evening due to huge amounts of vomiting, that was a make-shift and okay pain solution. I'm finding the cyclobenzaprine to help a lot with the pec muscle spasms, and so I'm using that in between the oxycodone doses. Nausea has been my Usual after surgery. Alas! Wow, SO much edema in right armpit where there was SNB, but the drains will probably eventually do the trick on clearing that out. Drs and my husband nurse say to sleep upright. Helps my GI issues and also helps w/ draining edema into surgical pouches. Thank heavens for many shapes of small pillows, including a bed wedge + a neck c-shaped travel pillows. Those are my main tips to pass along/",

I'm on Keflex for 10 days post surgery---prophylactic, and standard care from my SO and PS. If you're on antibiotics, too, maybe this is an explanation? Be sure to take your temperature, too, because feeling hot can go along with a fever, which can be a sign of infection.",

      "Content": "Oct 10, 2018 08:56PM HikingLady wrote: RE: Lymphedema, axillary node excisions, and post-mastectomy PT issues I saw my PT (who specializes in all this) today. How did I find her? Lots of Googling. She also knows Manual Lymph Drainage techniques, etc for managing/preventing lymphedema. Lymphedema IS a risk after all breast surgeries, and after radiation. My breast-specialist PT is working specifically on my right side, to make it more comfortable. I have TE's, and my right side had radiation (whole breast + site-specific) in 2003, 15 years ago. Right side pec doesn't want to stretch over the TE (because of scar tissue), and that there are more adhesions and less free movement on that side. (I have to have BELOW pec expanders and implants also because of radiation--skin too thin for the newer \"pre-pectoral\" type implants) My left side is much more comfortable, doesn't mind the tissue fills, and the pec doesn't spasm out and scream at me. Anyway, she's doing some stretching of fibers, movement and freeing of the fascia layer, and generally \"working\" the scar, adhesions, and scarred tissue so that it can be more flexible. This will make my final implants be more comfortable. I'm staying whatever size I am at this point, maybe B, maybe C, depends what the PS decides will fit well in the pocket. I'm stopping NOW, at 300cc's, although I could have 500-700 put in. Too uncomfortable at this point, and also, healing was slow on the right side after the BMX, so I don't want to get all crazy and have healing complications. Implant swap surgery is going to be January 2, a full 4 months PFC, so I can have time to rebuild strength and heal well. I'm waiting that long for the same reason--my healing will be challenged, so I want to have the best possible good health before that surgery. My PT says that she can help everyone be more comfortable with TE's and be more able to have the implants have enough \"space\" in their pockets without adhesions, etc. Scar-minimization, scar-remodeling (so that the incision floats over the fascia layer and doesn't get caught, moves smoothly), stretching of different attachment sites for muscles attaching to joints and ligaments, lymphedema prevention, drainage and management techniques, and working on scar adhesions ARE normal PT skills, so any large system (like Kaiser) usually has some PT's who have this specialty. Obviously, some PTs are orthopedic people, and some are post-surgery specialists, and I did spend a lot of time looking before I found this very skilled PT. Basically, she's doing very specific massage and stretching on me. AIR TRAVEL & LYMPHEDEMA RISK Today, this PT said, \"Oh, you're going on some airplane flights soon? You should wear a compression sleeve on your right arm.\" I said, \"But, I have no lymphedema!\" She said, \"THAT'S why you need to do this. PREVENT any future lymphedema. Do this EVERY TIME YOU FLY. You're at high risk for lymphedema any time up to 2 years post Axillary Node Excision.\" So, before my flight, I'll go to a place in Portland that specializes in this (Just Like A Woman--they also specialize in mastectomy bras of all types, with prosthetic forms, removable pads, etc) and have them fit me with a compression sleeve for my right arm, and she instructs me to put it on a few hours AHEAD of my flight and keep it on for a few hours AFTER my flight, as pressurization takes several hours to normalize in blood stream after flight. Ooh, that will be SO CUTE to wear, along with my tank top when I fly to LA on Friday to see my daughter! Right? A fashion statement! One more cancer indignity. Am working (psychologically) on wearing it PROUDLY. Well, I got in the public pool (a few weeks ago, after chemo was over) baring my horizontal no-nipple BMX incision scars with the lumpy TE square-looking torso in the showers, and just decided to own MY BODY THAT LOOKS DIFFERENT NOW, so I guess I can do Compression Sleeve While Flying. WOW, this was news to me, and exactly why I sought her out. Preventing lymphedema is way better than managing it, duh. I had axillary node excisions (2 removed, both negative, sentinel/dye trace, etc) in 2003 with my lumpectomy. Again, in 2018, one node excised (also sentinel, dye trace, also negative), and although 2018 axillary node excision wasn't a separate incision (it was done by tunneling through the mastectomy/breast incision, so there's not a new scar), the risk comes from the removal of the lymph node, not from just scar tissue. This is DEFINITELY not something either my SO or PS ever mentioned. Surgeons deal with their thing, and then we're on our own. I wanted to share this compression-sleeve-while-flying tip with anyone who's had axillary node excisions, which, I'm pretty sure, is EVERY breast surgery patient who's had an invasive breast cancer. If you're ALREADY dealing with lymphedema, you probably do have a PT who's helping you, and who's guiding compression sleeves and wrapping and manual lymph drainage. If you don't have lymphedema, then, like me, you also don't WANT to have it. ",
