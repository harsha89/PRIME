I had a DCIS that was small and have had surgery and rads, and sometimes I feel that I shouldn't even be on this site, but darn it my cancer was and is very scary to me even if it is not a bad as others.  Sorry just venting.",

I do have some Toms of Maine natural deoderant which according so some literature is ok becuase it does not contain allumiun (spelling) salts which can react during the radiation.  Those looking for cotton bras I found some at Walmart for $6.00.  All cotton and snap in the front.  I got them 2 sizes larger then my usual so they have larger sizes.  I also found some all cotton sports bras that pull over but have really lose elastic on the bottom for 3 for $9.00 and men's Hanes t-shirts a package of 5 for $8.00.",

When I heard I would be starting I got butterflies, strange because I thought that I was ok with it.  Anyway, when I met with my doc and the nurse they gave me pages of what I could and could not do.  No swimming too drying, no lotions or soap 4 hours prior to my treatment.  No deodorant except Tom's of Maine (can buy on line), even then not 4 hours before treatment.  Soft cotton bras, T-shirts or cami's, no blends or poly as that will make you sweat and can irritate.  I have heard that you can get the cotton bras at Wal-Mart and at Kohl's although I was not able to find them on line.  JC Penny has a nice front zip sports bra that is mostly cotton and not too expensive, I ordered mine on line. Bras should be at least one size larger due to swelling.  No shaving while having treatment and then for a month after use an electric razor.  Wash anything next to your skin with Delph or Ivory, no fabric softener, no dryer sheets. No soap that has any additives in it.  No nylon bath scrubbers.  I am still checking on soap and the nurse told me that she is looking also to find a good one for me.  They prefer that you not use it at all if poss., but just run luke warm water over.  No hot tubs, sauna or high heat or sun exposure.  The high heat can react with the radiation making it even hotter and causing a worse skin reaction.  Cold can also over act and cause a reaction.  Drink tons of water; eat fresh fruits and veggies, high protein, low fat.  No processed foods or mixes (cut out the hamburger helper and Rice a roni, ha, ha) no alcohol. Low salt, no soy.  No caffeine.  You need to stay as well hydrated as poss., and avoid anything that may dehydrate you.  The doc and nurse both say that really helps.  Walk at least 30 minutes a day and get fresh air, do deep breathing, and make sure to stretch as much as possible.  Avoid crowds and people with colds.  I had a party yesterday and told all the little nieces and nephews that I would see them soon.  Love them all, the little germ carriers.  So that is what I have heard from my rad team.  I will meet with the doctor once a week and with the nurse everyday prior to treatment so she can asses my skin.  They will give me lotions etc to use.  By the way when I am nervous I talk a lot.

No shaving under that arm (I may have to braid mine).  She did tell me that I will have to give up wearing a bra and go to a cami by about the 4th week and may even go to just t-shirts.  Needless to say I will be taking time off work, that would be just too much information to share with my work group.  The whole idea is to try to keep anything from rubbing on your skin.  She told me if the Aveeno is not working to let her know and they will give me other creams to help.  No heating pads, ice packs, electric blankets, hot tubs. swimming, tan booths or sunbathing.  She said to drink tons of water and eat fruits, vegs and lean protein. To have yogurt, milk and cheese.  Stay away from processed foods.  Hope that helps some. ",
