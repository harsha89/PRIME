I posted this on the other one, but to be sure I wanted to post here as well. Thanks! Hello Ladies! My name is Theresa and I go for my first Chemo treatment tomorrow morning 8am. I am getting the Cytoxan/Adriamycin cocktail. I just moved from Washington DC to the small town in Northern Michigan last week to be closer to family and support for the chemo treatments. I'm not sure that was such a good idea. I'm still trying to unpack and organinze my home before treatment tomorrow. ACK! so much to do. I haven't had much time to do much more reseach on what to expect either. Many of you have mentioned a 'chemo class'. I was never offered this but am thinking about droping by the infusion center of the hospital later today if I have time to check it out. My doc decided against the port, which I am releived. I do not do well with pharmacueticlas in general. Another thing I'm quite worried about with the treatments. I get severe nausea with any drug. I can barely take a Tylenol without upsetting my stomach. Wow, I just realized how cranky I sound. Sorry girls! I just wanted to say hello and join the September Sisters. I'm really apprehensive and scared about tomorrow. Thanks for listening. xoxo ~t",
