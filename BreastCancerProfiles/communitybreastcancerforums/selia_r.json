First of all, I am under 20, and is there any risk of me getting breast cancer? I was born with a birthmark over my left breast and it covers it completely. My family has a history of skin cancer. Recently, the area right above my nipple has been slightly scabbed and itchy, and I think there is a small lump at the bottom of my breast. Is this likely to be breast cancer? I also have one swollen node under my armpit, but it's the right one. Can anyone help me? Log in to post a reply",
