I know what the s/e of taxol are but the unknown and lack of control is what is driving me insane.  I'm doing this as neoadjuvant chemo and I am hoping for complete pathological resolve.  I bought my wig already.  Love it in all honesty.  I have long hair and am still debating as to whether or not to cut my hair short or if I should just shave it off and start wearing the wig.  I know people say that losing hair is the hardest thing.  I'm just scared.  Thank goodness my son (4 mons old) won't know the difference. I'm glad I found you guys and together I know we can all get through this. Janice",

I'm so glad I've found you guys.  I've only had one other person who my ONC recommended to speak to (a patient of hers) who was the same age as me (32) with the same dx and is 3 yrs out now and is 5 mons preg!  There is hope :) Thanks for being there for me though silently until now...
