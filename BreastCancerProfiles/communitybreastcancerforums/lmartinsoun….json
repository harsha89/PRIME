Unfortunately I went to the imaging center only to be told the order for my mammogram had been cancelled. After the center trying to reach my dr for over an hour I got an email from her encouraging me to skip the mammogram and come in October for another clinical breast exam and she would refer me to a breast surgeon for a second opinion ultrasound.  However once I told her I had bleeding from the nipple on just the breast with the lump she is leaving the decision up to me. Do I wait an go see her for a referral or go back to the mammogram facility and risk them refusing the mammogram and just doing another ultrasound. I'm not sure what to do, I'm so mad at my drs office and that not once did she explain or acknowledge the order she sent for the mammogram to begin. Just fuming....",

I have an apt with a surgeon I've heard good things about from co-workers (and I work with a cancer org so if they're pleased with her, thats good cause they have high standards). I have my official appt with the surgeon on october 1st and hopefully I will also have more answers. ",
