Then i got a call yesterday from the specialist & he tells me that there are no papillomas, no tumors, they are all just regular fibroadenomas, & no surgery is needed. WTF????? i havent ate or slept in 2 months since this whole ordeal began. The MRI was done solely based on my family history. they find all this stuff, scare the hell outta me & now im just supposed to forget about it. I told him im not at all comfortable with 'watching & waiting'. i've been doing that for 10 years now & im tired. one of the things they found was there last year (which i forgot about) has grown from 8mm to 12 mm. there are more than 5, but they chose not to biopsy all of them because \"statistically they should be fibroadenomas also\" again, WTF?!!!! i cant & wont accept that. i just cant. i told him that this news should make me feel better, but it doesent. dang, i'm barely a b cup, all i have is fibroids huh? Im now waiting for my BRCA results so i can see someone else. i am so lost & confused & angry! first they tell me that these growths are not cancer, but the cells & tissue around them look suspicious...now all a sudden i'm fine? how in the hell am i supposed to accept that? and what if they are just fibroadenomas?...they are painful, not just when aunt flo comes,  all the time. im just supposed to watch them keep growing? then i learned that you can still get cancer with or without the BRCA mutation. all i know is that my breasts are filled with things i wasnt born with, & im not comfortable with 'w&w', & i dont know what to do now.",
