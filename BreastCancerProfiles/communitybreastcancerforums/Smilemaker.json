It's been almost a year since I sat in the exam room waiting for test results.I too have found it difficult to voice my fears and concerns in a support group. Feels petty to complain about thinning hair and no sex drive when the women sitting next to me have  much more at stake. I have been lurking in the background and found support and advice here reading everyones post. There are days I hardly think about bc, and there are days I break and cry at the drop of a hat. Just taking it a day at a time and hope for the best. Thank you all for the words of wisdom. Weare not alone.",
