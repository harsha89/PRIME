She explained do to my age 38 yrs and the type of cancer I have (spindal cell metaplastic carcenoma stage 2 grade 3)they have to be a little more aggressive. She did not tell me much about my cancer but explained that this cancer does not follow lymph nodes and could be very aggressive. They did a scope in my nose (this makes you want to sneeze) right away because I've had a lump in my throat for a while. Everything looked good. They are sending me for many tests, bone scan, heart test and many ultrasounds. I'm greatful for that because the things you think about are crazy. This will put my mind at ease. She thinks that the oncologist will tell me about 5 rounds of chemo starting in 2 weeks. I will be off work for 6-8 months. I am glad everything has started. Bring it on!!!! I will let you guys know the results of my tests. I am so glad I found this site as you all help my journey a little less scary. hugs to all and you are all in my prayers.

      "Content": "kimvidito wrote: Hi everyone My complaint is more due to family problems. I live about 5 hours away from any relatives. My husband and 2 children and I live in a fairly small community and we are alone. I thought that I would get support through all of this but I was wrong. My mom and dad had a big Canada day party this weekend and everyone went. I couldn't because I was just too weak. A five hour drive to go to a barbecue was not my idea of fun and I have to go for my 3rd chemo thursday. When I explained why I could not go, my mom did not even acknowledge but was the first to call to tell me how much fun they had. Every time they come to our town, something happens like she told my 14 year old daughter to walk a mile in her shoes when my daughter was trying to explain the pain she had due to my having cancer. My brothers act like nothing is happening and when they came they got drunk. We had planned in January to go on a family trip to the east coast. This was supposed to be a 40th wedding anniversary party for my parents. We had to cancel the cottages and so on... I just found out that my parents and one of my brothers are still going and having the party. I explained that that was hurtful because I have cancer and we should have postponed this but they felt that they were going to proceed. I guess my question is how do I stay focused on getting well and beeing positive when I don't have any support. My husband and kids are great but they feel this strain as well. My son has lupus and always felt that because our family is so far away, they have no idea what we are going through every day. We struggle some days and what am I supposed to do call them and say, hey I'm having a bad day today. Why should I? I am so down and I can't seem to get back up. I was very positive but can't seem to get there again. The treatment has also put me into menopause so I might be feeling down because of that. Any suggestions on how to get positive and move on. take care everyone Kim Kim Metaplastic carcinoma, stage 2 , 2cm tumor, grade 3 triple neg Dx 4/11/2007, 2cm, Stage II, Grade 3, 0/2 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
