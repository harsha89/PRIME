We are - perhaps - too fond of each other, as he homeschooled for the last two years of high school, so I've seen a lot of him. I'm sure he's going to have a grand time in college. He's been chomping on the bit for at least a year now. \"But what about me?\", she whined. Before Stage 4, I had planned to get a job when he hit high school (ha!), so that by the time college rolled around I would be very involved in my next \"act\", and wouldn't droop too much when the nest emptied. Life is different now. I hope I see him graduate. I hope my health issues don't derail him. I also don't see how I could maintain a job outside the home, given chemo fatigue and all that. How have you guys managed this transition? I want him to thrive, without getting in his way. As much as I wanted him to go to college close by, I think the distance will be good for him. I see the anxiety on his face when I talk about cancer. He's a big fan of FaceTime and Skype, but I am yearning for the day he tells me that he's ending a call because he's got plans with his mates. He should be creating his own, unique life. Come September, I fear I will be blubbing for days. DH asked what my plans were for filling my time, come Fall. I grinched at him, then started crying.

MO says to continue with weekly Taxol for now, keep the TMs down, and keep the lesions healing. Heavy sigh.

My friend didn't let anyone know until he had advanced kidney failure.

They sent him straight to the hospital (next door, luckily), but it was a losing battle. Damnit all. He was in remission. He had time left.

We have a forum for commemorating loved ones, but would anyone be in favor of making it more of a memorial wall with information about each person? I would like to read about these ladies, and their lives. They continue to inspire, even after death. Each person could have a thread, and we could post our memories of them. When I first joined the Stage 4 club, the angel postings scared me. Now, they inspire.  ER/PR+, HER2-, Grade 3. Stage 4, July 2012.

Side note: I found the lump originally, but because I was younger at the time (44), both mammography and sonography didn't find anything, so the radiologist said there was \"nothing there\", and off I went on my merry way. Then my nipple started inverting, blah blah blah. Six months later, I had breast cancer. My breast tissue was so dense, the original round of imaging didn't reveal anything. I'm not bitter, but I am quite firm about people getting tissue biopsies for anything suspicious now.  My son (12) gave me whooping cough for Christmas. I spent about two months coughing so hard, I'd have to sit down or lie down to ride the coughs out. Then my right side (cancer side) started hurting badly. So, I went to see my GP, who ordered a blood panel. I asked her to throw in the CA 27-29, as it had been a year since my last one (normal). A great frenzy ensued, as my CA 27-29 values were 750, and a week later 850!! Off to the CAT and PET scans, which showed two sclerotic lesions on one rib, and one vertebrae. The radiologist thought they were to be expected from the cough. My oncologist knew about the tumor markers though, and thinks that they are metastasis.  I've done my first Zometa (I had all the side effects, plus some from other ladies it felt like), and was switched from Arimidex to Tamoxifen. I'm going in next week for labs and more Zometa. Good times.I have read that Tamoxifen might be a better choice for obese ladies, and even though I have recently lost 60 pounds on Atkins, I do have a good 40 to go.  My ribs seem to be taking their own sweet time healing up. I doesn't help that I have a year old dog who yanks my arm off when she sees a bird (we are working on that), and I decided to fight the Lily-of-the-Valley in the garden.   I'm getting used to the idea of Stage 4, thanks to Ativan. I am clinging to the faint hope that the fractured rib threw off the tumor markers. I have heard anecdotal reference to broken bones elevating the numbers, but have read no reliable reference. Is that just a crazy notion, or have you guys heard ot it?  This forum rocks, by the way. I think my head would have exploded without it. Thanks!   ER/PR+, HER2-, Grade 3. Stage 4, July 2012.

No medical professional has ever discussed my weight with me! Every time my husband sees his PCP, he gets his tummy prodded and is told to lose ten pounds.  I'm trying to figure out why. Maybe they think that at that level of overweight, surely I know, and that further discussion would be embarassing to me. I also owned up to it. But, I could have used some discussion and support. Losing weight is hard, and we - the obese - need to hear the message from our medical team. Especially given my hormone positive pathology. I'm a little bitter. I wish my oncologist had looked me straight in the eye and said that if I didnt lose the weight, I was looking at metastasis down the road. I'd have started sooner and lost weight faster (I think, I hope). Coulda, woulda, shoulda, right? So, the message to my fluffy crowd is that obesity is Not Good for the hormone positive set. Adipose tissue produces estradial - the less you have, the better. Also, it interferes with insulin signaling pathways, leading to higher blood sugar levels, which are also contraindicated for breast cancer patients. Getting breast cancer is multifactorial. Obesity alone won't \"give\" you cancer, so I'm not pointing the finger and blaming anyone for being the instigator of their own disease. But, reducing body mass is an important tool in managing this #$#@%# disease, and I wish my doctors had been a little more strident in making sure that information got through to me.

      "Content": "blainejennifer wrote: I just finished reading \"The Death of Cancer\" by Vincent DeVIta, who has spent his medical career in and around chemotherapy, in various big-time places (NCI, Yale), so I was very interested in what he had to say. It's a good read, as he had an auxiliary author. Anyway, in the concluding chapters, he makes a case for big blast chemo as an approach to metastatic cancer. It seems that palliative chemo only teaches the cancer cells how to survive the chemotherapeutic agent eventually, and it is not an avenue to a cure. He also points out that fear of toxic side effects kept chemotherapy from being fully utilized in the 1960's and 1970's. This is a synopsis, of course. It seems that it is his belief that metastatic patients should have a go with chemotherapeutic agents that they have not been exposed to. When I was diagnosed with Stage 4, I asked my Onc why I wouldn't have a course of chemo like I had when I was early stage, and I was waved off with talk of it not being effective, etc. However, I have looked through the data, and find no clinical evidence of that belief. I have a dubious nature, I also believe that I didn't have a shot at a full early stage cure because of the outdated belief that fat ladies shouldn't be given the full body weight dosage of chemo because it would be too toxic. That methodology has been disproved. Actual fact: I begged my original Onc for two more rounds of Taxol during my early stage treatment. I was tolerating it very well, and I wanted to grind any remaining cancer cells into the dust. I was, of course, not accommodated. I'm sure she didn't want me coming back, years later with leukemia as a result, but - in hind sight - maybe I wouldn't be Stage 4 now. So, are we not being offered a chance at real remission because of an idea, or because of actual evidence? ER/PR+, HER2-, Grade 3. Stage 4, July 2012.

They tell you to eat a varied and nutritious diet, but that means that someone has to assemble and cook said diet. Tonight - I am NOT that someone.

Got those zapped, 15 sessions, and it seems to have been helping. Then, two weeks ago, some of my liver values popped up, AST and ALT. So, I am gently slid, burrito style, into the PET/CT scan to see what is what. Progression is what that is. Diffuse progression, so there is no clearly defined target to aim for. Gulp. Due to some compulsive reading, I know this is scary. If your liver can't process chemo, the liver can fail trying. If I don't respond to Gemzar/Carboplatin, I'll start hearing words like \"comfort care\" and \"hospice\". I'm not crazy. I know that I won't last forever on treatment, but I need two more years to see my child graduate from college. I'm sure God is busily putting that in their calculations - \"Oh, that's right. Jennifer needs two more years for her one kid.

Does anyone have advice as to what the heck to do? I will be seeking a second opinion at Roswell Park. I've already got a berth there, from last year when I wanted a second opinion on some CAR T trials at the U of Virginia. BTW, that trial would be great for HER2+ patients. Not so much for HER2-. Trial identifier: NCT03272334. I've several other trials identified. I'm not the most popular girl at the party, as I am extensively pretreated, but the ones that could go, I'm putting in for. I am hoping that by tomorrow, my brain will have rebooted and I might be able to think again. Goals are: 1. Figure out what to beg for should the Gemzar/Carbo not do all that was planned. 2. Pull all strings available/Get second opinion arranged. 3. Arrange 30 minutes of vigorous pouting, then call it a day on that sort of thing. Frankly, I'd rather blast Sandi Patti, and make a joyful noise, etc. Golly. I have just run out of steam. Going to go to sleep now. Forgive any errors - I know there will be tons.

      "Content": "blainejennifer wrote: I was going to put this in the liver mets thread, but it is more than that. In the past week, my Mom died. She was 99 and went peacefully, but my sister didn't let me know because she was angry at my brothers. It is a long complex story, but the shortest version is that she was my Mom's caregiver and guardian, and my brothers have not helped at all. I used to before the Stage 4 diagnosis, but traveling got difficult, and only made it out there twice in the past five years. But, I stayed in touch. Mom had dementia, for twenty years, so my sister did have a big job. Mom had enough money, but it's still hard. However you slice it, my Mom was dying, and I didn't know till three days after she passed. This morning, my son informs me that he is really tanking his first semester at college. He is smart, but has wicked ADHD. By really tanking, I mean to say that he is passing one class. Doing very well in it, but Come On. Alrightee - we knew he'd be changing his major, but I'm still not getting a full story out of him as to what - exactly - is the problem. Absences? Late work? It's not the end of the world. He is healthy, loves the campus (maybe too much, right?), and we are getting some supports in place for next semester. But, his scholarship is gone, and that is going to be an issue. Wait - there's more. For the first time in six years of treatment, I had to go to the ER last Friday because my intestines stopped working. I'd had massive over-production, from a constipation correction, and it just wouldn't stop, even when it ran out of food ammunition. Then it felt like my insides were blown up and hot, with sharp pains. This isn't normal, so off to the ER I head. They were marvelous, and I even got my favorite infusion nurse to jump over and access my port for the CAT scan and lab work. They diagnose ulcerative colitis, and put me on an antibiotic regimen. I am improving, slowly. Today, I'm supposed to get chemo (Doxil, 8th round), but my MO calls to say that there is significant liver progression based on the ER's CAT scan, but he's away dealing with his mother-in-law and won't be back in the office till Friday. We will talk options then. He was comforting, and said that there were options. But, let's get real. I've been on Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Taxol, Faslodex, Letrozole/Ibrance, Xeloda, Halaven, CMF and Doxil. I am using up options. He seemed more upset about my colitis, so now I'm thinking it's got something to do with my liver, and not my Mother or Son - I do tend to take my emotions out on my innards. Here I am now, trying to keep moving forward, but the will is gone. If I died today, my son could just bundle the grief into his first semester's woes, and be ready to get at it come mid-January. I know I'm going to kick him in the fanny in the future, what with dying and all, and I hate that. My spouse would recover, and he wouldn't have to change jobs to keep from traveling so much. My brothers could pretend to grieve, and I'd go into the same plot as my Mom. How do you keep going? So many of you have been pummeled by life, and you don't surrender. For the first time in my life, I wish I had religious faith. Yes, I have taken some Ativan. I will be seeking counseling, if for nothing else than learning how to help my kid make it into adulthood. My poor husband has to deal with all this, and show up happy and productive at work. He is amazing. ER/PR+, HER2-, Grade 3. Stage 4, July 2012.

And, frankly, my hip has been achy, and it wakes me up at night. Have any of you out there squeezed the juice out of a protocol with this maneuver? Should I be agitating for a treatment change? One thing I will be asking MO tomorrow is if this is a good time to get a bone biopsy before radiation begins. I've had no biopsy for Stage 4, just imaging.

Got those zapped, 15 sessions, and it seems to have been helping. Then, two weeks ago, some of my liver values popped up, AST and ALT. So, I am gently slid, burrito style, into the PET/CT scan to see what is what. Progression is what that is. Diffuse progression, so there is no clearly defined target to aim for. Gulp. Due to some compulsive reading, I know this is scary. If your liver can't process chemo, the liver can fail trying. If I don't respond to Gemzar/Carboplatin, I'll start hearing words like \"comfort care\" and \"hospice\". I'm not crazy. I know that I won't last forever on treatment, but I need two more years to see my child graduate from college. I'm sure God is busily putting that in their calculations - \"Oh, that's right. Jennifer needs two more years for her one kid. Perhaps I'll take it from this lady over here, the one in Yemen who has a three hour walk for treatment, if the clinic is open, that is.\" Luckily, the menfolk are out of the house. DS is back at college. DH is doing his thing in NYC. So, I can undulate around the house for a few days, crying to expunge the sorrow, and to get my mental fanny in gear. Does anyone have advice as to what the heck to do? I will be seeking a second opinion at Roswell Park. I've already got a berth there, from last year when I wanted a second opinion on some CAR T trials at the U of Virginia. BTW, that trial would be great for HER2+ patients. Not so much for HER2-. Trial identifier: NCT03272334. I've several other trials identified. I'm not the most popular girl at the party, as I am extensively pretreated, but the ones that could go, I'm putting in for. I am hoping that by tomorrow, my brain will have rebooted and I might be able to think again. Goals are: 1. Figure out what to beg for should the Gemzar/Carbo not do all that was planned. 2. Pull all strings available/Get second opinion arranged. 3. Arrange 30 minutes of vigorous pouting, then call it a day on that sort of thing. Frankly, I'd rather blast Sandi Patti, and make a joyful noise, etc. Golly. I have just run out of steam. Going to go to sleep now. Forgive any errors - I know there will be tons.

He's 86, and was in fabulous health and living independently. Soon after admit, his heart kicked up a bit, stabilized, but he'd already been put on a ventilator as he couldn't get his oxygen sats into the 90's. Then he got renal failure. That was Monday. As of today, his heart and lungs have recovered and are stable, but he is still in renal failure and still ventilated. He had made it very clear in his medical directive that he didn't want to persist under extraordinary medical care. He lost two wives to ALS (Cleveland area, Great Lakes cyanobacteria, whole other story), so he's well aware of what living compromised is like. His kids fear that he is sliding down the slippery slope from temporary ventilator support to the ventilator keeping him alive. Which he didn't want. And you know how it is in ICU. The hospitalist is encouraged that he recovered heart and lung function. The nephrologist is very dour. The infection specialist is worried about his continued low platelet count - that's why he can't be put on dialysis. What I'm asking for is some real world advise/experience on his recovery. If it is possible that he will recover with some quality of life, his kids are going to keep pushing. But, if it looks like he'll be intensely medicalized for the rest of his life, his kids realize that they are going to have to respect his clear medical directive for no extraordinary measures. Me personally? I so much want him to live - in whatever manner. I know it's selfish and venal, and doesn't take into account his desires. He's Very Catholic, and death would be a promotion for him.

When I was first diagnosed, the best part was that it brought my brothers and I closer. Previous to the dx, we had grown apart as they all live in Texas, and I don't. Up until this year, I visited them every year (weekly chemo clipped my wings). My little brother visits me once a year when a business trip brings him close, and my big brother has never really had the funds to go travelling. Now, I'm Stage 4, and after a small flurry of interest, my brothers have tapped out. Phone calls - nope. Emails - not so much. I call and email, but get crickets in return. They got together for Thanksgiving and didn't even call me. Jeez - I'm crying as I write this. They did the same thing to my Mom as she was dying, but they'd always had a problematic relationship with her. I wasn't expecting they'd treat me the same way. I know I should tell them how I feel, but I want to do it without blubbing. It's not like they ever paid a whole bunch of attention to me, but the Thanksgiving thing got me. How have you guys handled family? BTW, I've had one lovely friend through out treatment. She plays with me like I'm normal - love that! ER/PR+, HER2-, Grade 3. Stage 4, July 2012.
