However, I had chemo in 2013 for TNBC, had AC Avery 2 weeks for 8 weeks and Neulalsta, then 11 weeks of Taxol. My hair is now more fine (thin) and weak, broken split ends...... My pony tail is tiny like a rats tail. Tried NIOXIN 4 shampoo for hair loss, made it worse and so dry. My self esteem w/o my wig is down the tubes.... I look awesome in my wig, however not so without it, look 30 yrs older, like my own grandmother. What have you done to help yourself/your hair????",
