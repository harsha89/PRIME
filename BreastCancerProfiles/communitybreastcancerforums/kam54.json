I have been super negative since rads started and fought not to have it done.  I am a double mast with ILC both sides and one positive node each side-low grade/stage 2.  My skin looks so bad and discolored with my under arms very sore and VERY red.  I am so concerned about the long term side effects and of course reconstruction will have to be the tram flap or DIEP.  So if anyone else has quit, please advise why and what your dr said.

TenderIsOurMight: Thank you for the info.  You have given me some things to think about.  I wish my radialogist would have explain the way you did.  At least now I have some knowledge to discuss with her today.  I do have some presciption cream, but it doesn't really seem to help much. I will see if there is anything else. Moj: I had an ok time with chemo, but my mental attitude towards rads is sooooo negative and I know it doesn't help not having a more positive outlook.  I am also sorry you had such a hard time through it all. You had alot of chemo and many surgeries. I am glad you are now feeling better.  My family keeps telling me it's almost over. Maxgirl:Your feelings are about the same as mine.  The minimum I think I will stop is the clavical area.  Per Tender I will discuss the amount of rads I have had there first, but I still am thinking no more because of the throat/neck area. Thanks to you all for being braver than me with rads and thank you for all your suggestions and support.",
