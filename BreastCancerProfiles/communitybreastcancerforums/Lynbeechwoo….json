I just have no one to ask and suddenly my appointment is tomorrow. I am second guessing everything now- like if there is a problem how long has it been there? Will they tell me my birad score without me asking or do you need to ask?",

The mammogram was taken and the tech said \"the radiologist would like to do the ultrasound\" so I was escorted to another waiting room with other women waiting in gowns- some were crying quietly. After about almost 2 hours the ultrasound tech came and got me- she was very kind- she did her scan quickly- told me to get dressed and that she would show the radiologist . I got dressed. And prayed again. The ultrasound tech came back in and said the radiologist said everything looks good - b9 both mammo an ultrasound. I literally asked if I could hug her and I did. I can't thank you all enough for the support and prayers. I am going to look into the mri/mbi because I do have dense breasts. Thank you for your love. Traci",

I found this board by accident. I have been touched by Benny's posts and updates about her and diamond caring for each other- egging each other on- and just silently communicating love to each other as animals and humans do. I send my love and prayers on to Benny and hope that she finds comfort in the love she shared with diamond.",
