I know there have been some clincal trials on this but haven't been able to find any results.   Thought this information might be useful for anyone having bad HFS, as always probably best to check with your Onc before trying.

I tried to get my wife to visit this site, but she doesn't want to particpate in online boards, and support groups are out of the question (she thinks they'll just depress her more).  So with your help, i'll summarize the advice I receive here and pass it along.  Log in to post a reply",

Pain meds has been another sticking point between us (she tells her friends that i'm a pill pusher), her big concern is that she doesn't want to become addicted to narcotics, i've shared with her the research that shows that when patients take narcotics for pain they rarely become addicted because the drug goes to the pain center of the brain not the pleasure center.  I don't think she's listening to me.  She also doesn't like the way the drugs make her feel (which I can understand) and she's very eager to get off narcotics so she can drive, so she can be more independant.  We've weaned her off the fentanyl patch and take dilaudid as needed...",

I think its helping, i'm starting to understand that at times she just wants to lash-out at someone or anything.  In the past I tried to fix this by being upbeat, but listening is definately better. Unfortunately she's not letting me off the hook that easily.  There are questions that come up every time she gets down/frustrated.  Why is this happening to me? (i say i don't know), How am i supposed to live mont-to-month with these serum marker tests?  (the question that started this topic).  How do I answer this last question without launching into a positive pep-talk?",

Back in January 2010, she was in a pilates ball class and fell off her ball injuring her back, but instead of getting better she got worse and worse, we thought she had a ruptured disc (her symptoms didn't seem to match bone mets, pain was constantly moving around, and it all started with the fall in class) in June we did an MRI that showed the multiple lesions on her spine and pelvis.  Her biopsy revealed ER- PR+ (10%) HER2-.  She had several weeks of radiation to her spine and hip and femur, follwed by Zometa infusions every 28 days, the onc put her back on Tamox since she \"failed\" while on Aromisan. We did 4 courses of Xeloda before the side effects got to be too severe (it was the constant diaharea not the hand/foot thing that caused the doc to take her off). Since her markers continued to fall, her PET/CT scans have shown that the disease isn't progressing, but last month her cancer markers went up for the first time since she started treatment.  I understand the markers arent perfect, but I guess its the only way to know, abscent constant scaning to know how long she can stay off a chemo treatment.  Our biggest challenge now is dealing with month-to-month issue as well as pain mgmt.  I've tried to get her on the board, I print out the posts from that amazing member who's now 18 or 19 years into bone mets and still doing great, but she gets furious at me for sharing these stories with her, telling me that i'm not facing reality and that those stories are of the \"outliers.\"  While she might be right, and in the words of our onc, this crappy disease is very heterogenous so its really unfair to look at stats.  Unfotunately we had a bad experience with a therapist back in 2000 when she was first diagnosed.  If there's anyone here from the bay area that knows of a good one please private message me.  Maybe i can convince her to give it another shot.   While this board may only be helpful to her by proxy, I spend a lot of my evening after she goes to sleep reading through everyone's post.  For some reason it gives me lots of comfort and I sincerley thank all of you for that.",
