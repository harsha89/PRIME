      "Content": "PCR wrote: This is kind of a strange situation, but a friend of mine had a one year follow up PET scan in mid-October (she was diagnosed with stage III BC, finished her treatment, except for Tamoxifen, in June), and she still has not heard the results.  She's afraid to call her oncologist, and her appointment isn't scheduled until Nov. 26 (it was originally Nov. 5 and she had her husband reschedule it). There may not be any way to know this, but would hospitals generally contact patients quicker than that if any evidence of disease was found?  Seems like there would be laws requiring governing this, but I couldn't find anything on the web. When she had the scan, they did say they would call if they needed her to come in \"right away,\" so I'm hoping the lack of news means the scan was clear. Log in to post a reply",
