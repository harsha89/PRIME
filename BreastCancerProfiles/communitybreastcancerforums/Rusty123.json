Again, thanks for the kind words and all the best to all these wonderful women. Diane",

Can anyone tell me how they did on FEC?  I start my treatment on Thursday the 19th and would really appreciate any feedback.  Also, home care is coming to my house the day after chemo to administer a Neulasta shot.  Apparently the nurse will show me how and I will have to give myself a shot 24 hours after each treatment.  Did you have to give yourself the shots? Thanks! Diane",

Are you on these meds as well?  Where are you in Ontario?   Diane",
