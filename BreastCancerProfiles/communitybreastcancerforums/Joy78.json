I  talked to my sister-in-law a little while ago and she always wants to know how I am.   I sometimes hesitate to tell her things,  as she kind of has a way of making mountains our of molehills, but I decided to let her know about this newest problem.  Right away she wanted to know if these new spots were related to \"the black spots I had in my mouth a while back\".   At first I didn't know what she was talking about, but then it hit me, that she meant the jaw bone necrosis.  After trying to get through to her that I did not have \" black spots in my mouth \" and not related to that problem at all.  She gets things mixed up a lot, and that is why I am always hesitant to mention anything to her . But, she is so good to me and has always treated me like a \"sister\" instead of an \"in-law\" and we are very close. And, this pertains to all of my  SIL's.  I was an only child, so I married into a big family and we are all close.  But, I am closer to this particular \"sister\".  Anyway, I got her straightened out.   I know most of my family truly don't understand my whole medical history and it just seems like too much trouble to go into trying to explains everything.  Even tho, my family are very supportive, I don't think they fully understand everything.  And, I just have a tendency to kind of keep things to myself.  Just gets tiring trying to make people understand things.  I think the fact that most people, when they hear \"CANCER\", they right away think the worst..  And, that is sure not the case.  We all are just \"living with Cancer\".   The general public just doesn't realize what treatments are available and how far the medical field is advancing every single day. I had a nurse tell me that there are so many new drugs and treatments coming out every day. I remember reading that eventually, cancer will be treated as a chronic disease, just like Diabetes or Heart Disease.  I have a great little pamphlet that I picked up in the doctor's office called \"Guide to Metastatic Cancer....Moving forward with hope. It is a Health Monitor Network publication.  It is just so encouraging to read.  I have rattled on enough.  It is still snowing to \"beat the band\".. At times, I cannot hardly see out the window.   Not sure how much we are supposed to get this time.  Glad I am staying put, all bundled up in my nice warm, fleece robe.  Am reading a good book on my Kindle so will get some lunch and then curl up with my book. Have a good day. Joy",

Cyber KNife greatly reduced the size of the lesion and I have had relatively minor back pain all along,  Ever since I had the first surgery back in 2006 , I had difficulty walking and still have to use a walker.  But, I feel good and don't really have any big problems.  However,  last week I had a PET scan, which I have been getting every six months.  Have not had any problems except for the lesion that they have been watching all along.  However, my oncologist called me in for an appointment today and told me that the PET scan showed 2 liver mets.  He has stopped the Faslodex and is going to start me on a chemo pill, which I don't know the name of and also a bone injection once a month.   I had to have blood work done today after which they will order the chemo med and get back to me as to how to take it, when I need to see the doctor again, and give me an appointment for the bone injection.  Needless to say, I am a little concerned, but I don't have any symptoms of any kind right now. The  PET scan I had 6 months ago showed nothing, except for the place in my spine, which had remained stable. So, this new problem has just developed in the past 6 months.  I hope I have remembered everything, as it seems like so long that I have been dealing with cancer.. Most of the time I don't really think about it, as I have felt fine all along.  And, I still will deal with it as best as I can and try not to worry too much about it.  I will be 81 in May and outside of the cancer,  I am pretty healthy and still take care of my own place and do for myself. I try to keep as active as I can.  Have difficulty walking really slows me down..   My blood work is good.  My tumor marker number went down almost to normal  (41)  after the last Cyber Knife treatments. I have blood work done every 3 months and the number has been going up a couple points the last couple times I had the blood work.  Last time it was 51,  which I know isn't that bad.  I have been reading some of the postings here about the liver mets.  I still have a lot more to read.  But, I do feel encouraged by what I have read.  As I told my son today,  I feel very fortunate to have done as well as I have over the past 8 + years and I am realistically aware that I know I will eventually die from all of this.  But, I have real good doctors and trust them.  I have to see the orthopedic surgeon on Monday and am anxious to hear what he has to say.  Sorry for the long post, but I wanted to try to include everything up to this recent dx.  I plan on coming back here a lot just for the information that I can find out about  and to get some encouragement.    Joy",

The nurse navigator called me today and got all my prescription information and I will be getting Xeloda.  She had to get in touch with the pharmacy company as it has to come from a special source.  Not all pharmacies stock it.   I think she said 3 pills twice a day for 2 or 3 weeks,(not sure about that) and then off a week.   I found a thread on this site about different ones who have been on it and a lot of information about it.  I also found a site with a lot of testimonials and it sounds like it is very successful.   Lots of side effects, tho.   The main one that most people mentioned is the hand and foot dryness, peeling, redness and general soreness.  And, diarrhea was another one.  Most of the others were the general s/e of most of the treatments.  The diarrhea will be the one that will worry me the most.  When I get nervous, I usually will have it.  Then, I worry about getting somewhere and having an accident and that starts a  vicious circle.  LOL Someone mentioned to get in a stock of Immodium.   But, the nurse was very nice and said she would go over everything with me when I get the medicine. I also have a transportation problem.  But, she also told me that that can be worked out also.  I have wonderful family support, but do have a hard time arranging rides to doctor's appointments. Blood work I can have done on Sat. mornings with no problems with getting a ride.  My oldest son's wife has her own business and she can get off most of the time, but there are times when it isn't a good time for her during rush times.There is a county bus that I can get at certain times, but doesn't always work out with the scheduling of my appointments. But, my 2 daughter-in-laws have told me that it will all work out.   So, I do  feel a little less stressed tonight. The doctor had also mentioned an injection of a bone supplement.  And the nurse told me that would be Xegeva.   A few years ago, after I was on Zometa for a long time, I got that jaw bone necrosis and that is when I was put on the Faslodex.  They had mentioned Xegeva at the time, but it also causes the jaw bone necrosis.  So, I mentioned that to the nurse and she said she would have to talk to the doctor and see what he says about that.  I live in Central Maryland, about 30 miles west of Baltimore, and they are calling for more snow tomorrow.  Today, it never got out of the teens as far as the temperature goes.  They are predicting a pretty good amount of snow.  I am so sick of the cold and the snow.   My son and I were supposed to go visit my 2 little great-grand daughters this afternoon and take them all out for supper, but it was just too cold to take the girls out and for me, also.  I was so disappointed as I have not seen them since Christmas.  They live about an hour from me.  The oldest one is 2 1/2 and the baby is almost 3 months.  They are so cute.  Hope everyone will have a good week end.
