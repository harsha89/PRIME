God never gives us more than we can deal with. My attitude has always been ok, I'll deal with it and everything will be fine. Now 6 years later, it is and I'm cancer free. If you go into anything expecting a problem, you'll usually have one. My stage 3 breast cancer was located on right side only, however, number of lymph nodes involved was unknown. Surgeon removed all of them and testing showed cancer was present in all but 3. My instructions to the surgeon \"get rid of the cancer - I don't want it\". Are your physicians MD's and board certified for their specialized area of medicine? Know who you are placing your trust.",
