My onc says that it is \"bad medicene\" to have them done because of the false positive results and that they are expensive to do.  First of all, Im paying for it. And second of all, I need the peace of mind that treatment is/has done what it should. How do you get past this point?  I hate thinking that every little ache is the cancer coming back, but tired of dwelling on it.  I just think if there is something there......I want it out NOW.

I finished chemo in November and radiation in January since that time I have cut my hair four times.  I really got use to the \"sassy/kick butt\" attitude that I get from my short hair style.  It is about an inch long now and black as black can be.  Each time I cut it there was probably 1/2 an inch cut off.  So yes, it will grow back.  Think of it as only being hair.....life has greater value.  But this is a decision that you can only make. I say go for it.......................come jump on the sassy bus with me. Hugs, Cindy",

I had mastectomy last April, chemo from May to Nov. then rads until mid January.  Never broke down through any of it until about a month ago.  On tamoxifin since the first of February.  Coming here and hearing from others is the best thing I could have done.  You can tell which forums to read on which days.  If you are feeling down.....dont read the ones that will upset you.  I was able to work through my 2 week funk that I was in from support of family and friends and this board. Go to the American Cancer society webpage and sign up for \"reach to recovery\"  they will match you with someone to talk to.  Join any support groups that are in your area.............I have nothing due to the fact that I live in the sticks of Wisconsin and that is why I frequent the boards. If you do not reguarly exercise........start now.  My job is very active and we live on a dairy farm, so I thought that was enough.  ITS NOT!  Nothing better than a walk to clear your thoughts and stress.  Wish someone would have told me that sooner and I could have avoided some of the tention. Be sure to tell your onc of any medication that your primary doc puts you on.  I was put on an antidepresant that would weaken the effect of the tamoxifin.  Luckly I had only taken one.......Now Im on nothing except for an occational alprazolam for anxiety attacks.
