      "Content": "rock wrote: July 31, 2008 Amgen Told to Reword Drug Label By ANDREW POLLACK The Food and Drug Administration has ordered Amgen to change the labels for its flagship anemia drugs in a way that could further restrict their use in treating patients with cancer. The move, which the F.D.A. announced on Wednesday, represents the first time the agency has invoked authority under a 2007 law that empowered it to order changes in a drug's prescribing information. Previously, the F.D.A. could only negotiate with a drug's manufacturer to change the label. Sales of the drugs, Aranesp and Procrit, have already plummeted in the last year because of studies suggesting that their use to treat the anemia caused by chemotherapy could actually make cancer worse or shorten lives. Procrit is manufactured by Amgen but sold under license by Johnson & Johnson. Sales of Aranesp, generally considered Amgen's flagship product, fell 13 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, to $825 million, the company announced Monday in posting its quarterly results. In the United States alone, sales plunged 26 percent, to $427 million. Yaron Werber, a biotechnology analyst at Citi Investment Research, estimated that the new label could reduce the use of Aranesp for cancer patients in this country - the drug is also used by people with kidney disease - by an additional 40 percent, further cutting annual sales by about $264 million. Despite the concerns about the drug, sales of Aranesp and Amgen's overall financial results were better than Wall Street expected in the second quarter. That, plus the positive result of a clinical trial for a new bone drug, lifted Amgen shares this week. Shares of Amgen rose 2 cents, to $62.30 Wednesday, near their 52-week high. Amgen said in a statement Wednesday that the new label was consistent with its expectations and that it had already factored the impact of the label change into updated financial guidance it provided to investors on Monday. Johnson & Johnson said it would cooperate with the F.D.A. in using the new label. Its sales of Procrit and a similar drug, Eprex, dropped 14 percent worldwide in the second quarter, to $652 million, and fell 23 percent in the United States to $346 million. Because the company is larger and more diversified than Amgen, the sales of any one drug tend not to have as large an impact on its financial performance. The new labels will say that treatment with the drugs should not begin until a patient's hemoglobin drops to 10 grams per deciliter of blood. And language is being removed that seemed to imply that it was safe to continue treating patients until their hemoglobin rose to 12 grams per deciliter. Hemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying component of blood and is at low levels in people with anemia, causing problems like fatigue. There are no accepted theories yet on why high doses of the anemia drugs seem to make cancer worse. The new labels also say the drugs should not be used if the chemotherapy is being given to cure patients, rather than to extend their lives. While that would be left to a doctor to judge, it would very likely apply, for instance, to so-called adjuvant therapy, in which chemotherapy is used after a tumor is removed by surgery in hopes of preventing cancer from coming back. When cancer is advanced, chemotherapy is often not considered curative. However, the new labels will not advise against use of the drugs for all patients with breast cancer or head and neck cancer. An advisory panel to the F.D.A. in March had called for such an advisory, because the drugs' risks seemed to be stronger for those two types of cancer. One effect of the label changes could be to make it less likely that Medicare would loosen reimbursement policies for the drugs. Amgen and many oncologists have been trying to get Medicare to amend a policy in which it will not pay for use of the drugs if hemoglobin is above 10. In their arguments, the company and doctors pointed to the drugs' labels, which seemed to suggest that the F.D.A. thought that a hemoglobin level of up to 12 was safe. But now the F.D.A. has also adopted the 10 gram level for initiating cancer therapy, and mention of 12 grams has been removed from the label. Dr. Richard Pazdur, director of the F.D.A.'s oncology drug office, said that the mention of the level of 12 was confusing people, making them think hemoglobins up to 12 were safe when, in fact, the safety is unknown. \"We felt people interpreted this as an upper safety limit,\" he said in an interview Wednesday. He said a hemoglobin level of 8 to 9, just high enough to avoid blood transfusions, was appropriate, though the new labels do not state a specific figure. The labels for the drugs have already been changed a few times since new safety concerns arose early last year. The F.D.A. and Amgen have been negotiating the latest changes since the advisory committee in March recommended further restrictions on use of the drugs. While the company and the agency agreed on most language, there were some points on which they could not reach agreement, Dr. Pazdur said. That prompted the F.D.A. to invoke its new authority to order the changes, he said. Amgen had wanted the label to give doctors discretion to initiate therapy before hemoglobin levels dropped to 10 in patients who could not tolerate that degree of anemia. And it wanted mention of the 12 gram upper limit for stopping therapy. Dx 1/12/2008, IDC, 1cm, Grade 3, 1/5 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I hope to have ovaries removed in next few months because a) the operation should be pretty straightforward with a quick recovery time and b) will reduce my chances of my ER+ cancer recurring or developing a new primary. For me, two key factors in MY decision (just me, just the way I think! Not recommending this way of thinking to anyone else!) not to have masectomies were the fact that one, I am just not in the mood to go through major surgery and reconstruction -- I want to get ON with my life right now. Two, I'm still relatively young (43) and single and frankly, I like my (perfectly ordinary) breasts the way they are. It might sound a bit odd to other people, but I want to enjoy my intact breasts for a few more years, especially since I might have to let them go at some point. I realize that since I don't have kids, this is probably not very helpful to you. When I got my BRCA2 results, the gene counselor gave me the name of a therapist that I could see who specialized in women making decisions like ours. ( I didn't take her up on it, but I might at a later point.) You might find a conversation with a similarly specialized therapist helpful to you as you sort through all the factors that would go into your decisions about whether or not to have your ovaries removed, whether to have another masectomy, the timing of each of these IF you decided to have them done, etc.  I'm a big believer in not feeling rushed to act, of not acting out of a sense of fear or pressure. Frankly, sometimes I think oncos are a bit too casual and hasty with the \"Get rid of the breasts!\" approach to breast cancer.  I've had these breasts all my life, thank you very much. If they really DO have to go, I'd like to tell 'em good bye first, you know?! Take good care, Colleen. PS I am sorry that your husband left you for someone else. Ow. That would be really hard. A guyfriend of a half dozen years took a hike partway through chemo. Not thrilled about that, but that's life.But for what it's worth -- I'm going through this with the support of my friends (and my family, who are far away) and it's been OKAY.  ",

I called my gene counselor and was reminded that (I hope I have this right): My BRCA2+ status does not influence my risk of recurrence; my risk of recurrence is similar to other women who do not have the gene mutation.  And, lumpectomy+chemo+rads and masectomy are about the same. My risk of a new primary (i.e., in other breast), however, is about 2-3%/year for the next 10-15 years.  That's probably a high estimate, because it doesn't take into account me having my ovaries out or taking Tamoxifen. It also is based on shakier information than it seems, because the research and follow-up is really not there to state these things definitively. FInally, she mentioned that different countries have different rates of masectomies. One possibile explanation is that surgeons may vary in how often and emphatically they recommend masectomies, ranging from  PRO-MASECTOMY (in countries like the Netherlands and Germany) to NOT-SUCH-FANS of MASECTOMY (in France).  I thought that was interesting.  ",

I had the BRCA counseling and test after I was diagnosed because of my family history (Mom with premenopausal BC, maternal aunt with ovarian). I was naive. It's a rare mutation (fewer than 1 in 800 women of Irish-German descent; only around 10% of women with breast cancer). I didn't even realize that non Ashkenazi Jewish people were at risk for the mutation until after I got cancer! Before I was diagnosed, it was recommended that I get a baseline 10 years earlier than my Mom's age when she was diagnosed (i.e., 30). I then had regular mammograms. After I was diagnosed w/ bc, I had a lumpectomy. Later, I underwent counseling and tested positive for BRCA2 mutation. Now that I know my gene status, my nieces (and sisters, cousins, etc.) all know that they need to be vigilant per the guidance offered at facingourrisk.org. I would also like to note that gene COUNSELING is really important, to decide whether or not it makes sense to be tested and if so, to decide whether or not you want to be tested.  Post-result counseling also matters.  So I would urge people to really take the COUNSELING part of the gene counseling seriously and have it done by trained and experienced gene COUNSELORS.  No shortcuts!

I'm still very comfortable with my decision to have a lumpectomy. If I have a recurrence or a new primary, I might re-evaluate that but right now? I'm just not of the mind to have masectomies and all that that involves.  I probably will have my ovaries removed, though, to reduce some risk.  I wouldn't normally rush to have that done except that I will be leaving the country in January and would like recovery well underway. The gene counseling folks at Mem Sloan-Kettering (where I'm being treated) seemed fine with my decision and my rationale behind it. My onco was less enthusiastic, but still largely supportive. She made it clear that if I get cancer again, she will push me to have a masectomy or two. I am just not wild about surgeries and reconstruction blah blah blah.  If it means a shorter lifespan, FINE. I really want to resume my life as best I can, if possible. I'm going ahead with radiation because even if bc does come around again, I was never that wild about the idea of implants.  Down the road I might look back and wish I'd made a different decision. But then again, I think I will take heart in knowing that I made a decision that was based on how I felt and what I knew at the time, not on fear or pressure. LIke Linda, I think very highly of my gene counselor.  The hours I spent with YK before and after I was tested were some of the most rewarding of this whole experience. I hope everyone finds a decision they can be at peace with.  And daughters, Irun and always? It is corny (and I am not normally this sappy) but I would give you both a hug if I could. I have the benefit of about 20 years more experience making these big-ass decisions.  And they are still hard. I am struck by your resourcefulness, clearheaded-ness and poise.

(Sorry to state the obvious.)  If it were me, and having my scalp show through was going to be my \"new normal,\" I would have a tough time adapting. I had a neighbor in NYC with very thin hair but then she got hair weaves and looked absolutely FANTASTIC.  It was a very natural look and she was very happy with them. I don't know anything about them, how long they last, how expensive they are, etc. but maybe it is something to consider? Of course, that is not to say that you should rush out and cover your exposed scalp. There is something to be said for self-acceptance, after all. But if \"rocking the exposed scalp\" is not your thing, well, who is to judge?! Maybe -- and as with this entire post, feel free to ignore this!! -- it is important to do something before what is happening on your head turns you into someone you don't want to be, e.g., insecure and self-conscious.  \"Do something\" might mean deciding that it just doesn't matter anymore or looking into hair weaves or taking up horseback riding or something else that helps give you back the vibrance that maybe you feel you've lost.  Anyway, this whole post can be boiled down to: \"I'm sorry you're going through this and I wish I had something useful to offer, I really do.\"  You take care.",

(I took biotin when I dropped a TV on my toe a few years ago; my podiatrist said then that about 50% of his patients respond to biotin.) A couple random thoughts for the newly- or about-to-be bald: Re: comfort.  I sprayed Aveda toner on my head and slept on a flannel pillowcase.  Also, a friend's mom knit me these little stocking caps w/ very fine, soft yarn. I carted one around everywhere during the summer (infusion and examination rooms can be chilly) and now I sleep with one because the fall air freezes my head.  Those caps were one of the kindest and sweetest gestures... It is a funny thing: Not everyone will lose their hair or lose all of their hair!  Women on A/C usually do; I understand that women on CMF may experience hair thinning.  I was on A/C and lost 80% of my hair but had some sparse stubble throughout the whole experience.  One of my friends didn't seem to lose much hair at all (she was on different drugs).  Everybody's different. People just starting chemo: If you haven't already, consider finding/joining an \"October 2008 chemo\" group. It can be a wonderful source of support and practical info.  Also, my \"May 2008\" had quite an extensive discussion of hair loss and other issues.  Most of us at one point or another posted photos of ourselves bald.  Among our many fine qualities, we were a very pro-bald group!

Perhaps because I am a bit of a weirdo.) I was relieved that the eyebrow-less phase didn't last long. It was starting to get to me. OH! An observation and a question: Observation: I had been using brownish powder to draw in my eyebrows but when they  started to come back, I had to switch to a charcoal color.  In fact, my hair is coming in this charcoal color. Will my hair eventually revert to being brown again? Or am I going to be charcoal (and gray) for the rest of my days?",

Toward the end, I started to respond by saying: \"Why? I think I look okay bald, don't you?\" or \"Why? Is there something wrong with me being bald?\" I will not hold my breath to find out whether the sample bottle of stuff worked, dear Ott. But if I'm wrong, I'll buy a bottle of the stuff myself, drink half of it, and pass along the rest! The only stuff in a bottle that might make our hair grow is Time.

I think one of the best things we can do for bald kids (and others) is encourage greater social acceptance of being bald in the first place. So go \"commando,\" \"topless,\" \"bald-bald\" in public, every now and then, if you're up for it!    http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/06/fashion/06lockside.html?sq=locks%20of%20love&st=nyt&scp=3&pagewanted=print The above is a list of organizations.  http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/06/fashion/06locks.html?sq=locks%20of%20love&st=nyt&scp=4&pagewanted=print This is an article which reports on how hair supplies exceed the demand.  EXCERPT from 2007 NY Times article:  But although charities have been highly effective at stirring the passions of donors, they have been less successful at finding a use for the mountains of hair sent to them as a result. As much as 80 percent of the hair donated to Locks of Love, the best known of the charities, is unusable for its wigs, the group says. Many people are unaware of the hair donation guidelines and send in hair that is gray, wet or moldy, too short, or too processed, some of which is immediately thrown away. Even hair that survives the winnowing may not go to the gravely ill, but may be sold to help pay for charities' organizational costs. At the headquarters of Locks of Love in Lake Worth, Fla., the hair deluge - up to 2,000 individual donations a week - can be daunting for the small staff of six employees and 10 to 15 volunteers. \"We created this monster because people get so much from it,\" said Madonna Coffman, the president of Locks of Love. \"They get the attention. They get a warm and fuzzy feeling. They feel they're going to help a child.\" *******",

Noelle, I am happy your kitten came home.  There is something about you keeping an eye out that reminds me a lot of my mom, and I mean that as a form of the highest praise.  For all you've got on your plate, you still have room/time to worry about a kitten. That's pretty cool. Jacki -- HURRAY FOR CARTS. Re: \"hips separating from [my] body.\"  That is an excellent description; I have had moments of that. I feel like a marionette, trying not to put weight on any of my leg bones.  Good for you for giving the cart a spin. There is no award for sucking up the most pain. Your energy could be a lot better spent on living, rather than coping with pain. Angels, my results took about 6 weeks but my sisters only took 2-3 weeks because they were able to test for a very specific mutation (2, actually).  Is it helpful or thoughtless for me to observe that -- waiting for results SUCKS, but the reality is that we are what we are, and the waiting doesn't change that.  I would not wish the mutation on anyone but the reality is that people have lived with the mutations for years, w/o knowing a mutation even existed.  I wouldn't want us to lose sight of that.  When in doubt, live life fully.  Speaking of which:  Yoohoo, Sue? Results, dear? Karin? (My friend is doing well. As she pointed out, they have to use a lot of drugs during the surgery to make sure the  pain doesn't restore a person to consciousness.  But one cannot spend the next 7 weeks unconscious, so she is on heavy pain meds.  Still, it is good to see her and she looks and sounds very strong.) Jean:  I'm thinking of you as you face the first holiday without your mom. I am awfully sorry about that. I've got to call it a night.  You guys are sweethearts re: the book. It'll be out in paperback in a year or so. Maybe I can bring you copies when we schedule our inevitable rendezvous? I'll send you info on the book when I send my xmas cards, I promise. But frankly, when one compares the Book to the May Sisters . . . . well, there is no comparison.",

Colonoscopies are the new mammogram, apparently.  I have an appointment for an exam and consult (involving two enemas) on Thursday.  The colonoscopy will follow on December 23rd.

Gracie, Jen, Nicole and everyone else who is getting tests or waiting for results -- keep us posted!!!!! And as you hop on the table or slide into the tube, know that we're with you.  (Otter, while I am not thrilled about having to have a colonoscopy, I honest-to-god thought of you as soon as my onco brought it up, and I felt comforted immediately.  I know that \"colonoscopy, thought of you\" does not sound like a compliment of the highest order, but I swear it is.)  Peeps:  Holiday cards.  I'll love 'em if I get 'em. But I also would be honored if you didn't send me one because I would know that you knew I'd understand if you didn't.  (Did that make sense? Kind of like when someone is a good enough friend that I don't clean my apartment -- much -- before they come over.)  I bet a lot of us feel that way. WE ARE A NO-GUILT, ANYTHING GOES SISTERHOOD.  (Could you throw that in our by-laws, Kristy?!) Enormous hugs to all of you. ",

I'm just worried about there being \"one more thing\" I didn't see coming at a time when I might be sliding toward the end of a frayed rope w/o the wherewithall to tie a knot. I THINK what's happening is that Christmas is making me feel like a loser. I did ZERO shopping and the only cards I sent were the ones to you all (and I still need to send out cards to three of you tomorrow!).  I half-decorated my tree and then I gave up.

I LOVE field trips.  Eyebrows are wonderful things.  Ditto for being appreciated and cut slack. Cris -- Are you getting some good gene counseling? I am like a rabid dog on the point of counseling. It scares the bejeezus out of me to think there are women who are being told they have the gene mutation without having had the benefit of good counseling before they are tested. I know sometimes counseling is just not the option but if it IS an option, please take it!!!! (I'm BRCA2+. My family's results -- mostly + for the mutation, so much for the 50/50 crap! -- continue to stream in. I thank God a couple times a week I had really top-flight counseling. Gene mutations: The gift that keeps on giving.)   Randie: I struggled for awhile because I don't want to say \"Yeah, Randie, listen to your body...hit pause on chemo...\" and then later come to find out that that pause shortened your life in a significant way. But! I just couldn't imagine a scenario where I could see frogmarching you to a chemo that you feel like you are too D.A.T. to endure right now. UNLESS UNLESS UNLESS there is a reason that this break would be really lousy timing, i.e., a critical point in getting on top of the mets, even a short break would result in trillions more cancer cells. (I am making that scenario up, obviously. But you get my drift.)  You KNOW I support you in whatever you do. I really do respect that it is your body, your life, your decision. But if I\"m really honest, I hope that you're thinking of a \"pause\" rather than a stop to chemo.  Or maybe considering consulting another oncologist to see what other options you might have.  One more thing: I once had a friend who was very very ill with AIDS. He and his partner wanted me to support them in their decision to kill my friend (not help them with it, just support them in their decision). And I told them, \"You know, there may come a time for that. And when that time comes, I'm there for you 100%. But right now? I don't feel like it's that bad yet, that we're 'there' yet. I think you're just really tired of being in the hospital and feeling like sh*t. So no, I can't get behind the suicide plans right now.\" (I have taken care of a lot of people who died of AIDS. So my objection wasn't coming completley out of nowhere.) That was 2002. Greg is alive and very healthy.  Of course, it could've turned out very differently. Maybe Greg would have gone on to have a lousy couple weeks before dying and my withholding of supportwould have made a hard situation even harder.  ** * * * * * * Okay, so this is a pretty obnoxious post. But I don't have the energy to re-word it into something less over-bearing.  I hope the concern comes through, though, and the unconditional love.  Because it's felt. It really is.",

I am expecting a whole lot of nothing.Also, I might have some lymphedema in my breast.  Or maybe it is just residual swelling from radiation.   (Or maybe the non-bc breast has just shrunk a lot.) Anyone else with a bc-breast that is twice the size of the other?   Linda: My mom was diagnosed with diabetes last year.  She changed her diet, picked up the exercise and is on some drug that made her drop 50 pounds (she probably only had 25 pounds to spare so it is really odd to see her as a petite person -- she now wears TWO foobs even though she only had one masectomy).   What am I trying to say?  That I'm sorry to hear of her diagnosis, but I know at least one person, i.e., Mom, who is managing pretty well a year out.",

Have missed you guys tons but I have had an unbelievably wonderful time.  In addition to the \"business\" part of the trip, I went swimming yesterday in the 90+ degree heat and have seen loads of friends. A friend's partner -- who doesn't even know me --- grilled me filet mignon and made me this exquisite pound cake w/ homemade strawberry ice cream, peach slices and a berry glaze (he's a pastry chef).  The kindness, the food, the company . . . it made me cry. The only hitch in the trip (aside from the fire trucks and the heat) has been that I developed these spasms/involuntary contractions in my upper right back. It looked like I was recoiling with revulsion which socially, is more than a little problematic. At first, I wasn't even sure it was happening but on Tuesday, they were happening a couple (dozens of?) times an hour. I called my doc and she said it was probably a side effect of the Neulasta. Anyway, I've been taking it easy since which seems to have helped. Wish I had time or energy to post more, but I don't.  Again, you have all been in my thoughts almost continuously these last few days.  If you get a chance to go for a dip in a pool or a swimming hole (and I mean a REAL one), I strongly urge you to do it.  Paddling in 80 degree water on a 95 degree day felt like I was bathing at Lourdes.  Much love, rock.",

That is not bragging. It is simply stating the reality and recognizing that (my whining aside), I'm incredibly fortunate. I do not know what I would do if the situation were otherwise. Actually, I suspect I do know. I probably would not set my life aside, not on a long-term basis, anyway.  I spent the first 20 years of my life trying to escape that area.  I could not move back there.   Until recently, there were two (effectively single) people in my building who are not capable of taking care of themselves but also refused to acknowledge their need for help. Who were they counting on to make sure they had food, medicine, etc.? My wonderful 84-year-old neighbor Pam, which, to be honest, pisses me off.  (Fortunately, one neighbor has since moved into an assisted care setting where she is much happier and less isolated. A second continues to live his Collier-brother existence, but without Pam trekking to the store for him.) I don't know where I'm going with this. Other than to say the word \"patriarchy\" probably belongs in this discussion somewhere and I think self-sacrifice is mightily over-rated (helping out? yes. But giving up my happiness/life for another person? hmmmm.  Yeah, I know how bad that makes me sound.) These posts have helped turn a corner, tho. My mom is in a position to still be a mom to me (e.g., travel, comfort). That is an incredible privilege. To be going through this AND to be looking after other people (kids, hubbies, wives, parents)...  Honest, guys. I apologize. And not just for the rambling.  ",

I ate like a pig.  Good times.  Glad I took advantage of the steroid-y energy. Plus, I felt that a celebration was in order, re: chemo. Linda -- where do you find biotene for less than $16?? (then again, I buy it buy the 10 gallon bucket.)  And where are you at with the treatments? Adrienne:  So, after my \"3rd-ish\" Taxol (2 DD plus 2-3 others), my WBC is 3.1 (I'm back on Neulasta); my hemoglobin is 9.3 and my red blood cells are 3.03. (And advice for raising my HGB? you, of the rising hemoglobin?!)  Sue: Pole-dance, pole-dance, fedora fedora! (How are you doing? How is the nest?) Noelle, I am probably going to say something in the \"dumb things people say\" realm and I apologize. But I want you to know that I'm really grateful to you (and Otter) and all the women who stick around after chemo is finished.  I feel like you're ahead of us on the road, and you're running back to us to say, \"Okay, here's what lies ahead.\" and that is incredibly helpful and reassuring to me.  I only wish I could reciprocate. For me, most of the stupid stuff people say falls in the category of somehow trying to tell me how I should feel. Luck, relieved, \"done\", \"cured,\" \"positive\" etc.  I actually told someone today that if she had lost her job, got a divorce or was in a car accident, it was not likely that someone would immediately respond \"Be positive!\" so I think people should think twice before laying that load on a person with bc.  Them's my two cents. Did I mention I'm back on DD Taxol? And that I drank prosecco with friends tonight? Wish you were here, guys.  But you actually were.  smooches.",

      "Content": "Aug 1, 2008 01:51AM rock wrote: Amgen Told to Reword Drug Label The Food and Drug Administration has ordered Amgen to change the labels for its flagship anemia drugs in a way that could further restrict their use in treating patients with cancer. The move, which the F.D.A. announced on Wednesday, represents the first time the agency has invoked authority under a 2007 law that empowered it to order changes in a drug's prescribing information. Previously, the F.D.A. could only negotiate with a drug's manufacturer to change the label. Sales of the drugs, Aranesp and Procrit, have already plummeted in the last year because of studies suggesting that their use to treat the anemia caused by chemotherapy could actually make cancer worse or shorten lives. Procrit is manufactured by Amgen but sold under license by Johnson & Johnson. Sales of Aranesp, generally considered Amgen's flagship product, fell 13 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, to $825 million, the company announced Monday in posting its quarterly results. In the United States alone, sales plunged 26 percent, to $427 million. Yaron Werber, a biotechnology analyst at Citi Investment Research, estimated that the new label could reduce the use of Aranesp for cancer patients in this country - the drug is also used by people with kidney disease - by an additional 40 percent, further cutting annual sales by about $264 million. Despite the concerns about the drug, sales of Aranesp and Amgen's overall financial results were better than Wall Street expected in the second quarter. That, plus the positive result of a clinical trial for a new bone drug, lifted Amgen shares this week. Shares of Amgen rose 2 cents, to $62.30 Wednesday, near their 52-week high. Amgen said in a statement Wednesday that the new label was consistent with its expectations and that it had already factored the impact of the label change into updated financial guidance it provided to investors on Monday. Johnson & Johnson said it would cooperate with the F.D.A. in using the new label. Its sales of Procrit and a similar drug, Eprex, dropped 14 percent worldwide in the second quarter, to $652 million, and fell 23 percent in the United States to $346 million. Because the company is larger and more diversified than Amgen, the sales of any one drug tend not to have as large an impact on its financial performance. The new labels will say that treatment with the drugs should not begin until a patient's hemoglobin drops to 10 grams per deciliter of blood. And language is being removed that seemed to imply that it was safe to continue treating patients until their hemoglobin rose to 12 grams per deciliter. Hemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying component of blood and is at low levels in people with anemia, causing problems like fatigue. There are no accepted theories yet on why high doses of the anemia drugs seem to make cancer worse. The new labels also say the drugs should not be used if the chemotherapy is being given to cure patients, rather than to extend their lives. While that would be left to a doctor to judge, it would very likely apply, for instance, to so-called adjuvant therapy, in which chemotherapy is used after a tumor is removed by surgery in hopes of preventing cancer from coming back. When cancer is advanced, chemotherapy is often not considered curative. However, the new labels will not advise against use of the drugs for all patients with breast cancer or head and neck cancer. An advisory panel to the F.D.A. in March had called for such an advisory, because the drugs' risks seemed to be stronger for those two types of cancer. One effect of the label changes could be to make it less likely that Medicare would loosen reimbursement policies for the drugs. Amgen and many oncologists have been trying to get Medicare to amend a policy in which it will not pay for use of the drugs if hemoglobin is above 10. In their arguments, the company and doctors pointed to the drugs' labels, which seemed to suggest that the F.D.A. thought that a hemoglobin level of up to 12 was safe. But now the F.D.A. has also adopted the 10 gram level for initiating cancer therapy, and mention of 12 grams has been removed from the label. Dr. Richard Pazdur, director of the F.D.A.'s oncology drug office, said that the mention of the level of 12 was confusing people, making them think hemoglobins up to 12 were safe when, in fact, the safety is unknown. \"We felt people interpreted this as an upper safety limit,\" he said in an interview Wednesday. He said a hemoglobin level of 8 to 9, just high enough to avoid blood transfusions, was appropriate, though the new labels do not state a specific figure. The labels for the drugs have already been changed a few times since new safety concerns arose early last year. The F.D.A. and Amgen have been negotiating the latest changes since the advisory committee in March recommended further restrictions on use of the drugs. While the company and the agency agreed on most language, there were some points on which they could not reach agreement, Dr. Pazdur said. That prompted the F.D.A. to invoke its new authority to order the changes, he said. Amgen had wanted the label to give doctors discretion to initiate therapy before hemoglobin levels dropped to 10 in patients who could not tolerate that degree of anemia. And it wanted mention of the 12 gram upper limit for stopping therapy.",

I just got off the phone with \"Y\", who was my gene counselor during the process of finding out I am BRCA2+.   I had posted Karin's \"pole dance\" video to my blog. I had given the blog address to my gene counselor \"Y\" some time ago, not ever expecting her to check it out. Well, it turns out that Y reads my blog which is pretty darned cool in and of itself, but cooler still: She mentioned at the end of our conversation that she really enjoyed the pole dance video that I had posted. Moreover, she said that it had been a rough week (or couple weeks?) in her office because they were getting a lot of positive results, for BRCA and other mutations. Delivering the news was really taking a toll on their spirits.  So she emailed the pole dance video to her colleagues and they all got a much-needed laugh/some comic relief. Isn't that cool? First, can I just say that it never occurred to me how hard it must be to tell someone as part of your job that they have a gene mutation. Second, and the reason for the post, I love it that you, Karin, made a difference in people's lives that you didn't even know.  I love it when that happens.  (I gave Y an exclusive and told her about K and all of us and our planned pole dances on the last day of chemo!) (Sue? Where are you, sweety?) Sending out lots of love to all of you. PS Thanks for keeping my mom in your thoughts. And yes, Otter, Mom's gone down a similar path as your MIL, tho she did get med tx a bit earlier. She's trying her best to get well and describes Dad as an \"attentive nurse\" which is a relief.

After 1 DD Taxol, I was backed off to weekly Taxols (w/ lighter dose) for 2 weeks. At the same time as I switched to Taxol, I started taking 50 mgs of B6, only exposing my skin to cool or lukewarm water, moisturizing my hands and feet a lot (but NOT massaging), keeping my feet up at night, swapping walking and jumping rope as exercise for a stationary bike, protecting my hand, and wearing Crocs 24/7 (well, except to bed, of course!).  Now my hand has completely healed and my feet are in pretty good shape.  Most importantly to me, I was able to resume DD Taxol and finish on schedule.  My podiatrist also gave me some ointment that fortunately, I did not have to use:  Voltaren Gel. I don't know what to recommend to you, Randie, other than some measures I took that helped alleviate the symptoms or at least, prevented them from getting worse while I was on Taxol.   If it were ME (and it is not, so feel free to ignore this!), I'd probably try stuff to reduce or halt the worsening of the symptoms and not say anything to the doctor in hopes that I could finish on schedule.  If it were ME, I would not cancel any treatment.  Them's my two cents.

It's \"a sweeping novel about class, sex, and money that brings THatcher's London alive.\"  A sampling: Just in front of Nick, Lady Kimbolton was greeting the Tippers.  Lady Kmbolton's first name was Dolly, and even her close friends found ways of avoiding the natural salutation.  'Good evening, Dolly,' said Sir Maurice . . . Cracked me up.  I'm now working  my way through Golding's (Lord of the Flies fame)  Rites of Passage. It's improving my vocabulary but not quite a rollicking good read.  A sampling: I have seldom seen a face at once so daunted and so atrabilious.  He is a complete argument for the sovranty of the humours.  Say wha- huh?That Golding, such a jokester. ***** Karin. Karin, karin, karin. I'm just sitting here smiling, as happy as a pig in ... mud.  (Do you know that I now think of your posts of pigs as \"jpigs\"? Dorky, but true.)  A big welcome back (*missed you a LOT*) hug.  For what it's worth, my moods came off the rails a bit too. But I had the reassuring benefit of knowing that I was not alone, i.e., that you had struggled/were struggling too.  It helped tremendously.",

Or where can I flee from Your presence? 8 If I ascend to heaven, You are there; If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, You are there. 9 If I take the wings of the dawn, If I dwell in the remotest part of the sea, 10 Even there Your hand will lead me, And Your right hand will lay hold of me. 11 If I say, \"Surely the darkness will overwhelm me, And the light around me will be night,\" 12 Even the darkness is not dark to You, And the night is as bright as the day. Darkness and light are alike to You. 13 For You formed my inward parts; You wove me in my mother's womb. 14 I will give thanks to You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; Wonderful are Your works, And my soul knows it very well. 15 My frame was not hidden from You, When I was made in secret, And skillfully wrought in the depths of the earth; 16 Your eyes have seen my unformed substance; And in Your book were all written The days that were ordained for me, When as yet there was not one of them. 17 How precious also are Your thoughts to me, O God! How vast is the sum of them! 18 If I should count them, they would outnumber the sand. When I awake, I am still with You.  ",

I still have quite a numb patch which covers about a 5\"x5\" area, but the feeling is coming back.  Scarring (inc from radiation) can disrupt lymph flow.  So check with your doctor about this, but at the suggestion of my sister (an OT) and with the okay from my docs, I've been doing \"scar massage\" since the steri-strips came off. Nothing too fancy: When I'm hanging out watching TV,* I just put some antibiotic ointment** on my fingertips and massage the site to improve the circulation, flatten the scar itself, and reduce the cording. Firm, but nothing painful; I kind of pay attention to the way the skin feels. I think it has helped a lot and I am amazed by how much and how my body has healed! The site now feels normal save a small 1\" square that is still hard.  I like the idea of doing something nice to my increasingly beleaguered body & breast. And I swear, it isn't as weird as it might sound. See also: http://www.lymphnotes.com/article.php/id/31/  My little sister says scar therapy can often even help with \"old\" scars.  The important thing is a) to get doctors okay and b) make sure your incision has healed. * Or once, during a 500 mile late-night drive across the rural midwest! (Lucky I didn't get pulled over! \"Well you see, officer...\")  **Like many people, I'm sensitive to Vitamin E--gives me contact dermatitis.",

Today, Mom is alive, healthy, and wonderful.  (Disclosure: There was about a decade where it certainly was not a mother-daughter lovefest!) Yeah, I'd prefer neither of us had cancer. But honestly, I am so proud to be my mom's daughter.  My mom gave me a huge gift by showing me how to cope, how to be strong, how to laugh and yell and play and and work and keep going.   May none of your kids ever go through this, of course. But honestly, from my experience, I am grateful, SO GRATEFUL, that I have my mom's example of how to cope and this wonderful image of her during that time... It means everything (inc and esp now when she's 1,000 miles away and nowhere near an airport).   ***** Now, I'm waiting for results of gene-testing. I've been told the likelihood of a positive result is high. I'm okay with that. You see, they don't have a test for \"Leona\" (my mom). I am pretty sure Leona is the best d**ned gene of all and it is definitely stronger than any ol' cancer. Lots of love to you moms, from this daughter.",

Now, this does not provide evidence of what happens in the human body (in vivo) but it gives her and her colleagues at MSKCC good reason to recommend that women with breast cancer not take more than 100% of daily recommended value of Vitamin C.  You can have as many fruits and vegetables as you want, as much vitamin C in whole food form as you like. But stay away from Vitamin C supplements.  Vitamin C is so ubiquitous in our diets that you do not really need to take a vitamin C supplement.  If there is some vitamin C in the multivitamin that you take, though, it's okay to take the multivitamin provided it does not exceed 100% of the FRDI (federal recommended daily intakes) .  I hope this makes sense.

I spent the day in a meeting with the heads of Cape Town/Western Cape orgs that deal with child and adult sexual assault survivors.  Nitty gritty, wrenching stuff.  Rates of sexual violence are sky high here, as are HIV infection rates.  NOT a good combination.  The dozen or so women in this meeting are among those who helped write the sexual offences act. They are the ones who will try to hold the govt accountable to the law.  I'm working on a proposal to ensure that women victims of assault are provided with post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for HIV infection, in keeping with the sexual offences act.

But I have just found out that my best friend from grad school, the woman who I lived with along with her daughter from the time her daughter was one to when she was almost five... has breast cancer. Caught early (rads, but no chemo).  Here's an excerpt from her note which gives you a sense of her personality and why I love her so very, very much:   \"What did strike me is how much healthier your response was than the ones I'm having. Shit, you just go ahead and quit smoking and start exercising and I'm in the knee-jerk, \"fuck you. I'm going out with a Camel in one hand, a glass of gnarly red wine in the other, and a joint between my toes.  When it became clear that the cancer I got is pretty much never going to be life-threatening, it was almost a let-down to realize that I'd be forced to make some choices a bit tougher than how to make a dramatic exit. I've yet to opt for the healthy life-style choice. Perhaps that will come later.\"   She doesn't give herself enough credit, mind you. She smokes and enjoys her wine, but she has also been a vegetarian and eaten organic her whole life, has stayed in shape, etc. Cancer doesn't play fair.",

He is friends with the woman who suggested I ask the Unit to host me for my Fulbright.)  So there is still the distinct possibility that when we meet there will be zero in the chemistry department.  I have seen snapshots of him and he seems cute. (He was wearing sunglasses in one photo and in the other he was looking down. So it is possible that he only has one eye.) He grew up in 4 different countries (boarding school in two of them) and now lives here. He was arrested and detained in one of them (where he was born) for organizing a protest against the then-president who was trying to change the constitution so he could remain in office.  However, Amnesty International and the Ivy League school he attended were able to secure his release.  He used to live in NYC. He is a graduate student and a few years younger than me. Much to my mortification at the time, he found my blog AND the post where I said I had a crush.  He said he was really flattered and introduced me to the expression \"the stride of pride.\"  (He also said he was in awe, which was nice until it turned from being in awe to being intimidated.  Me? Intimidating? That is rich.) He seems like the nicest nicest of guys. (My friend who knows him slightly confirms this.) He says that he smiles too much, is effeminate, and is un-macho.  I say \"And this is a problem? What's the next thing you're going to tell me, that you don't believe in violence against women and you're not a homophobe?\"  I never go out with guys who are a 10 on the manly-man scale anyway. He has a beautiful voice. (That accent! So dreamy!) and he writes beautifully too. We are supposed to have dinner next week. I hope there is chemistry. Feel free to humor me and tell me about the crushes and loves of your respective lives!  What was the most romantic moment in your early dating history? (and I'm not talking grand gestures. I'm talking about \"The time we sat on my porch eating oranges until 2 am...\" or \"The time he gave me an indian head nickel\")  I'm a sucker for woo-ing stories! *squish* and *smooches* all around.",

Happy, happy birthday!  In your honor, I have bought some cherries and I have washed them and put them in the fridge and around 10 pm tonight (when hopefully, the temp has dropped below 90 degrees outside) I'm going to see if my wonderful neighbor Pam is available to go outside and join me on a parkbench to eat some cherries.  We will hum \"Happy birthday\" in your honor, or perhaps Pam will bring her kazoo. Tomatojuice: I am so glad you posted. I also live alone and my family is very far away and generally not in a position to travel (kids, health, distance, cost).  I've got a lot of friends \"around\" but only one or two who are in the neighborhood and only one without family commitments or mobility issues. While I'm an outgoing person in a lot of ways, my battle has been not to withdraw and retreat, and to let the \"low\" of Day 3 & 4 become a full-fledged slump.  So I try to move around every day, go outside every day (a good wander, when I have the energy), have human contact (phone or face to face) every day.  (I am a woman of simple goals.) Having finished three, I also am trying to fight off the dread of the remaining 5 poison-filling queasiness-inducing sessions. I'm not over the hump yet -- I can't start whimpering now!  (I think I'm going to see if my little sister will fly out from Alaska for a road/camping trip through Vermont toward the end. I definitely do better when I have a treat \"beyond\" a chemo appt to look forward to. Even if it is just a picnic in the park.)   But lean on us, okay? I know it's not the same as having someone in the room, but let us know what you're thinking. I, for one, welcome the company of someone who, like me, is on our own.  So if the rest of you will pardon another outburst of whining: Is it just me, or is motivating myself a thousand times a day to FILL THE D**NED WATER BOTTLE or GIVE MYSELF THE D**N SHOT or SWALLOW THE D**ED PILLS or TAKE A D**NED SHOWER or SUBMIT THE D**N INSURANCE RECEIPT or HEAT THE D**N PIECE OF QUICHE or TAKE OUT THE D**N TRASH/RECYCLING or PICK UP THE D**N TOWEL THAT I DROPPED ON THE FLOOR a Huge Drag???!!!  (Mind you, I love my independence.

He was really careful, too, because he knows my immune system isn't great.  He had several suggestions I thought I'd pass along here. 1.  Don't go barefoot. Not even in my house. Wear \"crocs.\"  My feet need arch support and protection. 2.  He recommended wearing nylon socks when I wear sneakers. Nylon wicks away moisture better than cotton.  Thin socks are better than thick because socks can contribute to blisters on sweaty feet.  3.  Keep feet moisturized. They can pick up a lot of cracks which are then openings for infection. 4.  He recommended a stationary bike or swimming as they don't require a lot of balance and reduce impact on my feet. 5.  He gave me samples for some Voltaren Gel which may help if I develop a lot of foot pain. (I am going to check with my docs before using it)  6.  Never ever allow a salon to do my cuticles or soak my feet.  Let them paint the nails and nothing else. He's convinced that even the cleanest or most expensive nail salons are cesspools.  (He told me the last time I saw him, too, before I even developed bc.) Feet are esp prone to infections because the circulation is poorest. Jeano-- Great pic! And \"whew\" about the lump scare. CONGRATS to Lee and Roxi.

Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is always cold?

I'm always clutching a bottle of cold water in my \"IV\" hand the morning of chemo! The nurse, Kerry, also has a technique for finding good veins.

I have only skimmed it (will read more carefully later) but oddly, have already found it reassuring to have it recognized as something \"intensely painful.\" Because it is. I keep trying to pretend it isn't but it is.  More than the pain, though, is the fact that I live alone (happily) and am without someone to \"fetch\" (not just groceries, but ointment, glass of water, another ice pack, new box of Kleenex). Last night, I told myself that it was okay if I had to crawl. That while it wasn't very dignified, it was okay.  (Even sitting with my feet down is really painful.  The good news is that the joint pain is completely overshadowed by the feet pain. AND I do have a lot of good reusable icepacks on hand, oddly enough. And bandaids, lotions, antibiotics.) If I had known it was going to be like this, I would have re-organized my apartment (e.g., put rugs down everywhere, reorganized my nightstand and the area around my couch, stocked up on food, bought a chair for the bathtub, bought a cooler to keep by the bed with my icepacks, stocked up on cheapo footy-socks) and otherwise made arrangements.  Right now, I ice my feet and then I use the 20 minutes or so of relief to do what I need to do. On Monday, if it is still bad, I'll look into Access-A-Ride and maybe a home health aide or housekeeper in case I'm still laid up a week from now. It's all about planning.  (People who live with this all the time -- can you imagine? I'm stil damned lucky.)

Sure \"they\" could chooses not to hold hands; we could choose to wear a wig. Indicator of our level of social acceptance.  [after a paragraph of typing I conclude: Must be far, far harder to be gay and wanting to hold hands.]  Safe and happy travels. If you find yourself in Kansas on Hway 24 let me know! Roxi:  excuse my memory lapse if you have already told me this, but are you BRCA+? (I am.) I am assuming you are otherwise it would make more sense for you to be tested before your daughters are. (If you're pos for the mutation- 50/50 chance each daughter is. If you're neg, there is no chance a daughter inherited the gene from you.) If you have any questions about the BRCA stuff, feel free to PM me.  But if you've already been through the counseling, you prob already know what I know!)  You have my complete sympathy with regard to your sisters' scare. I am going through that now with my older sister who is appearing to be  more cavalier than I feel she should be.  On the other hand, my younger sister is being tested next week. I do not think it is right for me to push either of them to be tested for the mutation, but I DO wish my older sister was being more aggressive in getting follow up for these cysts.  Again, though, the thing I most want you to know is that I feel for you. When I heard about K's scare, it was like a punch to the gut. Similarly, thinking about my sisters having the mutation is 1000 times harder than knowing I have it.  Honest.  Sable -- UTI. Bleah.

Eddie: Re: blisters. I was carefully and studiously NOT popping my blisters. Then I went to my podiatrist who just as carefully and studiously DID pop them.  So I now compromise. I try not to pop them but to let the liquid reabsorb. If that doesn't apear to be happening, then I disinfect a needle with alcohol, antibiotic, bandage, etc.  My feet are not in pain, but boy are they hideous. Covered in slow-to-heal sores. Keeping my feet up and on ice seems to have helped. Wearing crocs. Keeping my blisters bandaged.  And the Udderly Smooth with Urea I ordered from drugstore.com works better than the 10 gallons of other lotions I have on hand.   This would be more convincing if I hadn't just whined about my feet but -- after one infusion --  I DO like Taxol a lot better than A/C.  I have felt fantastic! strong! healthy! energetic! the last week or more in a way that I never felt for a prolonged period of time on A/C.  And no constipation. No queasiness.   And Eddie -- could your eye stuff be conjunctivitis?  Are you getting (yellowish-greenish) goop to go along with the whitish gunk?  Because that sounds like a lot more gunk than what I've had.  That's my \"professional\" opinion.

Laura -- first chemo is often the most worrisome because everything is so darned new.  When I had A/C on Wednesday, I often \"crashed\" on Sat and Sun and then rebounded and felt fine for the rest of the time.  Eating lots of fiber (fruit, oatmeal, nuts) and drinking lots of water will help stave off constipation if you're taking Emend.  Good luck!  Jean -- I'm sure you know this but just want to throw it out there:  I was afraid of Taxol #1 but in reality, allergic reactions are not all that common.  And I have generally found Taxol much better than A/C.  I don't feel stoned on Taxol or drugged up or queasy.  Everybody's different, but given a choice, I prefer Taxol to A/C. Jeano and Co:  So Taxol #2 infusion was uneventful except that Dr. T. has decided to have me take Taxol every week for awhile given that my feet are kind of a mess.  She says they don't look like a Taxol mess but she wants to play it safe.  I'm not wild about the possibility of having to finish chemo later (I was supposed to be done Aug 8th) but it IS preferable to having to switch drugs or having my feet go crazy again.  Also, she's taking me off Neulasta just in case it is the source of the problem.  I was so bummed about the possibility of not being done \"on schedule\" but honest to God, I thought of Eddie and Cris and how well you guys have coped with your delays and it helped me get perspective.  As the onco nurse said, \"Hey, you're still 'jetting.'\" by which she meant \"You are still able to continue with treatment.\"  And that's true.  How it must feel to be a woman who is told, \"We're going to stop chemo because your body needs a break\" or \"No more chemo because it isn't doing any good at all...\"  Yet we have met those women on these threads and they manage. They handle it with their characteristic grace.  So after a few sneaky tears in the library, I was fine. But I did think of you guys and it helped.

I didn't quite get to the \"I am going to die alone in an SRO, bald, cancer-ridden, and mistaken for a man\" stage because I got too tired.  I am sorry some of you are going through this too, but I confess, it is an ENORMOUS relief to find I have company!   **and check this out: the book would have had a Jan 2009 pub date whether I had cancer or not -- a fact that I somehow failed to appreciate in the throes of despair last night By the way, Otter, thank you for the menopause 101!  Weight gain, moodiness, and desert-like conditions -- do you think this is Evolution's way of trying to get women to form their own men-free colonies?!  And Hunkydory -- if it had been me late last night, I would have cried if she'd been nice or cried if she'd been rude.   Friend: Hey, how ya doin'? Me:  I'm fine. But check back in five minutes. ",

For what it's worth, I offer the following schedule of my hair loss.  I was surprised by how much it upset me. And I am hugely relieved that I now feel okay. A couple rough days, but then I am okay.  We won't always feel this weird.  I also think it was good that I made myself hang out with friends.  I could feel myself withdrawing, which only made me feel like more of a freak.  But that's just my experience. It might not be yours. I know people might be thinking \"Enough with the hair, already!\" but I post anyway just in case it reassures someone.  If I could sit next to you and console you, believe me, I would. Wed: Chemo #2 (A/C) Thurs: Hair starting to fall. Tufts come out without much effort during a \"shedding phase\" (my hair seems to shed a lot in the evening but at other times, not at all). I go to museum with a friend. Friday: Much like Thursday. Increased feeling of my scalp crawling off my head. I don't want to leave the house. I blame chemo, but part ofit is just feeling like a freak. I have brunch outside with a friend. Visit other friends that evening. Saturday***: Hair falling and coming out really rapidly. The hardest day, psychologically.  I barely leave my apartment. Sunday: The big shave, followed by a long hike with a friend. Monday:  I hang out with a friend all day wandering around wearing a little kerchief with an elastic on the back. I start to adapt. Tuesday: Tons of hair sheds in the shower that night. (It looks look iron shavings; I'm very glad my hair is so short otherwise it'd be a mess. And NYC plumbing couldn't handle it.) Wednesday: I start to feel like myself again. I start to get used to this being me.",

What I did benefit from was a couple tips one-on-one from a young woman at a Sephora make-up counter who showed me how to wear a little eye make-up. Feel free to PM me if you have any spec questions, but it wasn't that complicated once someone showed me the very basic stuff.

When outdoors isn't a respite, but part of the  problem. I'm sorry about that. Karin -- the smile on your grandson's face (and yours) made me get all teary! It reminded me so much of the good times I had when  I was 10 and my mom had cancer.  (Her joking around as she tried on wigs, her trying on my little sister's rollerskates -- she's still alive some 30 years later, I might add). Of course, we don't have to be happy and silly all the time but boy... when the opportunity  presents itself -- Carpe Goofiness! Carpe Joy! Eddie -- I've been thinking about your experience in the airport when I went on my bald-bald walk this morning.  You're def onto something. I like to think that we're kind of poster women for living w/ breast cancer when we're out and about and bald-bald.   Cris -- ooooh, edema. No experience with that, just feet issues more generally. I'm putting them up as much as I can, not crossing my legs, and wearing my crocs!  (edema, tho, oooohhhh...ow.) joia -= I wasn't told not to wear tampons. If it were me, I'd prob usually NOT wear one, but wear one for dance class. (Cool! dance class!  Says someone who honestly falls down when she tries to dance in public.) lee -- really happy about your stepdaughter's rehab & recovery. A lot of us have loved ones struggling with addiction (I even made up t-shirts that say \"I love someone who is addicted to drugs\" a few years ago!).  I had a recent conversation w/ a good friend who went into rehab about the time I was in chemo (until his insurance balked). I told him how much I appreciated the company of a friend who was also fighting for his life.  Since then, however, he's come off the rails. I told him I felt like he wasn't trying lately. He said, \"Well, it's not that easy to quit.\" And I said, \"I never ever said any of this was easy. It's hard as hell. But we have to do it anyway if we want a shot at life.\"  Anyway, Lee, I am really happy your stepdaughter is doing.well. And in a similar vein to some of what we've been talking about, I'm gonna post something from my blog that I wrote to the young people in my life. I don't know why, I just thought I'd post it here.  Scratch that. If you want to read it, you can go to www.rockthebald.blogspot.com, for Friday, June 27th.  (The blog is NOT required reading.  There will not be a quiz!) Is it just me, or are May 2008 women the BEST? I'm sure everyone feels that way about their cohort, but I gotta say, I really like us. ",

It makes a big diff having people who are going thru chemo say what you're saying.  Karin -- \"Dancing with my IV pole\" sounds like a great title for a book. (Did you see the post from the woman who literally did a pole dance with hers? Hysterical. Wish I wasn't blanking on her name.)  And Adrienne -- EXACTLY. 3.5 HOURS being infused? More steroids?!  Allergic reaction possibility?  Plus, I can't help but feel that my \"luck\" is going to run out sometime. Even though that is completely illogical. We will get through this. A certain amount of dread is natural, and certainly understandable. Especially when the drug is labelled: \"Fatal reactions have occurred in patients despite premedication.\"  It's almost funny! You know what? I am a woman of action. I've decided to put in a call to the onco nurse and find out exactly what pre-meds I'll be getting, and ask them for more details about what to expect. Okay, I did that and I feel muuuuuuch better. (I also learned that I like the Tuesday onco nurse a little better than the Wed one because she volunteers MUCH more info.)  My pre-meds will prob be: Decadron, Benadryl (will make me super-sleepy which is why someone should pick me up), and Zantac. Afterwards, I'll still get Neulasta, but no Amend or Decadron. Since I'm already having some neuropathy issues, the nurse recommended I ask Dr. T if she would write me a prescription or two for the foot pain, etc. in case it worsens.  She said I might expect more fatigue than I have had thus far.  Whew. I feel better. ",

Well, I think she is kind of in denial about the fact that I have breast cancer, am undergoing chemo, and have BRCA2.  She had bc at 40 so slack must be cut.  Still, it is painful to have a discussion about my cancer news where you could substitute any number of nouns (e.g., phone service, commute) for the words \"cancer\" and \"chemo\" and \"BRCA2.\" I think I will put a windsock on my head and call it a day. ",

And maybe your PCP or OB/GYN. It's gonna be a holiday weekend and it would just be darned suck-o to have this get worse (e.g., start bleeding, hurt more) when there might be an easy solution, y'know?  See if you can push them to see you. You do have cancer, and all. Those mucosal cells are shedding right along with the rest of our rapidly growing cells (hair, eye-whatevers, back of the throat, lining of the nose--Cris, absolutely NOT TMI, m'dear!).  Probably doesn't take much to make them bleed. And you need every drop of blood, every RBC, WBC, every platelet your body can muster. The blood -- around the urethra (it is a pretty word, isn't it?)  -- maybe the very beginning of a UTI? Or I gently suggest (not expecting you to repond!): if you have had any activity of the sex (or even tampon?) variety in the nether regions, perhaps there is an abrasion. I'm trying to think of anything you can eat that might help but am drawing a blank... Unsweetened cranberry juice or cran tea for urinary stuff... Lots of fruit for constipda... clams have a lot of iron and protein (good when we're losing blood)...  Oh damn. I am the anti-Otter.  Sorry about this.",

I am sorry that I have company in my misery, but I find it extremely reassuring that you guys are feeling this way, too and that my mood is not just a character flaw or moral failing.  It makes sense that we're hitting it around the same time, i.e., we ARE the May 2008 group! I cannot tell you how much I appreciate you guys for sharing, stereotypical and dorky as that sounds. I'm just tired of chemo, cancer, and it is too darned soon to be tired of it because I still have chemo and rads and more surgery to go.  But \"wishing\" thing were otherwise does not make it so.  I'm operating on the assumption that I WILL feel better (physically and emotionally). That this is just another transition and while it sucks right now, I will eventually figure out a way to adapt and cope. But right now . . . right now . . . Adrienne -- YES! to the recliner nausea.  Just the THOUGHT of (c-h-e-m-o) or (d-r-u-g-s) or even (f-o-o-d) makes my stomach churn.  And the 3-3.5 hour Taxol infusion.  I know. I just want someone to hit me in the side of the head with a shovel and knock me out.  Trying not to get into a thought pattern that will make chemo harder than it needs to be (is \"anticipatory or preemptive nausea\" recognized by the DSM IV?) but it is tough.  What DO we know about Taxol, anyway?    Adrienne, Kristy, Gracy, everyone ---  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  You have done wonders for my mood.  I am NOT a touchy feely person or a group hug kind of person. But while I am saying dorky things, let me add this:  If I could be anywhere right now, it would be standing in a circle with all of you whom I've gotten to know on these threads, holding hands, and just \"being present\" for a few minutes. At the end of the day, we have to go through chemo alone (i.e., we are the only ones getting that particular infusion). But we are also going through this alone, together. I am so grateful for that, and to each of you.",

(I like the new pic-- do you have piercing blue eyes?) Feel free to fill me in on what weekly Taxol has been like for you and what I should look outu for.  I do hope they'll let me go back to every 2 weeks; I wanna be done.  Then again, I also wanna be able to walk.  Roxi -- Shaving this weekend? We're there if you need us.  Oddly, I had to give my  head a trim yesterday. I had shaved back in May.  But I still have a head that is about 20-30% covered in stubble, some of which has been growing and was about 3/4\" long. So I gave it a trim so I didn't look quite so goofy.  Here's a question for you guys:  Is anyone noticing their emotions getting thrown around by chemopause?  I tell you, I try to be a pretty upbeat person but last night...boy. I'm struggling to sort out how much of my mood was natural/normal and how much was due to hormone changes. And can someone give me an idea of what to expect re: menopause? (my ovaries are coming out) a) overall energy;b) weight and weight distribution;c) skin  Wonderin' about Sue.  I don't want her or any of us to feel like we must post; I think it is healthy to peel myself off them from time to time (tricky, though, since the indexing has me glued to the computer these days). But I'm thinking about her, y'know? ",

Okay, don't tell anybody but . . .  I was given a prescription for Atavan a million years ago when i started chemo. I never took any of it. Because I hate drugs. I haven't slept well in months but that was okay because, well, it just was. However, when my little sister came into town, I didn't want to be operating on 3-4 hours of sleep a night. So the night before she came, I took an Ativan. And I slept through the night and woke rested for the first time in months.  Then we went on our road trip and I took one every night because, again, I did not want to ruin our trip by me being sleep-deprived and grouchy.  Anyway, I have not taken the drug since I got back. Consequently, I have not slept very well. I'm not sure what to do.  I gotta say, I LIKED feeling rested and well, \"normal.\" I don't want to take a pill to make me feel this way. I say this, Karin, because I don't want you (or any of us) to get used to feeling depressed, sleep-deprived, anxious, etc; I don't want us to make depressed, sleep-deprived, anxious our new normal, especially now that we're done with chemo. In general, I subscribe to the belief that we NEED a range of emotions, including what I think of as \"the less popular dwarves\" (i.e., dopy, grumpy, sleepy, anxiety-ridden, sobby).  But when it hangs in there for awhile . . .  Karin, I'm concerned about you.  Too blue for too long. ",

I am so relieved to learn of your background. I swear, if you had said, \"I have a PhD in Art History but science just comes easy to me\" I would have hit myself in the head with a shovel. 5.  I love reading about people's lives. Especially how we got whereever we are.  Okay. So I'll see how far I get with mine.  Childhood -- grew up in very very rural area, outside a town of 500 people in Kansas.  Went to college to study speech pathology (I know some sign language, and the phonetic alphabet -- was signing 3 weeks ago at chemo!) but dropped out when I broke up with a boyfriend. I moved to England for 6 months and wound up working with homeless people who were mentally ill, violent, addicted to drugs or alcohol or all of the above. Experience changed my life 21. Returned, changed major to one I made up. Road trip to DC with bf to see a friend who had testicular cancer for the second time. We broke up  but I stayed in DC. 21-22? 23? Worked for Defense Department as a clerk; we investigated fraud and I went to the Pentagon every Tuesday to buy delicious raisin bread at their bakery. Volunteered with Mother Theresa's nuns at her AIDS hospice. Got accepted to Peace Corps. Turned 'em down to get engaged to a plant geneticist though that didn't work out. 24-29. Got a PhD in Sociology: Justice. Dissertation examined sentencing of men and women drug offenders, and how whether or not they had kids influenced their sentencing.  30-42.  Got a tenure-track job and moved to NYC. My research is mainly focused on women in the criminal justice system. Early work also looked at HIV/AIDS.   Now. The book I'm finishing now looks at the criminal justice system and how it regulates women's reproductive rights (e.g., hard to be a good mother when you're being beaten, hard to have good repro health when you're locked up). Other: I learned to play the guitar (a little) a few years ago, and I picked up piano again. I love my life and I'm happy on my own (not dating at the moment, zero interest in marriage), but there are many times I am jealous (not in a mean way) of people who are happily with someone, making plans together, traveling together, owning a home,  helping each other out, making each other sandwiches, going on bike rides, building some shelves, fetching water or tacos, holding my hand, picking me up at work, you know? Gotta go. There is a lump in my throat and I don't think it's a side effect! Big hugs to everyone.",

In the back, she went bottom to top.   My hair was already cut short so it wasn't too big of a mess.  And I've heard that duller razors/clippers can be kinder (less likely to nick) than new ones. I didn't look at my reflection in the mirror for a couple hours (I just looked in the reflection in the window). It was a SHOCK when I did and I really hated how I looked; I focused a lot on how weird my ears looked, how weird my head looked.  I just kept thinking freak-freak-freak-freak  (like the sound in those horror movies.) After 2 days, when some more hair fell out (and kind of evened things out so I looked less scruffy), when I figured out how to wear eye shadow for the first time in my life (charcoals work on a lot of skin tones; pinks on others) and -- most importantly -- when I'd had time  to get used to how I looked, it was fine! I guess what I'm suggesting is that don't let your first impression be your last impression. In my (admittedly limited experience), you will look a bit different 2 days later, in reality, and in your perception.   Bald or not, beauty comes from our eyes, our smile, and the feelings and vitality behind the eyes and the smile...not our hair.  Roxi, you're (still) going to look beautiful. PS Tip: And if you do go bald/bald, when you find people kind of looking/staring, just give 'em a little smile. They pretty much always smile back. It just catches 'em off guard. ***** And...I am lovin' the birthday wishes and the brownies, sisters. I mean it.  I am SOAKING IT UP. (Please give me a chance to show you guys some love, too,  when your birthdays and anniversaries roll around, okay?!)",

(It kind of weirds me out that I have yet to encounter someone -- like me -- who is BRCA+ w/ bc who is not a fan of masectomies.)  I was reminded (and I hope I wrote this down right): My BRCA2+ status does not influence my risk of recurrence; my risk of recurrence is similar to other women who do not have the gene mutation. And, lumpectomy+chemo+rads and masectomy are about the same. My risk of a new primary (i.e., in other breast), however, is about 2-3%/year for the next 10-15 years. That's probably a high estimate, because it doesn't take into account me having my ovaries out or taking Tamoxifen. It also is based on shakier information than it seems, because the research and follow-up is really not there to state these things definitively. FInally, she mentioned that different countries have different rates of masectomies. One possibile explanation is that surgeons may vary in how often and emphatically they recommend masectomies, ranging from PRO-MASECTOMY (in countries like the Netherlands and Germany) to NOT-SUCH-FANS of MASECTOMY (in France). I thought that was interesting though it makes a lot of sense. Further evidence of the social construction of risk, you know?",

(Only to change their mind and decide to cover it a few weeks later, but by then, he was back to alcohol and coke.) About 2 months ago (the last time I saw him), I told him that while I missed him when he was in rehab, I felt as though he was one of the few people in my life who could understand what I was going through, because we were both fighting for our life. But lately, I felt like he had stopped fighting.  He objected, \"But it's not that easy [to get off drugs]!\" And I said, \"I KNOW it's not that easy. It's f*cking hard. But it's what has to be done if we're going to live.\"   I do have a soft spot in my heart for people strugging with addictions. Perhaps the key word, though, is struggling.  Alcohol and other drugs do a lot of good in this world in the way of anesthesia, comfort, painkilling; but they also cause a lot of pain.  I'm sorry you are on the receiving end of some of the latter. I know that you needed this like a shovel to the head. xoxoxo   P.S. I know what you mean about \"threes\". Though sometimes, don't you feel as though it has turned into \"multiples of three\"?",

I just spent a delightful evening with two of my former students, among the first I ever taught.  Their son is staying with grandparents and I was flattered/honored that they wanted to hang out with me.. They're both journalists, and all-round great people. I love seeing them. Calling it a night.  But couldn't head for bed without checking in to the thread. ",

Nothing.  I met some really nice folks while I hung out.  Lemme see, was told to keep my hands and feet well-moisturized, and to wear lotion & socks at night. Avoid hot water as it dries out the skin.  (Wash dishes in lukewarm water or better yet! use the dishwasher, have someone else do the dishes, or switch to paper plates!) Playing piano is okay (provided it isn't Chopin -- I only know 2 Chopin pieces and neither are very demanding) but guitar is probably not a good idea.Told that ibuprofen is preferable to Tylenol because Tylenol taxes the kidney (or was it the liver) and so does Taxol but ibuprofen/Alleve taxes the other organ. Recommended that I take ibuprofen for awhile to offset the bone aches. All in all, I feel pretty good! Hope Adrienne can say as much. Apologies for short, self-centered nature of this post, I'm just HUNGRY and kinda tired. But I will catch up later... Take good care, and good luck, Thursday people!!!  rock",

I feel you, sister.  I am still adhering to my \"no complaining for 3 days\" policy. This is PROTESTING and RAGING, which is different. 1.  From now on, I'm going to always ask for the product insert rather than rely on the summary.  It was a fluke that I asked for it, to be honest. 2.  We should not have to be this knowledgeable. We should trust our doctors to a) be well-informed and b) inform us of the potential risks a drug poses to our health, especially when we have told them that we PREFER to be informed. 3.  The oncos have us by the short hairs.  I know what you mean about not wanting to seem argumentative or like a \"problem\" patient.  At the same time, I do not want them to assume I will take whatever is thrust at/injected in me. 4. But my biggest beef is with the drug companies. How DARE they try to increase the prescriptions of a product that can jeopardize our lives by increasing the range of HGB levels at which it may be prescribed. SHAME. I am going to put a hat on my head just so I can take it off for you, Adrienne. Good for you for saying, \"Uh, not taking this next time.\"  (And was it you who also dropped some weight you had been carrying that you had wanted to lose?  Hats off again, for that.  It's just that I suspect you -- like me -- didn't undertake an activity that improves our health just so that the benefits could be offset by a @(#$*7ed drug.)  You are many, many things, Adrienne. A dummy is definitely not one of them. I'm really glad you pointed this out to the nurse.  And while I'd prefer not to have company in this incident, there is a piece of me that is comforted knowing I'm not alone in my feelings.",

Sue's \"dog ass tired\" is a very accurate descrip.  ).  You'd think for someone who claims to \"relate\" I could offer something useful.  All I got is that you are absolutely correct: It will NOT always be like this.   This morning was a beautiful, cool, non-humid morning in NYC. I called Pam and we walked to the farmer's market.  I bought some potatoes and some (more) zucchini bread. It was a beautiful morning, made more beautiful by the fact that I was up, on my feet, walking.  Felt like a gift. Sue and Eddie, you both also seem like the type of people who don't need shingles, queasiness, and fatigue to make you appreciate the good things life serves up on a daily basis (e.g., peaches, a dip in a lake, the view from a kitchen window, the wonderful diversity of a city).   Those things will still be there when you feel better; those things are still here. Roxi, SuePeet, Sue, Eddie, Randie, EyesOTex, I am sorry you don't feel well. I wish I could be there with a cool cloth, or make your bed up with nice crisp sheets, or bring you a glass of lemonade on the porch, or run you a bath or something.  I suspect we all feel that way.  Take good care.",

I found it a very moving doc, but hard to watch a womansy-documentary about life and health and strength which emphasizes all that is (can be) natural about women when I was feeling like a toxic waste site. Eventually, though, I've concluded that while chemo = chemicals (Pacific Yew or no), the friendships I've developed and strengthened the last 7 months are not only natural, but life-giving, and powerful and beautiful.

Sable and Eddie--  My eyes are largely courtesy of Stila eyeshadow and some GOOD 20-somethings who showed me how to wear eye makeup for the first time in my life.  I even bought their eyebrow stuff.  Did YOU know that you can put the lighter shade on the space that used to be eyebrows  nearest your nose (where mine are MIA) and the darker stuff everywhere else and it looks pretty darned convincing?  Yeah, the lighter shade makes it look a lot less fake on me.  Meanwhile, I was over her thinking, \"Boy, I wish I had Sable's teeth.\" (I love your expression, btw.  I just do.)",

      "Content": "Sep 1, 2008 09:43PM - edited Sep 1, 2008 10:26PM by rock Ah, the obliviousness of a 9 year old.  I was a rotten 10 year old when Mom had cancer.  To cite but one example (which I probably already told you guys about) At some point Mom was in the hospital for an extended stay. It was early May. I know this because my older sister (who was 16) was trying to fry a chicken and bake a birthday cake for my Dad.  I remember her getting out the Betty Crocker red & white checked cookbook to figure out how to cut up the chicken. I was supervising by saying things like \"It doesn't look like that when Mom does it\" and \"Yuk, why are you touching it so much?\". Finally, my sister snapped, grabbed the leg of the kitchen (which was still attached)  and threw the mutilated chicken across the room. It hit the wall over the kitchen table and kind of slid down.  There was a long horrible silence.  And because it was the only meat that was thawed . . . well, the chicken was rinsed, cut up and fried.   Every single thing my sister asked me to do, I'm pretty sure I responded with \"You're not Mom! You can't make me!\" She was 16 and trying to look after us four younger ones (though at points my baby brother and either me or my little sister stayed with relatives).   And I was as indifferent and self-centered as only a clueless 10 year old can be.  (My Dad visited us at various intervals but he stayed in a rooming house near the hospital which was a couple hours away. I didn't feel abandoned. Both Mom and Dad wanted to be both places at once.) Kids that age -- who knows how much they grasp, retain, care on a given day.  But my heart is aching for you and for pretty much every mom with a young kid.  Sure, I feel for what Mom went through NOW, but then? It never registered that cancer might kill her. I don't even remember thinking of her as being sick. Because she was Mom.  The Mom who could make/fix/solve/find anything.  Mind you, my mom is not a martyr!  And she was fully capable of blowing up at us!  Lemme see, there was the \"Common Decency\" lecture and the \"I am not your maid\" not to mention a whole series of \"shorts\" that were prefaced by \"Listen here, Suzie Q...\" or \"If you think I'm going to sit here and [x], then you've got another think coming...\" My point, and I did have one, somewhere . . . 1. Kids are often oblivious. 2. They are also incredibly resilient. (So blow up more.) 3.  You are the most important person. Because if you are okay and getting what you need, everybody else will be okay, too.  I have yet to see a home where that wasn't the case. Cris, of course you're okay. You, me, all of us are -- despite our varying degrees of baby cockatiel appearance -- frigging Poster Women for How to Cope with Cancer!  But personally, I think I need(ed) to go to a \"I don't want to deal with this sh*t anymore\" place. I didn't buy a home there or even a time share, but I think I need(ed) to go there.",

Still a bit demoralizing to think that I could have 8 more weeks of chemo when I was SUPPOSED to finish by August 8th.  Am hoping that onco will change her mind and put me back on dose dense Taxol (rather than weekly).  Am in pretty good shape aside from anemia and related fatigue. If I have to be in chemo for another 2 months it seriously jeopardizes my plans to be in SA in January because it postpones surgery and radiation.  Thinking maybe I won't have ovaries out until next fall.

Actually, she seems to be in worse shape now.  She's the area nurse; she and my dad are strong, independent,  sane wonderful members of their tiny little town (pop. 500).  I know they're doing everything they can.

It can get a little annoying for those around me as I turn EVERYTHING into an occasion to say \"Cheers!\" and \"Happy birthday!\" to somebody but it takes the pressure off the day.

I don't know why, but I'm not. My rads will be prone (face down) because the rad onco prefers to do all of them that way. I'll also do 4 weeks of rads + a couple boosters. Sorry so rushed.

I think about you women on and off all day, in ways specific and general.  As I try to find the balance between thinking about cancer and not thinking about cancer, it helps a great deal to know you are there with me, going through this, some of you where I am, some ahead, some following, looking for examples as I am.  I'm very grateful for that.

I was one of those little kids whose parent had a bout with breast cancer. (and my dad nearly died when I was 8)  [Mom got cancer at 39; her own mother had died a few months before she was diagnosed. Me and my 4 sibs ranged in age from < 1 to 16].  Frankly, I think it is an incredible gift that my parents unknowingly gave me. They showed me by their example that it is possible to weather really hard news with strength, grace, and humor. I cannot know what it is like to be the mom or gramma with cancer. But I can say with a fair amount of confidence that you women are no doubt giving your kids the same gift that my parents and my gramma (and my 6 aunts and uncles who also developed cancer < 50) gave me -- your warmth, your humor, your strength even during this tough time. Your kids are incredibly lucky.",

My God.  How is your friend doing? How are you? I'm glad she has you, I really am. Otter, that pissant? Bless his heart.  (Did I say that right?!) Is it wrong to laugh out loud at your description of having to put your hands in the air in the presence of the Pissant? I just imagined breaking otu in that \"hip\" song \"Put your hands in the air like you just don't care...Whoop!whoop!whoop!\" They've decided to let my weird Pap result go because -- I love the casualness with which they inform me of these things -- they will do a D&C when they remove my ovaries anyway and will test the tissue then to see if cancer's involved.  \"Oh! Okay then!\" Sable -- a raise? Put your hands in the air, whoopwhoopwhoop! cuz that is fantastic.  Congrats to you. Eddie -- you play guitar? That's it. We're all descending on your front steps this fall.  I kind of play guitar but not well.  I just noodle along to whatever anyone else is doing... (I don't know many chords; I just know the scales.) What do the words mean, btw? Everybody: You are the best. I am no longer freaked out. You have restored me to the \"tree of trust.\"  I wish I could say something really private and personal so that you would know that for sure but I am coming up short.  Oddly, I'm kind of glad it happened because it made me realize that I was taking your support and compassion for granted. So grateful to you. Friends here. must go. CHEMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! xoxox  Sue, so happy that it is just granola. May good news keep coming your way. FOREVER. ",

LP casually mentions how she slept on the steps of the Supreme Court because she wanted to hear the oral arguments of a case for which she helped write the brief. And SK covered Ferraro's campaign back in the day, as well as several natural disasters. I wish you guys were here.  Gotta scram. We're gonna squeeze in another kayak trek. ",

I posted this over on \"I bitch, I moan.\" But it is actually more serious than that.  I'm going to try to be very honest with you guys, and with myself. Last Wednesday (a few hours before the party), I was reviewing my CT scan report, trying to understand better the two abnormal findings, i.e., \"A sclerotic focus in the medial wall of the acetabulum of the right hip appears to be a bone island in this patient without known primary malignancy. There appears to be a small focus of fibrous dysplasia in the left iliac bone. No other osseous abnormalities are seen.\" I'd chalked these findings up to arthritis . But then a few words jumped out at me: \"Without known primary malignancy\"? So I called the radiology practice and said, \"Excuse me, but I just finished treatment for breast cancer and the CT report doesn't mention that as part of my history.\"  Upshot is that now I'm supposed to make more calls and have this CT scan compared with my old PET scan (which made no mention of anything), etc. This was on wednesday. I haven't done jack about it yet. I just can't. I just cannot deal with one more thing, even if this one more thing turns out to be nothing. I have simply maxed out on calling doctors and scheduling appointments and having one doctor's appointment turn into 3 others when ALL I AM TRYING TO DO IS LIVE MY LIFE. It's probably only going to turn out to be arthritis, anyway, not bone mets.  So can I please, please, please just DO NOTHING and move on with my life? At this point, I don't even CARE if it's something serious.  I just want a break. I do NOT want to make 3 phone calls to track down my old scan and another 3 phone calls and trips back and forth across town to pick up the damn scans . . . I am so very tired of all of this.  And my Mom is calling right now and I cannot talk to her because what am I going to say? I just don't have the energy tonight to keep up the positive front. I am grateful for everything I have. There is so very much for me to be happy about.  But I am so tired of doing everything on my own and having to make room for @#($*& cancer. PS Kerry, The post-chemo facial hair DOES go away.  I'm not sure when that happened but it DID happen. PS #2. I love you guys. Thank you for listening to this. You don't need to fix it. You don't need to give me advice. Though if you know anything about \"sclerotic focus\", I'm all freaking ears.",

I have this numb patch that comes and goes... a little smaller than my hand. But I think since it is on my side/back, it was easier for me to realize \"This is a nerve thing\".And my scar site used to \"throb\" in a disconcerting way several months ago, but not anymore. I have had zero bloodwork which also suits me fine. Sometimes I wonder if I should be getting all this stuff checked out but then I remember my onco's idea, \"You feel good, so lets just assume that you ARE good and not do all of these tests.\" It made sense to me at the time, and I think I'll go with it.

She makes other people feel crummy by invariably saying things like \"I have NEVER had a problem with MY weight.

(The teacher blamed me for being too involved in his life, because I had taken him under my wing when mom got cancer. They probably would have blamed mom but since she was in the hospital at the time...)  So I completely relate to the feeling of being blamed and wanting to smack someone with a shovel. Anyway, having said that, the speech therapist gave me some really good advice that completely resolved my brother's stutter.  He told me (and maybe Mom was there for this one, but I know I was): \"Don't leave the room when C. is talking. Don't turn your back. Make sure he knows that you're paying attention to him.\"  The therapist knew that of course,  we were still paying attention to him when we left the room, were making dinner, etc. but C. didn't always have that feeling. And in a large, busy family, there is a lot of times when one is holding 2 convos at once, leaving and returning, etc. Now, of course, maybe it's different from your son, but I just throw it out there in the realm of alternatives to a well-applied shovel. Your boy sounds like a great kid.  I'm holding you responsible for that! But the other stuff.  PLEASE. These are boys and boys stutter more than girls for any number of reasons.  I'm sure if fathers were around more, we'd blame them more for kids' problems, too. Julie -- refresh my addled brain.  What kind of things have you been experiencing? I care, but I also have more than a passing interest in this... what's up? Thanks for the support, people. It's been a rough couple weeks.

Feel free to ignore the following info about The Day After Day 1 of A/C. No need to respond or comment or anything.  It's just there for what it's worth in case it is useful to other folks. Fatigue:  Today I \"received\" friends from 11 - 2 pm, and it was truly lovely. I am tired now, but I can pretend it is because I spent the afternoon \"entertaining\" (on a very very laidback scale) rather than the chemo.  Also, my dear friend and mentor has been through chemo and was wonderful about gently reminding me to eat, drink, etc.  (I am not normally open to gentle reminders.)   Appetite: Oddly, the day after chemo, I am hungry but have no appetite.  I am allowed one serving of my Keffir (probiotic) drink a day. It's packed with vitamins. I just need to remember to drink it.  Nothing sounded appealing.  But once I was around people, I could eat some fruit, some crackers. And I had Sandra putting stuff on my plate in a manner that did not bring out my assaultive tendencies. Nausea:  Felt a little seasick through the night (waves in the pool?).  It felt exactly like those times I've gone to bed a little tipsy and the room spinned and I felt a little queasy.  At some point, I sat up in bed and read a book. THat seemed to distract me and the nausea passed. Night sweats: I woke up 3-4 times with drenching night sweats. I have been getting 1 or 2 a couple nights a week for awhile (pre diagnosis).  I'm 42 so can't rule out looming menopause. My friend ordered me a wicking nightgown.  Anybody with advice? Constipation. I was slightly constipated.  I held off on my cup of coffee until later in the morning and tried to eat a few dried apricots.   That seemed to help.  I'd really like to hold off on taking drugs for things that I might be able to treat naturally. Port.  They told me that at some hospitals, the policy is that everyone who gets A/C must get a port.  However, at MSKCC since my veins look good, etc. no port for me, at least not for now.  My friend had a port two years ago.  I wouldn't have noticed her 1\" scar if she hadn't pointed it out.  (She also has done some scar massage.)",

Perhaps I am over-identifying with your situation.  It's just that when you are happily imagining ONE kind of vacation and then get sucked into another kind entirely...   PS Kristy, if you find the wherewithall to say to your family members, \"People, I love you but I am really looking forward to some serious down/alone time this vacation so please understand if I'm not as social as I've been in past years.\" I will try to find a way to say . . . . ummm.... \"I am glad you like your roommate but her presence kind of harshes the friendly supportive buzz of our happy little group so maybe in the future...\" To clarify: I am all about inclusiveness. and all NOT about cliques. There is another woman who just started to show up every week even though she was never really invited. But she is a nice person, a warm person, someone who cares about others and it is no stress at all to stretch a bit to include her. We have all been in a position at one time or another where we needed a friend. But this other woman . . . Dios mio. \"Anything you can do, I can do better!\" wears real thin real quick.",

OH FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.  Okay, your neighbor is a paranoid nutball. That is hardly reassuring. Anything you say or do is not likely to make her less of a paranoid nutball.  So basically, all you can do is . . . seek harmless forms of revenge that will make YOU feel better and keep YOU from coming undone.  Strange as this sounds, I had (still have, actually) a colleague of 14 years who HATES MY GUTS. She succeeded in making my life really unpleasant the first few years (I could barely speak in a faculty meeting without breaking into a sweat and stammering).  Then I thought \"Feck it.\"  I decided to launch a campaign to really get under her skin without diminishing me.  My main form of revenge was greeting her cheerfully every time I saw her.  \"Hey, Betsy! How was your weekend!\" She would grunt and glare, and I would carry on down the hallway.  I was always tempted to add \"Have a nice day!\" or \"Jesus loves you!\" -- she's Jewish -- but that was farther than I -- a non-believer -- was willing to go.  The more cheerful I was, the more noticeably unbalanced she became.)  You have children so you are at an advantage. There is no end to the things you can do to irritate her, e.g., have the kids wave cheerfully and enthusiastically everytime you pull out of the driveway, \"Bye Mrs. Crabcake! [use her real name]  Have a nice day! Jesus loves you!\"  Your children should skip a lot! They should toot party horns wherever they go!  Your happiness and good humour is the best revenge. You can develop a family song and have them sing it!  And then, after night falls, you move to Plan B... More on that later. But you can start rotting the fish and the eggs now...  Sorry you're having to deal with this.  Really. It can really get under one's skin. 3.   Adrienne: I am going to print out your post and cart it around with me.  It's just one of those things that I need to commit to memory, you know?  (Especially the \"I'll personally kick his ass\" part.) So far, the last few weeks have been really nice. I think we are treating each other very carefully, remembering maybe how painful it was to have our feelings hurt so bad (however accidentally).  I would really like it if you people would hold hands with someone a little bit today, and maybe wish me luck while you do so.   (Two times, I have spent him an SMS and he has joined me -- including at a performance of a transgendered performance artist/drag queen -- so he could meet my girlfriends.That's a good sign, right?)",

I mean no harm. As with all things chemo, everyone is different.  What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. Chemo Tips - Compiled (or Everything you wanted to know, and a whole lot more) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend, a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. \u2022 Make sure you are given the drug EMEND for the nausea. \u2022 Eating a popsicle, or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin may prevent mouth sores. Possible side-effects General care \u2022 Drink as much fluid as you can \u2022 For moisturizers, you probably want something as scent free as possible. \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set \u2022 To help keep your RBCs up, one person recommended a lot of peanut butter. (Miki note: I'd translate that to really saying \"eat lots of protein.\") \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in Hair loss You may want to get a silk or satin (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive.  I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). When hair starts to fall, a lint roller helps to remove lingering hairs. Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Port care Mouth sores \u2022 \"If you get mouth sores, there's a little cocktail you can whip up with liquid benadryl and Maalox.\" \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - Hairy tongue  Pain/aches \u2022 Specifically if you are going to be getting Neulasta, Aleve was recommended as a pain killer for aches. The poster suggested taking one 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. Ibuprofen \u2022 (Miki note) - in general, I think the feeling is that Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice as it has the fewest possible side-effects Sleeplessness \u2022 Ambien CR was recommended because the CR - Controlled release - allowed for her to get to sleep and stay asleep Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Eating active culture yogurts (e.g., Activia) is recommended by some \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 I take one square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then I drink gallons of water and tea. I also eat Activia yogurt every single day. So far, so good. I think the secret is taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking as much water as you can stand \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast, which is often very helpful. \u2022 One recipe offered: o 1 Green Plantain (not banana) Usually Spanish stores or grocery have o 1 garlic clove o Olive oil o Boil the plantain and add a pinch of salt; mash it and add garlic and olive oil (note from Miki, I'd be very cautious about how much olive oil). \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 Another tip - keep a squirt bottle by the toilet and rinse your self off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. I used an old water bottle and when I got this tip earlier on-line the person suggested a ketchup bottle. If the water rinse doesn't help - which it did help - but still got sore - take Uristat or AZO - both over the counter. These are analgesics which help with the burning and pain. But remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections. \u2022 (Miki note) If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation.",

We went back to her house to pick up her dog.  (I studied myself in the mirror a little and concluded I have pointy ears and my dad's hairline.) After a detour to buy SPF 70 sunscreen (which we are convinced works by deflecting the sun onto the person you're with)** we took a long hike around a lake. Later, I took the train back and called a friend when I reached Harlem. We sat in her little garden and drank mint tea.  Then around 9 pm I walked home through Morningside Park.  People were still enjoying the last hour or so of barbecues, with kids on bicycles and skipping rope on the sidewalk. I just got home (9:30pm).  It turned out to be a wonderful day.  Thank you everybody.  **Do you know that some sunscreen contains soy? Because what the world needs now, apparently, is more soy. ",

Bald bald.  It felt great.  And honestly, there were not that many looks (or maybe I was oblivo). Little little kids stared, but they are little kids.  My friend  pointed out that what we might assume is a judgmental or disapproving expression could actually be someone thinking \"Are my hemorrhoids returning?\" or \"Did I turn off the iron before I left home?\" or \"That reminds me, I need to buy onions.\" People, even if you're not ready for public bald bald, don't rule out being bald bald at home.  Whatever you're comfortable with . . . (Hurray, Kristy! Inadvertent baldness has a lot to recommend it!) My head was shaved and I probably have 25% of what I had before. Adrienne: I LOVE THE AVATAR.   Jean and I will meet you next to the palm tree on Wednesday!  My theme song is Rare Earth's I Just Want to Celebrate (and Fleetwood Mac's Landslide for my more pensive moods). Other songs I have been living with are on Rock the bald, the iMix.

I'd recommend getting a travel sized bottle as well to throw in your back-pack. - Aleve (painkiller) - Biotene mouthwash - Imodium - Senekot-S (anti-constipation) - Pepcid - plastic flatware - Chewing gum - sugar free hard candy. My mom found sugar-free hard candy somewhat helpful with dry mouth. - Peanut butter - unscented moisturizer (if you don't already have it) - sunscreen (for face and for everything else; SPF 15+)  - new shower curtain liner - new toothbrushes - another thermometer (since tracking temp matters)  - squirt/ketchup bottle for bathroom rinses - at least one extra box of Kleenex - indiv packets of kleenexes (disappearance of nose hairs = dripping nose) - a box/packet of the flushable moist wipes (One of the posters noted that chemo \"coming out\" can be burning/uncomfortable; these could help soothe...er...irritated tissues) - white rice - crackers (inc indiv packets of animal crackers to carry around for queasy moments) - applesauce - chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles ",

I will post more later but right now, I'm getting ready to order some Thai food.  10:15 pm:   Roxi, I am on medical leave. I have felt physically FINE up to this point, but trying to schedule appointments around my classes was impossible. Today:  I started A/C.  I might update this with more details later but I want to go to bed soon.  Everything went swell.  Things I learned (w/ the caveat that everyone is different, etc.):   Pack some protein-y snacks to tide you over if you have an afternoon chemo. The first chemo is longer and at my hospital (Mem Sloan Kettering), afternoon appointments often run a bit later. It's easy to get a bit light-headed from hunger or low blood sugar if it's been a few hours since lunch. Note:  Many \"energy bars\" contain soy! I'm ER+ so need to restrict my soy intake to 2 servings/week.  It may be best to pack nuts or a little tub of peanut butter.  The MSKCC kitchen was stocked with graham crax . . . but no protein.  And (according to the dietician) no Vitamin C supplements. Ever, even after chemo.  (I learned a lot talking to the dietician waiting for my chemo to start.  A free consult!) 6 small meals will prob suit me better than 2-3 bigger ones. Only 2-3 c. green tea/day during chemo.  Drink h2o before, during, and after.  I should empty my bladder every 2 hours or so (that's the \"news\" part). Today and tomorrow I should feel fine. I was told to expect a crash (on A/C) around days 3, 4, or 5.  My brain is a bit addled right now. I feel fine, good, etc. but also a bit wonky. Definitely was happy to have my friend here to sort out what drugs I need to take when for the next 2 days because I'm not feeling very with it.  (Roxi: If I had to teach a class right now, I could. But I wouldn't trust myself to calculate their final grades, if that makes sense!  For me, this is different than feeling tired or post-stress.) That's it for now. I'm going to call it a night.  Congratulations, Familyrocks! I'm dedicating this first night's sleep with chemo coursing thru my veins to all the women who have ever had chemo/are undergoing chemo/will have chemo soon.   ",

Try to be as kind to yourself as you can be and look for ways to help yourself relax whether that is a bubblebath or a neckrub or a dumb movie night with girlfriends (\"Blades of Glory\" anyone?) or playing a silly board game or dragging the guitar out of the closet or (preferably) all of the above.  I promise: Doing things to reduce the stress/relax makes everything easier.  So when in doubt, put down the scrub brush or the shopping list and try to find a way to unwind. Them's my two cents. My days 3, 4, 5 after A/C (the first) were fine.  A little achy, fatigue-y but fine! I didn't take any drugs, just ate little slices of quiche most of the day (and some grapes) and went for a couple walks.  I think the approach of small frequent bland-protein meals and moving around has helped. Oh, and I've added \"avocado with a little olive oil and black pepper\" to my list of constipada and anti-queasiness remedies. ",

It's been 4 months since I found the lump; can we get this chemical show on the road??!! But! then I told myself that the (admittedly aggressive) cancer didn't appear overnight and, after my surgeries (a lumpectomy & a re-excision), the bulk of the cancer is gone! So a few extra days or a week won't hurt, especially if it means I feel good about my decision and that I have healed from the surgery. I would just gently add that dose-dense is no joke. All chemo chemicals are strong, but i personally -- just where i am coming from! --  would not want to be overmedicated in the interests of time given the (scary! serious! life-altering!) side effects.    Having said that,  it does matter a lot that YOU feel good about whatever you decide.  (Good for you for getting the second opinion. And who knows, maybe a third!) P.S. A book by a cartoonist friend of a friend of mine called \"Cancer Vixen\" lays out CMF treatment pretty thoroughly (and in a fun if sometimes shallow way). ",

I had a great experience.  I probably had 5 or 6 hours of counseling all told, and they sent me about 10-15 single spaced pages of information tailored specifically to me and my family so I didn't even have to take notes.  By the end, they could have told me I was going to sprout a second nose in the middle of my forehead and I think I would have handled it well.This was important because it fell to me to tell my 30+ first cousins (including three whose mom had died of ovarian cancers a few months ago) and my four siblings. Bottom line:  I am BRCA2+, it was hard news, but I'm okay (then again, I don't have kids). If you ever want to talk about any of this, PM me. I'm really sorry to hear about your dad.

I have cried a LOT this year.  By myself. I think I might have mentioned that I have this lovely 22 year old friend here, James (my Muslim poet-hero). Of the many things I like about James, one is his matter-of-fact honesty.  I remember one conversation where he said, \"You know, I really like to cry. It feels so good. I like to cry almost as much as I like to sleep\" (he also suffers from insomnia which is how we came to know each other).   I don't know where I'm going with this.  I guess I want to say that I think crying a lot is okay. I think depression, on the other hand... well, it can be scary, and it can hurt us. And I hope if any of us are feeling blue in an \"uh-oh, this is not moving on\" kind of way, that we'll say something, right? Jackie/Gracie: I doubt you are over-sensitive. In my opinion, you are not over-sensitive. I strongly suspect that you are perfectly the right amount of sensitive.  And I feel for people who didn't have the childhood that every kid deserves. Mine was not ideal (hello, parents and their near-death experiences) but I did grow up feeling loved and secure.Which is HUGE. Sue: Damned straight.  I know how many miles I have gotten out of being able to drop, \"My friend Sue, the AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER\" into a conversation. I can only imagine the perks of actually BEING Sue. I haven't said it in awhile, but boy, I do love us.

It was also kind of freaky. I have done this a million times!  But I picked up the guitar yesterday and it was back.  I can relate to the feeling, though, of going to the well and the well is not empty so much as I don't remember where the well even is.  Scary. Disturbing. Sue:  You are right as rain.  I do hope I hear from D again. I really like him.  [deleted] On a less-shallow note (the post on Jen's friend reminded me) I am going to have two procedures done on some Thursday in the not-to-distant future. I have had a couple strange Paps in a row now (cervical dysplasia -- CIN1) and my uterine  lining looks odd so they want to rule out endometrial and cervical cancers.  Yeah, nothing says sexy like \"colposcopy\" and \"hysteroscopy.\"  The doc is taking the approach of \"see and treat.\" Whatever strangeness she finds while she is looking around, she intends to remove.   The fun never stops!  Speaking of fun . . . Randie -- I don't want to be a tattletail but Adrienne  wouldn't share the recliner last time, and Cris hogged all the good juice.  Also, you should check Jen's pockets before you leave next time.  Remember when the doctor couldn't find the stethoscope? Uh-huh.  I'm just sayin'.  I am not naming names, and I realize that chemo did quite a number on our tastebuds, but I think we would all do well to pack a few breath mints as the novely of being trapped under the bed or in a closet with Ms. Halitosis wears off pretty quickly.  I do like the way Otter hums to herself, though. Very soothing. And Noelle always smells nice and her skin is so soft.  (Speaking of which, I apologize for the stubbly state of my legs. If I'd known I'd be rolling up my pant legs and stuffed in a hot closet, I would have shaved...) I'm sure  we will all get the hang of these hospital stays eventually. But in the meantime, remember, breath mints are your FRIEND! Love you guys.",

Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.) The usual caveat applies: Not everything works for everybody! We all find our own path, admittedly, with the help of others on the path, and who have walked it before us. P.S.

I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth. Warning: Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride -- like Crest pro-health -- may stain your teeth. Seriously.) - Imodium - Anticonstipation: Walnuts, pecans, almonds, dried apricots, prunes, prune juice, Colace, Miralax, Senekot-S, activia yogurt (No need to buy all of these. See what you need & what works for you!) - Pepcid - disposable flatware, plates and cups (for times when you're tired or immune-suppressed; plastic flatware helps offset metallic taste in mouth) - Sugarfree chewing gum, sugar free hard candy (some people prefer lemon flavor) or breath mints - Protein food sources (e.g., peanut butter, nuts, clams, oysters, meat, avoid soy if you are ER+) - unscented moisturizer - sunscreen (for face and for everything else; SPF 15+) - new or washed shower curtain liner (minimize bacteria, mold) - new toothbrushes (mouth is really vulnerable to infections, sores; oral hygiene is super-important) - another thermometer (since tracking temp matters) - at least one extra box of Kleenex - indiv packets of kleenexes (disappearance of nose hairs = dripping nose) - a box/packet of the flushable moist wipes (I use these wipes the first few days after chemo to prevent the discomfort/burning that may accompany urination; these may help soothe irritated tissues. Others use a squirt bottle.) - Thing of Clorox-type wipes - artificial tears for dry eyes (consider Renew or Similasan brands) - acidopholus capsules for yeast infections if you're prone to them - nonlatex gloves to wear when doing dishes, etc. to reduce nicks and cuts, at least on those low blood count days toward the end of treatment. Food - unsweetened indiv things of applesauce - individ things of cottage cheese (I find smaller servings less daunting on a queasy stomach, and may be less wasteful in the long haul) - Eggbeaters (bland, protein) - brown rice - crackers (inc indiv packets of animal crackers or Saltines to carry around or keep in desk drawer or nightstand for queasy moments. ER+ should watch out for soy -- it's in a lot of cracker sandwiches) - dried apricots and fruit (helps with constip) - lentil soup, black bean soup, chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles, orange Pedialyte For those of us facing hair loss: http://www.4women.com http://www.sparklingearth.com/products.asp?categor... http://www.bandanas.net/skullbest.htm http://www.myskullcaps.com/ http://www.sungrubbies.com Pointers on tying scarves: http://www.coveryourhair.com/HowToTieTiechels.html http://www.tznius.com/ This has more extensive scarf tying instructions (click on link in nav bar or at the bottom of the home page). - You Tube: search \"how to tie head wraps.\" The video is by galaxyswurl.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first. (See Starting Chemo May 2008 converation to get a sense of when, where and how much hair is lost over time!) Food.

I checked with MSKCC dietician & a nutritionist and they recommended I take Calcium Citrate, Magnesium, Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) during chemo (and forever) to combat bone loss. They said \"not during chemo\" to everything else, including a multivitamin. They also said \"never\" to most soy products [I am ER+] -- only 2 servings a week-- and Vitamin C supplements.)

My sense is that everybody's tastes are so different . . . it's hard to predict. (You might want to post your question over on the May 2008 chemo thread.  My \"sisters\" and I are all a bit food-obsessed!)  I am suffeing from a lack of appetite myself, so it is hard for me to answer. But I'll give your question a try...  Bear in mind that this is just my experience; not a universal one. I am not very interested in spicy foods.  Small portions are more appealing than larger ones. Personally, food my friends offered that I enjoyed included * quiches, meat sauce (for spaghetti) * I have been craving a small loaf of banana nut bread, pumpkin bread, zucchini bread (with reduced sugar, but NO sugar substitutes -- I've never hated chemicals as much as I have during chemo!) * my little sister made me some chocolate no-bake cookies with oatmeal that I LOVED (sugar is bad, but the choco and the oatmeal -- mmm, mmm. And i DID need fiber!) * maybe a cold pasta salad of sorts?  Especially if you can sneak some protein or fiber into it? (e.g., sunflower seeds) Again, that is just such a thoughtful question, a thoughtful gesture.  Sometimes, too, I didn't think I had any interest in food until I was with a friend...  So don't underestimate the power of you joining her for some caprese (tomatos, mozzarella, basil drizzled with olive oil)!

If you try to eat well and get regular exercise (e.g., walking), and find as many occasions to relax and laugh as you can ... well, chemo doesn't have to be the worst thing in the world either!

Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.) The usual caveat applies: Not everything works for everybody! We all find our own path, admittedly, with the help of others on the path, and who have walked it before us. P.S.

A Pre-Chemo Shopping List None of this is \"new\" but it might be helpful to someone (like me) whose chemo started on short notice. - Purell-type hand-sanitizer. I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth. Warning: Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride -- like Crest pro-health -- may stain your teeth.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first. (See Starting Chemo May 2008 converation to get a sense of when, where and how much hair is lost over time!) Food.

I checked with MSKCC dietician & a nutritionist and they recommended I take Calcium Citrate, Magnesium, Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) during chemo (and forever) to combat bone loss. They said \"not during chemo\" to everything else, including a multivitamin. They also said \"never\" to most soy products [I am ER+] -- only 2 servings a week-- and Vitamin C supplements.)

Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.)

Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first. (See Starting Chemo May 2008 converation to get a sense of when, where and how much hair is lost over time!) Food.

      "Content": "rock wrote: These lists may be read in conjunction with the conversation created by www.breastcancer.org member Melissaga (\"Tips for Getting Through Chemotherapy\") on December 6th, 2006. Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.) The usual caveat applies: Not everything works for everybody! We all find our own path, admittedly, with the help of others on the path, and who have walked it before us. P.S. Keep moving (e.g., go for walks). I swear it helps! rockthebald, nyc. 43 (Today's my birthday!) Receiving treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering in 2008. IDC, DCIS, LCIS. 1.8 cm. Stage 1/2-ish (T1No (i+) or T1N1 (mx)) Chemo: dose-dense, A/C + T. A Pre-Chemo Shopping List None of this is \"new\" but it might be helpful to someone (like me) whose chemo started on short notice. - Purell-type hand-sanitizer. I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth. Warning: Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride -- like Crest pro-health -- may stain your teeth. Seriously.) - Imodium - Anticonstipation: Walnuts, pecans, almonds, dried apricots, prunes, prune juice, Colace, Miralax, Senekot-S, activia yogurt (No need to buy all of these. See what you need & what works for you!) - Pepcid - disposable flatware, plates and cups (for times when you're tired or immune-suppressed; plastic flatware helps offset metallic taste in mouth) - Sugarfree chewing gum, sugar free hard candy (some people prefer lemon flavor) or breath mints - Protein food sources (e.g., peanut butter, nuts, clams, oysters, meat, avoid soy if you are ER+) - unscented moisturizer - sunscreen (for face and for everything else; SPF 15+) - new or washed shower curtain liner (minimize bacteria, mold) - new toothbrushes (mouth is really vulnerable to infections, sores; oral hygiene is super-important) - another thermometer (since tracking temp matters) - at least one extra box of Kleenex - indiv packets of kleenexes (disappearance of nose hairs = dripping nose) - a box/packet of the flushable moist wipes (I use these wipes the first few days after chemo to prevent the discomfort/burning that may accompany urination; these may help soothe irritated tissues. Others use a squirt bottle.) - Thing of Clorox-type wipes - artificial tears for dry eyes (consider Renew or Similasan brands) - acidopholus capsules for yeast infections if you're prone to them - nonlatex gloves to wear when doing dishes, etc. to reduce nicks and cuts, at least on those low blood count days toward the end of treatment. Food - unsweetened indiv things of applesauce - individ things of cottage cheese (I find smaller servings less daunting on a queasy stomach, and may be less wasteful in the long haul) - Eggbeaters (bland, protein) - brown rice - crackers (inc indiv packets of animal crackers or Saltines to carry around or keep in desk drawer or nightstand for queasy moments. ER+ should watch out for soy -- it's in a lot of cracker sandwiches) - dried apricots and fruit (helps with constip) - lentil soup, black bean soup, chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles, orange Pedialyte For those of us facing hair loss: http://www.4women.com http://www.sparklingearth.com/products.asp?categor... http://www.bandanas.net/skullbest.htm http://www.myskullcaps.com/ http://www.sungrubbies.com Pointers on tying scarves: http://www.coveryourhair.com/HowToTieTiechels.html http://www.tznius.com/ This has more extensive scarf tying instructions (click on link in nav bar or at the bottom of the home page). - You Tube: search \"how to tie head wraps.\" The video is by galaxyswurl. Cheap synthetic wigs: http://123wigs.com/wigstore/ More expensive wigs: http://www.paulayoung.com/ Inexpensive synthetic wigs may be available on ebay (Don't rule out just going \"bald bald\" most of the time, and wearing sunscreen. I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C.

Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.) The usual caveat applies: Not everything works for everybody! We all find our own path, admittedly, with the help of others on the path, and who have walked it before us. P.S.

Stage 1/2-ish (T1No (i+) or T1N1 (mx)) Chemo: dose-dense, A/C + T. A Pre-Chemo Shopping List None of this is \"new\" but it might be helpful to someone (like me) whose chemo started on short notice. - Purell-type hand-sanitizer. I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth. Warning: Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride -- like Crest pro-health -- may stain your teeth. Seriously.) - Imodium - Anticonstipation: Walnuts, pecans, almonds, dried apricots, prunes, prune juice, Colace, Miralax, Senekot-S, activia yogurt (No need to buy all of these. See what you need & what works for you!) - Pepcid - disposable flatware, plates and cups (for times when you're tired or immune-suppressed; plastic flatware helps offset metallic taste in mouth) - Sugarfree chewing gum, sugar free hard candy (some people prefer lemon flavor) or breath mints - Protein food sources (e.g., peanut butter, nuts, clams, oysters, meat, avoid soy if you are ER+) - unscented moisturizer - sunscreen (for face and for everything else; SPF 15+) - new or washed shower curtain liner (minimize bacteria, mold) - new toothbrushes (mouth is really vulnerable to infections, sores; oral hygiene is super-important) - another thermometer (since tracking temp matters) - at least one extra box of Kleenex - indiv packets of kleenexes (disappearance of nose hairs = dripping nose) - a box/packet of the flushable moist wipes (I use these wipes the first few days after chemo to prevent the discomfort/burning that may accompany urination; these may help soothe irritated tissues. Others use a squirt bottle.) - Thing of Clorox-type wipes - artificial tears for dry eyes (consider Renew or Similasan brands) - acidopholus capsules for yeast infections if you're prone to them - nonlatex gloves to wear when doing dishes, etc. to reduce nicks and cuts, at least on those low blood count days toward the end of treatment. Food - unsweetened indiv things of applesauce - individ things of cottage cheese (I find smaller servings less daunting on a queasy stomach, and may be less wasteful in the long haul) - Eggbeaters (bland, protein) - brown rice - crackers (inc indiv packets of animal crackers or Saltines to carry around or keep in desk drawer or nightstand for queasy moments. ER+ should watch out for soy -- it's in a lot of cracker sandwiches) - dried apricots and fruit (helps with constip) - lentil soup, black bean soup, chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles, orange Pedialyte For those of us facing hair loss: http://www.4women.com http://www.sparklingearth.com/products.asp?categor... http://www.bandanas.net/skullbest.htm http://www.myskullcaps.com/ http://www.sungrubbies.com Pointers on tying scarves: http://www.coveryourhair.com/HowToTieTiechels.html http://www.tznius.com/ This has more extensive scarf tying instructions (click on link in nav bar or at the bottom of the home page). - You Tube: search \"how to tie head wraps.\" The video is by galaxyswurl.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first. (See Starting Chemo May 2008 converation to get a sense of when, where and how much hair is lost over time!) Food. Protein and iron rich foods may help boost RBC: Meat chili, clams, oysters, some beans, nuts Here is a link for Summer Express: 101 meals to be prepared in 10 minutes or less. http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/18/dining/18mini.html?_r=1&scp=10&sq=100+recipes&st=nyt&oref=slogin And 101 fast recipes for inspired picnics http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/02/dining/02mlis.html?scp=2&sq=101+picnic&st=nyt Supplements: Check with a dietician or a nutritionist about supplements and multivitamins. (My A/C + T regimen may contribute to bone loss. I checked with MSKCC dietician & a nutritionist and they recommended I take Calcium Citrate, Magnesium, Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) during chemo (and forever) to combat bone loss. They said \"not during chemo\" to everything else, including a multivitamin. They also said \"never\" to most soy products [I am ER+] -- only 2 servings a week-- and Vitamin C supplements.)

Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first. (See Starting Chemo May 2008 converation to get a sense of when, where and how much hair is lost over time!) Food.

Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.)

Stage 1/2-ish (T1No (i+) or T1N1 (mx)) Chemo: dose-dense, A/C + T. A Pre-Chemo Shopping List None of this is \"new\" but it might be helpful to someone (like me) whose chemo started on short notice. - Purell-type hand-sanitizer. I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth. Warning: Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride -- like Crest pro-health -- may stain your teeth. Seriously.) - Imodium - Anticonstipation: Walnuts, pecans, almonds, dried apricots, prunes, prune juice, Colace, Miralax, Senekot-S, activia yogurt (No need to buy all of these. See what you need & what works for you!) - Pepcid - disposable flatware, plates and cups (for times when you're tired or immune-suppressed; plastic flatware helps offset metallic taste in mouth) - Sugarfree chewing gum, sugar free hard candy (some people prefer lemon flavor) or breath mints - Protein food sources (e.g., peanut butter, nuts, clams, oysters, meat, avoid soy if you are ER+) - unscented moisturizer - sunscreen (for face and for everything else; SPF 15+) - new or washed shower curtain liner (minimize bacteria, mold) - new toothbrushes (mouth is really vulnerable to infections, sores; oral hygiene is super-important) - another thermometer (since tracking temp matters) - at least one extra box of Kleenex - indiv packets of kleenexes (disappearance of nose hairs = dripping nose) - a box/packet of the flushable moist wipes (I use these wipes the first few days after chemo to prevent the discomfort/burning that may accompany urination; these may help soothe irritated tissues. Others use a squirt bottle.) - Thing of Clorox-type wipes - artificial tears for dry eyes (consider Renew or Similasan brands) - acidopholus capsules for yeast infections if you're prone to them - nonlatex gloves to wear when doing dishes, etc. to reduce nicks and cuts, at least on those low blood count days toward the end of treatment. Food - unsweetened indiv things of applesauce - individ things of cottage cheese (I find smaller servings less daunting on a queasy stomach, and may be less wasteful in the long haul) - Eggbeaters (bland, protein) - brown rice - crackers (inc indiv packets of animal crackers or Saltines to carry around or keep in desk drawer or nightstand for queasy moments. ER+ should watch out for soy -- it's in a lot of cracker sandwiches) - dried apricots and fruit (helps with constip) - lentil soup, black bean soup, chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles, orange Pedialyte For those of us facing hair loss: http://www.4women.com http://www.sparklingearth.com/products.asp?categor... http://www.bandanas.net/skullbest.htm http://www.myskullcaps.com/ http://www.sungrubbies.com Pointers on tying scarves: http://www.coveryourhair.com/HowToTieTiechels.html http://www.tznius.com/ This has more extensive scarf tying instructions (click on link in nav bar or at the bottom of the home page). - You Tube: search \"how to tie head wraps.\" The video is by galaxyswurl.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C.

Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation.

Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first. (See Starting Chemo May 2008 converation to get a sense of when, where and how much hair is lost over time!) Food. Protein and iron rich foods may help boost RBC: Meat chili, clams, oysters, some beans, nuts Here is a link for Summer Express: 101 meals to be prepared in 10 minutes or less. http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/18/dining/18mini.html?_r=1&scp=10&sq=100+recipes&st=nyt&oref=slogin And 101 fast recipes for inspired picnics http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/02/dining/02mlis.html?scp=2&sq=101+picnic&st=nyt Supplements: Check with a dietician or a nutritionist about supplements and multivitamins. (My A/C + T regimen may contribute to bone loss. I checked with MSKCC dietician & a nutritionist and they recommended I take Calcium Citrate, Magnesium, Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) during chemo (and forever) to combat bone loss. They said \"not during chemo\" to everything else, including a multivitamin. They also said \"never\" to most soy products [I am ER+] -- only 2 servings a week-- and Vitamin C supplements.)

Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.) The usual caveat applies: Not everything works for everybody! We all find our own path, admittedly, with the help of others on the path, and who have walked it before us. P.S. Keep moving (e.g., go for walks). I swear it helps! rockthebald, nyc. 43 (Today's my birthday!) Receiving treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering in 2008. IDC, DCIS, LCIS. 1.8 cm. Stage 1/2-ish (T1No (i+) or T1N1 (mx)) Chemo: dose-dense, A/C + T. A Pre-Chemo Shopping List None of this is \"new\" but it might be helpful to someone (like me) whose chemo started on short notice. - Purell-type hand-sanitizer. I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth. Warning: Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride -- like Crest pro-health -- may stain your teeth. Seriously.) - Imodium - Anticonstipation: Walnuts, pecans, almonds, dried apricots, prunes, prune juice, Colace, Miralax, Senekot-S, activia yogurt (No need to buy all of these. See what you need & what works for you!) - Pepcid - disposable flatware, plates and cups (for times when you're tired or immune-suppressed; plastic flatware helps offset metallic taste in mouth) - Sugarfree chewing gum, sugar free hard candy (some people prefer lemon flavor) or breath mints - Protein food sources (e.g., peanut butter, nuts, clams, oysters, meat, avoid soy if you are ER+) - unscented moisturizer - sunscreen (for face and for everything else; SPF 15+) - new or washed shower curtain liner (minimize bacteria, mold) - new toothbrushes (mouth is really vulnerable to infections, sores; oral hygiene is super-important) - another thermometer (since tracking temp matters) - at least one extra box of Kleenex - indiv packets of kleenexes (disappearance of nose hairs = dripping nose) - a box/packet of the flushable moist wipes (I use these wipes the first few days after chemo to prevent the discomfort/burning that may accompany urination; these may help soothe irritated tissues. Others use a squirt bottle.) - Thing of Clorox-type wipes - artificial tears for dry eyes (consider Renew or Similasan brands) - acidopholus capsules for yeast infections if you're prone to them - nonlatex gloves to wear when doing dishes, etc. to reduce nicks and cuts, at least on those low blood count days toward the end of treatment. Food - unsweetened indiv things of applesauce - individ things of cottage cheese (I find smaller servings less daunting on a queasy stomach, and may be less wasteful in the long haul) - Eggbeaters (bland, protein) - brown rice - crackers (inc indiv packets of animal crackers or Saltines to carry around or keep in desk drawer or nightstand for queasy moments. ER+ should watch out for soy -- it's in a lot of cracker sandwiches) - dried apricots and fruit (helps with constip) - lentil soup, black bean soup, chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles, orange Pedialyte For those of us facing hair loss: http://www.4women.com http://www.sparklingearth.com/products.asp?categor... http://www.bandanas.net/skullbest.htm http://www.myskullcaps.com/ http://www.sungrubbies.com Pointers on tying scarves: http://www.coveryourhair.com/HowToTieTiechels.html http://www.tznius.com/ This has more extensive scarf tying instructions (click on link in nav bar or at the bottom of the home page). - You Tube: search \"how to tie head wraps.\" The video is by galaxyswurl.

I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.) The usual caveat applies: Not everything works for everybody! We all find our own path, admittedly, with the help of others on the path, and who have walked it before us. P.S. Keep moving (e.g., go for walks). I swear it helps! rockthebald, nyc. 43 (Today's my birthday!) Receiving treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering in 2008. IDC, DCIS, LCIS. 1.8 cm. Stage 1/2-ish (T1No (i+) or T1N1 (mx)) Chemo: dose-dense, A/C + T. A Pre-Chemo Shopping List None of this is \"new\" but it might be helpful to someone (like me) whose chemo started on short notice. - Purell-type hand-sanitizer. I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth. Warning: Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride -- like Crest pro-health -- may stain your teeth. Seriously.) - Imodium - Anticonstipation: Walnuts, pecans, almonds, dried apricots, prunes, prune juice, Colace, Miralax, Senekot-S, activia yogurt (No need to buy all of these. See what you need & what works for you!) - Pepcid - disposable flatware, plates and cups (for times when you're tired or immune-suppressed; plastic flatware helps offset metallic taste in mouth) - Sugarfree chewing gum, sugar free hard candy (some people prefer lemon flavor) or breath mints - Protein food sources (e.g., peanut butter, nuts, clams, oysters, meat, avoid soy if you are ER+) - unscented moisturizer - sunscreen (for face and for everything else; SPF 15+) - new or washed shower curtain liner (minimize bacteria, mold) - new toothbrushes (mouth is really vulnerable to infections, sores; oral hygiene is super-important) - another thermometer (since tracking temp matters) - at least one extra box of Kleenex - indiv packets of kleenexes (disappearance of nose hairs = dripping nose) - a box/packet of the flushable moist wipes (I use these wipes the first few days after chemo to prevent the discomfort/burning that may accompany urination; these may help soothe irritated tissues. Others use a squirt bottle.) - Thing of Clorox-type wipes - artificial tears for dry eyes (consider Renew or Similasan brands) - acidopholus capsules for yeast infections if you're prone to them - nonlatex gloves to wear when doing dishes, etc. to reduce nicks and cuts, at least on those low blood count days toward the end of treatment. Food - unsweetened indiv things of applesauce - individ things of cottage cheese (I find smaller servings less daunting on a queasy stomach, and may be less wasteful in the long haul) - Eggbeaters (bland, protein) - brown rice - crackers (inc indiv packets of animal crackers or Saltines to carry around or keep in desk drawer or nightstand for queasy moments. ER+ should watch out for soy -- it's in a lot of cracker sandwiches) - dried apricots and fruit (helps with constip) - lentil soup, black bean soup, chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles, orange Pedialyte For those of us facing hair loss: http://www.4women.com http://www.sparklingearth.com/products.asp?categor... http://www.bandanas.net/skullbest.htm http://www.myskullcaps.com/ http://www.sungrubbies.com Pointers on tying scarves: http://www.coveryourhair.com/HowToTieTiechels.html http://www.tznius.com/ This has more extensive scarf tying instructions (click on link in nav bar or at the bottom of the home page). - You Tube: search \"how to tie head wraps.\" The video is by galaxyswurl.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first. (See Starting Chemo May 2008 converation to get a sense of when, where and how much hair is lost over time!) Food.

(My A/C + T regimen may contribute to bone loss. I checked with MSKCC dietician & a nutritionist and they recommended I take Calcium Citrate, Magnesium, Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) during chemo (and forever) to combat bone loss. They said \"not during chemo\" to everything else, including a multivitamin. They also said \"never\" to most soy products [I am ER+] -- only 2 servings a week-- and Vitamin C supplements.)

The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first. (See Starting Chemo May 2008 converation to get a sense of when, where and how much hair is lost over time!) Food.

Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.) The usual caveat applies: Not everything works for everybody! We all find our own path, admittedly, with the help of others on the path, and who have walked it before us. P.S. Keep moving (e.g., go for walks). I swear it helps! rockthebald, nyc. 43 (Today's my birthday!) Receiving treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering in 2008. IDC, DCIS, LCIS. 1.8 cm. Stage 1/2-ish (T1No (i+) or T1N1 (mx)) Chemo: dose-dense, A/C + T. A Pre-Chemo Shopping List None of this is \"new\" but it might be helpful to someone (like me) whose chemo started on short notice. - Purell-type hand-sanitizer. I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth. Warning: Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride -- like Crest pro-health -- may stain your teeth. Seriously.) - Imodium - Anticonstipation: Walnuts, pecans, almonds, dried apricots, prunes, prune juice, Colace, Miralax, Senekot-S, activia yogurt (No need to buy all of these. See what you need & what works for you!) - Pepcid - disposable flatware, plates and cups (for times when you're tired or immune-suppressed; plastic flatware helps offset metallic taste in mouth) - Sugarfree chewing gum, sugar free hard candy (some people prefer lemon flavor) or breath mints - Protein food sources (e.g., peanut butter, nuts, clams, oysters, meat, avoid soy if you are ER+) - unscented moisturizer - sunscreen (for face and for everything else; SPF 15+) - new or washed shower curtain liner (minimize bacteria, mold) - new toothbrushes (mouth is really vulnerable to infections, sores; oral hygiene is super-important) - another thermometer (since tracking temp matters) - at least one extra box of Kleenex - indiv packets of kleenexes (disappearance of nose hairs = dripping nose) - a box/packet of the flushable moist wipes (I use these wipes the first few days after chemo to prevent the discomfort/burning that may accompany urination; these may help soothe irritated tissues. Others use a squirt bottle.) - Thing of Clorox-type wipes - artificial tears for dry eyes (consider Renew or Similasan brands) - acidopholus capsules for yeast infections if you're prone to them - nonlatex gloves to wear when doing dishes, etc. to reduce nicks and cuts, at least on those low blood count days toward the end of treatment. Food - unsweetened indiv things of applesauce - individ things of cottage cheese (I find smaller servings less daunting on a queasy stomach, and may be less wasteful in the long haul) - Eggbeaters (bland, protein) - brown rice - crackers (inc indiv packets of animal crackers or Saltines to carry around or keep in desk drawer or nightstand for queasy moments. ER+ should watch out for soy -- it's in a lot of cracker sandwiches) - dried apricots and fruit (helps with constip) - lentil soup, black bean soup, chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles, orange Pedialyte For those of us facing hair loss: http://www.4women.com http://www.sparklingearth.com/products.asp?categor... http://www.bandanas.net/skullbest.htm http://www.myskullcaps.com/ http://www.sungrubbies.com Pointers on tying scarves: http://www.coveryourhair.com/HowToTieTiechels.html http://www.tznius.com/ This has more extensive scarf tying instructions (click on link in nav bar or at the bottom of the home page). - You Tube: search \"how to tie head wraps.\" The video is by galaxyswurl.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation.

Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first. (See Starting Chemo May 2008 converation to get a sense of when, where and how much hair is lost over time!) Food.

I checked with MSKCC dietician & a nutritionist and they recommended I take Calcium Citrate, Magnesium, Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) during chemo (and forever) to combat bone loss. They said \"not during chemo\" to everything else, including a multivitamin. They also said \"never\" to most soy products [I am ER+] -- only 2 servings a week-- and Vitamin C supplements.)

Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.) The usual caveat applies: Not everything works for everybody! We all find our own path, admittedly, with the help of others on the path, and who have walked it before us. P.S. Keep moving (e.g., go for walks). I swear it helps! rockthebald, nyc. 43 (Today's my birthday!) Receiving treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering in 2008. IDC, DCIS, LCIS. 1.8 cm. Stage 1/2-ish (T1No (i+) or T1N1 (mx)) Chemo: dose-dense, A/C + T. A Pre-Chemo Shopping List None of this is \"new\" but it might be helpful to someone (like me) whose chemo started on short notice. - Purell-type hand-sanitizer. I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth. Warning: Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride -- like Crest pro-health -- may stain your teeth. Seriously.) - Imodium - Anticonstipation: Walnuts, pecans, almonds, dried apricots, prunes, prune juice, Colace, Miralax, Senekot-S, activia yogurt (No need to buy all of these. See what you need & what works for you!) - Pepcid - disposable flatware, plates and cups (for times when you're tired or immune-suppressed; plastic flatware helps offset metallic taste in mouth) - Sugarfree chewing gum, sugar free hard candy (some people prefer lemon flavor) or breath mints - Protein food sources (e.g., peanut butter, nuts, clams, oysters, meat, avoid soy if you are ER+) - unscented moisturizer - sunscreen (for face and for everything else; SPF 15+) - new or washed shower curtain liner (minimize bacteria, mold) - new toothbrushes (mouth is really vulnerable to infections, sores; oral hygiene is super-important) - another thermometer (since tracking temp matters) - at least one extra box of Kleenex - indiv packets of kleenexes (disappearance of nose hairs = dripping nose) - a box/packet of the flushable moist wipes (I use these wipes the first few days after chemo to prevent the discomfort/burning that may accompany urination; these may help soothe irritated tissues. Others use a squirt bottle.) - Thing of Clorox-type wipes - artificial tears for dry eyes (consider Renew or Similasan brands) - acidopholus capsules for yeast infections if you're prone to them - nonlatex gloves to wear when doing dishes, etc. to reduce nicks and cuts, at least on those low blood count days toward the end of treatment. Food - unsweetened indiv things of applesauce - individ things of cottage cheese (I find smaller servings less daunting on a queasy stomach, and may be less wasteful in the long haul) - Eggbeaters (bland, protein) - brown rice - crackers (inc indiv packets of animal crackers or Saltines to carry around or keep in desk drawer or nightstand for queasy moments. ER+ should watch out for soy -- it's in a lot of cracker sandwiches) - dried apricots and fruit (helps with constip) - lentil soup, black bean soup, chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles, orange Pedialyte For those of us facing hair loss: http://www.4women.com http://www.sparklingearth.com/products.asp?categor... http://www.bandanas.net/skullbest.htm http://www.myskullcaps.com/ http://www.sungrubbies.com Pointers on tying scarves: http://www.coveryourhair.com/HowToTieTiechels.html http://www.tznius.com/ This has more extensive scarf tying instructions (click on link in nav bar or at the bottom of the home page). - You Tube: search \"how to tie head wraps.\" The video is by galaxyswurl.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom.

I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth. Warning: Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride -- like Crest pro-health -- may stain your teeth. Seriously.) - Imodium - Anticonstipation: Walnuts, pecans, almonds, dried apricots, prunes, prune juice, Colace, Miralax, Senekot-S, activia yogurt (No need to buy all of these. See what you need & what works for you!) - Pepcid - disposable flatware, plates and cups (for times when you're tired or immune-suppressed; plastic flatware helps offset metallic taste in mouth) - Sugarfree chewing gum, sugar free hard candy (some people prefer lemon flavor) or breath mints - Protein food sources (e.g., peanut butter, nuts, clams, oysters, meat, avoid soy if you are ER+) - unscented moisturizer - sunscreen (for face and for everything else; SPF 15+) - new or washed shower curtain liner (minimize bacteria, mold) - new toothbrushes (mouth is really vulnerable to infections, sores; oral hygiene is super-important) - another thermometer (since tracking temp matters) - at least one extra box of Kleenex - indiv packets of kleenexes (disappearance of nose hairs = dripping nose) - a box/packet of the flushable moist wipes (I use these wipes the first few days after chemo to prevent the discomfort/burning that may accompany urination; these may help soothe irritated tissues. Others use a squirt bottle.) - Thing of Clorox-type wipes - artificial tears for dry eyes (consider Renew or Similasan brands) - acidopholus capsules for yeast infections if you're prone to them - nonlatex gloves to wear when doing dishes, etc. to reduce nicks and cuts, at least on those low blood count days toward the end of treatment. Food - unsweetened indiv things of applesauce - individ things of cottage cheese (I find smaller servings less daunting on a queasy stomach, and may be less wasteful in the long haul) - Eggbeaters (bland, protein) - brown rice - crackers (inc indiv packets of animal crackers or Saltines to carry around or keep in desk drawer or nightstand for queasy moments. ER+ should watch out for soy -- it's in a lot of cracker sandwiches) - dried apricots and fruit (helps with constip) - lentil soup, black bean soup, chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles, orange Pedialyte For those of us facing hair loss: http://www.4women.com http://www.sparklingearth.com/products.asp?categor... http://www.bandanas.net/skullbest.htm http://www.myskullcaps.com/ http://www.sungrubbies.com Pointers on tying scarves: http://www.coveryourhair.com/HowToTieTiechels.html http://www.tznius.com/ This has more extensive scarf tying instructions (click on link in nav bar or at the bottom of the home page). - You Tube: search \"how to tie head wraps.\" The video is by galaxyswurl.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first. (See Starting Chemo May 2008 converation to get a sense of when, where and how much hair is lost over time!) Food.

I checked with MSKCC dietician & a nutritionist and they recommended I take Calcium Citrate, Magnesium, Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) during chemo (and forever) to combat bone loss. They said \"not during chemo\" to everything else, including a multivitamin. They also said \"never\" to most soy products [I am ER+] -- only 2 servings a week-- and Vitamin C supplements.)

Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.) The usual caveat applies: Not everything works for everybody! We all find our own path, admittedly, with the help of others on the path, and who have walked it before us. P.S.

Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first.

      "Content": "rock wrote: These lists may be read in conjunction with the conversation created by www.breastcancer.org member Melissaga (\"Tips for Getting Through Chemotherapy\") on December 6th, 2006. Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.) The usual caveat applies: Not everything works for everybody! We all find our own path, admittedly, with the help of others on the path, and who have walked it before us. P.S. Keep moving (e.g., go for walks). I swear it helps! rockthebald, nyc. 43 (Today's my birthday!) Receiving treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering in 2008. IDC, DCIS, LCIS. 1.8 cm. Stage 1/2-ish (T1No (i+) or T1N1 (mx)) Chemo: dose-dense, A/C + T. A Pre-Chemo Shopping List None of this is \"new\" but it might be helpful to someone (like me) whose chemo started on short notice. - Purell-type hand-sanitizer. I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth. Warning: Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride -- like Crest pro-health -- may stain your teeth. Seriously.) - Imodium - Anticonstipation: Walnuts, pecans, almonds, dried apricots, prunes, prune juice, Colace, Miralax, Senekot-S, activia yogurt (No need to buy all of these. See what you need & what works for you!) - Pepcid - disposable flatware, plates and cups (for times when you're tired or immune-suppressed; plastic flatware helps offset metallic taste in mouth) - Sugarfree chewing gum, sugar free hard candy (some people prefer lemon flavor) or breath mints - Protein food sources (e.g., peanut butter, nuts, clams, oysters, meat, avoid soy if you are ER+) - unscented moisturizer - sunscreen (for face and for everything else; SPF 15+) - new or washed shower curtain liner (minimize bacteria, mold) - new toothbrushes (mouth is really vulnerable to infections, sores; oral hygiene is super-important) - another thermometer (since tracking temp matters) - at least one extra box of Kleenex - indiv packets of kleenexes (disappearance of nose hairs = dripping nose) - a box/packet of the flushable moist wipes (I use these wipes the first few days after chemo to prevent the discomfort/burning that may accompany urination; these may help soothe irritated tissues. Others use a squirt bottle.) - Thing of Clorox-type wipes - artificial tears for dry eyes (consider Renew or Similasan brands) - acidopholus capsules for yeast infections if you're prone to them - nonlatex gloves to wear when doing dishes, etc. to reduce nicks and cuts, at least on those low blood count days toward the end of treatment. Food - unsweetened indiv things of applesauce - individ things of cottage cheese (I find smaller servings less daunting on a queasy stomach, and may be less wasteful in the long haul) - Eggbeaters (bland, protein) - brown rice - crackers (inc indiv packets of animal crackers or Saltines to carry around or keep in desk drawer or nightstand for queasy moments. ER+ should watch out for soy -- it's in a lot of cracker sandwiches) - dried apricots and fruit (helps with constip) - lentil soup, black bean soup, chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles, orange Pedialyte For those of us facing hair loss: http://www.4women.com http://www.sparklingearth.com/products.asp?categor... http://www.bandanas.net/skullbest.htm http://www.myskullcaps.com/ http://www.sungrubbies.com Pointers on tying scarves: http://www.coveryourhair.com/HowToTieTiechels.html http://www.tznius.com/ This has more extensive scarf tying instructions (click on link in nav bar or at the bottom of the home page). - You Tube: search \"how to tie head wraps.\" The video is by galaxyswurl.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge!

      "Content": "May 23, 2009 10:19AM rock wrote: I had my LEEP/LLETZ procedure last Thursday. I had minimal discharge, only a few days of pain. Was tired, but everything was going smoothly. About two days ago, though, I started to bleed bright red blood. Not a lot, but steady. I can actually feel it come out of my body. (Am really questioning my decision to have all white bedding, I might add.) I mentioned this to my gynecologist (the bleeding, not the sheets) and she said, \"Hmmmm, I wouldn't expect you to have that.\" But didn't seem terribly concerned. I am kind of tired, though, and am wondering if the blood loss is enough to affect me insofar as I'm already a little challenged in the red cell department. (RBC = 3.7, Hemoglobin in the 11-range). No fever. Anyway, if you are so inclined share your thoughts, I am very much inclined to welcome them! Merci beaucoup, and wishing you the best Friday in recorded human history. Much love, Her reply:  Now- for the bleeding. Somehow I had not processed beforehand that you were having a hysteroscopy as well. I know it was a crucial piece of data--and the absolutely correct thing to have done. So--possible bleeding sources: Uterus and Cervix Because you are \"estrogen deficient\"--I doubt that the bleeding is coming from your uterus. The lining of an estrogen deficient (how about a less negative term--progesterone dominant) uterus would be very thin--not a lot of possible bleeding tissue. If you had developed a post-op infection, you might bleed a little. But if your uterus had a post-op infection, you should be feeling increasing lower abd discomfort and or cramps and or fever. So--the cervix has a crater where the transformation zone was removed. Typically they will use a combination of thermal cautery and chemical cautery to keep you from bleeding right after the procedure. The tissue and residual chemical cautery (Monsel's solution) form an \"eschar\". (Basically, a blackish scab.) Usually, this falls off in small pieces, and you would see fragments on your pad. IF you have lost the eschar that was overlying a blood vessel, that could bleed quite freely. We usually recommend that people avoid heavy lifting for several days. Also , no sex and \"nothing in the vagina\" for up to 3 weeks--so, no tampons. The idea is to NOT trap bacteria up against the raw cervix. BUT: This might be an occasion where the judicious use of a tampon could prove helpful. The idea is that we could use the tampon to provide pressure against the surface vessel that is bleeding. Tampons tend to be dry, and your vagina may feel dry. The tampon might then stick to the cervix, and cause more problems when you remove it (pulling more eschar off). BUT--you could apply some type of KY to the tampon--especially the end. Without looking, I can't tell you for sure what is bleeding. You knew your Hemoglobin and RBC counts--how about platelets? Platelets clot to stop bleeding. Aspirin makes platelets not function as well. Are you taking any aspirin, or any type of headache medicine? (Or any herbal tea that someone specifically suggested?) The chemical name for aspirin is salicylate or salicylic acid. Check your meds or supplements. There might even be some kinds of foods that contain salicylate--I am ignorant in this regard! (They would have a folklore reputation for aiding pain relief.) I have also had people whose platelets seemed very susceptible to ibuprofen as well. Are you having any easy bruising? Now--how to judge how much you are bleeding--if you are soaking a pad in an hour, that is the kind of bleeding that should be evaluated. The doctor needs to LOOK. A pad in 4 hours? If that doesn't slow down in 24 hours, I recommend calling her again. A pad every 6-8 hours--I think we might be able to talk it into stopping. I think you could be tired for lots of reasons--not sleeping well because you are worried about your bleeding, overall stress of making it through this kind of chapter in your health care in a country other than your native land, etc. I think you would have been able to tell if you were losing too much blood. Nutritionally, red meat or liver helps boost iron stores. Does this help? Let me know how you are doing! Mary (So far, it is a beautiful Friday, and I am not on call for the weekend.)",

Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.) The usual caveat applies: Not everything works for everybody! We all find our own path, admittedly, with the help of others on the path, and who have walked it before us. P.S. Keep moving (e.g., go for walks). I swear it helps! rockthebald, nyc. 43 (Today's my birthday!) Receiving treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering in 2008. IDC, DCIS, LCIS. 1.8 cm. Stage 1/2-ish (T1No (i+) or T1N1 (mx)) Chemo: dose-dense, A/C + T. A Pre-Chemo Shopping List None of this is \"new\" but it might be helpful to someone (like me) whose chemo started on short notice. - Purell-type hand-sanitizer. I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth. Warning: Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride -- like Crest pro-health -- may stain your teeth. Seriously.) - Imodium - Anticonstipation: Walnuts, pecans, almonds, dried apricots, prunes, prune juice, Colace, Miralax, Senekot-S, activia yogurt (No need to buy all of these. See what you need & what works for you!) - Pepcid - disposable flatware, plates and cups (for times when you're tired or immune-suppressed; plastic flatware helps offset metallic taste in mouth) - Sugarfree chewing gum, sugar free hard candy (some people prefer lemon flavor) or breath mints - Protein food sources (e.g., peanut butter, nuts, clams, oysters, meat, avoid soy if you are ER+) - unscented moisturizer - sunscreen (for face and for everything else; SPF 15+) - new or washed shower curtain liner (minimize bacteria, mold) - new toothbrushes (mouth is really vulnerable to infections, sores; oral hygiene is super-important) - another thermometer (since tracking temp matters) - at least one extra box of Kleenex - indiv packets of kleenexes (disappearance of nose hairs = dripping nose) - a box/packet of the flushable moist wipes (I use these wipes the first few days after chemo to prevent the discomfort/burning that may accompany urination; these may help soothe irritated tissues. Others use a squirt bottle.) - Thing of Clorox-type wipes - artificial tears for dry eyes (consider Renew or Similasan brands) - acidopholus capsules for yeast infections if you're prone to them - nonlatex gloves to wear when doing dishes, etc. to reduce nicks and cuts, at least on those low blood count days toward the end of treatment. Food - unsweetened indiv things of applesauce - individ things of cottage cheese (I find smaller servings less daunting on a queasy stomach, and may be less wasteful in the long haul) - Eggbeaters (bland, protein) - brown rice - crackers (inc indiv packets of animal crackers or Saltines to carry around or keep in desk drawer or nightstand for queasy moments. ER+ should watch out for soy -- it's in a lot of cracker sandwiches) - dried apricots and fruit (helps with constip) - lentil soup, black bean soup, chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles, orange Pedialyte For those of us facing hair loss: http://www.4women.com http://www.sparklingearth.com/products.asp?categor... http://www.bandanas.net/skullbest.htm http://www.myskullcaps.com/ http://www.sungrubbies.com Pointers on tying scarves: http://www.coveryourhair.com/HowToTieTiechels.html http://www.tznius.com/ This has more extensive scarf tying instructions (click on link in nav bar or at the bottom of the home page). - You Tube: search \"how to tie head wraps.\" The video is by galaxyswurl.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first. (See Starting Chemo May 2008 converation to get a sense of when, where and how much hair is lost over time!) Food. Protein and iron rich foods may help boost RBC: Meat chili, clams, oysters, some beans, nuts Here is a link for Summer Express: 101 meals to be prepared in 10 minutes or less. http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/18/dining/18mini.html?_r=1&scp=10&sq=100+recipes&st=nyt&oref=slogin And 101 fast recipes for inspired picnics http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/02/dining/02mlis.html?scp=2&sq=101+picnic&st=nyt Supplements: Check with a dietician or a nutritionist about supplements and multivitamins. (My A/C + T regimen may contribute to bone loss. I checked with MSKCC dietician & a nutritionist and they recommended I take Calcium Citrate, Magnesium, Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) during chemo (and forever) to combat bone loss. They said \"not during chemo\" to everything else, including a multivitamin. They also said \"never\" to most soy products [I am ER+] -- only 2 servings a week-- and Vitamin C supplements.)

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first. (See Starting Chemo May 2008 converation to get a sense of when, where and how much hair is lost over time!) Food. Protein and iron rich foods may help boost RBC: Meat chili, clams, oysters, some beans, nuts Here is a link for Summer Express: 101 meals to be prepared in 10 minutes or less. http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/18/dining/18mini.html?_r=1&scp=10&sq=100+recipes&st=nyt&oref=slogin And 101 fast recipes for inspired picnics http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/02/dining/02mlis.html?scp=2&sq=101+picnic&st=nyt Supplements: Check with a dietician or a nutritionist about supplements and multivitamins. (My A/C + T regimen may contribute to bone loss. I checked with MSKCC dietician & a nutritionist and they recommended I take Calcium Citrate, Magnesium, Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) during chemo (and forever) to combat bone loss. They said \"not during chemo\" to everything else, including a multivitamin. They also said \"never\" to most soy products [I am ER+] -- only 2 servings a week-- and Vitamin C supplements.)

      "Content": "rock wrote: These lists may be read in conjunction with the conversation created by www.breastcancer.org member Melissaga (\"Tips for Getting Through Chemotherapy\") on December 6th, 2006. Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.) The usual caveat applies: Not everything works for everybody! We all find our own path, admittedly, with the help of others on the path, and who have walked it before us. P.S.

A Pre-Chemo Shopping List None of this is \"new\" but it might be helpful to someone (like me) whose chemo started on short notice. - Purell-type hand-sanitizer. I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth. Warning: Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride -- like Crest pro-health -- may stain your teeth. Seriously.) - Imodium - Anticonstipation: Walnuts, pecans, almonds, dried apricots, prunes, prune juice, Colace, Miralax, Senekot-S, activia yogurt (No need to buy all of these. See what you need & what works for you!) - Pepcid - disposable flatware, plates and cups (for times when you're tired or immune-suppressed; plastic flatware helps offset metallic taste in mouth) - Sugarfree chewing gum, sugar free hard candy (some people prefer lemon flavor) or breath mints - Protein food sources (e.g., peanut butter, nuts, clams, oysters, meat, avoid soy if you are ER+) - unscented moisturizer - sunscreen (for face and for everything else; SPF 15+) - new or washed shower curtain liner (minimize bacteria, mold) - new toothbrushes (mouth is really vulnerable to infections, sores; oral hygiene is super-important) - another thermometer (since tracking temp matters) - at least one extra box of Kleenex - indiv packets of kleenexes (disappearance of nose hairs = dripping nose) - a box/packet of the flushable moist wipes (I use these wipes the first few days after chemo to prevent the discomfort/burning that may accompany urination; these may help soothe irritated tissues.

And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first. (See Starting Chemo May 2008 converation to get a sense of when, where and how much hair is lost over time!) Food.

Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.) The usual caveat applies: Not everything works for everybody! We all find our own path, admittedly, with the help of others on the path, and who have walked it before us. P.S. Keep moving (e.g., go for walks). I swear it helps! rockthebald, nyc. 43 (Today's my birthday!) Receiving treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering in 2008. IDC, DCIS, LCIS. 1.8 cm. Stage 1/2-ish (T1No (i+) or T1N1 (mx)) Chemo: dose-dense, A/C + T. A Pre-Chemo Shopping List None of this is \"new\" but it might be helpful to someone (like me) whose chemo started on short notice. - Purell-type hand-sanitizer. I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth. Warning: Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride -- like Crest pro-health -- may stain your teeth. Seriously.) - Imodium - Anticonstipation: Walnuts, pecans, almonds, dried apricots, prunes, prune juice, Colace, Miralax, Senekot-S, activia yogurt (No need to buy all of these. See what you need & what works for you!) - Pepcid - disposable flatware, plates and cups (for times when you're tired or immune-suppressed; plastic flatware helps offset metallic taste in mouth) - Sugarfree chewing gum, sugar free hard candy (some people prefer lemon flavor) or breath mints - Protein food sources (e.g., peanut butter, nuts, clams, oysters, meat, avoid soy if you are ER+) - unscented moisturizer - sunscreen (for face and for everything else; SPF 15+) - new or washed shower curtain liner (minimize bacteria, mold) - new toothbrushes (mouth is really vulnerable to infections, sores; oral hygiene is super-important) - another thermometer (since tracking temp matters) - at least one extra box of Kleenex - indiv packets of kleenexes (disappearance of nose hairs = dripping nose) - a box/packet of the flushable moist wipes (I use these wipes the first few days after chemo to prevent the discomfort/burning that may accompany urination; these may help soothe irritated tissues. Others use a squirt bottle.) - Thing of Clorox-type wipes - artificial tears for dry eyes (consider Renew or Similasan brands) - acidopholus capsules for yeast infections if you're prone to them - nonlatex gloves to wear when doing dishes, etc. to reduce nicks and cuts, at least on those low blood count days toward the end of treatment. Food - unsweetened indiv things of applesauce - individ things of cottage cheese (I find smaller servings less daunting on a queasy stomach, and may be less wasteful in the long haul) - Eggbeaters (bland, protein) - brown rice - crackers (inc indiv packets of animal crackers or Saltines to carry around or keep in desk drawer or nightstand for queasy moments. ER+ should watch out for soy -- it's in a lot of cracker sandwiches) - dried apricots and fruit (helps with constip) - lentil soup, black bean soup, chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles, orange Pedialyte For those of us facing hair loss: http://www.4women.com http://www.sparklingearth.com/products.asp?categor... http://www.bandanas.net/skullbest.htm http://www.myskullcaps.com/ http://www.sungrubbies.com Pointers on tying scarves: http://www.coveryourhair.com/HowToTieTiechels.html http://www.tznius.com/ This has more extensive scarf tying instructions (click on link in nav bar or at the bottom of the home page). - You Tube: search \"how to tie head wraps.\" The video is by galaxyswurl.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation.

The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?)

I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first. (See Starting Chemo May 2008 converation to get a sense of when, where and how much hair is lost over time!) Food.

Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.) The usual caveat applies: Not everything works for everybody! We all find our own path, admittedly, with the help of others on the path, and who have walked it before us. P.S. Keep moving (e.g., go for walks). I swear it helps! rockthebald, nyc. 43 (Today's my birthday!) Receiving treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering in 2008. IDC, DCIS, LCIS. 1.8 cm. Stage 1/2-ish (T1No (i+) or T1N1 (mx)) Chemo: dose-dense, A/C + T. A Pre-Chemo Shopping List None of this is \"new\" but it might be helpful to someone (like me) whose chemo started on short notice. - Purell-type hand-sanitizer. I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth. Warning: Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride -- like Crest pro-health -- may stain your teeth. Seriously.) - Imodium - Anticonstipation: Walnuts, pecans, almonds, dried apricots, prunes, prune juice, Colace, Miralax, Senekot-S, activia yogurt (No need to buy all of these. See what you need & what works for you!) - Pepcid - disposable flatware, plates and cups (for times when you're tired or immune-suppressed; plastic flatware helps offset metallic taste in mouth) - Sugarfree chewing gum, sugar free hard candy (some people prefer lemon flavor) or breath mints - Protein food sources (e.g., peanut butter, nuts, clams, oysters, meat, avoid soy if you are ER+) - unscented moisturizer - sunscreen (for face and for everything else; SPF 15+) - new or washed shower curtain liner (minimize bacteria, mold) - new toothbrushes (mouth is really vulnerable to infections, sores; oral hygiene is super-important) - another thermometer (since tracking temp matters) - at least one extra box of Kleenex - indiv packets of kleenexes (disappearance of nose hairs = dripping nose) - a box/packet of the flushable moist wipes (I use these wipes the first few days after chemo to prevent the discomfort/burning that may accompany urination; these may help soothe irritated tissues. Others use a squirt bottle.) - Thing of Clorox-type wipes - artificial tears for dry eyes (consider Renew or Similasan brands) - acidopholus capsules for yeast infections if you're prone to them - nonlatex gloves to wear when doing dishes, etc. to reduce nicks and cuts, at least on those low blood count days toward the end of treatment. Food - unsweetened indiv things of applesauce - individ things of cottage cheese (I find smaller servings less daunting on a queasy stomach, and may be less wasteful in the long haul) - Eggbeaters (bland, protein) - brown rice - crackers (inc indiv packets of animal crackers or Saltines to carry around or keep in desk drawer or nightstand for queasy moments. ER+ should watch out for soy -- it's in a lot of cracker sandwiches) - dried apricots and fruit (helps with constip) - lentil soup, black bean soup, chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles, orange Pedialyte For those of us facing hair loss: http://www.4women.com http://www.sparklingearth.com/products.asp?categor... http://www.bandanas.net/skullbest.htm http://www.myskullcaps.com/ http://www.sungrubbies.com Pointers on tying scarves: http://www.coveryourhair.com/HowToTieTiechels.html http://www.tznius.com/ This has more extensive scarf tying instructions (click on link in nav bar or at the bottom of the home page). - You Tube: search \"how to tie head wraps.\" The video is by galaxyswurl.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first. (See Starting Chemo May 2008 converation to get a sense of when, where and how much hair is lost over time!) Food. Protein and iron rich foods may help boost RBC: Meat chili, clams, oysters, some beans, nuts Here is a link for Summer Express: 101 meals to be prepared in 10 minutes or less. http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/18/dining/18mini.html?_r=1&scp=10&sq=100+recipes&st=nyt&oref=slogin And 101 fast recipes for inspired picnics http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/02/dining/02mlis.html?scp=2&sq=101+picnic&st=nyt Supplements: Check with a dietician or a nutritionist about supplements and multivitamins. (My A/C + T regimen may contribute to bone loss. I checked with MSKCC dietician & a nutritionist and they recommended I take Calcium Citrate, Magnesium, Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) during chemo (and forever) to combat bone loss. They said \"not during chemo\" to everything else, including a multivitamin. They also said \"never\" to most soy products [I am ER+] -- only 2 servings a week-- and Vitamin C supplements.)

Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.) The usual caveat applies: Not everything works for everybody! We all find our own path, admittedly, with the help of others on the path, and who have walked it before us. P.S.

      "Content": "rock wrote: These lists may be read in conjunction with the conversation created by www.breastcancer.org member Melissaga (\"Tips for Getting Through Chemotherapy\") on December 6th, 2006. Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.) The usual caveat applies: Not everything works for everybody! We all find our own path, admittedly, with the help of others on the path, and who have walked it before us. P.S. Keep moving (e.g., go for walks). I swear it helps! rockthebald, nyc. 43 (Today's my birthday!) Receiving treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering in 2008. IDC, DCIS, LCIS. 1.8 cm. Stage 1/2-ish (T1No (i+) or T1N1 (mx)) Chemo: dose-dense, A/C + T. A Pre-Chemo Shopping List None of this is \"new\" but it might be helpful to someone (like me) whose chemo started on short notice. - Purell-type hand-sanitizer. I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth. Warning: Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride -- like Crest pro-health -- may stain your teeth. Seriously.) - Imodium - Anticonstipation: Walnuts, pecans, almonds, dried apricots, prunes, prune juice, Colace, Miralax, Senekot-S, activia yogurt (No need to buy all of these. See what you need & what works for you!) - Pepcid - disposable flatware, plates and cups (for times when you're tired or immune-suppressed; plastic flatware helps offset metallic taste in mouth) - Sugarfree chewing gum, sugar free hard candy (some people prefer lemon flavor) or breath mints - Protein food sources (e.g., peanut butter, nuts, clams, oysters, meat, avoid soy if you are ER+) - unscented moisturizer - sunscreen (for face and for everything else; SPF 15+) - new or washed shower curtain liner (minimize bacteria, mold) - new toothbrushes (mouth is really vulnerable to infections, sores; oral hygiene is super-important) - another thermometer (since tracking temp matters) - at least one extra box of Kleenex - indiv packets of kleenexes (disappearance of nose hairs = dripping nose) - a box/packet of the flushable moist wipes (I use these wipes the first few days after chemo to prevent the discomfort/burning that may accompany urination; these may help soothe irritated tissues. Others use a squirt bottle.) - Thing of Clorox-type wipes - artificial tears for dry eyes (consider Renew or Similasan brands) - acidopholus capsules for yeast infections if you're prone to them - nonlatex gloves to wear when doing dishes, etc. to reduce nicks and cuts, at least on those low blood count days toward the end of treatment. Food - unsweetened indiv things of applesauce - individ things of cottage cheese (I find smaller servings less daunting on a queasy stomach, and may be less wasteful in the long haul) - Eggbeaters (bland, protein) - brown rice - crackers (inc indiv packets of animal crackers or Saltines to carry around or keep in desk drawer or nightstand for queasy moments. ER+ should watch out for soy -- it's in a lot of cracker sandwiches) - dried apricots and fruit (helps with constip) - lentil soup, black bean soup, chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles, orange Pedialyte For those of us facing hair loss: http://www.4women.com http://www.sparklingearth.com/products.asp?categor... http://www.bandanas.net/skullbest.htm http://www.myskullcaps.com/ http://www.sungrubbies.com Pointers on tying scarves: http://www.coveryourhair.com/HowToTieTiechels.html http://www.tznius.com/ This has more extensive scarf tying instructions (click on link in nav bar or at the bottom of the home page). - You Tube: search \"how to tie head wraps.\" The video is by galaxyswurl.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out!

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first. (See Starting Chemo May 2008 converation to get a sense of when, where and how much hair is lost over time!) Food. Protein and iron rich foods may help boost RBC: Meat chili, clams, oysters, some beans, nuts Here is a link for Summer Express: 101 meals to be prepared in 10 minutes or less. http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/18/dining/18mini.html?_r=1&scp=10&sq=100+recipes&st=nyt&oref=slogin And 101 fast recipes for inspired picnics http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/02/dining/02mlis.html?scp=2&sq=101+picnic&st=nyt Supplements: Check with a dietician or a nutritionist about supplements and multivitamins. (My A/C + T regimen may contribute to bone loss. I checked with MSKCC dietician & a nutritionist and they recommended I take Calcium Citrate, Magnesium, Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) during chemo (and forever) to combat bone loss. They said \"not during chemo\" to everything else, including a multivitamin. They also said \"never\" to most soy products [I am ER+] -- only 2 servings a week-- and Vitamin C supplements.)

I did use the mouthwash 2-3 times a day throughout chemo and never developed any mouth sores.  I'm a believer in prevention, to be honest, and it doesn't necessarily have to be with a fancy-schmancy mouth rinse; Otter had success with baking soda + water, I believe! My body became slower and slower to heal as chemo wore on (a mosquito bit me at the beginning of chemo, and I still had evidence of the bite four months later). I was afraid if I developed mouth sores, my immune system would not rally well to heal them!   Short answer: Proactive is good. An ounce of prevention, etc.",

I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first. (See Starting Chemo May 2008 converation to get a sense of when, where and how much hair is lost over time!) Food.

(My A/C + T regimen may contribute to bone loss. I checked with MSKCC dietician & a nutritionist and they recommended I take Calcium Citrate, Magnesium, Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) during chemo (and forever) to combat bone loss. They said \"not during chemo\" to everything else, including a multivitamin. They also said \"never\" to most soy products [I am ER+] -- only 2 servings a week-- and Vitamin C supplements.)

Some women have their periods throughout.  Others, like me, had them for the first month or two and then... well, lets just say that I have no idea when my last period was. To be honest, I'm a little sad that it's gone, and that I didn't know the \"last one of my life\" was the last one of my life. My hot flashes lasted a few months, of varying intensity. Somewhere on my blog (www.rockthebald.blogspot.com) I discussed the various KINDS of hot flash I had. I learned to treat them as a form of biofeedback as they were often associated with stress or anxiety. So when I felt one coming on, I used it as a reminder to pause, and take a couple deep breaths.  I'm much calmer now.  I haven't had a hot flash in a long time. I'm not sure why, but it could be because I'm happier and more relaxed. Or maybe my body's just \"done.\" 2. Chemo brain. In my experience, and despite my early and complete DENIAL that such a thing existed (I was convinced that the diminished mental capacity had to be a function of stress, disrupted sleep patterns, etc.), I have to say, \"Yep, it exists.\" For what it's worth, though, my mental functioning WAS restored. 6 months post-chemo, I'm still a little more forgetful and inarticulate than I recall being, but I'm definitelyin the bounds of normal. In the throes of chemobrain, however, I'd have these horrible moments -- like when your computer is trying to access the CD drive and it can't.  Just spinning, helplessly,pointlessly.  My brain was like swiss cheese. Sometimes I'd go to recall something and I'd be fine. And other times, I couldn't even remember what category of thing I was trying to call. NOT PRETTY. but also, NOT PERMANENT (in my experience). 3. Blurry vision. My vision was a mess during chemo. It improved afterwards but it is still not what it was. That could be a function, however, of the shift my eyes would have made anyway at about this age (43).   Hey, Nico!  And hey to all the newcomers.  I am observing my one year anniversary of my diagnosis this week.  In this year, I've gotten a Fulbright, published a book, and moved to South Africa where I am loving loving loving my life. (It was also a year where my dad almost died, my mom got really sick, and I had to call the police twice when a friend came off the rails.)  I feel for everyone who is just setting out on this ... this path/journey/experience.  It taught me things I didn't know about myself. It highlighted strengths and weaknesses I didn't know I have. But it also brought some (more) wonderful people into my life and for that, I'm oddly grateful.",

They no longer burn (I finished chemo 6 months ago), but my vision isn't as good as it used to be, especially when it comes to reading small print. That could be due to age, though. Re: Sex.  I am happy to report that while the libido (and the body's natural lubrication) went away, it also came back.  I kind of took the approach of \"use it or lose it.\" I know that it's not that simple. But while it is one thing to say goodbye to periods, it's another thing to say goodbye to enjoying sex. Of course, one doesn't feel terribly sexy when one is hairless and anemic.  But as the body healed, my sex drive returned. I'm starting to feel like my old self. There are other threads that deal with this in more detail. And Eva, for what it's worth, I kind of think my body is still going through some of the cycles, I just don't have my period. So don't write off the primal sex just yet. It may be MIA for awhile, but you just might get your sex groove back,  too! (God, I must say, though. It is making me cry thinking about those of you who are going through this now.  I just feel for all of you who are starting chemo. It is hard. There is so much that is unknown, that can't be known, that only time will tell.  You WILL come through this, though. I promise. I cannot promise a cure. I cannot promise it will be easy. I can only promise that we do have what it takes to do this, whatever \"this\" turns out to be.)",

      "Content": "rock wrote: These lists may be read in conjunction with the conversation created by www.breastcancer.org member Melissaga (\"Tips for Getting Through Chemotherapy\") on December 6th, 2006. Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.) The usual caveat applies: Not everything works for everybody! We all find our own path, admittedly, with the help of others on the path, and who have walked it before us. P.S. Keep moving (e.g., go for walks). I swear it helps! rockthebald, nyc. 43 (Today's my birthday!) Receiving treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering in 2008. IDC, DCIS, LCIS. 1.8 cm. Stage 1/2-ish (T1No (i+) or T1N1 (mx)) Chemo: dose-dense, A/C + T. A Pre-Chemo Shopping List None of this is \"new\" but it might be helpful to someone (like me) whose chemo started on short notice. - Purell-type hand-sanitizer. I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth. Warning: Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride -- like Crest pro-health -- may stain your teeth. Seriously.) - Imodium - Anticonstipation: Walnuts, pecans, almonds, dried apricots, prunes, prune juice, Colace, Miralax, Senekot-S, activia yogurt (No need to buy all of these. See what you need & what works for you!) - Pepcid - disposable flatware, plates and cups (for times when you're tired or immune-suppressed; plastic flatware helps offset metallic taste in mouth) - Sugarfree chewing gum, sugar free hard candy (some people prefer lemon flavor) or breath mints - Protein food sources (e.g., peanut butter, nuts, clams, oysters, meat, avoid soy if you are ER+) - unscented moisturizer - sunscreen (for face and for everything else; SPF 15+) - new or washed shower curtain liner (minimize bacteria, mold) - new toothbrushes (mouth is really vulnerable to infections, sores; oral hygiene is super-important) - another thermometer (since tracking temp matters) - at least one extra box of Kleenex - indiv packets of kleenexes (disappearance of nose hairs = dripping nose) - a box/packet of the flushable moist wipes (I use these wipes the first few days after chemo to prevent the discomfort/burning that may accompany urination; these may help soothe irritated tissues. Others use a squirt bottle.) - Thing of Clorox-type wipes - artificial tears for dry eyes (consider Renew or Similasan brands) - acidopholus capsules for yeast infections if you're prone to them - nonlatex gloves to wear when doing dishes, etc. to reduce nicks and cuts, at least on those low blood count days toward the end of treatment. Food - unsweetened indiv things of applesauce - individ things of cottage cheese (I find smaller servings less daunting on a queasy stomach, and may be less wasteful in the long haul) - Eggbeaters (bland, protein) - brown rice - crackers (inc indiv packets of animal crackers or Saltines to carry around or keep in desk drawer or nightstand for queasy moments. ER+ should watch out for soy -- it's in a lot of cracker sandwiches) - dried apricots and fruit (helps with constip) - lentil soup, black bean soup, chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles, orange Pedialyte For those of us facing hair loss: http://www.4women.com http://www.sparklingearth.com/products.asp?categor... http://www.bandanas.net/skullbest.htm http://www.myskullcaps.com/ http://www.sungrubbies.com Pointers on tying scarves: http://www.coveryourhair.com/HowToTieTiechels.html http://www.tznius.com/ This has more extensive scarf tying instructions (click on link in nav bar or at the bottom of the home page). - You Tube: search \"how to tie head wraps.\" The video is by galaxyswurl.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water.

See what you need & what works for you!) - Pepcid - disposable flatware, plates and cups (for times when you're tired or immune-suppressed; plastic flatware helps offset metallic taste in mouth) - Sugarfree chewing gum, sugar free hard candy (some people prefer lemon flavor) or breath mints - Protein food sources (e.g., peanut butter, nuts, clams, oysters, meat, avoid soy if you are ER+) - unscented moisturizer - sunscreen (for face and for everything else; SPF 15+) - new or washed shower curtain liner (minimize bacteria, mold) - new toothbrushes (mouth is really vulnerable to infections, sores; oral hygiene is super-important) - another thermometer (since tracking temp matters) - at least one extra box of Kleenex - indiv packets of kleenexes (disappearance of nose hairs = dripping nose) - a box/packet of the flushable moist wipes (I use these wipes the first few days after chemo to prevent the discomfort/burning that may accompany urination; these may help soothe irritated tissues. Others use a squirt bottle.) - Thing of Clorox-type wipes - artificial tears for dry eyes (consider Renew or Similasan brands) - acidopholus capsules for yeast infections if you're prone to them - nonlatex gloves to wear when doing dishes, etc. to reduce nicks and cuts, at least on those low blood count days toward the end of treatment. Food - unsweetened indiv things of applesauce - individ things of cottage cheese (I find smaller servings less daunting on a queasy stomach, and may be less wasteful in the long haul) - Eggbeaters (bland, protein) - brown rice - crackers (inc indiv packets of animal crackers or Saltines to carry around or keep in desk drawer or nightstand for queasy moments. ER+ should watch out for soy -- it's in a lot of cracker sandwiches) - dried apricots and fruit (helps with constip) - lentil soup, black bean soup, chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles, orange Pedialyte For those of us facing hair loss: http://www.4women.com http://www.sparklingearth.com/products.asp?categor... http://www.bandanas.net/skullbest.htm http://www.myskullcaps.com/ http://www.sungrubbies.com Pointers on tying scarves: http://www.coveryourhair.com/HowToTieTiechels.html http://www.tznius.com/ This has more extensive scarf tying instructions (click on link in nav bar or at the bottom of the home page). - You Tube: search \"how to tie head wraps.\" The video is by galaxyswurl.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first. (See Starting Chemo May 2008 converation to get a sense of when, where and how much hair is lost over time!) Food. Protein and iron rich foods may help boost RBC: Meat chili, clams, oysters, some beans, nuts Here is a link for Summer Express: 101 meals to be prepared in 10 minutes or less. http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/18/dining/18mini.html?_r=1&scp=10&sq=100+recipes&st=nyt&oref=slogin And 101 fast recipes for inspired picnics http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/02/dining/02mlis.html?scp=2&sq=101+picnic&st=nyt Supplements: Check with a dietician or a nutritionist about supplements and multivitamins. (My A/C + T regimen may contribute to bone loss. I checked with MSKCC dietician & a nutritionist and they recommended I take Calcium Citrate, Magnesium, Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) during chemo (and forever) to combat bone loss. They said \"not during chemo\" to everything else, including a multivitamin. They also said \"never\" to most soy products [I am ER+] -- only 2 servings a week-- and Vitamin C supplements.)

Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.) The usual caveat applies: Not everything works for everybody! We all find our own path, admittedly, with the help of others on the path, and who have walked it before us. P.S.

A Pre-Chemo Shopping List None of this is \"new\" but it might be helpful to someone (like me) whose chemo started on short notice. - Purell-type hand-sanitizer. I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth. Warning: Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride -- like Crest pro-health -- may stain your teeth. Seriously.) - Imodium - Anticonstipation: Walnuts, pecans, almonds, dried apricots, prunes, prune juice, Colace, Miralax, Senekot-S, activia yogurt (No need to buy all of these. See what you need & what works for you!) - Pepcid - disposable flatware, plates and cups (for times when you're tired or immune-suppressed; plastic flatware helps offset metallic taste in mouth) - Sugarfree chewing gum, sugar free hard candy (some people prefer lemon flavor) or breath mints - Protein food sources (e.g., peanut butter, nuts, clams, oysters, meat, avoid soy if you are ER+) - unscented moisturizer - sunscreen (for face and for everything else; SPF 15+) - new or washed shower curtain liner (minimize bacteria, mold) - new toothbrushes (mouth is really vulnerable to infections, sores; oral hygiene is super-important) - another thermometer (since tracking temp matters) - at least one extra box of Kleenex - indiv packets of kleenexes (disappearance of nose hairs = dripping nose) - a box/packet of the flushable moist wipes (I use these wipes the first few days after chemo to prevent the discomfort/burning that may accompany urination; these may help soothe irritated tissues.

Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first.

Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.)

A Pre-Chemo Shopping List None of this is \"new\" but it might be helpful to someone (like me) whose chemo started on short notice. - Purell-type hand-sanitizer. I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth. Warning: Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride -- like Crest pro-health -- may stain your teeth. Seriously.) - Imodium - Anticonstipation: Walnuts, pecans, almonds, dried apricots, prunes, prune juice, Colace, Miralax, Senekot-S, activia yogurt (No need to buy all of these. See what you need & what works for you!) - Pepcid - disposable flatware, plates and cups (for times when you're tired or immune-suppressed; plastic flatware helps offset metallic taste in mouth) - Sugarfree chewing gum, sugar free hard candy (some people prefer lemon flavor) or breath mints - Protein food sources (e.g., peanut butter, nuts, clams, oysters, meat, avoid soy if you are ER+) - unscented moisturizer - sunscreen (for face and for everything else; SPF 15+) - new or washed shower curtain liner (minimize bacteria, mold) - new toothbrushes (mouth is really vulnerable to infections, sores; oral hygiene is super-important) - another thermometer (since tracking temp matters) - at least one extra box of Kleenex - indiv packets of kleenexes (disappearance of nose hairs = dripping nose) - a box/packet of the flushable moist wipes (I use these wipes the first few days after chemo to prevent the discomfort/burning that may accompany urination; these may help soothe irritated tissues. Others use a squirt bottle.) - Thing of Clorox-type wipes - artificial tears for dry eyes (consider Renew or Similasan brands) - acidopholus capsules for yeast infections if you're prone to them - nonlatex gloves to wear when doing dishes, etc. to reduce nicks and cuts, at least on those low blood count days toward the end of treatment. Food - unsweetened indiv things of applesauce - individ things of cottage cheese (I find smaller servings less daunting on a queasy stomach, and may be less wasteful in the long haul) - Eggbeaters (bland, protein) - brown rice - crackers (inc indiv packets of animal crackers or Saltines to carry around or keep in desk drawer or nightstand for queasy moments. ER+ should watch out for soy -- it's in a lot of cracker sandwiches) - dried apricots and fruit (helps with constip) - lentil soup, black bean soup, chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles, orange Pedialyte For those of us facing hair loss: http://www.4women.com http://www.sparklingearth.com/products.asp?categor... http://www.bandanas.net/skullbest.htm http://www.myskullcaps.com/ http://www.sungrubbies.com Pointers on tying scarves: http://www.coveryourhair.com/HowToTieTiechels.html http://www.tznius.com/ This has more extensive scarf tying instructions (click on link in nav bar or at the bottom of the home page). - You Tube: search \"how to tie head wraps.\" The video is by galaxyswurl.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge!

Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first. (See Starting Chemo May 2008 converation to get a sense of when, where and how much hair is lost over time!) Food.

Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.) The usual caveat applies: Not everything works for everybody! We all find our own path, admittedly, with the help of others on the path, and who have walked it before us. P.S. Keep moving (e.g., go for walks). I swear it helps! rockthebald, nyc. 43 (Today's my birthday!) Receiving treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering in 2008. IDC, DCIS, LCIS. 1.8 cm. Stage 1/2-ish (T1No (i+) or T1N1 (mx)) Chemo: dose-dense, A/C + T. A Pre-Chemo Shopping List None of this is \"new\" but it might be helpful to someone (like me) whose chemo started on short notice. - Purell-type hand-sanitizer. I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth. Warning: Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride -- like Crest pro-health -- may stain your teeth. Seriously.) - Imodium - Anticonstipation: Walnuts, pecans, almonds, dried apricots, prunes, prune juice, Colace, Miralax, Senekot-S, activia yogurt (No need to buy all of these. See what you need & what works for you!) - Pepcid - disposable flatware, plates and cups (for times when you're tired or immune-suppressed; plastic flatware helps offset metallic taste in mouth) - Sugarfree chewing gum, sugar free hard candy (some people prefer lemon flavor) or breath mints - Protein food sources (e.g., peanut butter, nuts, clams, oysters, meat, avoid soy if you are ER+) - unscented moisturizer - sunscreen (for face and for everything else; SPF 15+) - new or washed shower curtain liner (minimize bacteria, mold) - new toothbrushes (mouth is really vulnerable to infections, sores; oral hygiene is super-important) - another thermometer (since tracking temp matters) - at least one extra box of Kleenex - indiv packets of kleenexes (disappearance of nose hairs = dripping nose) - a box/packet of the flushable moist wipes (I use these wipes the first few days after chemo to prevent the discomfort/burning that may accompany urination; these may help soothe irritated tissues. Others use a squirt bottle.) - Thing of Clorox-type wipes - artificial tears for dry eyes (consider Renew or Similasan brands) - acidopholus capsules for yeast infections if you're prone to them - nonlatex gloves to wear when doing dishes, etc. to reduce nicks and cuts, at least on those low blood count days toward the end of treatment. Food - unsweetened indiv things of applesauce - individ things of cottage cheese (I find smaller servings less daunting on a queasy stomach, and may be less wasteful in the long haul) - Eggbeaters (bland, protein) - brown rice - crackers (inc indiv packets of animal crackers or Saltines to carry around or keep in desk drawer or nightstand for queasy moments. ER+ should watch out for soy -- it's in a lot of cracker sandwiches) - dried apricots and fruit (helps with constip) - lentil soup, black bean soup, chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles, orange Pedialyte For those of us facing hair loss: http://www.4women.com http://www.sparklingearth.com/products.asp?categor... http://www.bandanas.net/skullbest.htm http://www.myskullcaps.com/ http://www.sungrubbies.com Pointers on tying scarves: http://www.coveryourhair.com/HowToTieTiechels.html http://www.tznius.com/ This has more extensive scarf tying instructions (click on link in nav bar or at the bottom of the home page). - You Tube: search \"how to tie head wraps.\" The video is by galaxyswurl.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful.

ER+ should watch out for soy -- it's in a lot of cracker sandwiches) - dried apricots and fruit (helps with constip) - lentil soup, black bean soup, chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles, orange Pedialyte For those of us facing hair loss: http://www.4women.com http://www.sparklingearth.com/products.asp?categor... http://www.bandanas.net/skullbest.htm http://www.myskullcaps.com/ http://www.sungrubbies.com Pointers on tying scarves: http://www.coveryourhair.com/HowToTieTiechels.html http://www.tznius.com/ This has more extensive scarf tying instructions (click on link in nav bar or at the bottom of the home page). - You Tube: search \"how to tie head wraps.\" The video is by galaxyswurl.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first. (See Starting Chemo May 2008 converation to get a sense of when, where and how much hair is lost over time!) Food.

I checked with MSKCC dietician & a nutritionist and they recommended I take Calcium Citrate, Magnesium, Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) during chemo (and forever) to combat bone loss. They said \"not during chemo\" to everything else, including a multivitamin. They also said \"never\" to most soy products [I am ER+] -- only 2 servings a week-- and Vitamin C supplements.)

Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.) The usual caveat applies: Not everything works for everybody! We all find our own path, admittedly, with the help of others on the path, and who have walked it before us. P.S.

A Pre-Chemo Shopping List None of this is \"new\" but it might be helpful to someone (like me) whose chemo started on short notice. - Purell-type hand-sanitizer. I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth. Warning: Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride -- like Crest pro-health -- may stain your teeth. Seriously.) - Imodium - Anticonstipation: Walnuts, pecans, almonds, dried apricots, prunes, prune juice, Colace, Miralax, Senekot-S, activia yogurt (No need to buy all of these. See what you need & what works for you!) - Pepcid - disposable flatware, plates and cups (for times when you're tired or immune-suppressed; plastic flatware helps offset metallic taste in mouth) - Sugarfree chewing gum, sugar free hard candy (some people prefer lemon flavor) or breath mints - Protein food sources (e.g., peanut butter, nuts, clams, oysters, meat, avoid soy if you are ER+) - unscented moisturizer - sunscreen (for face and for everything else; SPF 15+) - new or washed shower curtain liner (minimize bacteria, mold) - new toothbrushes (mouth is really vulnerable to infections, sores; oral hygiene is super-important) - another thermometer (since tracking temp matters) - at least one extra box of Kleenex - indiv packets of kleenexes (disappearance of nose hairs = dripping nose) - a box/packet of the flushable moist wipes (I use these wipes the first few days after chemo to prevent the discomfort/burning that may accompany urination; these may help soothe irritated tissues. Others use a squirt bottle.) - Thing of Clorox-type wipes - artificial tears for dry eyes (consider Renew or Similasan brands) - acidopholus capsules for yeast infections if you're prone to them - nonlatex gloves to wear when doing dishes, etc. to reduce nicks and cuts, at least on those low blood count days toward the end of treatment.

Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.) The usual caveat applies: Not everything works for everybody! We all find our own path, admittedly, with the help of others on the path, and who have walked it before us. P.S. Keep moving (e.g., go for walks). I swear it helps! rockthebald, nyc. 43 (Today's my birthday!) Receiving treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering in 2008. IDC, DCIS, LCIS. 1.8 cm. Stage 1/2-ish (T1No (i+) or T1N1 (mx)) Chemo: dose-dense, A/C + T. A Pre-Chemo Shopping List None of this is \"new\" but it might be helpful to someone (like me) whose chemo started on short notice. - Purell-type hand-sanitizer. I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth. Warning: Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride -- like Crest pro-health -- may stain your teeth. Seriously.) - Imodium - Anticonstipation: Walnuts, pecans, almonds, dried apricots, prunes, prune juice, Colace, Miralax, Senekot-S, activia yogurt (No need to buy all of these. See what you need & what works for you!) - Pepcid - disposable flatware, plates and cups (for times when you're tired or immune-suppressed; plastic flatware helps offset metallic taste in mouth) - Sugarfree chewing gum, sugar free hard candy (some people prefer lemon flavor) or breath mints - Protein food sources (e.g., peanut butter, nuts, clams, oysters, meat, avoid soy if you are ER+) - unscented moisturizer - sunscreen (for face and for everything else; SPF 15+) - new or washed shower curtain liner (minimize bacteria, mold) - new toothbrushes (mouth is really vulnerable to infections, sores; oral hygiene is super-important) - another thermometer (since tracking temp matters) - at least one extra box of Kleenex - indiv packets of kleenexes (disappearance of nose hairs = dripping nose) - a box/packet of the flushable moist wipes (I use these wipes the first few days after chemo to prevent the discomfort/burning that may accompany urination; these may help soothe irritated tissues. Others use a squirt bottle.) - Thing of Clorox-type wipes - artificial tears for dry eyes (consider Renew or Similasan brands) - acidopholus capsules for yeast infections if you're prone to them - nonlatex gloves to wear when doing dishes, etc. to reduce nicks and cuts, at least on those low blood count days toward the end of treatment. Food - unsweetened indiv things of applesauce - individ things of cottage cheese (I find smaller servings less daunting on a queasy stomach, and may be less wasteful in the long haul) - Eggbeaters (bland, protein) - brown rice - crackers (inc indiv packets of animal crackers or Saltines to carry around or keep in desk drawer or nightstand for queasy moments. ER+ should watch out for soy -- it's in a lot of cracker sandwiches) - dried apricots and fruit (helps with constip) - lentil soup, black bean soup, chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles, orange Pedialyte For those of us facing hair loss: http://www.4women.com http://www.sparklingearth.com/products.asp?categor... http://www.bandanas.net/skullbest.htm http://www.myskullcaps.com/ http://www.sungrubbies.com Pointers on tying scarves: http://www.coveryourhair.com/HowToTieTiechels.html http://www.tznius.com/ This has more extensive scarf tying instructions (click on link in nav bar or at the bottom of the home page). - You Tube: search \"how to tie head wraps.\" The video is by galaxyswurl.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first.

I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first. (See Starting Chemo May 2008 converation to get a sense of when, where and how much hair is lost over time!) Food.

      "Content": "rock wrote: These lists may be read in conjunction with the conversation created by www.breastcancer.org member Melissaga (\"Tips for Getting Through Chemotherapy\") on December 6th, 2006. Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.) The usual caveat applies: Not everything works for everybody! We all find our own path, admittedly, with the help of others on the path, and who have walked it before us. P.S. Keep moving (e.g., go for walks). I swear it helps! rockthebald, nyc. 43 (Today's my birthday!) Receiving treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering in 2008. IDC, DCIS, LCIS. 1.8 cm. Stage 1/2-ish (T1No (i+) or T1N1 (mx)) Chemo: dose-dense, A/C + T. A Pre-Chemo Shopping List None of this is \"new\" but it might be helpful to someone (like me) whose chemo started on short notice. - Purell-type hand-sanitizer. I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth. Warning: Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride -- like Crest pro-health -- may stain your teeth. Seriously.) - Imodium - Anticonstipation: Walnuts, pecans, almonds, dried apricots, prunes, prune juice, Colace, Miralax, Senekot-S, activia yogurt (No need to buy all of these. See what you need & what works for you!) - Pepcid - disposable flatware, plates and cups (for times when you're tired or immune-suppressed; plastic flatware helps offset metallic taste in mouth) - Sugarfree chewing gum, sugar free hard candy (some people prefer lemon flavor) or breath mints - Protein food sources (e.g., peanut butter, nuts, clams, oysters, meat, avoid soy if you are ER+) - unscented moisturizer - sunscreen (for face and for everything else; SPF 15+) - new or washed shower curtain liner (minimize bacteria, mold) - new toothbrushes (mouth is really vulnerable to infections, sores; oral hygiene is super-important) - another thermometer (since tracking temp matters) - at least one extra box of Kleenex - indiv packets of kleenexes (disappearance of nose hairs = dripping nose) - a box/packet of the flushable moist wipes (I use these wipes the first few days after chemo to prevent the discomfort/burning that may accompany urination; these may help soothe irritated tissues. Others use a squirt bottle.) - Thing of Clorox-type wipes - artificial tears for dry eyes (consider Renew or Similasan brands) - acidopholus capsules for yeast infections if you're prone to them - nonlatex gloves to wear when doing dishes, etc. to reduce nicks and cuts, at least on those low blood count days toward the end of treatment. Food - unsweetened indiv things of applesauce - individ things of cottage cheese (I find smaller servings less daunting on a queasy stomach, and may be less wasteful in the long haul) - Eggbeaters (bland, protein) - brown rice - crackers (inc indiv packets of animal crackers or Saltines to carry around or keep in desk drawer or nightstand for queasy moments. ER+ should watch out for soy -- it's in a lot of cracker sandwiches) - dried apricots and fruit (helps with constip) - lentil soup, black bean soup, chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles, orange Pedialyte For those of us facing hair loss: http://www.4women.com http://www.sparklingearth.com/products.asp?categor... http://www.bandanas.net/skullbest.htm http://www.myskullcaps.com/ http://www.sungrubbies.com Pointers on tying scarves: http://www.coveryourhair.com/HowToTieTiechels.html http://www.tznius.com/ This has more extensive scarf tying instructions (click on link in nav bar or at the bottom of the home page). - You Tube: search \"how to tie head wraps.\" The video is by galaxyswurl.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick.

Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.)

I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth. Warning: Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride -- like Crest pro-health -- may stain your teeth.

See what you need & what works for you!) - Pepcid - disposable flatware, plates and cups (for times when you're tired or immune-suppressed; plastic flatware helps offset metallic taste in mouth) - Sugarfree chewing gum, sugar free hard candy (some people prefer lemon flavor) or breath mints - Protein food sources (e.g., peanut butter, nuts, clams, oysters, meat, avoid soy if you are ER+) - unscented moisturizer - sunscreen (for face and for everything else; SPF 15+) - new or washed shower curtain liner (minimize bacteria, mold) - new toothbrushes (mouth is really vulnerable to infections, sores; oral hygiene is super-important) - another thermometer (since tracking temp matters) - at least one extra box of Kleenex - indiv packets of kleenexes (disappearance of nose hairs = dripping nose) - a box/packet of the flushable moist wipes (I use these wipes the first few days after chemo to prevent the discomfort/burning that may accompany urination; these may help soothe irritated tissues.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first. (See Starting Chemo May 2008 converation to get a sense of when, where and how much hair is lost over time!) Food. Protein and iron rich foods may help boost RBC: Meat chili, clams, oysters, some beans, nuts Here is a link for Summer Express: 101 meals to be prepared in 10 minutes or less. http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/18/dining/18mini.html?_r=1&scp=10&sq=100+recipes&st=nyt&oref=slogin And 101 fast recipes for inspired picnics http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/02/dining/02mlis.html?scp=2&sq=101+picnic&st=nyt Supplements: Check with a dietician or a nutritionist about supplements and multivitamins. (My A/C + T regimen may contribute to bone loss. I checked with MSKCC dietician & a nutritionist and they recommended I take Calcium Citrate, Magnesium, Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) during chemo (and forever) to combat bone loss. They said \"not during chemo\" to everything else, including a multivitamin. They also said \"never\" to most soy products [I am ER+] -- only 2 servings a week-- and Vitamin C supplements.)

I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first.

      "Content": "rock wrote: These lists may be read in conjunction with the conversation created by www.breastcancer.org member Melissaga (\"Tips for Getting Through Chemotherapy\") on December 6th, 2006. Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.) The usual caveat applies: Not everything works for everybody! We all find our own path, admittedly, with the help of others on the path, and who have walked it before us. P.S. Keep moving (e.g., go for walks). I swear it helps! rockthebald, nyc. 43 (Today's my birthday!) Receiving treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering in 2008. IDC, DCIS, LCIS. 1.8 cm. Stage 1/2-ish (T1No (i+) or T1N1 (mx)) Chemo: dose-dense, A/C + T. A Pre-Chemo Shopping List None of this is \"new\" but it might be helpful to someone (like me) whose chemo started on short notice. - Purell-type hand-sanitizer. I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth. Warning: Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride -- like Crest pro-health -- may stain your teeth. Seriously.) - Imodium - Anticonstipation: Walnuts, pecans, almonds, dried apricots, prunes, prune juice, Colace, Miralax, Senekot-S, activia yogurt (No need to buy all of these. See what you need & what works for you!) - Pepcid - disposable flatware, plates and cups (for times when you're tired or immune-suppressed; plastic flatware helps offset metallic taste in mouth) - Sugarfree chewing gum, sugar free hard candy (some people prefer lemon flavor) or breath mints - Protein food sources (e.g., peanut butter, nuts, clams, oysters, meat, avoid soy if you are ER+) - unscented moisturizer - sunscreen (for face and for everything else; SPF 15+) - new or washed shower curtain liner (minimize bacteria, mold) - new toothbrushes (mouth is really vulnerable to infections, sores; oral hygiene is super-important) - another thermometer (since tracking temp matters) - at least one extra box of Kleenex - indiv packets of kleenexes (disappearance of nose hairs = dripping nose) - a box/packet of the flushable moist wipes (I use these wipes the first few days after chemo to prevent the discomfort/burning that may accompany urination; these may help soothe irritated tissues. Others use a squirt bottle.) - Thing of Clorox-type wipes - artificial tears for dry eyes (consider Renew or Similasan brands) - acidopholus capsules for yeast infections if you're prone to them - nonlatex gloves to wear when doing dishes, etc. to reduce nicks and cuts, at least on those low blood count days toward the end of treatment. Food - unsweetened indiv things of applesauce - individ things of cottage cheese (I find smaller servings less daunting on a queasy stomach, and may be less wasteful in the long haul) - Eggbeaters (bland, protein) - brown rice - crackers (inc indiv packets of animal crackers or Saltines to carry around or keep in desk drawer or nightstand for queasy moments. ER+ should watch out for soy -- it's in a lot of cracker sandwiches) - dried apricots and fruit (helps with constip) - lentil soup, black bean soup, chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles, orange Pedialyte For those of us facing hair loss: http://www.4women.com http://www.sparklingearth.com/products.asp?categor... http://www.bandanas.net/skullbest.htm http://www.myskullcaps.com/ http://www.sungrubbies.com Pointers on tying scarves: http://www.coveryourhair.com/HowToTieTiechels.html http://www.tznius.com/ This has more extensive scarf tying instructions (click on link in nav bar or at the bottom of the home page). - You Tube: search \"how to tie head wraps.\" The video is by galaxyswurl.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C.

The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?)

Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.) The usual caveat applies: Not everything works for everybody! We all find our own path, admittedly, with the help of others on the path, and who have walked it before us. P.S. Keep moving (e.g., go for walks). I swear it helps! rockthebald, nyc. 43 (Today's my birthday!) Receiving treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering in 2008. IDC, DCIS, LCIS. 1.8 cm. Stage 1/2-ish (T1No (i+) or T1N1 (mx)) Chemo: dose-dense, A/C + T. A Pre-Chemo Shopping List None of this is \"new\" but it might be helpful to someone (like me) whose chemo started on short notice. - Purell-type hand-sanitizer. I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth. Warning: Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride -- like Crest pro-health -- may stain your teeth. Seriously.) - Imodium - Anticonstipation: Walnuts, pecans, almonds, dried apricots, prunes, prune juice, Colace, Miralax, Senekot-S, activia yogurt (No need to buy all of these. See what you need & what works for you!) - Pepcid - disposable flatware, plates and cups (for times when you're tired or immune-suppressed; plastic flatware helps offset metallic taste in mouth) - Sugarfree chewing gum, sugar free hard candy (some people prefer lemon flavor) or breath mints - Protein food sources (e.g., peanut butter, nuts, clams, oysters, meat, avoid soy if you are ER+) - unscented moisturizer - sunscreen (for face and for everything else; SPF 15+) - new or washed shower curtain liner (minimize bacteria, mold) - new toothbrushes (mouth is really vulnerable to infections, sores; oral hygiene is super-important) - another thermometer (since tracking temp matters) - at least one extra box of Kleenex - indiv packets of kleenexes (disappearance of nose hairs = dripping nose) - a box/packet of the flushable moist wipes (I use these wipes the first few days after chemo to prevent the discomfort/burning that may accompany urination; these may help soothe irritated tissues. Others use a squirt bottle.) - Thing of Clorox-type wipes - artificial tears for dry eyes (consider Renew or Similasan brands) - acidopholus capsules for yeast infections if you're prone to them - nonlatex gloves to wear when doing dishes, etc. to reduce nicks and cuts, at least on those low blood count days toward the end of treatment. Food - unsweetened indiv things of applesauce - individ things of cottage cheese (I find smaller servings less daunting on a queasy stomach, and may be less wasteful in the long haul) - Eggbeaters (bland, protein) - brown rice - crackers (inc indiv packets of animal crackers or Saltines to carry around or keep in desk drawer or nightstand for queasy moments. ER+ should watch out for soy -- it's in a lot of cracker sandwiches) - dried apricots and fruit (helps with constip) - lentil soup, black bean soup, chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles, orange Pedialyte For those of us facing hair loss: http://www.4women.com http://www.sparklingearth.com/products.asp?categor... http://www.bandanas.net/skullbest.htm http://www.myskullcaps.com/ http://www.sungrubbies.com Pointers on tying scarves: http://www.coveryourhair.com/HowToTieTiechels.html http://www.tznius.com/ This has more extensive scarf tying instructions (click on link in nav bar or at the bottom of the home page). - You Tube: search \"how to tie head wraps.\" The video is by galaxyswurl.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first. (See Starting Chemo May 2008 converation to get a sense of when, where and how much hair is lost over time!) Food. Protein and iron rich foods may help boost RBC: Meat chili, clams, oysters, some beans, nuts Here is a link for Summer Express: 101 meals to be prepared in 10 minutes or less. http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/18/dining/18mini.html?_r=1&scp=10&sq=100+recipes&st=nyt&oref=slogin And 101 fast recipes for inspired picnics http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/02/dining/02mlis.html?scp=2&sq=101+picnic&st=nyt Supplements: Check with a dietician or a nutritionist about supplements and multivitamins. (My A/C + T regimen may contribute to bone loss. I checked with MSKCC dietician & a nutritionist and they recommended I take Calcium Citrate, Magnesium, Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) during chemo (and forever) to combat bone loss. They said \"not during chemo\" to everything else, including a multivitamin. They also said \"never\" to most soy products [I am ER+] -- only 2 servings a week-- and Vitamin C supplements.)

At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first. (See Starting Chemo May 2008 converation to get a sense of when, where and how much hair is lost over time!) Food.

Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.) The usual caveat applies: Not everything works for everybody! We all find our own path, admittedly, with the help of others on the path, and who have walked it before us. P.S. Keep moving (e.g., go for walks). I swear it helps! rockthebald, nyc. 43 (Today's my birthday!) Receiving treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering in 2008. IDC, DCIS, LCIS. 1.8 cm. Stage 1/2-ish (T1No (i+) or T1N1 (mx)) Chemo: dose-dense, A/C + T. A Pre-Chemo Shopping List None of this is \"new\" but it might be helpful to someone (like me) whose chemo started on short notice. - Purell-type hand-sanitizer. I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth. Warning: Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride -- like Crest pro-health -- may stain your teeth. Seriously.) - Imodium - Anticonstipation: Walnuts, pecans, almonds, dried apricots, prunes, prune juice, Colace, Miralax, Senekot-S, activia yogurt (No need to buy all of these. See what you need & what works for you!) - Pepcid - disposable flatware, plates and cups (for times when you're tired or immune-suppressed; plastic flatware helps offset metallic taste in mouth) - Sugarfree chewing gum, sugar free hard candy (some people prefer lemon flavor) or breath mints - Protein food sources (e.g., peanut butter, nuts, clams, oysters, meat, avoid soy if you are ER+) - unscented moisturizer - sunscreen (for face and for everything else; SPF 15+) - new or washed shower curtain liner (minimize bacteria, mold) - new toothbrushes (mouth is really vulnerable to infections, sores; oral hygiene is super-important) - another thermometer (since tracking temp matters) - at least one extra box of Kleenex - indiv packets of kleenexes (disappearance of nose hairs = dripping nose) - a box/packet of the flushable moist wipes (I use these wipes the first few days after chemo to prevent the discomfort/burning that may accompany urination; these may help soothe irritated tissues. Others use a squirt bottle.) - Thing of Clorox-type wipes - artificial tears for dry eyes (consider Renew or Similasan brands) - acidopholus capsules for yeast infections if you're prone to them - nonlatex gloves to wear when doing dishes, etc. to reduce nicks and cuts, at least on those low blood count days toward the end of treatment. Food - unsweetened indiv things of applesauce - individ things of cottage cheese (I find smaller servings less daunting on a queasy stomach, and may be less wasteful in the long haul) - Eggbeaters (bland, protein) - brown rice - crackers (inc indiv packets of animal crackers or Saltines to carry around or keep in desk drawer or nightstand for queasy moments. ER+ should watch out for soy -- it's in a lot of cracker sandwiches) - dried apricots and fruit (helps with constip) - lentil soup, black bean soup, chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles, orange Pedialyte For those of us facing hair loss: http://www.4women.com http://www.sparklingearth.com/products.asp?categor... http://www.bandanas.net/skullbest.htm http://www.myskullcaps.com/ http://www.sungrubbies.com Pointers on tying scarves: http://www.coveryourhair.com/HowToTieTiechels.html http://www.tznius.com/ This has more extensive scarf tying instructions (click on link in nav bar or at the bottom of the home page). - You Tube: search \"how to tie head wraps.\" The video is by galaxyswurl.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful.

Food - unsweetened indiv things of applesauce - individ things of cottage cheese (I find smaller servings less daunting on a queasy stomach, and may be less wasteful in the long haul) - Eggbeaters (bland, protein) - brown rice - crackers (inc indiv packets of animal crackers or Saltines to carry around or keep in desk drawer or nightstand for queasy moments. ER+ should watch out for soy -- it's in a lot of cracker sandwiches) - dried apricots and fruit (helps with constip) - lentil soup, black bean soup, chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles, orange Pedialyte For those of us facing hair loss: http://www.4women.com http://www.sparklingearth.com/products.asp?categor... http://www.bandanas.net/skullbest.htm http://www.myskullcaps.com/ http://www.sungrubbies.com Pointers on tying scarves: http://www.coveryourhair.com/HowToTieTiechels.html http://www.tznius.com/ This has more extensive scarf tying instructions (click on link in nav bar or at the bottom of the home page). - You Tube: search \"how to tie head wraps.\" The video is by galaxyswurl.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first. (See Starting Chemo May 2008 converation to get a sense of when, where and how much hair is lost over time!) Food.

I checked with MSKCC dietician & a nutritionist and they recommended I take Calcium Citrate, Magnesium, Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) during chemo (and forever) to combat bone loss. They said \"not during chemo\" to everything else, including a multivitamin. They also said \"never\" to most soy products [I am ER+] -- only 2 servings a week-- and Vitamin C supplements.)

Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.) The usual caveat applies: Not everything works for everybody! We all find our own path, admittedly, with the help of others on the path, and who have walked it before us. P.S.

I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth.

My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first.

Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it!

All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.)

A Pre-Chemo Shopping List None of this is \"new\" but it might be helpful to someone (like me) whose chemo started on short notice. - Purell-type hand-sanitizer. I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth. Warning: Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride -- like Crest pro-health -- may stain your teeth. Seriously.) - Imodium - Anticonstipation: Walnuts, pecans, almonds, dried apricots, prunes, prune juice, Colace, Miralax, Senekot-S, activia yogurt (No need to buy all of these. See what you need & what works for you!) - Pepcid - disposable flatware, plates and cups (for times when you're tired or immune-suppressed; plastic flatware helps offset metallic taste in mouth) - Sugarfree chewing gum, sugar free hard candy (some people prefer lemon flavor) or breath mints - Protein food sources (e.g., peanut butter, nuts, clams, oysters, meat, avoid soy if you are ER+) - unscented moisturizer - sunscreen (for face and for everything else; SPF 15+) - new or washed shower curtain liner (minimize bacteria, mold) - new toothbrushes (mouth is really vulnerable to infections, sores; oral hygiene is super-important) - another thermometer (since tracking temp matters) - at least one extra box of Kleenex - indiv packets of kleenexes (disappearance of nose hairs = dripping nose) - a box/packet of the flushable moist wipes (I use these wipes the first few days after chemo to prevent the discomfort/burning that may accompany urination; these may help soothe irritated tissues. Others use a squirt bottle.) - Thing of Clorox-type wipes - artificial tears for dry eyes (consider Renew or Similasan brands) - acidopholus capsules for yeast infections if you're prone to them - nonlatex gloves to wear when doing dishes, etc. to reduce nicks and cuts, at least on those low blood count days toward the end of treatment. Food - unsweetened indiv things of applesauce - individ things of cottage cheese (I find smaller servings less daunting on a queasy stomach, and may be less wasteful in the long haul) - Eggbeaters (bland, protein) - brown rice - crackers (inc indiv packets of animal crackers or Saltines to carry around or keep in desk drawer or nightstand for queasy moments. ER+ should watch out for soy -- it's in a lot of cracker sandwiches) - dried apricots and fruit (helps with constip) - lentil soup, black bean soup, chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles, orange Pedialyte For those of us facing hair loss: http://www.4women.com http://www.sparklingearth.com/products.asp?categor... http://www.bandanas.net/skullbest.htm http://www.myskullcaps.com/ http://www.sungrubbies.com Pointers on tying scarves: http://www.coveryourhair.com/HowToTieTiechels.html http://www.tznius.com/ This has more extensive scarf tying instructions (click on link in nav bar or at the bottom of the home page). - You Tube: search \"how to tie head wraps.\" The video is by galaxyswurl.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first.

Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first. (See Starting Chemo May 2008 converation to get a sense of when, where and how much hair is lost over time!) Food.

      "Content": "rock wrote: These lists may be read in conjunction with the conversation created by www.breastcancer.org member Melissaga (\"Tips for Getting Through Chemotherapy\") on December 6th, 2006. Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.) The usual caveat applies: Not everything works for everybody! We all find our own path, admittedly, with the help of others on the path, and who have walked it before us. P.S. Keep moving (e.g., go for walks). I swear it helps! rockthebald, nyc. 43 (Today's my birthday!) Receiving treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering in 2008. IDC, DCIS, LCIS. 1.8 cm. Stage 1/2-ish (T1No (i+) or T1N1 (mx)) Chemo: dose-dense, A/C + T. A Pre-Chemo Shopping List None of this is \"new\" but it might be helpful to someone (like me) whose chemo started on short notice. - Purell-type hand-sanitizer. I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth. Warning: Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride -- like Crest pro-health -- may stain your teeth. Seriously.) - Imodium - Anticonstipation: Walnuts, pecans, almonds, dried apricots, prunes, prune juice, Colace, Miralax, Senekot-S, activia yogurt (No need to buy all of these. See what you need & what works for you!) - Pepcid - disposable flatware, plates and cups (for times when you're tired or immune-suppressed; plastic flatware helps offset metallic taste in mouth) - Sugarfree chewing gum, sugar free hard candy (some people prefer lemon flavor) or breath mints - Protein food sources (e.g., peanut butter, nuts, clams, oysters, meat, avoid soy if you are ER+) - unscented moisturizer - sunscreen (for face and for everything else; SPF 15+) - new or washed shower curtain liner (minimize bacteria, mold) - new toothbrushes (mouth is really vulnerable to infections, sores; oral hygiene is super-important) - another thermometer (since tracking temp matters) - at least one extra box of Kleenex - indiv packets of kleenexes (disappearance of nose hairs = dripping nose) - a box/packet of the flushable moist wipes (I use these wipes the first few days after chemo to prevent the discomfort/burning that may accompany urination; these may help soothe irritated tissues. Others use a squirt bottle.) - Thing of Clorox-type wipes - artificial tears for dry eyes (consider Renew or Similasan brands) - acidopholus capsules for yeast infections if you're prone to them - nonlatex gloves to wear when doing dishes, etc. to reduce nicks and cuts, at least on those low blood count days toward the end of treatment. Food - unsweetened indiv things of applesauce - individ things of cottage cheese (I find smaller servings less daunting on a queasy stomach, and may be less wasteful in the long haul) - Eggbeaters (bland, protein) - brown rice - crackers (inc indiv packets of animal crackers or Saltines to carry around or keep in desk drawer or nightstand for queasy moments. ER+ should watch out for soy -- it's in a lot of cracker sandwiches) - dried apricots and fruit (helps with constip) - lentil soup, black bean soup, chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles, orange Pedialyte For those of us facing hair loss: http://www.4women.com http://www.sparklingearth.com/products.asp?categor... http://www.bandanas.net/skullbest.htm http://www.myskullcaps.com/ http://www.sungrubbies.com Pointers on tying scarves: http://www.coveryourhair.com/HowToTieTiechels.html http://www.tznius.com/ This has more extensive scarf tying instructions (click on link in nav bar or at the bottom of the home page). - You Tube: search \"how to tie head wraps.\" The video is by galaxyswurl.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water.

      "Content": "rock wrote: These lists may be read in conjunction with the conversation created by www.breastcancer.org member Melissaga (\"Tips for Getting Through Chemotherapy\") on December 6th, 2006. Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.) The usual caveat applies: Not everything works for everybody! We all find our own path, admittedly, with the help of others on the path, and who have walked it before us. P.S. Keep moving (e.g., go for walks). I swear it helps! rockthebald, nyc. 43 (Today's my birthday!) Receiving treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering in 2008. IDC, DCIS, LCIS. 1.8 cm. Stage 1/2-ish (T1No (i+) or T1N1 (mx)) Chemo: dose-dense, A/C + T. A Pre-Chemo Shopping List None of this is \"new\" but it might be helpful to someone (like me) whose chemo started on short notice. - Purell-type hand-sanitizer. I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth. Warning: Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride -- like Crest pro-health -- may stain your teeth. Seriously.) - Imodium - Anticonstipation: Walnuts, pecans, almonds, dried apricots, prunes, prune juice, Colace, Miralax, Senekot-S, activia yogurt (No need to buy all of these. See what you need & what works for you!) - Pepcid - disposable flatware, plates and cups (for times when you're tired or immune-suppressed; plastic flatware helps offset metallic taste in mouth) - Sugarfree chewing gum, sugar free hard candy (some people prefer lemon flavor) or breath mints - Protein food sources (e.g., peanut butter, nuts, clams, oysters, meat, avoid soy if you are ER+) - unscented moisturizer - sunscreen (for face and for everything else; SPF 15+) - new or washed shower curtain liner (minimize bacteria, mold) - new toothbrushes (mouth is really vulnerable to infections, sores; oral hygiene is super-important) - another thermometer (since tracking temp matters) - at least one extra box of Kleenex - indiv packets of kleenexes (disappearance of nose hairs = dripping nose) - a box/packet of the flushable moist wipes (I use these wipes the first few days after chemo to prevent the discomfort/burning that may accompany urination; these may help soothe irritated tissues. Others use a squirt bottle.) - Thing of Clorox-type wipes - artificial tears for dry eyes (consider Renew or Similasan brands) - acidopholus capsules for yeast infections if you're prone to them - nonlatex gloves to wear when doing dishes, etc. to reduce nicks and cuts, at least on those low blood count days toward the end of treatment. Food - unsweetened indiv things of applesauce - individ things of cottage cheese (I find smaller servings less daunting on a queasy stomach, and may be less wasteful in the long haul) - Eggbeaters (bland, protein) - brown rice - crackers (inc indiv packets of animal crackers or Saltines to carry around or keep in desk drawer or nightstand for queasy moments. ER+ should watch out for soy -- it's in a lot of cracker sandwiches) - dried apricots and fruit (helps with constip) - lentil soup, black bean soup, chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles, orange Pedialyte For those of us facing hair loss: http://www.4women.com http://www.sparklingearth.com/products.asp?categor... http://www.bandanas.net/skullbest.htm http://www.myskullcaps.com/ http://www.sungrubbies.com Pointers on tying scarves: http://www.coveryourhair.com/HowToTieTiechels.html http://www.tznius.com/ This has more extensive scarf tying instructions (click on link in nav bar or at the bottom of the home page). - You Tube: search \"how to tie head wraps.\" The video is by galaxyswurl.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first. (See Starting Chemo May 2008 converation to get a sense of when, where and how much hair is lost over time!) Food. Protein and iron rich foods may help boost RBC: Meat chili, clams, oysters, some beans, nuts Here is a link for Summer Express: 101 meals to be prepared in 10 minutes or less. http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/18/dining/18mini.html?_r=1&scp=10&sq=100+recipes&st=nyt&oref=slogin And 101 fast recipes for inspired picnics http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/02/dining/02mlis.html?scp=2&sq=101+picnic&st=nyt Supplements: Check with a dietician or a nutritionist about supplements and multivitamins. (My A/C + T regimen may contribute to bone loss. I checked with MSKCC dietician & a nutritionist and they recommended I take Calcium Citrate, Magnesium, Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) during chemo (and forever) to combat bone loss. They said \"not during chemo\" to everything else, including a multivitamin. They also said \"never\" to most soy products [I am ER+] -- only 2 servings a week-- and Vitamin C supplements.)

      "Content": "rock wrote: These lists may be read in conjunction with the conversation created by www.breastcancer.org member Melissaga (\"Tips for Getting Through Chemotherapy\") on December 6th, 2006. Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.) The usual caveat applies: Not everything works for everybody! We all find our own path, admittedly, with the help of others on the path, and who have walked it before us. P.S. Keep moving (e.g., go for walks). I swear it helps! rockthebald, nyc. 43 (Today's my birthday!) Receiving treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering in 2008. IDC, DCIS, LCIS. 1.8 cm. Stage 1/2-ish (T1No (i+) or T1N1 (mx)) Chemo: dose-dense, A/C + T. A Pre-Chemo Shopping List None of this is \"new\" but it might be helpful to someone (like me) whose chemo started on short notice. - Purell-type hand-sanitizer. I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth. Warning: Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride -- like Crest pro-health -- may stain your teeth. Seriously.) - Imodium - Anticonstipation: Walnuts, pecans, almonds, dried apricots, prunes, prune juice, Colace, Miralax, Senekot-S, activia yogurt (No need to buy all of these. See what you need & what works for you!) - Pepcid - disposable flatware, plates and cups (for times when you're tired or immune-suppressed; plastic flatware helps offset metallic taste in mouth) - Sugarfree chewing gum, sugar free hard candy (some people prefer lemon flavor) or breath mints - Protein food sources (e.g., peanut butter, nuts, clams, oysters, meat, avoid soy if you are ER+) - unscented moisturizer - sunscreen (for face and for everything else; SPF 15+) - new or washed shower curtain liner (minimize bacteria, mold) - new toothbrushes (mouth is really vulnerable to infections, sores; oral hygiene is super-important) - another thermometer (since tracking temp matters) - at least one extra box of Kleenex - indiv packets of kleenexes (disappearance of nose hairs = dripping nose) - a box/packet of the flushable moist wipes (I use these wipes the first few days after chemo to prevent the discomfort/burning that may accompany urination; these may help soothe irritated tissues. Others use a squirt bottle.) - Thing of Clorox-type wipes - artificial tears for dry eyes (consider Renew or Similasan brands) - acidopholus capsules for yeast infections if you're prone to them - nonlatex gloves to wear when doing dishes, etc. to reduce nicks and cuts, at least on those low blood count days toward the end of treatment. Food - unsweetened indiv things of applesauce - individ things of cottage cheese (I find smaller servings less daunting on a queasy stomach, and may be less wasteful in the long haul) - Eggbeaters (bland, protein) - brown rice - crackers (inc indiv packets of animal crackers or Saltines to carry around or keep in desk drawer or nightstand for queasy moments. ER+ should watch out for soy -- it's in a lot of cracker sandwiches) - dried apricots and fruit (helps with constip) - lentil soup, black bean soup, chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles, orange Pedialyte For those of us facing hair loss: http://www.4women.com http://www.sparklingearth.com/products.asp?categor... http://www.bandanas.net/skullbest.htm http://www.myskullcaps.com/ http://www.sungrubbies.com Pointers on tying scarves: http://www.coveryourhair.com/HowToTieTiechels.html http://www.tznius.com/ This has more extensive scarf tying instructions (click on link in nav bar or at the bottom of the home page). - You Tube: search \"how to tie head wraps.\" The video is by galaxyswurl.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first. (See Starting Chemo May 2008 converation to get a sense of when, where and how much hair is lost over time!) Food. Protein and iron rich foods may help boost RBC: Meat chili, clams, oysters, some beans, nuts Here is a link for Summer Express: 101 meals to be prepared in 10 minutes or less. http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/18/dining/18mini.html?_r=1&scp=10&sq=100+recipes&st=nyt&oref=slogin And 101 fast recipes for inspired picnics http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/02/dining/02mlis.html?scp=2&sq=101+picnic&st=nyt Supplements: Check with a dietician or a nutritionist about supplements and multivitamins. (My A/C + T regimen may contribute to bone loss. I checked with MSKCC dietician & a nutritionist and they recommended I take Calcium Citrate, Magnesium, Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) during chemo (and forever) to combat bone loss. They said \"not during chemo\" to everything else, including a multivitamin. They also said \"never\" to most soy products [I am ER+] -- only 2 servings a week-- and Vitamin C supplements.)

I feel like my body would rebound each chemo, but over time, it would never rebound to the health/energy I had at the time of the previous chemo.  So it would take more out of me each time to recover, and I would recover less and less each time.  HAVING SAID THAT... I got better about taking care of myself, anticipating my low energy days.  Whereas in teh beginning, a Wednesday AC would leave me starting to sag on Friday night and all day Saturday, by the end, I was wiped out for the whole weekend. I did find Taxol easier in a lot of respects, but I was wiped out.  (It was also summer and the heat didn't help.) In terms of survival strategies... I learned to  just cut myself as much slack as possible, to be as gentle with myself as I could. (I am single, without children or others to care for.) If you can afford it, this is a good time to arrange to have your laundry done or eat pre-prepared food or take taxis.  (I am not rich, but I told myself that the money I was saving on haircuts could be put toward taxis!)  Treat yourself to things that make you feel good, e.g., nice socks, a warm hat, a hot water bottle, nice herbal teas. I was in decent health going into treatment. I walked 5 days out of 7 in most weeks. I think it helped me retain some strength and stamina (and spirits) and made recovery easier.  So, if you can, go for a walk.  It doesn't have to be a power-walk. Just some movement to get those chemo chemicals metabolised, to hang on to some muscle and some energy. But above all, be kind to yourself.  let friends and family know what you need. They might not be able to give it to you, but you need to tell them what you need (e.g., a lift, company, someone to run an errand.)  The fatigue can really do a number on the mood. I also have a theory -- JUST MY THEORY -- that those two years before I was diagnosed when I was feeling so tired all the time, my body was probably trying to fight off the cancer.  So it is completely understandable that you are tired, in my mind, even without the chemo. For what it's worth, I finished radiation at the end of October 2008.  It is now over a year later and I am living in Cape Town, South Africa. I just spent a long wonderful day with my girlfriends, listening to music and having a nice dinner.  My point is:  The chemo will (hopefully) end.  You will not always feel like this.  I don't know if any of this is helpful, but know that you are in my thoughts.  xoxo rock",

One way or the other, for most people on chemo, the hair will come out.  (See a link to how it went for me below). I had a little warning.  Two days after my second AC chemo, my scalp started to tingle. By that evening, it was easy to pull it out in tufts (like when you pull grass out of a lawn and it makes that soft pfffth sound). But I don't recommend you do that necessarily, because if you have your head shaved, it may be a day or two before the roots fall out (like magnet shavings on Mr Magneto) and you'll have truly bald spots on your scalp where you pulled it.  I digress.You could get it cut shorter. Or you could just wait and then have it shaved when you feel that super-tingly and the roots loosen. Or you could do your own thing.    For me, cutting my hair short was a way of preparing myself, an intermediary stage to something completely different.  But I had pretty long hair.  In retrospect, what I wish I had spent more time doing was running my hands through it and paying attention to how it swung against my face, and how the air blows it... because I didn't get to have those experiences for about two years after my hair fell out. My advice (for you to take or leave): Just enjoy it.  Feel it. If you have a partner, and you like him or her touching it, playing with it, stroking your head then do that... do lots of that!  It is now three years since I was diagnosed and I still don't look anything like I looked before I was diagnosed. That's not bad. It's just the truth. Every now and then, I look a little like my old self, hair- and face-wise. For what it's worth, I still think almost every day about women who are starting chemo.  I'm rooting for you, Divine! I'm rooting for all of you! For all of us!  (love to Nico, my bump-girl)  http://rockthebald.blogspot.com/2008/05/upon-which-i-describe-how-bald-is.html",

Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.) The usual caveat applies: Not everything works for everybody! We all find our own path, admittedly, with the help of others on the path, and who have walked it before us. P.S. Keep moving (e.g., go for walks). I swear it helps! rockthebald, nyc. 43 (Today's my birthday!) Receiving treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering in 2008. IDC, DCIS, LCIS. 1.8 cm. Stage 1/2-ish (T1No (i+) or T1N1 (mx)) Chemo: dose-dense, A/C + T. A Pre-Chemo Shopping List None of this is \"new\" but it might be helpful to someone (like me) whose chemo started on short notice. - Purell-type hand-sanitizer. I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth. Warning: Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride -- like Crest pro-health -- may stain your teeth. Seriously.) - Imodium - Anticonstipation: Walnuts, pecans, almonds, dried apricots, prunes, prune juice, Colace, Miralax, Senekot-S, activia yogurt (No need to buy all of these. See what you need & what works for you!) - Pepcid - disposable flatware, plates and cups (for times when you're tired or immune-suppressed; plastic flatware helps offset metallic taste in mouth) - Sugarfree chewing gum, sugar free hard candy (some people prefer lemon flavor) or breath mints - Protein food sources (e.g., peanut butter, nuts, clams, oysters, meat, avoid soy if you are ER+) - unscented moisturizer - sunscreen (for face and for everything else; SPF 15+) - new or washed shower curtain liner (minimize bacteria, mold) - new toothbrushes (mouth is really vulnerable to infections, sores; oral hygiene is super-important) - another thermometer (since tracking temp matters) - at least one extra box of Kleenex - indiv packets of kleenexes (disappearance of nose hairs = dripping nose) - a box/packet of the flushable moist wipes (I use these wipes the first few days after chemo to prevent the discomfort/burning that may accompany urination; these may help soothe irritated tissues. Others use a squirt bottle.) - Thing of Clorox-type wipes - artificial tears for dry eyes (consider Renew or Similasan brands) - acidopholus capsules for yeast infections if you're prone to them - nonlatex gloves to wear when doing dishes, etc. to reduce nicks and cuts, at least on those low blood count days toward the end of treatment. Food - unsweetened indiv things of applesauce - individ things of cottage cheese (I find smaller servings less daunting on a queasy stomach, and may be less wasteful in the long haul) - Eggbeaters (bland, protein) - brown rice - crackers (inc indiv packets of animal crackers or Saltines to carry around or keep in desk drawer or nightstand for queasy moments. ER+ should watch out for soy -- it's in a lot of cracker sandwiches) - dried apricots and fruit (helps with constip) - lentil soup, black bean soup, chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles, orange Pedialyte For those of us facing hair loss: http://www.4women.com http://www.sparklingearth.com/products.asp?categor... http://www.bandanas.net/skullbest.htm http://www.myskullcaps.com/ http://www.sungrubbies.com Pointers on tying scarves: http://www.coveryourhair.com/HowToTieTiechels.html http://www.tznius.com/ This has more extensive scarf tying instructions (click on link in nav bar or at the bottom of the home page). - You Tube: search \"how to tie head wraps.\" The video is by galaxyswurl.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first. (See Starting Chemo May 2008 converation to get a sense of when, where and how much hair is lost over time!) Food. Protein and iron rich foods may help boost RBC: Meat chili, clams, oysters, some beans, nuts Here is a link for Summer Express: 101 meals to be prepared in 10 minutes or less. http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/18/dining/18mini.html?_r=1&scp=10&sq=100+recipes&st=nyt&oref=slogin And 101 fast recipes for inspired picnics http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/02/dining/02mlis.html?scp=2&sq=101+picnic&st=nyt Supplements: Check with a dietician or a nutritionist about supplements and multivitamins. (My A/C + T regimen may contribute to bone loss. I checked with MSKCC dietician & a nutritionist and they recommended I take Calcium Citrate, Magnesium, Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) during chemo (and forever) to combat bone loss. They said \"not during chemo\" to everything else, including a multivitamin. They also said \"never\" to most soy products [I am ER+] -- only 2 servings a week-- and Vitamin C supplements.)

Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first. (See Starting Chemo May 2008 converation to get a sense of when, where and how much hair is lost over time!) Food.

Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.) The usual caveat applies: Not everything works for everybody! We all find our own path, admittedly, with the help of others on the path, and who have walked it before us. P.S. Keep moving (e.g., go for walks). I swear it helps! rockthebald, nyc. 43 (Today's my birthday!) Receiving treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering in 2008. IDC, DCIS, LCIS. 1.8 cm. Stage 1/2-ish (T1No (i+) or T1N1 (mx)) Chemo: dose-dense, A/C + T. A Pre-Chemo Shopping List None of this is \"new\" but it might be helpful to someone (like me) whose chemo started on short notice. - Purell-type hand-sanitizer. I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth. Warning: Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride -- like Crest pro-health -- may stain your teeth. Seriously.) - Imodium - Anticonstipation: Walnuts, pecans, almonds, dried apricots, prunes, prune juice, Colace, Miralax, Senekot-S, activia yogurt (No need to buy all of these. See what you need & what works for you!) - Pepcid - disposable flatware, plates and cups (for times when you're tired or immune-suppressed; plastic flatware helps offset metallic taste in mouth) - Sugarfree chewing gum, sugar free hard candy (some people prefer lemon flavor) or breath mints - Protein food sources (e.g., peanut butter, nuts, clams, oysters, meat, avoid soy if you are ER+) - unscented moisturizer - sunscreen (for face and for everything else; SPF 15+) - new or washed shower curtain liner (minimize bacteria, mold) - new toothbrushes (mouth is really vulnerable to infections, sores; oral hygiene is super-important) - another thermometer (since tracking temp matters) - at least one extra box of Kleenex - indiv packets of kleenexes (disappearance of nose hairs = dripping nose) - a box/packet of the flushable moist wipes (I use these wipes the first few days after chemo to prevent the discomfort/burning that may accompany urination; these may help soothe irritated tissues. Others use a squirt bottle.) - Thing of Clorox-type wipes - artificial tears for dry eyes (consider Renew or Similasan brands) - acidopholus capsules for yeast infections if you're prone to them - nonlatex gloves to wear when doing dishes, etc. to reduce nicks and cuts, at least on those low blood count days toward the end of treatment. Food - unsweetened indiv things of applesauce - individ things of cottage cheese (I find smaller servings less daunting on a queasy stomach, and may be less wasteful in the long haul) - Eggbeaters (bland, protein) - brown rice - crackers (inc indiv packets of animal crackers or Saltines to carry around or keep in desk drawer or nightstand for queasy moments. ER+ should watch out for soy -- it's in a lot of cracker sandwiches) - dried apricots and fruit (helps with constip) - lentil soup, black bean soup, chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles, orange Pedialyte For those of us facing hair loss: http://www.4women.com http://www.sparklingearth.com/products.asp?categor... http://www.bandanas.net/skullbest.htm http://www.myskullcaps.com/ http://www.sungrubbies.com Pointers on tying scarves: http://www.coveryourhair.com/HowToTieTiechels.html http://www.tznius.com/ This has more extensive scarf tying instructions (click on link in nav bar or at the bottom of the home page). - You Tube: search \"how to tie head wraps.\" The video is by galaxyswurl.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water.

ER+ should watch out for soy -- it's in a lot of cracker sandwiches) - dried apricots and fruit (helps with constip) - lentil soup, black bean soup, chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles, orange Pedialyte For those of us facing hair loss: http://www.4women.com http://www.sparklingearth.com/products.asp?categor... http://www.bandanas.net/skullbest.htm http://www.myskullcaps.com/ http://www.sungrubbies.com Pointers on tying scarves: http://www.coveryourhair.com/HowToTieTiechels.html http://www.tznius.com/ This has more extensive scarf tying instructions (click on link in nav bar or at the bottom of the home page). - You Tube: search \"how to tie head wraps.\" The video is by galaxyswurl.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first. (See Starting Chemo May 2008 converation to get a sense of when, where and how much hair is lost over time!) Food.

I checked with MSKCC dietician & a nutritionist and they recommended I take Calcium Citrate, Magnesium, Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) during chemo (and forever) to combat bone loss. They said \"not during chemo\" to everything else, including a multivitamin. They also said \"never\" to most soy products [I am ER+] -- only 2 servings a week-- and Vitamin C supplements.)

Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.) The usual caveat applies: Not everything works for everybody! We all find our own path, admittedly, with the help of others on the path, and who have walked it before us. P.S.

(My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first.

Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.) The usual caveat applies: Not everything works for everybody! We all find our own path, admittedly, with the help of others on the path, and who have walked it before us. P.S. Keep moving (e.g., go for walks). I swear it helps! rockthebald, nyc. 43 (Today's my birthday!) Receiving treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering in 2008. IDC, DCIS, LCIS. 1.8 cm. Stage 1/2-ish (T1No (i+) or T1N1 (mx)) Chemo: dose-dense, A/C + T. A Pre-Chemo Shopping List None of this is \"new\" but it might be helpful to someone (like me) whose chemo started on short notice. - Purell-type hand-sanitizer. I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth. Warning: Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride -- like Crest pro-health -- may stain your teeth. Seriously.) - Imodium - Anticonstipation: Walnuts, pecans, almonds, dried apricots, prunes, prune juice, Colace, Miralax, Senekot-S, activia yogurt (No need to buy all of these. See what you need & what works for you!) - Pepcid - disposable flatware, plates and cups (for times when you're tired or immune-suppressed; plastic flatware helps offset metallic taste in mouth) - Sugarfree chewing gum, sugar free hard candy (some people prefer lemon flavor) or breath mints - Protein food sources (e.g., peanut butter, nuts, clams, oysters, meat, avoid soy if you are ER+) - unscented moisturizer - sunscreen (for face and for everything else; SPF 15+) - new or washed shower curtain liner (minimize bacteria, mold) - new toothbrushes (mouth is really vulnerable to infections, sores; oral hygiene is super-important) - another thermometer (since tracking temp matters) - at least one extra box of Kleenex - indiv packets of kleenexes (disappearance of nose hairs = dripping nose) - a box/packet of the flushable moist wipes (I use these wipes the first few days after chemo to prevent the discomfort/burning that may accompany urination; these may help soothe irritated tissues. Others use a squirt bottle.) - Thing of Clorox-type wipes - artificial tears for dry eyes (consider Renew or Similasan brands) - acidopholus capsules for yeast infections if you're prone to them - nonlatex gloves to wear when doing dishes, etc. to reduce nicks and cuts, at least on those low blood count days toward the end of treatment. Food - unsweetened indiv things of applesauce - individ things of cottage cheese (I find smaller servings less daunting on a queasy stomach, and may be less wasteful in the long haul) - Eggbeaters (bland, protein) - brown rice - crackers (inc indiv packets of animal crackers or Saltines to carry around or keep in desk drawer or nightstand for queasy moments. ER+ should watch out for soy -- it's in a lot of cracker sandwiches) - dried apricots and fruit (helps with constip) - lentil soup, black bean soup, chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles, orange Pedialyte For those of us facing hair loss: http://www.4women.com http://www.sparklingearth.com/products.asp?categor... http://www.bandanas.net/skullbest.htm http://www.myskullcaps.com/ http://www.sungrubbies.com Pointers on tying scarves: http://www.coveryourhair.com/HowToTieTiechels.html http://www.tznius.com/ This has more extensive scarf tying instructions (click on link in nav bar or at the bottom of the home page). - You Tube: search \"how to tie head wraps.\" The video is by galaxyswurl.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first.

Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first. (See Starting Chemo May 2008 converation to get a sense of when, where and how much hair is lost over time!) Food.

Melissa's tips are great. (Posts by member \"otter\" are invaluable, and reliable). (The initial list & tips were compiled by my wonderful friend Miki, though it has been updated and modified a lot since.) I got tired of bumping and reposting these so started a new conversation. I will update it until December 2008. As Otter has pointed out elsewhere, before you rent a U-Haul and head to Walmart to buy everything on the list, bear in mind that you are NOT going to need most of it! It's here as a resource for when/if issues do arrive, not as a list of must-haves. You should feel free to distribute this info high and low, translate it, etc.! All I ask is that whenever the list is posted, a) credit be given where credit is due to all contributors & editors (not just me, but also melissaga, the women of breastcancer.org, Mary C & Deirdre P., the \"diffusers,\" any translators, etc!); b) the \"new\" post(s) refer back to this conversation, which is the one I will update/assume responsibilty for, at least until December 2008; and c) people clarify their changes & additions (misinformation is just too common and while I welcome being given the opportunity to correct my mistakes, I do not want to be held accountable for others'.) The usual caveat applies: Not everything works for everybody! We all find our own path, admittedly, with the help of others on the path, and who have walked it before us. P.S. Keep moving (e.g., go for walks). I swear it helps! rockthebald, nyc. 43 (Today's my birthday!) Receiving treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering in 2008. IDC, DCIS, LCIS. 1.8 cm. Stage 1/2-ish (T1No (i+) or T1N1 (mx)) Chemo: dose-dense, A/C + T. A Pre-Chemo Shopping List None of this is \"new\" but it might be helpful to someone (like me) whose chemo started on short notice. - Purell-type hand-sanitizer. I'd recommend getting a couple travel sized bottle as well to throw in your backpack, glove compartment, etc. (Beware the scented ones; they can smell like cheap Tequila!) - Tylenol (painkiller) or Ibuprofen (ask your oncologist which is preferred; some chemo drugs work the kidneys, others the liver so your doc may prefer one drug over another) - Biotene mouthwash, Biotene also makes a small bottle of mouth rinse which helps prevent/treat sore mouth. Warning: Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride -- like Crest pro-health -- may stain your teeth. Seriously.) - Imodium - Anticonstipation: Walnuts, pecans, almonds, dried apricots, prunes, prune juice, Colace, Miralax, Senekot-S, activia yogurt (No need to buy all of these. See what you need & what works for you!) - Pepcid - disposable flatware, plates and cups (for times when you're tired or immune-suppressed; plastic flatware helps offset metallic taste in mouth) - Sugarfree chewing gum, sugar free hard candy (some people prefer lemon flavor) or breath mints - Protein food sources (e.g., peanut butter, nuts, clams, oysters, meat, avoid soy if you are ER+) - unscented moisturizer - sunscreen (for face and for everything else; SPF 15+) - new or washed shower curtain liner (minimize bacteria, mold) - new toothbrushes (mouth is really vulnerable to infections, sores; oral hygiene is super-important) - another thermometer (since tracking temp matters) - at least one extra box of Kleenex - indiv packets of kleenexes (disappearance of nose hairs = dripping nose) - a box/packet of the flushable moist wipes (I use these wipes the first few days after chemo to prevent the discomfort/burning that may accompany urination; these may help soothe irritated tissues. Others use a squirt bottle.) - Thing of Clorox-type wipes - artificial tears for dry eyes (consider Renew or Similasan brands) - acidopholus capsules for yeast infections if you're prone to them - nonlatex gloves to wear when doing dishes, etc. to reduce nicks and cuts, at least on those low blood count days toward the end of treatment. Food - unsweetened indiv things of applesauce - individ things of cottage cheese (I find smaller servings less daunting on a queasy stomach, and may be less wasteful in the long haul) - Eggbeaters (bland, protein) - brown rice - crackers (inc indiv packets of animal crackers or Saltines to carry around or keep in desk drawer or nightstand for queasy moments. ER+ should watch out for soy -- it's in a lot of cracker sandwiches) - dried apricots and fruit (helps with constip) - lentil soup, black bean soup, chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles, orange Pedialyte For those of us facing hair loss: http://www.4women.com http://www.sparklingearth.com/products.asp?categor... http://www.bandanas.net/skullbest.htm http://www.myskullcaps.com/ http://www.sungrubbies.com Pointers on tying scarves: http://www.coveryourhair.com/HowToTieTiechels.html http://www.tznius.com/ This has more extensive scarf tying instructions (click on link in nav bar or at the bottom of the home page). - You Tube: search \"how to tie head wraps.\" The video is by galaxyswurl.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful.

ER+ should watch out for soy -- it's in a lot of cracker sandwiches) - dried apricots and fruit (helps with constip) - lentil soup, black bean soup, chicken broth, or some mild soup, just in case you wind up with an upset stomach and need something bland to eat - orange popsicles, orange Pedialyte For those of us facing hair loss: http://www.4women.com http://www.sparklingearth.com/products.asp?categor... http://www.bandanas.net/skullbest.htm http://www.myskullcaps.com/ http://www.sungrubbies.com Pointers on tying scarves: http://www.coveryourhair.com/HowToTieTiechels.html http://www.tznius.com/ This has more extensive scarf tying instructions (click on link in nav bar or at the bottom of the home page). - You Tube: search \"how to tie head wraps.\" The video is by galaxyswurl.

I did and it was much cooler -- NYC spring/summer -- and easier to forget about the hairloss. See breastcancer.org \"Starting Chemo in May 2008\" conversation) ******* Chemotherapy Tips As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\": (A great project for a friend). Assemble a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse to car or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol or Ibuprofen (ask your onco), toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills, mouth rinse. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. And when I say \"a lot\" I mean \"a normal lot\" not so much that you get sick from drinking too much water! You want to be well-hydrated (makes it easier to draw blood and to start an infusion; helps metabolize the drugs post-chemo, too). \u2022 For moisturizers, you may prefer unscented lotions (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended; I liked Udderly SMOOth with urea, available at www.drugstore.com). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 MOVE AROUND. Try to go for a walk on most days if you can. You will be glad you did. It keeps the extra pounds off (that some people gain from the steroids), gives you more energy, lifts your mood. I was never one for regular exercise before but walking? I'm sold on its benefits. \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. I was told to flush twice first 2 days after chemo (I was on A/C). \u2022 Replace (or wash w/ bleach) the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash and/or mouthrinse (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 The mouth sore cocktail: Equal parts of any liquid benadryl and liquid Maalox. Only mix up what you are going to use (about 1 teaspoon of each). Swish in mouth for a minute or two like a mouthwash. Then spit out. \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Some women recommend Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer ever.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere on www.breastcancer.org.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful. Locating \"Good veins\" Yesterday I learned some handy-dandy pointeers for making it easier to locate a \"good\" vein from which to draw blood or start an IV. \u2022 A/C can be hard on the veins. At some hospitals, women on A/C automatically have a port surgically installed. At MSKCC, however, I was given the opportunity to use my veins. The goal is to keep my veins in good enough health that I can use them for all 8 treatments. Another goal is to \"start low\" on the arm so that if one vein is blown, then they can work their way up. A nurse can go to a higher vein for attempt #2, but she cannot go lower. \u2022 The standard advice is \"Drink lots of water\" because hydrated veins are easier to find and stick. I still \"blew\" a vein on the back of my wrist on #4. At #5, I asked the phlebotomist (not the nurse), \"Any pointers? Any advice?\" She said, \"Well, I've noticed that your hands are always cold. Cold veins don't work very well. Warm up your hands before they put in the IV, draw blood, etc. You could use a hot pack or you could just rub your hands together. Run them under warm water. \" That's odd, my hand is cold? Why is that? And this wonderful, brilliant phlebotomist said, \"You're probably drinking a lot of water. Are you holding your water in your right hand? It's probably cooling off your hand and your circulation in that hand. Either drink room temperature water or hold the bottle of water in your other hand.\" I could have kissed her. \u2022 The nurse also has a technique for finding good veins. She had me hang my arm down off a pillow and pumping my hand open and closed to make it easier to identify a vein. The result? My IV was about 2 inches above my wrist (still low, I have another six inches of forearm to use!) and it went off without a hitch. Pain/aches \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice for A/C as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") The poster suggested taking a painkiller 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. A/C & Ibuprofen are processed through the liver; Taxol and Tylenol are processed through the kidneys. For this reason, I was urged to use Ibuprofen w/ Taxol and to use Tylenol w/ A/C. [I find it all very confusing; \"Ask your doctor which pain reliever is right for you.\"] \u2022 Regular exercise (e.g., a walk) seems to help lessen or prevent Neulasta pain for many of us Sleeplessness (esp in first few days post chemo) \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Eating fiber in days before chemo can help prevent/lessen constipation. And trust me, constipation on chemo can be excruciating. \u2022 Prune juice (you can mix it with Milk of Magnesia for a \"cocktail\") \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then lots of water and tea. \u2022 Eat active culture or probiotic yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee (if you've gone 'off it') may help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. \u2022 Bleeding hemorrhoids are not uncommon if you experience a lot of constipation. Prevention is key! Lotsa fiber! If it does develop, Tux pads can make you more comfortable, or baby wipes. And Colace or Fiber One or a stool softener can help you avoid straining. \u2022 Someone else keeps a squirt bottle (like a water bottle or a ketchup bottle) by the toilet and to rinse off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. Remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections (or is it the other way around?) Neuropathy and Hand Foot Syndrome (associated with the Taxanes) * Avoid going barefoot. Wear slippers or \"crocs\" always. * Gently massage feet and hands with lotion to keep them soft and improve circulation. (I like Udderly SMOOth with Urea. Reasonably priced; available at www.drugstore.com) * Wash hands (and dishes) in lukewarm water, not hot. * Ask onco about taking 50 mg of B6 to address neuropathy (tingling, numbness that often appears first in feet and hands) Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net to wear at night! \u2022 You may want to get a silk, satin or flannel (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive, stubble can gouge! (My sister made me a flannel one.) \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 About 18 days after my first A/C, I had my head shaved. \u2022 When hair on head starts to fall, a lint roller (I liked the velvet covered kind) helps to remove lingering hairs. \u2022 Hair in pubic area often starts to fall out first. (See Starting Chemo May 2008 converation to get a sense of when, where and how much hair is lost over time!) Food.

(My A/C + T regimen may contribute to bone loss. I checked with MSKCC dietician & a nutritionist and they recommended I take Calcium Citrate, Magnesium, Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) during chemo (and forever) to combat bone loss. They said \"not during chemo\" to everything else, including a multivitamin. They also said \"never\" to most soy products [I am ER+] -- only 2 servings a week-- and Vitamin C supplements.)

      "Content": "May 23, 2009 10:17AM rock wrote: My friend, Dr. Mary (who performs these procedures), first sent me this description of HPV, LEEP, and LLETZ. . First-- the HPV virus that causes the cervical change may have been there a long time, or may be a recent exposure. There is not a \"standard\" incubation time-although if you have had an abnormal pap before, then this is likely due to HPV that has been there awhile. In young women (under age 20 or 21) the guidelines suggest just waiting it out and re-screening, because the natural history in that age group is that the body fights it off. HPV is a family of viruses cleverly named HPV 1, 2 , 3 etc. There are just a few strains of HPV that are considered high risk for causing cervical cancer. If it is appropriate, in some instances you can actually request a HPV type. Anything that suppresses the body's immune system makes it more likely for the HPV to persist and cause higher level change. So--if a woman is HIV positive, they should be getting screened more aggressively, etc. It is likely the chemo gave this HPV a little window. In the US, the pap grading system is now called the Bethesda system--but they usually report the pap results using the old and new lingo (kind of like the US going metric). The cellular change is on a spectrum: ASCUS----------CIN 1----------CIN 2-------------CIN 3-----------Cervical cancer ASCUS = Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance CIN = cervical intraepithelial neoplasia Sometimes the CIN 2 and 3 are lumped together as High Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (HGSIL) I don't remember seeing what your biopsy results were. When you look on the colposcopy you can kind of get a sense of severity of the lesions based on physical appearance characteristics. If you were watching, I am sure they were pointing out what they were seeing. Likely the tissue turned white with the vinegar. Sometimes it very dense white, with other characteristics to look for. We typically don't use cryotherapy much at all anymore. Cryo would freeze the top layers of skin (on the cervix) which would then die and flake off. HOWEVER--the pointed cryo tip frequently resulted in a scarred, smaller transformation zone, with the lesion \"driven into\" the os and unable to be assessed later. The success rate of the LEEP is very high. (As I recall--the rates are somewhat dependent on the skill of the provider--but the range is like from 85% to 95% success in complete removal of \"at risk\" tissue.) The idea is to remove all the tissue that is embryologically programmed for natural change (\"the transformation zone\") and thus protect you from the risk of abnormal change, or cervical cancer. Glands on the face of the cervix drop down about 8 mm, so they will at least remove 10 mm (or 1 cm--not all metric education was for naught!) of the length of the cervix. If the ECC (Endocervical Curettage--scraping inside the cervical canal) was negative for any abnormalities, then they will remove the external tissue only. IF the ECC was positive--they will do an extra excision in the canal. We call that a LEEP Conization. Following the tissue removal, a cautery ball is used to cauterize the base of the wound. The LEEP loop using thermal energy and does a mild cautery on the first pass through. The additional cautery is to prevent significant bleeding. Here, we usually have our pathology results back in 1 to 2 weeks. I am sure each institution has their own turn around time. The magic words that are really cool to see in the path report are \"negative excision margins\"--that means there are no abnormal tissue areas at the edges of the removed tissue. We treat the base of the wound with \"Monsel's solution\" which is a chemical cautery. It goes on looking yellow, interacts with the blood, and comes out looking brown or black Your body will go into full gear to heal this area, and you may notice a clear discharge. If the discharge starts to smell bad, or you develop abdominal pain or fever--you should call the doctor. They would likely put you on antibiotics for a pelvic infection. We see people back at 3 weeks, and try to pass a small q-tip into the cervical opening. If it passes easily- great. IF not, we worry about scarring. Since you are not particularly expressing pregnancy plans, the scarring wouldn't be significant from a fertility point of view, but it could make your periods more crampy--so it would still get some treatment. Most people do very well during the procedure and afterword. If alot of cautery has to be used, they may cramp more--usually well managed by 800 mg of Ibuprofen and perhaps a couple of Lortab. We usually have folks rest the remainder of the day, and recommend they not do heavy lifting for 1 week. No sex--or vaginal tampon use--for 4 weeks. (some people might say 3 , some 6) You may have a little more lengthy healing process due to the Tamoxifen, and your resultant estrogen deficiency. In post-menopausal women we might offer topical estrogen--although I am pretty sure you are not too interested in that. There was a cream called \"Aminocerv\" that used to be available in the US--and then went away. It provides Amino acids, and a little bit of urea which helps break down scar tissue and promote \"soft\" healing. Aminocerv might still be available in South Africa.",
