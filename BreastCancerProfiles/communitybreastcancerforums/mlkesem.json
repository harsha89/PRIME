I am swimming and I am forever looking to see if it is floating ahead of me. But I do laugh about it.  My biggest dilemma is a wedding I am going to. I want to wear the dress I wore to my daughters just a year ago but know that I am heavier thanks to tamoxifen and missing part of the cleavage. Is it worth fixing what you already have or trying to find another. You guys mentioned photos where are they. I live in a hot climate and the prosthetic is soooo hot. Has anyone bought anything from softee or bosombuddy???? Thanks, Mlkesem",

I found the lumps myself on Aug 1 2008 diagnosed a few weeks later with 3 tumors of Invasive carcinoma and had surgery September 24th. I also would inquire immediately about having your ovaries removed. Have you been tested genetically? I have a strong familial component but am not braca positive - the onc here thinks I should consider it but I am 62. All I can say is try and surround yourself with supportive people and bug the hell out of the doctors to operate sooner. If in fact you know there is no choice but to wait then use what ever medicinal means is offered to get through the anxiety of it all. Good luck - not sure what I can say that will make you feel better - do the things you enjoy and indulge yourself with warmth and kindness of others  Mlkesem ",
