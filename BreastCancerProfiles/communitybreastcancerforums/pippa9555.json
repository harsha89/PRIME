    "Content": "pippa9555 wrote: I was diagnosed with bc 2 years ago and recently had microcalcifications on my other breast which lead to a biopsy and a hellish 2 weeks of waiting for results.  I think I aged another year in that time, but also realized what a blessed life I have with so many wonderful supportive friends.   I have been very reluctant to post on here because frankly I never wanted to be part of this club, just like I'm sure every other women here feels. But I feel differently about posting now.  The women on these boards are so amazing and supportive that I want to say, \"thank you\" for being there for me on some very dark days.  Although everyone's journey is different, I have learned so much on here and have found a lot of comfort through other women's stories. My recent biopsy was benign and I am so relieved, but I can still remember being diagnosed with breast cancer. It's so shocking at first, but you get through it one day at a time.  For those of you just being diagnosed, please remember it will get better and you are a lot stronger then you can imagine.  It's life changing to be diagnosed with breast cancer, but your life is not over, it's just changed.
