I went to my GP yesterday and she removed the stitches, noticed that my lymp node was feeling very lumpy and swollen, but told me it was likely due to the biopsy/excision. Which is pretty much in the same area. She told me results are not back yet and she would call as soon as they came in....SO, I called the sugeon's office and the receptionist advised that he was off this week. Geeez. Anyway, I asked her if she could see if the test came back....she does a little search and asks, if he had removed something from my breast. I correct her and say no, a cyst like thing under armpit and she quicky says that it will likely take two weeks. Her question about the breast makes me nervous, It clearly said on my little day surgery chart....removal leison left axillary....nothing about breasts. Sorry guys, to sound like a nut case, but I am going out of my mind and just want to know something. I am driving myself batty googling images of excised lumps and trying to compare them with what mine looked like. Thank you  for listening. Mimi, Do you know what type you have yet?",

Left with some sitches and some pain....Just wondering if any of you actually  saw your lump and what it may have looked like. When the nurse showed me what they took out. Mine looked a bit like shrimp or crab meat. I will not be getting my results for 8 to 10 days and I am to say the least pretty scared. I just lost my Mom last August to BC after she put up a good fight for seven years. She was 60 when she died and I have two little ones of my own. I really don't think I have what it takes to beat this if it is what my gut is telling me it is. I always thought malignant lumps would be black??? Mine was solid and orange and white. My surgeon has sent 4 pieces of it  off for further examination. What did your lumps look like? Thanks Katz Log in to post a reply",
