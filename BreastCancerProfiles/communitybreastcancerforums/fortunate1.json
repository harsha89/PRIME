I think Leaf has good answers for you. Write down every question you can think of for the Dr. appt. and make sure you understand the answers. My BC was lobular, which doesn't usually show up as a lump and isn't round. It also is easy to miss on a mammo. Mine conveniently did form a lump for me to find, which was confirmed with ultrasound. I pushed on it a lot while working my way through a prolonged diagnostic period, so it did indeed feel bruised. Don't know if this helps at all.  I hope that the Doc can give her some peace of mind (and maybe a biopsy).  ",
