It sometimes has to do with the fact that people might be in a different time zone. I don't have any answers to your questions but just wanted you to know that you are not alone! Try to keep positive and try not to google too much. I did the same, I was looking for someone with the exact same things going on as me and then realised that it just doesn't help. It just makes you go nuts! The wait is the hardest part but keep in mind that most things turn out to be benign. I am sure you will get more replies and actual answers to your questions, big hug!",

I will have to see what happens on Monday, nothing I can do anyways. Not too worried about the pain or anything. Whatever needs to be done, needs to be done, whether it is painfull or not. I just have wait and see.... Doesn't mean I am not worried anymore. I am, but I also realize that it is what it is and there is nothing I can do to change anything. Just hoping it will all turn out to be ok.",

As I live in Central America the results are in Spanish. But from what my doctor said and what I can find online it means that the assessment is incomplete. I am just hoping for the best and am trying to stay positive but it's a bit hard as I just lost my mom and am now being confronted with it again. The thought alone makes me very emotional, especially because I have a little son... Fingers crossed for next week!",

He wanted to check everything and said we could wait and check again in 3 months and then again in 6 or do the biopsy. I decided to do the biopsy as I would just be stressed out for 6 months. Also because there would still be a chance of having to get the biopsy done. The biopsy was this morning and I was surprised by the amount of tissue they took out (about 4.5 cm by 1 or 2 cm). But he said they got the whole area so at least that is good. Now I \"just\" have to wait for the results, about 10 days.  I will give another update as soon as I know more. Not that the biopsy is done I have another question. Considering how much tissue was taken out, will this leave a big \"hole\" in my breast? I guess you will be able to see it but I just wonder how much you will see.",

The conclusion was (the results are in Spanish so I hope I translated them correctly): Ductal microcalcifications associated with ductal hyperplasia non-atypical cribriform & apocrine micropapillary with associated fybrocystic mastitis. Thanks!",
