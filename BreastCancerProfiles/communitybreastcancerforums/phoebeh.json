And while this is no laughing matter, I have to laugh at how silly my main question feels. I don't like to take myself too seriously. I've had a lump in my right breast for a couple months now, and I've got a call in to my internist to see about getting it checked out. I am small-chested & don't usually get lumps of any sort & I have a couple other reasons for worry. I probably should have called before now, but I've had all kinds of medical & hormonal changes that I figured were responsible for changes in the feel that have occured over probably the last year or so (I haven't been good about writing it down). I'll get my silliest & also most pressing question out of the way first: Is there such a thing as being too flat-chested for a mammogram? I'm lopsided (visibly so), and have been for years. The lump has actually occured in the smaller breast, which is about an A cup (my left being a little over a B, if that's not tmi). I'm concerned that if I get sent for a mammogram, since it's in the A & feels close to the chest wall, it would pretty much be a pointless procedure. Weirdly enough, I almost think my right breast has shrunk a bit in the past few months, though that seems counterintuitive. Also wondering if I need to worry about an itchy nipple that does not have a visible rash? I've had it in the right breast as well, w/ some flaking, but it doesn't seem red or inflamed. I've used hydrocortisone cream on it & not had much relief even. But then I tend to have big problems w/ dry skin in the winter. A bit of my history if it helps: I'm 34, never had a mammogram. I think I have a somewhat raised risk--I'm child-free, overweight, and I've had to take bcp's (both combo & progestin-only) due to PCOS and endometrial hyperplasia that my doctor described as \"pre-cancerous\" due to atypical cells. Not taking the mini-pill inevitably leads to pretty horrific periods, including hemorraging. The endometrial hyperplasia got significantly worse a year ago leading to a cancer scare, & the atypia diagnosis. I've been told I'm likely at higher risk for endometrial and/or ovarian cancer as I've had serious issues w/ periods since I started around 11. I know that chances are, statistically, that it's nothing...it's fairly smooth, though not really mobile. I just don't usually get cysts--at least not ones I can feel. And w/ one cancer scare already this year, I guess I probably have it on the brain. But with the changes & going up & down on hormones to try to get the other stuff under control, I'm a little worried. And I really do wonder about whether a mammogram is even advisable for someone as flat on one side as I am LOL. Log in to post a reply",

At this point I feel like it is what it is, regarding my flat-chestedness. itsjustme10--I did not even think of that! I guess I thought that perhaps for men and us less endowed women they would go straight to ultrasound and/or MRI. I still don't know how they'll get the portion where the lump is in, but I guess I'll find out if the doc orders the mammogram. My doc is going to try to squeeze me in Friday morning so if I need tests then I can be sent right over to the hospital for them. I'm not really anxious, having been through the waiting before... it can't be any worse than getting an endometrial biopsy, right? Does anyone have any insight on the itching w/out a visible rash? If it helps, there are days when it's not so bad, and days when it drives me bonkers. But it is almost always there, just not red or rashy (unless I've been scratching out of annoyance.) Thanks again!",
