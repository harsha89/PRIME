I have been on Taxol since September of 2010 and have had absolutely no problems with it.  The only SE I can complain about is a little tingling on my toes.  Dr recommended some powder that I have not taken so cannot comment much on that.  I receive treatment in San Antonio which is 150 miles (one way) away from home once a week.  Though someone always goes with me, I do feel good enough to drive home and at times split the drive home with my husband.  Everyone is different and responds different to treatment.  I hope it works as well for you as it has for me.  Best of luck!

      "Content": "May 14, 2013 10:35AM frankandfernsmom wrote: Finally!!  I have time to answer my 5 questions!!  Sorry it took me so long..... I was born in Houston, TX but raised (or reared) in Del Rio, TX.  Woo-Hoo!!  The big city!!!  The reason I was born in Houston is because I was adopted through Catholic Charities.  I tried finding out information about my biological family when initially diagnosed, but birth mom was not willing to share much.  All I know is that my birthmom was around 23 years old and of Mexican descent and that my birthfather was 56 years old and of Czech descent.  Hmmmm.... makes me wonder what happened there.... Doesn't seem concentual to me.... ANYWAY.... I was adopted and raised by my PARENTS who were wonderful!!! They had previously adopted my brother before me.  I had a great childhood filled with love and pretty much just lived a normal life.  I graduated from Texas A&M University with a degree in Education Curriculum and Instruction and taught Math for 21 years.  A few years at the local HS but the majority at middle school.  Totally  LOVE middle school.  I know.... crazy!!!!  The majority of my years teaching were here in Del Rio, but we did live in Brownsville, TX where I taught math for 9 years.  When I was about to start my first chemo is when my husband suggested that I take an early disability retirement.  I love being home!!  I have a 9 year old that keeps me very busy!!  I am married to a University of Texas Longhorn and we will be celebrating our 13th anniversary this summer.  He has been a God-send!  He is always supportive and is always there with me at my doctor visits.  He has a wonderful family who is also available to go with me to doctors appointments, as I travel 300 miles rt once a week for treatment and @800 miles rt for quarterly checkups at MDA.  A lot of driving!!!  I have 3 wonderful sons.  The oldest just graduated with his Master of Public Service & Administration from the Bush School at Texas A&M University.  Whoop!! The tradition continues!!!  My second son just completed his 2nd year at Texas A&M as well!!  Then I have a 9 year old 3rd grader who keeps me super busy between school work, cub scouts, and baseball.  But I love every minute of it!!!  I was diagnosed stage IV from the get go in May of 2009.  I have multiple metastasis in my bones.  I have mets in my spine, pelvis, sternum, ribs, femur, and skull.  Too many to count!  I felt all gloom and doom upon hearing my prognosis but hey!!  I'M STILL HERE!!! And going strong, I might add!!!!  I have rarely felt sick during my treatments, I have good energy, I am active, and with the exception of tingling fingers and toes, I feel pretty darn good!!  Upon diagnosis, I honestly didn't think I would be around for my oldest son's graduation from college!  But here I am!! I currently have  a lesion on my liver but will have that taken care of tomorrow.  I will be in San Antonio getting cyberknife!  I am hoping that will take care of the liver problem and I can go back to living my life.  I hope to be around for a couple more years!!! As for a bucket list....I don't necessarily have a list, but if I want to do something or go somewhere, we do it!!  Life is too short!!  I have been able to visit Washington DC, Chicago, IL (went to see Oprah), Portland, California, Arizona, Vegas, Disneyland and Disneyworld, New Orleans, Puerto Vallarta, and Spain.  Next, I would like to go visit one of my best friends who lives in Colorado Springs, CO...  Hoping to go this summer.  Other than that, there are still some places here in the great state of Texas that I would like to visit.... Any suggestions?.... As for advice for the newly diagnosed... Information is very important!!  I feel you need to be proactive when it comes to your health!  Read, learn, ask questions, get to know your doctor.  If you are not satisfied, keep asking or find a doctor to your liking.  Don't be intimidated.  It's YOUR health you're dealing with!  Surround yourself with supportive people.  Let go of the negative.  Just don't allow it!!  Find a forum you are comfortable with, such as this one.  It has really helped me connecting with other women who are facing the same things. I hope I was able to give everyone a little insight into my life.  I hope it wasn't too long.... hehe Thanks Katie for asking the 5 questions! Best wishes to all!",
