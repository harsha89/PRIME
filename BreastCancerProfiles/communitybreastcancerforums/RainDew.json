I lose a similar amount to you every time I comb, I try to comb only once per day, and it is worse when I wash. That said, I don't have any bald spots - more just a general thinning. My hair is a lot longer though (no haircuts for 6 months means it's grown a lot) which kind of hides the thinness (it just looks different...). I now have a pretty sad little pony tail :-) I am hopeful as I approach the 16 week mark next week that it will stop soon...I'm pretty ready to move on...",

Yes I have a grade 1 tumor, so one more reason not to assume chemo would be effective. And yes even if it is, it is a small percentage benefit. (ODx have me 9% 10 yr distant recurrence chance w tamox, 1-2% chemo benefit).  So technically even with the chemo I'd be more likely to recur than to have chemo stop the recurrence. Having said all that, I don't want 10 years, I want 40 years. And if there are say 100 women, and 9 get asked to leave the room, but wait! 2 come back! Well, I want the option of being one of those 2. So I umm'd and ahh'd with my MO for 8 weeks and we finally ordered Mammaprint on top of OncoDx. (They were running some kind of special freebie for women in the ODx grey zone). Guess what? Mammaprint came back high risk. Which made this decision REALLY easy. For me - 12 crappy weeks and I know I won't ever have to look back with regret. Doesn't mean I might not be part of the 7% (someone has to be), but I will know I did what I could. For me, that is peace of mind. How are you thinking about it?",

All we know now is that AI+OS is better than tamox+OS, but not whether OS is in itself helpful...I am curious to see where this lands, but not prepared (personally) for a medical menopause until we know a little more (esp as this is hopefully coming soon). NCCN guidelines for a case like mine are 'consider chemo'. Basically there is no clear answer. I think TAILORx will have the most relevant results, but sadly too late for me.

So shave 50% off for tamox (already assumed in the ODx score) and they are closer. Not perfect, but apparently there can be some discordance between the tests. I opted for the chemo.

I was 39 at diagnosis almost a year ago, and I can tell you it DOES get better - you just can't sustain this level of panic forever. Once I had my treatment plan in place things started to feel a little better. And now, 5 months after finishing chemo, I feel almost normal most days. Some days I still get really scared, but those are far fewer than they were. Make sure you keep breathing, and get the support you need. I found a wonderful onco-psychiatrist who really helped. You may want to check out the terrific community of young women (diagnosed before 40) at the Young Survival Coalition. Big hug! Hang in there",

For a while I wore a coobie bra with the padded insert on just the one side to even things out. Now I usually don't bother - no one notices under my clothes. PS assures me it'll all fix in exchange",

I am little older than you (39) but felt the same shock - and huge huge fear of cognitive decline (I have a scientific senior role). I also fear hair loss - in my case mostly because I don't want to 'look sick'. Anyhow, I wanted to offer a different perspective from Kimmy - it has taken months for me to get my treatment plan together. I knew I wanted aggressive surgery, and I wanted to find the right breast surgeon and plastic surgeon. So it took a month between Dx and surgery. This was the worst time for me - lots of tests (MRIs, PET scan, node biopsies, genetic panel looking for BRCA).  Then post surgery I have sought multiple opinions on treatment plan (chemo v tamox only) - it's a statistics game. I still haven't decided, but will need to choose by mid July. My point is that women have very different experiences - some are rushed into tx, some take some time to decide what is right for them. Partly this is driven by Dx and tumor biology (I had a slow growing tumor) and partly by doctor preference. Remember the decisions are YOURS not your oncs.  Good luck, and let us know how it goes. Cancer sucks (and it really sucks to win the lottery in our 30s) but I can see here others get through it. Rain",
