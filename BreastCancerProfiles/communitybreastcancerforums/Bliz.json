I did so many things right as for as my health. I never in my wildest dreams thought I would have breast cancer at 55. I know, I must be dreaming. I guess a lot of my self esteem came from being healthy and fit. I also know I am throwing a huge pity party for myself right now, beause so many others have it so much worse. Still all of this does not help me get out of my funk. I guess I am just going through a lot of emotions. Right now it is sadness and anger and depression rolled into one. In general I have had a lot of minor and now this major health issue in the last two years. I feel like I have aged over night. ANd in some sick way, part of the downer is even though I have BC, it is not what is causing the rest of my malaise. Having had tons of tests and tried every menopause treatment there is, I will still have to try to figure out what that is all about after the BC treatment is over. Sorry to whine and cry so much, but I am used to feeling very good physically, mentally, emotionally and all that is really down the tubes right now.

So far I went to the general surgeon associated with the local breast center at the hospital closest to me. Pending other tests the diagnosis is invasive ductile carcinoma Stage and Grade 1. I assume the actual diagnosis wouldnt change much but the treatment might. Not really sure. Are there reasons I should go to the specialist? I am not even sure what to ask her except if she would have a different treatment opinion. Maybe something less invasive.

I would say to consult an LE massag expert and/or avoid the affected area. ",
