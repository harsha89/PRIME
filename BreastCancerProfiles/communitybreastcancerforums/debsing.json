I was immediately started on herceptin, perjeta and taxotere. I did six cycles then they took me off the taxotere and I stayed on the herceptin and perjeta together. Unfortunately, about two months later I developed skin mets so we assumed the herceptin/perjeta combo wasn't working. The skin mets also turned out to be triple +. Very weird. They then added navelbine to the herceptin and perjeta and I had some areas resolve and others progress... VERY MADDENING, NOT TOO MENTION FRIGHTENING.. I hate starting a new treatment because I feel like I'm using up another option and I'm getting closer to running out.
