No conditioning gel will keep you from losing eyelashes or eyebrows. Penciling eyebrows is possible, but when you are sick from chemo it's too much trouble. I'm wearing a wig (avoid it as much as possible because of the itching), but I never got used to being without lashes or brows. It's not a good look. But the good thing is that they come back. I now have eyebrows again. ",
