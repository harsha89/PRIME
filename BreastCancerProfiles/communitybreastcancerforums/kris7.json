Was diagnosed with breast cancer in December 2017 and had lympectomy in January 2018. Originally there was found 2 tumours in one breast but during surgery 4 in total were removed. All were small , 3 of them only 5mm and one 14mm. Report confirmed that the cancer is HER2 positive and there were some small positive margins. Anyway, I recovered really well after the surgery, had a brief chat with the surgeon who said that probably oncologist will proceed with radiotherapy and hormonal treatment. However I had to wait for oncologist appointment for up until today. And the suggestions he had for me were quite a shock. He said that the nature of my cancer would require chemotherapy, radiation and enforced menopause to stop producing the estrogen... I am 37 and dont quite know what to think of it all. I refused chemotherapy but still thinking of surgical menopause. One option is to remove my ovaries surgically and the other option is have an injection once a month for the next 5 years to keep the menopause going on. Anyone with the experience in the similar situation? Somehow feels unreal, I feel so healthy and MRI which was made after surgery showed that all is clear, my lymph nodes are clear, 2 were checked...

I was supposed to receive a call this Wednesday with the appointment, there was no call. I called them myself and got a reply that they do not give the results over the phone, only face to face. Ok, I do understand that. Got the call today with the docs appointment on Monday. Meanwhile, yesterday, I got a letter which came home with a scheduled appointment to see a doctor for beginning of March. Now i am supposed to live with no information over the weekend. I do not know what to think at all. Is it a good thing that doc will see me on monday, tell me the results and if the lump is benign then it is just a check up after 2 months...? Or how often the benign condition is checked up? And is it checked up by a doctor or ultrasound (which is performed by radiologist and not that one particular doc in question). Or it is something bad and they are just issuing the scheduled appointments with the doctor in charge... One really difficult weekend ahead... Log in to post a reply",

Surgery for removing the lumps is scheduled to the 7th of February. Doc strongly suggested the mastectomy but fo now as I am not ready to go through with it, it will be just the removal of the lumps + 5 weeks of radiotherapy. Somehow it feels now a bit easier when I know what im facing here and have the schedule and all... Now I will just deal with it.",
