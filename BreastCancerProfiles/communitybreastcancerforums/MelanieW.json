I too have wondered about some of the drugs like Zometa as a preventative.  I intend to ask my onc about this on my next visit.  I understand that insurance companies do not want to tread there because of the financial aspects.  But isn't bone mets the most common from bc?  Once dx'd with mets, then the insurance companies will certainly pay out more than they would trying to prevent it.  And no...you are not dead yet...not even close.  I think you will see that more and more as these ladies who have fought and won continue to come here to encourage you. ",

      "Content": "Feb 11, 2008 12:20PM - edited Feb 11, 2008 04:45PM by MelanieW Hello Ladies! I am from the Feb 2007 chemo group.  I just wanted to drop in and tell you all that we are thinking of you as you start your tx. After reading your posts, I want to add something.  I never took sleeping pills prior to chemo, but I found I just could not sleep without them.  Don't be afraid to ask for something.  The steroids will wind you up.  It's awful to feel so tired, but not be able to sleep.  I used them the first week following each tx.  As for ports.  I know a couple of you are still trying to decide.  I did it without one.  I did Tax/Cy/Epi every 3 weeks and had bloodwork every week.  I really did not think my veins would make it since we could only use one arm.  I developed phlebitis after tx #2.  This was a red inflamed, hard area.  They treated it with antibiotics and warm moist towels to the area.  After that, I would wrap my arm with a moist heating pad for 20 mins several times per day...especially the 10 days following tx.  I only had that one issue with phlebitis and I am happy and feel lucky that I made it through without a port.  Neulasta shot.  These were always given in my arm.  I had very minimal side effects.  I have heard that if you are giving them to yourself, then it does need to be in the stomach. This can be such an emotional roller coaster ride.  It is so important that you ladies stick together through it all.  Keep supporting each other.  We started a secret pal game that worked really nice.  One husband in the group collected the names of those who wanted to participate.  Assigned each a secret pal, sent an email survery to find out favorite colors, favorite treats, likes and dislikes.  Then sent that to their SP.  We did it for a couple of months.  It was nice to get a card or ecard or little gifts.  We set a spending limit of $5 per gift.  We actually did this after we completed chemo.  But it might be uplifting during chemo! Huggzz to you all....",
