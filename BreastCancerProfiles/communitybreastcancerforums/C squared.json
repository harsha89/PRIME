When he received the results of my CT and PET scans yesterday, he called me in the evening to let me know the GOOD results (so I wouldn't have to sweat it until Monday).  The first time I met with him I was having a he*! of a time with AC.., after writing everything down for me and switching up a few meds. he gave me his cell phone number and directed me to call him the day after my next chemo and let him know how I was doing.  Maybe he goes above and beyond but the oncologist I \"fired\" would NEVER have done any of these things muchless make me feel like it was okay to ask questions and be collaborative in my treatment.   She accused me of \"directing my own treatment\" and that was our last meeting.  The first oncologist is somewhat new to the field and has a lot to learn.  Don't get me wrong, I truely believe we all have to start out new and I respect the learning curve..., it just wasn't a good mix.  In the end, I think we both learned something from it.  IMHO it is of the utmost importance that we have a medical team behind us that  makes us feel as if they've got our back. My new oncologist has my every body part and I am blessed to have his care!",

And mets are not like Stage II. Pre-menopause and post-menopause are nowhere near each other.  Tamoxifen and AI's may bring us somewhat closer but still.  The differences are so abundant, it rarely ceases to amaze me!  Isn't that why we choose the boards that we associate with here on bc.org?  So we can relate to those who may TRULY understand.., with compassion and a true understanding. We seek to be validated and that is one of the many reasons bc.org is SUCH a great resource! I offer this perspective (as obvious as it may be to us) because we know that our loved ones, our  family, freinds, and neighbors are doing their best to comfort us and to support us.  Some want to be educated.., some \"had no idea\".  How many times has an ER+ woman been asked - \"so will they be putting you on hormone replacement therapy?\" And ya' just want to shake them & say \"did you hear a WORD that I just said? Estrogen FEEDS my cancer!\" But it makes you laugh because other-wise, you'll cry! I hope that I have not over-stepped my boundaries here.  I've noticed that (I think) all of the posts here come from women with Stage IV.  Quite honestly, I had a very limited concept of what dealing with Stage IV was like until my (32 yo) cousin taught me.  After all, I was a LE therapist working with breast cancer patients, so I \"knew\"..., AND I had alot of information to share with her. HA!  Then I asked her a VERY naive question (about having a mastectomy) and that's when I truly knew I was out of my league.  I should just LISTEN because I had lots more to learn!   Across the board, I think breast cancer is a humbling experience!  It re-aligns priorities, gives us new perspectives and provides a world of education we never signed up for! No need to feel guilty or to take on others' burdens.  Maybe we see the silver-lining a little more now.  Maybe we don't care about the \"stupid\" sh*t.  Maybe we know alot more about cancer than we ever expected. Not to be cliche but I think we laugh harder, we love deeper, and we LIVE each and every day because we want to live! ",

Her kidneys are barely functioning. I am so fearful that she is coming to the end of this awful journey though there is no talk of that from her husband.  She has 2 beautiful daughters age 9 and 12 who need their mother.  I'm wondering if I am way off base or if this is a legitimate concern (that she is nearing the end).  Can you please shed some of your wisdom on this for me?  I look forward to hearing from you.  Thank you!  ",

Good Luck & keep us posted!  ",
