I was told that due to my age (28) and how it appeared on the u/s that it was \"probably\" a benign fibroadenoma. It's that \"probably\" that gets me. I've been feeling my lump every day for 4 months. I thought I could accept the radiologist's rec and have an u/s every 6 months but I can't keep feeling my boob every day (it's started to become such a subconscious habit that I catch myself almost doing it at work. That's just going to lead to awkward conversations) between appointments so I made the decision to have a biopsy for peace of mind. That peace of mind won't come for another 2 weeks though. I like my dr and I had the u/s and will have the biopsy at a radiology center that deals specifically with women. I think they take these things seriously. However, I also think that if I was even just a few years older the recommendation of the radiologist would've been completely different and I'd have been automatically scheduled for a biopsy. The only thing that u/s told me 100% was that my lump wasn't a cyst. As slim as it may be I'm not focusing on the greater chance that it's benign, I'm focusing on the smaller chance that it's not. I would say that regardless of if they say you're too young if you're at all paranoid about it then have the biopsy. The way I see it being paranoid isn't going to kill you.",
