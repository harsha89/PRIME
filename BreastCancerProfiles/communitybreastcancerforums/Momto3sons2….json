Though it did lessen with meno I feel like I've had soreness and \"flare-ups\" since meno but not positive. Historically my fibrocystic symptoms always worsened with caffeine and chocolate, which I have been pounding lately r/t stress. My question is, can post meno women have fibro cysts. Dr Google doesn't have much definitive info. I'm scheduled for a diagnostic mammo and sono on March 8 and like many the anticipatory anxiety stinks! Thanks for ur support â˜º Log in to post a reply",
