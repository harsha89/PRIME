I sought out 2 different opinions and feel great about the surgeon I chose (for a variety of reasons). However, she wants to do it under general and the other doctor I saw was fine doing it more local (MAC). I just wondered what the norm was for an excisional biopsy. I've had general before and typically am really sick after. (even with a patch). I also am having this done right in the middle of a very busy work week where I have to be back up and moving within about 36 hours. Just wanted to get other opinions. Log in to post a reply",
