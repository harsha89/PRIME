Is it possible for her to have developed three cancerous lumps in three months time?  She's absolutely terrified and went home without having the MRI done.  She promises to come back into town tomorrow and have it done.  We also have fibrocystitis (or whatever that's called) in my family and both my mother and younger sister have had lumps removed from their breasts. I don't know how to reassure her because I've been where she is, but I just can't imagine that she has breast cancer so soon after a perfectly fine mammogram.  Is that wishful thinking on my part?
