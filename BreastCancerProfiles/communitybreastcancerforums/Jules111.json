Each time I tell my doctors, they tell me it is not caused by radiation. The worst has been two weeks after radiation treatments ended. Good luck . You are not crazy. I also want to add that I am a person who takes NO other medications or even aspirin. My body is not used to \"treatments\" and it feels the effects of radiation very strongly.",

Are they afraid o being sued? They had the nerve to tell me that radiation does not cause dizziness at all. One doctor asked me five times what other meds I am taking. Each time I said, \"None.\" I am so tired and dizzy I can hardly type this and it is two weeks after the radiation stopped. One nurse told me there is a dip in post-radiation treatment that occurs about now. Just can't believe the doctors insist radiation ONLY causes fatigue.",
