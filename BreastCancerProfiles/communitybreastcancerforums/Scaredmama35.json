Which my dr believes I will be. However today I met with a genetic counselor and did my blood sample to find out if I have the BRCA 1/2 gene mutation. ( I am 35 with only a history of one aunt with breast cancer) we decided to go ahead and look at all the gene mutations... So I guess I ended up doing a \" panel\" of gene mutation studies. I apologize bc I don't know the actual name of the test, bc I was just diagnosed on Monday and I tend to just go through periods of blanking out when these dr's are talking to me! Thank God my husband comes with me.  Anyway I guess I have some questions that I am wondering if anyone has experience with. Say this comes back positive for the BRCA gene mutation, I don't know if I am ready to get a double mastectomy right this second in my life. I have three young kids, I makes living by babysitting teachers kids... So I start work again end if August. My husband is also a teacher. Crazy how I am handed this horrible diagnosis and all I truly worry about is money. If I don't work, I don't get paid. So, although my goal is that this comes back negative and I can just have the lumpectomy, I have to prepare myself that it might not and then I have to think about a mastectomy that means a longer recovery time.  So here I sit and 1000 things are running through my mind. In my mind I am thinking if this comes back positive that I still do the lumpectomy and radiation if needed and then keep getting checked regularly and having a mastectomy maybe at the end of next  school year. Do people do this? Am I getting myself all worked up for something I don't even know yet? Ugh... So many things are thrown at you at the very beginning that I feel so overwhelmed! Thank you in advance!  Log in to post a reply",
