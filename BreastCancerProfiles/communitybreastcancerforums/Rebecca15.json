I researched all about this and there is a stage in puberty called the budding stage where one would have a lump under one or both nipples. This happens before you would start to develop. A little bit later I got one on the other side too. So now i had a lump under each nipple. A bit after that my breasts started to fill out a bit (they actually look like breasts and not just lumps). So now that I'm 18, almost 19, I still have those lumps in each breast. I am worried that it isn't normal, and that these lumps should have gone away. I've done some research and I'm nervous that it actually is something serious but I'm too scared to talk to the doctor or anyone else. I think the lumps have grown a bit since i first got them (I'm not sure because it was a long time ago) but they do feel kind of big, but maybe that's because I have small breasts. Anyways, if anyone could give me some information or know what it is or have had this please let me know! Thanks. Log in to post a reply",
