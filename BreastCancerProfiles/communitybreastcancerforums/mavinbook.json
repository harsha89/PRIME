Of course, he didn't have to remove that much! haha!!  I went back to work with a one drain and a big fat dressing so I wore my husband's nice shirts and my normal slacks/capris/skirts and got by ok.  Granted I don't work in corporate settings so I can be a bit eccentric in my dress.  I continued this style of dress for about 6 weeks until my SIL sent me a knitted foob (which is amazing as it is almost weightless and very soft). I've worked 40+ hours almost every week of chemo and it really hasn't been that bad.  I found that the Zofran made me a bit clumsy so I avoided handling artifacts (I work in a museum) on the days I took it, but otherwise I didn't make that many scheduling changes. I had infusions on Thursdays and Neulasta on Fridays with the M/C regimen and then I spent the weekend doing not much of anything (except for the weekend I moved houses--thank Gd for friends). With the Taxol I'm still doing infusions on Thursdays but I've worked the last couple of weekends and only been tired, not exhausted! Good luck!",
