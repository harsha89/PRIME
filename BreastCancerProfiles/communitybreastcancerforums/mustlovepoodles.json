I had been considering going flat because I am not at all interested in having several plastic surgeries to make artificial breasts, and all that it entails. My BS suggested that I see Dr. Ma in Atlanta; she's the PS who developed this type of recon. The advantage to it is that it's a one-stop-shop recon--it uses your own leftover skin to make small-to-medium-size humps, which helps keep your bra or camis down and looks pretty natural with clothes on. The pictures look pretty good, for most women. She says it works best for women with large breasts, who aren't interested in the standard recons (and I fit the bill!) Also, if after 6-7 months I feel that I need a bigger \"hump\", she can go in and put a small implant, basically a breast augmentation which would be a 1-hour outpatient procedure. Has anyone else had the goldilocks recon? And were you happy with the results? Oncotype 23. Positive for PALB2 & Chek2 gene mutations. My breasts are trying to kill me!
