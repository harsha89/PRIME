My mum is also on taxol and carboplatin, and also herceptin. The initial scans show the tumor in the liver has shrunk but the onco says we should still cut up the liver as the \"liver can always grow back again\". God bless and watch over you. I hope you zap all those lesions with the chemo. This really is a hateful disease!",

Needless to say, the shock was overwhelming. She is ER-, PR +, Her2+++, and is currently on 12 cycles of TCH. Her surgeon is proposing that after she finishes her chemo cycle, to go for a surgery in BOTH the breast and liver. Would like to find out if this is the usual protocol? Would it be too invasive to subject my mum to such a major operation? Thanks all for your help. Log in to post a reply",
