Rika certainly is an angel.  She is my 2nd mom, since my own mother lives far away.  She is giving relieve to so many people!  She is a RN and her son an Emergency Physician, so they translate difficult path reports for me, and can set my mind at ease when I start worrying about silly things.  One thing that I did want to ask you.  At night it seems as if my whole LE side, from my foot to my shoulder aches.  Do you think that this is all related?  My friend is a Chyropractor, so I was thinking of going to see her.  Maybe a pinched nerve somewhere is adding to all of this? I hope you have a gr8 day, and thanks for all your help and support. Liezel",

My friend did not want to touch my LE arm, just helped with some relief in my shoulders.  She also put a TENS machine on my trunk, and the relief has been amazing. Debbie, we do not have the compression camis here.  It does sound as if it can be amazing.  I'll google those brands and see if I can order online for myself and a few friends.

I have been so angry and sad the last few days.  My son Connor's teacher keeps complaining that he can't concentrate, that he talks too much, and that he can not make friends.  She said he had ADD and was tactile defensive.  He definitly does not!  But I did that him to a Play therapist to get behind the rest.  For the last 6 weeks he has seen her every week for assesment, and we had feedback on Thursday last week.  She agreed with me that he definitely does not have ADD and that he is not tactile defensive.  He is extremely bright and probably a bit bored at school at with friends his age.  She then asked me more about my dx, and when Connor's \"problems\" started.  The conclusion we both came to, was that my dx has had a bigger impact on him and our lives than we thought.  He was just 2 when I was dx, and until then my whole life revolved around him.  He got all our attention, and was generally treated like the baby he was. When I was dx I could not pick him up for weeks after surgery, and then with the all the tx afterwards it is suddenly 2 years later and we realise now that even though we explained to him that I was sick, he saw less of me, got less attention, and therefor became very insecure.  So now he talks to get our attention, throws tantrums and cry easily.  He also prefers adult company because he is trying to \"make up\" for \"losing\" me.  This just breaks my heart!  I have been so self absorbed the last 2 years, I did not realise what I have been doing to him.  But, now that we know, we can work on it, and I have been trying very hard to make it up to him.  I am also moving him to another school with smaller classes. Hopefully they'll know how to stimulate a highly intelligent child.  It is sad because you'll expect more from a Montessori school. I just hate this disease and what it has done to me and my family.  And it does not end!  I want to get off this bus! I hope you all keep well.  Sorry for my rant.  Have a good week! Liezel",

Sandra, I was in London last week.  It went so quick, I was hoping to touch base but before I knew it I was back on a plane - Just missed all your snow!!  I have to admit, I was glad to see my boys again though.  I have CT 1 x year and chest xrays and blood every 6 months.  I am supposed to see her every 4 months, but I just can't. Small steps with Connor as well Leanne.  I try to not see the diagnosis, just him and all his gifts and talents.  The problem is that society does not always see kids that way, and he battles to relate to other kids.  I am well.  Too busy to think about the C - but the fatigue still there.  Took ages to recover after my trip to London, still try to fit in a nap as often as possible.  It might also be because I have not had any time for excercise though!  Hope you are all well.  Look after yourself!

Yes, you are all Aunties!!!  My darling baby was born 31 August actually.  Weighing a healthy 3.76 kg!  We have been on a roller coaster ride since then.  Not all of it because of normal newborn stuff.  When Matt was born we were told that there was a problem with his left testis.  They did a sonar when he was 2 hours old and found a lot of cysts.  They addopted a wait and see attitude to see if it improved, when it did not after 2 days we were told that they think it might be cancerous.  They did an operation to \"look and see\" when he was 3 days old.  Afterwards they told us they had to remove the testis completely.  We had to wait 4 days for the pathology.  We got the news on 07 September - 5 yrs after my mastectomy.  It was cancerous, but was presenting bizarely and they were not sure exactly what type it was.  We were devastated and of course I was convinced that I gave it to him someway. A week later we did new tumor markers and then we got the verdict, after it was referred to some academics.  It was a yolk sac tumor.  The removal was the only tx required and they used the word cured.  But, we have to do tumor markers every month to make sure it stays this way.  So, for now my boy is healthy.  Battling with colic and reflux and feeling extra guilty because I can't breastfeed, but he is still my little miracle and I am just so thankful for him every day.  Hope you are all well.  Speak again soon - hear him crying!

Big weekend for South Africa and England this weekend!  We are playing in the finals of the Rugby World Cup!  No matter what happens - I still love you guys.... I have been keeping my recon and mast scars covered with plaster since AUG for the scarring.  This weekend when I changed it, I noticed four nodules along the scar on the ca side.  I immediately panicked and phoned my ps.  He seems to think it might be a reaction to the plasters, so I am to keep it open and put some Bactroban ointment on.  If it has not cleared by next Monday, I must go in to see him.  I can not see a difference yet, so you can imagine what is going on in my mind.  I have started a few projects just to keep my mind off it, and now my 10wk old puppy is also sick.  Not a good week..... I hope you all have a lovely week.  The weather has turned, and it is lovely and sunny.  The fruit trees in my garden are carrying Figs, Peaches, Avocado and lemons, but \"my\" tree has absolutely no fruit.  Very sad.....

Leanne, so good to hear from you again!  At last finished - I can imagine that rather than stroking this beast, you want to kick his behind!  Good luck with your decision on the ooph or hyst.  I would not be able to make that decision.....  Connor still having the same problems, but we are also slowly learning to live with it.  I spoke to a counsellor the other day, and she said that kids their age make up their own reality if we do not explain everything to them.  When they saw us sick, stressed and worrying, and maybe could not understand our explanations, they made up their own story, and this is scaring them.  They are protecting themselves in a way from potential hurt.  All we can do is talk to them, spend alone time and refer to our sickness and how much we missed them in that time.  It is working slowly, but I find I do not have as much patience as before, so 1 day at a time. Susan, I can really relate to your feelings at this time around your brother.  The 18th was my sister's bday, and it is 10 yrs now that she has been dead.  Time has not healed the wounds, but I have learned to live with it.  It is just so difficult at this time of year.....  My cousin's son's wife has left him all alone with 1yr old twin girls.  He can not cope and has left them with my cousin and his wife.  They are battling financially, and now the girls might be taken away.  My mom has asked if I would be willing to take them in.  I would really love to have more kids, but do not know how DH would react.  They are on the furthest side of the country from me, and it won't be that easy for them to keep seeing their parents.  My first reaction is to take them, but there is so many logistical and financial things to consider.  Think of me while I battle with this... Maxine, good luck for Monday, and Tina for the 4th.  My follow up also in April, after I was hoping to ignore it, they phoned to remind me.  Going to ignore it for a few weeks more I think..... Keep well all.....",

We spend a glorious 2 days in a game park - no lion or rhino sightings, but had an elephant 1 meter away from us!  It was huge and smelly, and I was so scared!  Kept snapping away, and then saw afterwards our camera is broken!  So no pics of this wonderfull memory.  Then went onto the Wild Coast, where we spend a week at a resort.  It was very rustic, but they fed us well, and we spent a lot of time fishing.  Still recovering from the long trip back - about 1500 kms one way, and losing the extra weight will take a while!  Connor's 5th birthday tomorrow!  He is so excited.  We are going to buy his gift today, and he has been working for the last 2 months to save enough money to buy a Ben10 watch, so he is very excited!   I hope you all keep well.  Liezel",

Wow, from being so worried and concerned about baby Matt we have gone to being absolutely elated!  His TM down again.  The new pediatric onc we are scheduled to see next week contacted us from Boston where she discussed his case with some experts and they all agree that the route we have been following (set by his urologist who did not want us to see an onc) has been unnecessary and a waste of time.  According to them the TM we thought was abnormal is NORMAL for babies.  They also agree with a dx we got from Birmingham that the original tumor was a Juvenile Granulosa Cell Tumor and that it is always benign! So we have cancelled his scans since it is a complete waste.  You can all imagine my relief!  Yesterday morning I woke up with a very heart, thinking that it was going to be the worst day of my life.  I went to bed elated and slightly tipsy from celebrating!  The onc words - go back to your normal life, there is nothing to worry about - made us do just that.

I have had a lot of time to think about the feedback from Connor's play therapist.  Yes, this disease has affected his life in a huge way, but I'll work very hard now to make him forget.  Every now and then I think he has, and he comes up with another memory.  He is continuing to see the Play therapist, and I have had the opportunity to watch him interact with his friends at school.  I do think he is an old soul, and finds running around in circles a waste of time.  While his friends does that, he tries to get them to do something more constructive, when they don't, he does it by himself.  His manners are amazing, so I must be doing something right.  He is an amazing little man.  And all he wants for Xmas is a sister..... I hope you all have a good week.  My shopping nearly done!  Our church has a Christmas Market, so I got most of my stuff there!! Love, Liezel",

I had such weird experience this morning.  I was speaking to a mother at my son's school who does not know about my bc.  Her father just had a biopsy to test for prostrate cancer, which was B9.  She said that she was relieved, because \"once you get cancer, that is it, it or the associated problems will kill you.\"  I was dumb struck and did not say anything, but it has been bugging me.  Not nice to hear other people sort of pronouncing a death sentence on you.... On a nicer note - I saw Celine Dion in concert this weekend!!  She was amazing!!  I was in tears half the time.  Apart from the fact that I love her music, I just think she is a wonderfully rounded person and a good role model.  I also admire her for how she put her career on hold after her husband's dx and her son's birth.  She seems so normal in a world of people like Britney Spears!

They are not speculating as to whether it is the chemo or my age, but I prefer to blame the chemo - I don't feel old!  So I had a D&C and cycle should be back to normal in about 2 weeks.  We will continue trying, but won't get too excited next time until we have a positive scan.  The paind it caused everybody was just not worth it..... I hope you are all well.  Summer seems to have reached us at last, although the last week was cold and miserable - suited my mood.  Hopefully we can christen our new pool this coming weekend.

This book has really made such an impact on me.  It feels as if I see myself and others for the first time.  I can really recomend it to everybody.  To all of my september sisters - Namaste (my favourite interpretation:   The Divinity within me perceives and adores the Divinity within you.)

Calico, hope your daughter's ekg ok.  She really is too young for this...  Enjoy your holiday!! The nodules are not medistinal nodes.  It is little nodules or bumps in the pleura.  When looking at the CT scan of the lungs from the feet (if that makes any sense), it looks like peas at the bottom, which is the back of the lungs I guess.  The radiologists feels it might be scar tissue from rads or the bronchoscopy I had in 06.  I have spoken to a few docs, and they agree with my onc to wait for 6 months.  They feel the trauma of a biopsy (at least 24hrs in ICU) or the cost of a PET scan not worth it.  My insurance does not pay for any tests or scans if I am not in tx, so this really is unfortunately a huge factor in my decision to follow advice and wait another 6 months. In the meantime, I am going to try some reiki.  I have to do something.... Sandra, hope the wedding went well.  Susan, still thinking of you and your whole family! Liezel",

It has, in a way, also made my fear of a recurrence so much bigger.  I definitely can not afford it now!  I have to be there for him, not just now, but for the rest of his life.  I am supposed to have check-ups every 4 months still, but we have to do scans every 6 months to keep an eye on my lung nodules, so I have decided to strecth it.  1.5 months to go to the next scan, and already I am starting to get nervous. I have also been offered another position.  Working from home, but with a lot of international travelling!  So hopefully I'll be able to meet some of you soon... Calico, glad to hear your daughter doing well.  What a pity about mom.  Will keep her and you in my thoughts for your PET on Wednesday.  Let us know when you have results.
