I finished chemo Dec 6th and will be having bilateral mx on Jan 3rd. I had one positive node on the cancer side, but PET scan, CT scan, bone scan and MRI showed nothing anywhere else. For those of you having (or who have had) bilateral mx, did you do sentinel node biopsy on the prophylactic side? My BS wants to do it, but I'm very hesitant. Of course I want to do everything in my power to catch every bit of cancer, but I've already been through eight rounds of chemo and like I said, nothing showed up anywhere else. My best friend is dealing with lympedema in her arm and leg (from bmx and oopherectomy) so I'd rather not mess with lymph nodes on my good side since all of the ones on my cancer side will be gone! Thoughts? Opinions? I don't want to take over your thread with this, so feel free to PM me if you want. Thanks and good luck with surgery this month!!!",

I lurked over here for a while before my surgery last week and I appreciate what I learned from all of you.   Anyway, I don't remember names, but I wanted to respond about the port pain.  My surgeon told me that women who don't have a lot of \"padding\" in the chest area (not necessarily breasts, but just overall flesh) have more discomfort.  She actually told me if I wasn't so skinny it wouldn't hurt so much.  I am far from skinny...LOL   But I guess I am thin in the collarbone area.  My port pain went away, but it never really felt comfortable.  I call it my alien and I can't wait to get it out! Also, about adriamycin.  Doctors will not run Adriamycin and Herceptin at the same time since they both carry heart toxicity risks.  Adriamycin is usually paired with Cytoxan and Taxol.....AC - T or T- AC.  The Herceptin for her2 + ladies would be added to the taxol portion of the chemo schedule (and then continued after for a year).  Adriamycin has been around for a long time for breast cancer treatment and it's very harsh but many doctors like to use it because it's been proven to work well.  I did AC-T (finished in Dec) and even though I feared \"The red devil\", it was tolerable. Just wanted to chime in since I could relate to some of what you're talking about.  Oh, and I totally understand the TEs in the pits feeling.  I had my BMX last Friday and filled to 100cc during surgery.  I feel like this \"iron bra\" wraps around me!   Happy healing ladies, and for those of you facing chemo, YOU CAN DO THIS!!",

Cutiecool - the crying is awful, isn't it?  I finally resorted to telling everyone to text me instead of calling or talking to me, because anytime I talk to someone about it I cry.  bcisnofun - I had my hubby call the doctor Friday to get a prescription for anxiety.  Hasn't helped yet, but it takes a while... domesticwomen - I don't know why I was never offered an ultrasound before.  I know my mammogram report always stated dense breasts and said I could talk to my health care provider about additional imaging, but since I never found a problem, my dr never found anything, and the mammogram didn't show anything suspicious, I guess I was lulled into a false sense of security.  Hindsight is 20/20, and I wish I had asked two years ago.  Wouldn't have stopped me from having cancer, but I would maybe have caught it two years ago instead of now.  I was only 38 with no risk factors, so it didn't really occur to me to push the issue. Denise - I'm ready to just KNOW what all I'm dealing with and get on with it.  I'm hopeful that I'll feel better after Tuesday when I meet with the oncologist.  Right now all I know is I have 2 lumps that are cancer.  <sigh> How come nobody tells you that a cancer diagnosis immediately causes insomnia????  I know my emotions are all over the place, but you'd think I would crash eventually due to pure exhaustion.  I don't fall asleep until after midnight each night, yesterday I was wide awake at 5am, today 6am.  I guess my mind just never turns off, even with the help of medication. Anyway, thanks for the kind words and the inspiration.   Michelle",
