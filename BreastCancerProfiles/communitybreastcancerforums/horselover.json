I was up and walking around on Sat. ready to go home.  Sunday, I said I'm going home, so I can get some sleep!! So they let me go.. Some say they get kicked out too quickly, and I was ready to go ASAP.   My only pill I take is ibuprofen, if needed, which isn't often.  People too think I am amazing, but I don't know what normal is.   My drain tubes had to stay in 3 weeks, and the one was still draining around 70cc, due to the auxillary node dissections (or something other)  I don't know all the terms.   The PS said the drain had to come out even though it was draining 70cc, she said they are in too long.  The one actually was hard to pull out, I guess it started to grow in some, because that was just a little painful when she pulled it like tug o war..LOL , and she said thats why they had to come out. She also did a fill the same day she took out the drains of 90 cc, didn't hurt, no pain afterwards. The most painful part for me after oper. is the expander the first couple of days moving when my muscle moved, the rib under it, but nothing is too much to deal with. If I didn't have the expander I don't think it would be a big deal at all.  When all is done I will have a rebuild on the good breast to match my left fake implant.  I had my operation 3 weeks 4 days ago and I'm going horseback riding tomorrow, first time post op! I want to get as much in before chemo starts and hell begins for it looks like almost a year for me of treatments! Like I read on someone elses post,  I lost one of my best parts my boob, and now I will loose my long naturally blonde hip length hair too.  I just hope it hasn't spread anywhere else, and that the radiation doesn't ruin my recon.  After all this I still don't think it has sunk in yet...  I'm a stage III at 40?????????? :(",

I know its gonna be a long hard 6 to 8 mnths. rseaw22 }  Good Luck with your operation, you should do fine.  I don't know if mine wasn't all that bad because I had only one side done.  I'm really glad I only did one side, because I wasn't limited that much on  what I could.   Because it was my left side done, and I'm right handed.  I was cooking dinner, dusting, and trying to make the bed within one week.   By three weeks, I can vacuum, and do almost everything, except lift my arm up over my head...or saddle my horse..LOL   I think we are gonna get nailed up here with snow this year.  I live in the Catskills and at night its already starting to feel like fall, my horses are starting to shed out there summer coats in prep. for there winter coats,  the squirrels are already readying there nests and my 3 large g. sheps have some funky stuff going on with there coat too.  I think its gonna be a loong cold winter!!!!  Of course I hear chemo makes you cold too. BethNY}  Thats funny your brother comes all the way up here to do a few horses.  He must be good at what he does.  My best friend and riding buddy used to live in Long Island.   She still talks like it too, even though she's been up here, in the Catskills, I think around 10 years.  We just started hangin out the past year and half, because we both love horses.  She's actually is the one who kept telling me to go get check out when I told her about my leaking breast.  She is a year younger than me and she's already had two biopsies, one with needle, and the other she had a calcification removed and her nodes scraped, not cancerous though.  She went with me to get my first mammo,  this May and thats when my journey began.  She is 4' 9\" and 89 lbs. and offers to saddle my horse up and everything, its comical...LOL  I did go for my first ride today,  my Quarterhorse \"Why Me DUDE\"  ( what a fitting name ) was a good boy but I can't believe how weak my legs are still.  I hope you are right and I can continue to ride, I have four horses here, and they need to be ridden!!!  It was nice talking to you, knowing you were way young and did okay.  I know that the cancer tends to be more aggressive the younger you are, thats why they said they have to be very aggressive in my treatments,  oh joy!!  My friend keeps telling me it will be a year of hell, but then I'll have another 40.  I hope she's right!!",
