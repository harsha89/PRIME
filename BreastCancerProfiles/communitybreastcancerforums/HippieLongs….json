Eventually after alot of searching I found breast free and this msg board. I am suprised there is not more support or encouragement available for women who decide to go unreconstructed and without forms. There were many factors involved in my decision not to reconstruct, Most important to me was reserving my body's strength to fight cancer not spend that strength on recovering from more surgery. I have never tried forms, I just felt they were not for me. That they would add insult to injury by covering my struggle to make it easier for OTHERS to deal with... and well, who cares about THEM?! I am at peace with my flat self even if it is a challenge to some of the less open minded people around me. I am proud of my scars. They show my strength and courage.. and that i KICK ASS! Now if i could only figure out a better way to dress the new me. ",
