The scan came back with a few minor abnormalities, but the nose bleeds and sinus pain had stopped so I was told I didn't need to do anything about the minor abnormalities. Today was talking with my co-worker and my nose just started bleeding. I think I freaked her out. It bleed on and off all morning.",

It was a core biopsy and I was told by a nurse in advance that the numbing medication may burn a little but after that I wouldn't feel anything other than pressure. As the biopsy started I did my best to relax and deal with the burning pain. I actually didn't feel much of a burn. The pressure was quite uncomfortable and just as I thought the procedure was finished the surgeon informed me that he was ready to start. At this point it really hurt and I told him it was painful. The nurses said it's almost done so I did my best to relax and think of something else. I'm not really a wimp - I went through 70 hours of labor without any meds and I had root canal without Novacaine (I was pregnant). This didn't hurt as much as the root canal, but it was certainly up there. Felt like an ice pick being pushed into me. Afterwards, the doctor said he was sorry, but it was unusual to feel pain. He actually seemed surprised by my telling him it hurt. Tomorrow I get my results. If it isn't cancer he still wants to remove the lump. There is no way I'm letting that happen without a general anaesthetic.",

I really believe the sicker you are the nicer the waiting rooms. The building where my doctor is located has a typical waiting room although they do have coffee, tea, juice and pretzels. When you get to the pre-op waiting room things are much nicer. This waiting room has a huge window overlooking a very nice section of Manhattan, plush chairs, semi-private internet workstations and mocha lattes. This was very helpful as my 1pm appointment actually began at 4pm.    Today I was injected with radioactive stuff, had to walk around for 2 hours and then have my lymph nodes mapped. Several years ago I updated my supplemental disability coverage with a cancer rider. I foolishly thought the cancer policy would be a waste of money since I was never going to get cancer. I 'm very glad I bought it because it reimburses me for things like travel, wigs, etc. I was quite excited to find out they will reimburse part of the cost of a hotel room until I learned they reimburse $50/per night. Not too many places in NYC for $50 a night. I think I could get a place to sleep with a view of the park - or rather in the park for $50. Instead I've been making the 70 mile trek each way several times this week. Tomorrow is my Lumpectomy and SNB. I have to be there at 7am to be wired. Between the wiring and the radioactive injection you would think I could develop some sort of superhero power. No such luck.  Beth",

I stayed overnight at the hospital and I've been sleeping a lot since then. I'm slowly spacing my pain meds out further and further. DH took the week off from work to \"take care\" of me. He is changing dressings, cooking and getting our son off to school. Then he spends a lot of time playing video games since I'm asleep most of the day anyway. I'm supposed to stay out of work a few weeks, but this may change after I meet with the Oncologist. Thanks for all the advice. It sure came in handy. Beth ",

Prior to my surgery I have to see the BS on 9/3, get some additional scan also on 9/3, get my SN located on 9/4 and then go in for outpatient surgery on 9/5. If they have to remove any SN I will be admitted overnight. Does anyone else have to make a separate trip for the SN location? I thought this was done an hour or two before surgery instead of the day before. It's a 1 1/2 to 2 hour commute each way and I would rather just go in and stay. Also, what exactly do they do to you during SN location? Thanks, Beth",
