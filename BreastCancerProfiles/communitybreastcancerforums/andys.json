The water was no problem, the crew was happy to keep the liquids coming. In addition to the regular drink service, they carried trays of cups of water up and down the aisle almost constantly. As for the moisturizer, try asking your flight attendant. Many airlines have moisturizer in the first class lavatory, and they would probably find a way to get you access to that. They might even let you use some of their own, if they are allowed to carry it on yet. (As of Friday, they were subject to the same restrictions as the rest of us, with a further restriction of not being allowed to check bags. So my poor flight attendant was on a four-day, multi-city hop and had to buy new toothpaste, etc each night. Fortunately, she was able to stow her expensive stuff in a locker at the first airport, so she didn't have to throw hundreds of dollars of stuff away, and she said she was going with the \"natural look\" for now. She had heard that they were going to ease up on the crew restrictions ).",

I had forgotten to mention the massage.  I have been doing three full massages per day, plus trunk-only every trip to the ladies room.  I also do the collar bone clearing around once per hour.  (I don't know if that, alone, does any good, but I feel like it's something I can do in public).  So far so good, the actual scrape is still pretty sore and red, but the bruising on my hand has decreased.  My hand IS a little swollen, but that could just be because of the bruising.  Anyway, I'm home now, and I'll check in with my MD tomorrow to see if she thinks I need a visit to her and/or an order for a PT evaluation.  Instead of chocolate, I had a delicious Dutch doughnut, freshly fried, dipped in powdered sugar, and eaten on the street.  (Sort of like funnel-cake at the state fair).  Anyway, as always, I appreciate your knowledge and sympathy.  My best to the family.

She just says to take it slowly and be aware of any signs that whatever you are doing is stressing your system - heaviness, etc. So, in terms of weight training or Curves, she would say to start slowly. If you have a sleeve and glove, be sure to wear it. If they say start with 8 reps, you should start with 4 and gradually increase. Likewise, add weight slowly, but she doesn't believe there's a specific limit. She recommended measuring my arm before and after exercising - 2 places in the upper arm, at the elbow, middle of forearm, wrist, hand circumference. Keep track of the measurements - often a change is measurable before you can eyeball it. From personal experience, I would say, be aware of how you feel - if the arm feels heavy, or like your sleeves are touching the skin even when they aren't, or a slight achiness - all of these are things that I have felt. It's great that you want to exercise. If you know how to be careful, it could actually help prevent acute lymphedema. Have fun.",
