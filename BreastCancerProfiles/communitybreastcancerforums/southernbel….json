I had my surgical biopsy on the 14th (I started my period that morning!) & on Friday I found out I have IDC, Grade 2, currently stage I. I have to undergo a mastectomy & I\u2019m choosing bilateral. Also have a 2 week family vacation coming up. I leave July 14th for it. I\u2019m going to do everything I can to keep that vacation as planned. My last beach vacation with my own I boobs. Lol. Rest up & then get back & fight. I think the obsessing & the pity party are normal because I\u2019m doing it too. I hadn\u2019t my doctor prescribe me some anxiety medication to help with that.",

If it helps any, back then mine was hard & round. Felt like a B.B. deep in my tissue. It was deep, 1mm from my muscle.  Now here we are 8 years later & I have another lump that is bi-rad 4 & I\u2019m all like \u201cI\u2019m fine, I can move it!\u201d The things we tell ourselves sometimes. I have an excisional biopsy for this one next Thursday.",
