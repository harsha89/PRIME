I also felt breathless for 2 days but that seems to have subsided now. Being the hypochondriac I am, looking on the internet probably isn't my best bet! But I came on here with hope that one of you lovely ladies or gentlemen would be able to help me out! I'm going to be booking an appointment at the GP tomorrow morning with hope he has a good diagnosis for me. Thankyou for your help in advance, I'd love to hear from you :)",
