Now, I have vesicle filled red, extremely itchy rash that has spread over my entire breast. Saw the radiation doctor yesterday, and she said I am allergic to Polysporin, and gave me Benadryl pills each 25 mg to be taken 1- 2 tabs every 4-6 hours. The vesicles are leaking and some are scaly... Anyone experience Polysporin contact dermatitis? stage 1, left breast ca. bilateral lumpectomy, radiation 16 treatments, still to start endocrine therapy, PR+/ER-/HER2-",
