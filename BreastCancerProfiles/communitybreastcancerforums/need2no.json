I had some tumour markers taken and he said if anything is wrong he'll let me know, otherwise I am back again in 3 weeks for the next Herceptin. I googled Herceptin and came across the manufacturers website, which states that muscular pain IS a side effect, so I think all you ladies talk more sense than the mighty Onc!",

      "Content": "need2no wrote: Hi all I was dx June 08 with IBC, had 6 rounds of taxotere, started Herceptin in August alongside chemo, had a mastectomy in November and then 5 weeks of radiotherapy.   Taxotere shrunk tumour well and finished in Oct. Results of mastectomy were that they got everything out and margins clear, also full lymph node clearance, out of 13 taken none had cancer signs. Radiotherapy finished 2 weeks ago. Now why can't I relax and get on with life???   Because my body is full of pains and aches, some movements are difficult particularly bending as my knee wants to give way. Pains in shoulders and arms, arm movement is restricted but I did have a diagnosis of tendonitis long before I had cancer, so it could be this? Now the newest pain is at the top of my outer leg, around the thigh area and its like someone pushing  something into my leg, at night it gets worse when I am in bed so I take paracetamol and codeine to help, which it does.   The same leg and my knee is a problem, not painful but like it doesn't want to move when I've been sitting for a while.  The skin of my thigh also feels sore, like it has a mossie bite or something, but there is no evidence of anything there. I'm getting myself into a right state over bone mets.   My bone scan on diagnosis was clear. Does this sound like something anyone else has experienced?   I'm just so new to getting past the treatment stage I just don't know what to do. Thanks for help Log in to post a reply",
