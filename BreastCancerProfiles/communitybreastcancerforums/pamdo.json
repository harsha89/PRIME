      "Content": "pamdo wrote: Hello all...I hope this is the best place to post this.  I've been reading these boards since my diagnosis in October - but this is my first post - and its a long one, thanks for your patience! I'm looking for some help  - finding people who have similar diagnosis, and deciding if I should be having a mastectomy - or perhaps even a double. I was diagnosed in October 2009. My doctor found an enlarged lymph node under my right armpit during a heart scan.  I had clean mammos and us a few months earlier.  Redid allscans, including MRI - but could not find primary.  Biopsy showed metastatic adenocarcinoma, likely of breast origin. CTs showed extensive nodal involvement  - throughout my clavicle and chest, including on the left side clavicle.  Surgeon wanted to do mastectomy, but I was orignally reluctant given no primary could be found.  Went to tumour board and agreed to start with total axillary node dissection - found 9 of 20 nodes positive.  Triple negative, lots of extra focal invasion.  But NO PRIMARY found!  Was very frustrating.  Consequently, was staged at 3c.  Also BRCA negative. Chemo began Jan 2010.  Original plan was 3 FEC, 3 Taxotere.  Side effects caused a change in plans - had 2 FEC, 1 EC and so far have completed 9 of 12 weekly taxol.  I am told I will need extensive radiation 35 rounds to right breast, chest wall, axilla and clavicle neck area. What I need help with is deciding on mastectomy.   Surgeon says yes, and perhaps even double, oncologist says totally up to me  .  She says recurrence risk is high - but higher risk of distant mets vs. local recurrence. If I do proceed, I want reconstruction - preferrably DIEP.  PS says I can only do one diep and one implant due to previous abdominal surgeries.   I really struggle with the thought of additional surgeries....particularly with two different types of reconstruction.  But I also don't think I will have any peace with being followed by mammo and even MRI  -given they didn't find primary.  I haven't found anyone else with a similar diagnosis. Appreciate any thoughts...thanks so much!    occult breast primary -r. mx with immediate diep 08/11 Dx 10/28/2009, Stage IIIC, 9/29 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

After consulting with my docs this week I've made the decision...for now...to proceed with uni mast this August.  I will finish chemo in two weeks (yay!) after which they will redo all staging, including breast mris.  If we find any evidence of disease in the other breast- i will do bmx.  If not I will proceed with uni, then rads (35).  Then 6 months after rads I can proceed with reconstruction (diep planned).  During that reconstruction, docs say I can change my mind and do the left side and implant reconstruction.  I feel good about my decison for now..but I still have lots of time to change my mind.  Appreciate all your input and your sharing of all your experiences...will keep you posted on my journey. On another note, my 9 year old son made a website about breastcancer. www.4thebreastcancersurvivors....  please visit!",
