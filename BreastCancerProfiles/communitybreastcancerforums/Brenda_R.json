There's lots of us Stage 3 gals that are alive and kicking, and NED.  I don't feel any more at risk than a stage 1 dx.

She was unable to care for herself and had 2 surgeries and 9 hospitalizations in that year. She was nearly blind (macular degeneration) and could barely walk. She was a very needy person, and I did a 12 hour shift with her daily with very few days off, for months on end. The last month was in the hospital, and the last week was at my sister's where Mom went to pass away. She refused to be in a nursing home. The stress was tremendous.  One month after Mom died, my brother's son died. One month later (over Thanksgiving) I found a lump, and it went from there. So for me, stress played a big part.  I'm one of those that a clear mammo and 6 months later I had a 4 cm lump.  I can't say that stress caused it, but I think the stress, both mental and physical, lowered my immune system and maybe allowed the BC to take off.",

I don't think you can get SSD if you are still working.  Apply right away for SSD and tell them you qualify for compassionate allowances fast tracking due to your dx. You will still probably have to go through the 5 month waiting period before you get a check. Then it's 24 more months before you get Medicare.  So you will need to be able to get through the 5 or 6 months it takes to get a check and be able to provide your own insurance for 29 months.

From SSD website- www.ssa.gov/disability/profess...  13.10 Breast (except sarcoma-13.04) (See 13.00K4.) A. Locally advanced carcinoma (inflammatory carcinoma, tumor of any size with direct extension to the chest wall or skin, tumor of any size with metastases to the ipsilateral internal mammary nodes. B. Carcinoma with distant metastases. OR C. Recurrent carcinoma, except local recurrence that remits with antineoplastic therapy. ----------------------------------------------------- D. What evidence do we need? 1. We need medical evidence that specifies the type, extent, and site of the primary, recurrent, or metastatic lesion. When the primary site cannot be identified, we will use evidence documenting the site(s) of metastasis to evaluate the impairment under 13.27. 2. For operative procedures, including a biopsy or a needle aspiration, we generally need a copy of both the: a. Operative note. b. Pathology report. 3. When we cannot get these documents, we will accept the summary of hospitalization(s) or other medical reports. This evidence should include details of the findings at surgery and, whenever appropriate, the pathological findings. 4. In some situations we may also need evidence about recurrence, persistence, or progression of the malignancy, the response to therapy, and any significant residuals. (See 13.00G.) E. When do we need longitudinal evidence? 1. Tumors with distant metastases. We generally do not need longitudinal evidence for tumors that have metastasized beyond the regional lymph nodes because these tumors usually meet the requirements of a listing. Exceptions are for tumors with distant metastases that are expected to respond to antineoplastic therapy. For these exceptions, we usually need a longitudinal record of 3 months after therapy starts to determine whether the intended effect of therapy has been achieved and is likely to persist. 2. Other malignancies. When there are no distant metastases, many of the listings require that we consider your response to initial antineoplastic therapy; that is, the initial planned treatment regimen. This therapy may consist of a single modality or a combination of modalities (multimodal) given in close proximity as a unified whole, and is usually planned before any treatment(s) is initiated. Examples of multimodal therapy include: a. Surgery followed by chemotherapy or radiation. b. Chemotherapy followed by surgery. c. Chemotherapy and concurrent radiation. 3 . Types of treatment. Whenever the initial planned therapy is a single modality, enough time must pass to allow a determination about whether the therapy will achieve its intended effect. If the treatment fails, the failure will often happen within 6 months after treatment starts, and there will often be a change in the treatment regimen. Whenever the initial planned therapy is multimodal, a determination about the effectiveness of the therapy usually cannot be made until the effects of all the planned modalities can be determined. In some cases, we may need to defer adjudication until the effectiveness of therapy can be assessed. However, we do not need to defer adjudication to determine whether the therapy will achieve its intended effect if we can make a fully favorable determination or decision based on the length and effects of therapy, or the residuals of the malignancy or therapy (see 13.00G).  -------------------------------- The thread is here- community.breastcancer.org/for...  I  ",

Her2 + makes us high risk for recurrance and Herceptin knocks that risk down greatly. For most, Herceptin is do-able. Good luck in your decision.

Her2 is very aggressive and fast growing, but the Herceptin is a very powerful drug against her2 positive BC. I had a lumpectomy, then the Red Devil (Adriamycin) plus Cytoxin for 3 months, then radiation for 7 weeks, then a year of Herceptin.  I am celebrating 3 years out just this weekend, and am NED (no evidence of disease).  For me, the chemo was very hard to do and I was very sick, but you do get better, it just takes time. A lot depends on your Mom's age.  I wouldn't look too hard at the stats right now, because the ones out there are several years old and don't take into account Herceptin, which is our miracle drug. If , for some reason she can't finish Herceptin, there is still Tykerb and other new drugs coming out for her2 positives.  I don't worry too much about mortality rates. ",

Shame on you.  Even after I asked all 3 of you if I should be getting the bone scan,  you told me no I didn't need it, the pet/ct was enough. It took my first visit with my Rad Onc, to get a bone scan and find out I didn't have bone mets.  To my PCP, I wish you would have taken me seriously when I told you my hips, legs and back hurt badly. Again it took my Rad Onc to order the MRI that showed multi level disc disease, spinal stenosis, and a perineural cyst. Can you also tell a certain nurse that you are the doctor, and you should diagnose me and not her? and you should talk to me about what meds I need and not her?  On the flip side, to my PCP, thank you for being a caring doctor, at least as long as you thought I was stage 4. After you realized I was instead stage 3, it was like a light switch flipped and you no longer had time for me. To my Onc, thank you for writing off the cost of a drug that I couldn't afford. You saved my life.  To my surgeon, thank you for being aggressive in surgery and taking a large portion surrounding my lump. You got clean margins, and that meant a lot to me.  To my Rad Onc, thank you for ordering the scans I needed. Thank you for writing off what the insurance wouldn't pay, so I didn't have to go somewhere else. Thank you for knocking out the cancer in the IM node, that couldn't be removed. I am mad at some of you, but I am also greatful to all of you. I hope you understand.",

I don't always feel that I have much to offer, not going through tx right now, but once in awhile I feel I can add something, just let those of you that are going through it now, that things will get better (although I know it doesn't seem like it). Your life will get back to a new normal. I do empathize with those going through chemo and rads. It hasn't been so long ago that I was too and I remember how I felt.",

Mainly diarhea and runny nose for a day or 2 after treament. I had some hip pain, that I'm pretty sure was from the Herceptin. But it's a miracle drug and if I had the choice to do only 1 thing for BC (being Her2 positive), it would be Herceptin. Good luck to you and your Mom.",

He said it was just too hard for them.  (I learned this from a couple of older ladies that I had radiation with. We had the same onc.) They did surgery and rads only. I can't speak to the anti hormonals. If it were me, I'd go with surgery, herceptin (if her heart is ok), rads and maybe AI's. I wouldn't do the chemo. I had A/C and it was very hard on me at 50. I can't imagine doing it at 74. Maybe you should get a second opinon from another onc.",
