I just appreciate your thorough description, it makes me feel good to know that things will clarify themselves eventually.  I'll probably post my \"bloody nipple discharge story\" sometime soon, but for now there's a long version of it in my bio if you're curious.  Anyway, glad it turned out so well, and I hope you're feeling awesome. ",
