I'm getting my port put in tomorrow, and I'm sure I'll be scheduling chemo (T/C) later today at my onc appt. I'm nervous and afraid of chemo, of course because of the fear of the unknown and a feeling of being \"out of control\". I know everyone reacts differently, so I'll just have to wait and see. I work in a small medical office, and am worried about working full time, and also being around sick co-workers and patients with crappy ventilation in the building. Someone's already sick at my office and I haven't even started treatments yet. :/ Also, I'm wondering if I'll need someone with me for my treatments because it's an hour away from home? I know I'm worrying ahead of time, but would still like to know others' similar experiences? Thanks so much girls!",
