What a coincidence.....I am also the daughter of someone named Sandie (spelled differently) and she also has stage 4 breast cancer currently in her bones and liver. There also appears to be something on the lining of her lung but from what they tell me, it is not in her lung. Her original diagnosis was in 2000 at which point she had a mastectomy followed by chemotherapy and radiation. She was in remission for 4 and a half years when it metastisized to her bones. About 2 and a half years ago, it spread to her liver. I would love to talk with you more as I know how helpless you feel. I too have turned to the women on this site for advice on how to help my mom. Where do you live if don't mind saying? If you would rather not, I understand but maybe we can chat sometime? Courtney",

My mom was 71 and I felt that even that was too young. Olga was taken way too soon! I can see from her picture she was so beautiful! My dad kept thinking he missed something. He is a doctor but a gastroenterologist, not an oncologist and certainly not my moms' doctor. I know with all my heart that he did everything he could have possibly done as her husband and from reading your posts I am pretty certain that you did too! My heart is broken having lost my mom. She was my best friend. But my heart breaks even more by the pain I see my father in. He lost the love of his life and I am so sorry that you lost yours. This disease is cruel and is robbing so many of their life and the rest of us of their love on earth. It is not fair that your children have to grow up without a mother. We are left with a huge void. I can't offer you any magical words to ease your pain but in some ways, I can offer empathy. I hope you can find comfort from friends and family during this very painful time. Warm regards, Courtney ",

My mom was diagnosed in 2000, in remission for 4 and a half years, and then it came back in her bones. It is also now in her liver. I share with you hope. The initial diagnosis was terrifying. It turns your whole world upside down and there is a huge shift in your entire sense of normal. NOTHING feels normal anymore. Over time of course there is a new normal that we learn to live with. Remission was great! But I must admit that I never thought it was going to come back and when it did, we were terrified all over again. That was 5 years ago. Her doctors continue to tell us that there are still many treatment options for her and that while her cancer has progressed over the years, it is doing so very slowly. I will continue to hang my hat on that hope. But I don't know what it is like to be her. So many treatment options but certainly no walk in the park. So what can we do as daughters. Be there for our moms. Go to her doctor's appointments when you can so you can not only be there to support her but ask questions and learn. It took me 10 years but I am finally walking the Avon Breast Cancer Walk in Boston this weekend. My sister and I are walking together as a team called Sandie's Soldiers because our mom is Sandie and we are her Soldiers fighting this fight with her. Together we raised over $11,000.00. For the first time in 10 years, I feel like I can do something. I have felt helpless and frustrated for so long. This is not a club I would like anyone to have to be a part of but I am here to tell you that you are not alone and neither is your mom. Research is fast and furious and I too am terrified but will never give up hope that my mom will see the cure and so will yours and every other woman dealing with this terrible disease. Just be your mom's soldier!",
