I have the best fiance in the world. I found the lump, had the lumpectomy and sentinel node removed all within 2 weeks in Aug.  Fortunately it appears it didn't spread to the lymph, but very aggressive (8), stage 2.  I've had my first chemo 10/4, so far so good - one down, 7 to go.  My goal is to do the chemo on Thurs (everyother), then work the following week and a half then take the Thur/Fri off again - I hope it works out. I appreciated reading everyones comments and suggestions and just feelings - it's nice to know you're not alone in this. Unfortunately, it's almost scary how many there are. My mom passed away 20 years ago of breast cancer - she was very advanced when she finally went to the doctor - much different today than it was 20 years ago. Have you heard of eating popsicles during chemo?  I heard it's supposed to keep the mouth sores away - anyone tried it? God Bless and keep strong - we'll be through and moving into the next chapter of our life book before we know it !",
