My scalp hurts when my hair is the least bit dirty....does this mean I am headed toward hair loss? I haven't lost my hair since the beginning of my mets journey 10.5 years ago...so I can't remember exactly how it went. I have read in various places that many women have lost their hair after their second dose? How long after your second dose? I can't do the hair falling out in patches thing... I am an all or nothing kind of gal. When I was on Taxotere in 2007, I shaved my head the day my hair started falling out. I was never completely bald, but my gray hair grew while my brown hair fell out, so I would just shave it every week until it started to grow back. Do you think I will be in that same boat with Halaven? Thanks in advance for your advice!",
