I  have also found a larger lump that is painless lower down in my armpit. Im doing my GCSEs at the moment so i really dont have the time to be worrying about possible cancer, however i have been to the doctors and he has told me to get a blood test. I also have some sore spots in my breast but no lumps. Any Ideas????? Log in to post a reply",
