I'm glad you got that over with so you can move forward too. I elected not to do the testing b/c of insurance (I wish I could have). I may do it in the future but that may be putting the cart before the horse at this point~ IDK.  There's quite a few of us getting rads or about to this month. I wish us all luck.",

I had my second surgery 2 weeks ago this coming Thursday so I'm pretty happy that they're moving me forward with rads. I want this behind me as fast as possible :-)",

I haven't done it yet but plan on it here (hopefully) this weekend. I'm off to my first appointments here in a bit. I don't like being exposed and handled by people but what can you do?",
