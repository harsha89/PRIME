But instead, I was cranky and cried.   =(   Near my node incision, I thought I bruised myself as it is dark and so sore. The RO said this was from the radiation.  My skin is starting to turn dark pink. This must be a critical time for any quick break down in skin because I was told to immediately see them if I started to blister before I saw the doctor next. Is anyone doing hormonal therapy along with their radiation?  I'm having terrible neuropathy from that and am wondering if perhaps I should hold off until radiation is completed.  I think what pushed me over the emotional edge was having my hands fall asleep while trying to hold the bar. I better stop.  I feel like I'm whining... Know that I say a prayer for all of us each night.",

This week has been the toughest, both physically and emotionally for me.  I actually told the nurse on Monday that I wasn't in the mood to see the Dr.  She told me that it was a State law that a doctor see a radiation patient once a week (who knows if she was fibbing or not).   Love my rad onc, love my nurses and the techs, but.... For the first time today, I felt a stabbing pain during the rad treatment. The tech said I shouldn't feel the beam, that maybe it was the position my arm was in.  ~shrugs~ I know....I should be thankful that this was caught in time, that I don't need chemo, and that I'm about two-thirds through treatment.  I'm just tired of it all, as I know we all are.  I hope your Thanksgivings are good ones. xo",

I had my second of 7 today.   5 more boosts and I'm done with radiation!  Did you feel any differently after the boosts?  I don't know if its psychosomatic -- but I haven't felt so good these past two days.  Good luck mom2acat. Sparrow -- I haven't felt goofy, but I have definitely been easily distracted. I'm so tired.  All I want to do is hibernate.  Unfortunately, responsibilities don't allow for that.  I'll be done before I get a chance to just stay in bed and rest! lol",
