She has one other abdominal lymph patient who also finds compression exacerbates it. That said, my vascular physician recommended walking in chest-high cold water. The water acts as compression and I find this effective. Similar to MLD the effect is not sustained but it does bring it down and helps me to 'manage' it. I avoid saunas and Jacuzzi. I have had the green dye mapping and found that also helpful, MLD has changed from pushing lymph around to gently stroking the areas where I have channels. Hivamat also works, again I focus on where I have identified channels. What I found most helpful with the green dye (indocyanine green dye lymphangiography) was it explained why I react in certain ways, for example, my channels in the left groin drain to the right, which explained when MLD pushes fluid below my belly button down to the groin I flair, even though it should work. I have an option for a node transfer but I am waiting until the key centre in my country has more experience. I have also found an amazing physio who specialises in Myofascia release and I now rarely need MLD unless I flair. I have found this to be enormously effective and my understanding is that my obliques grip and this interrupts the lymph flow. I find sitting upright makes me flair and it is because my muscles grip, lying down helps. Nothing makes me 'flat' I just have varying degrees of swollen and my expectations have changed from 'flat' to management. I also do pilates for the deep breathing. There is an increasingly belief that LE has an inflammatory component and positive feedback from people following a keto diet on the effects on their LE. I haven't gone down this route as my inflammatory markers are checked annually by my immunologist and vascular physician and I don't have any evidence of inflammation. If it wasn't for my love of carbs I might give this a go, and I might still at some point. I also second the earlier point that you are worked-up for other conditions, for example, ovarian cancer can manifest in abdominal swelling so my clinicians regularly check that my abdominal LE is not masking symptoms of this. Hope some of these strategies help others",

My symptoms was swelling that just didn't resolve but would ease overnight and then worsen during the day. When I was very swollen, my stomach would be very hard and I would be in a lot of pain as my organs were being 'squished'. My Drs were saying just give it time, but I felt it was unusual. I kept pushing for answers, had multiple scans to discount other causes. I self-diagnosed lymphedema as the scans showed it wasn't ascites, gas or other fluid build-up, so in my mind the only other fluid could be 'fluid in the cells'. I found a physiotherapist who specialises in treating oncology patients with lymphedema and I responded to MLD. She recommended I see a vascular physician. In the meantime I had acupuncture and had blisters on my abdomen filled with yellow fluid around the area where I have no sensation (post surgery). The vascular physician, who is an older very experienced Dr, took my history, saw the scars and photos of the blisters and said he thought it was lymphedema. He sent me for a lymphoscintigraphy scan. I was initially diagnosed with primary but over time it is clearly secondary. I was diagnosed within 5 months of symptoms. I have been very proactive in getting a diagnosis and also in my treatment. Abdominal is considered rare but I think there are more than people realise and it gets masked and considered to be weight rather than fluid. Hoping you find some answers and I appreciate the warm welcome despite my lymphedema not resulting from breast (or other) cancer.",
