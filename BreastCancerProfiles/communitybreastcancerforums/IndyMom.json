      "Content": "IndyMom wrote: My BRCA1 and 2 came back negative. Which is good news. But I would still like to get my ovaries removed to be on the safer side. For my peace of mind. I am having a hard time convincing my surgeon about this. I have my BMX scheduled for 10/20. And she recommended not to do it at the same time. Instead to do it at the time of my reconstruction surgery. But my plastic surgeon said they cannot schedule Ooph at the same time as reconstruction. I feel like they are trying to push me away from getting my ovaries removed. Couple of questions... 1. Have any other ladies here got their ovaries removed even when BRCA1 and 2 came back negative? 2. When is the best time to get my Ooph scheduled? thanks Indy Mom Dx 8/30/2016, ILC, Right, 4cm, Stage IIB, Grade 2, ER+/PR+, HER2- Surgery 10/20/2016 Lymph node removal: Sentinel; Mastectomy: Left, Right Log in to post a reply",
