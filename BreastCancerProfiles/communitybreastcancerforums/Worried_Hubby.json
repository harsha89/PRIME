      "Content": "Worried_Hubby wrote: Dear All,   My wife was diagnosed with breast cancer + bone mets to spine (2 spots) a year ago and just underwent a PET scan after a year of chemo (CEF) / lumpectomy / chemo (Taxol) / breast radiation / Tamoxifen / Oopherectomy. The Oopherectomy indicated presence of Breast cancer in the ovaries.   The latest PET shows a lot of new hot spots (multiple spine , femur, humerus) with high SUVs (above 7) and CA -125 has increased from 153 in september to 887 now. The doctors are confused because:   a. She is asymptomatic with no/very low pain. b. They felt initially that the disease was 'less aggressive' and chemosensitive to CEF. It regressed 50 - 60% after 3 CEF cycles. After which she had taxol weekly 12 cycles. c. It is ER/PR + and Her2 negative. so tamoxifen should have been effective over the last 2 months of hormonal therapy.    We are in a major bind because: 1. Our Onco suggests this is a new Ovarian cancer that was missed earlier. He says it is probable for young premenopausal women. He plans to treat with a new chemotherapy directed towards reducing the CA-125. Carbolatin has been mentioned. 2. The other Oncologist we consult in the US feels this could still be all realated to the breast cancer. According to him, while the CA-125 is high, it is nonspecific and can be due to various reasons. He would like to check if the breast cancer spread to the abdomen because the lining there is similar to that of ovaries where it was also detected. He wants to continue the hormonal treatment, maybe move to arimidex and if it is unsuccessful, then to use chemotherapy for Breast Cancer and not Ovarian Cancer.   These opinions are very divergent and feel that this could be a 'make-or-break' situation in our battle against this disease!   Any thoughts/opinions and pointers would be of immense help!!   Hugs and Kisses to All You Courageous Women.   Worried and Desperate But Hopeful Husband Dx 10/20/2008, IDC, Grade 2, 5/23 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
