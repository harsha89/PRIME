This happened for a couple of weeks then lessened and stopped. I didn't go to the doctor at the time, I know I should have but we are immigrants and we're applying for permanent residence in our new country and any serious diagnosis would have put a long delay on this. This has all gone through but since it appears to have been a one off I'm not sure if follow up is necessary any thoughts? Also I feel embarrassed tell a doctor that I didn't seek any advice!
