I had lt. mastectomy with tram flap reconstruction. Both areas were open. large area on breast and 4 smaller ones in the abdominal area on the right side. I to had to pack for about 2 mnths and I then told my Dr. I have had it. I ended up with a clean up surgery and what had happened is the breast had fat necrosis with bacteria & dead tissue. The abdominal area had stitches that did not dissolve. I am finally all closed up, the 2nd surgery did the trick. Talk with your Dr. and ask him or her to look into the options of what could be going on. I also had allot of oozing in both areas. I know how difficult it is to stay positive but try really hard to have faith. I had finally got to the point that I was going to find a new Dr. when everything came together. God bless you & good luck.",

I had Lt. breast mastectomy with tram flap reconstuction. I had some discoloration on flap and that ended up opening up. It seemed like everytime I went into the Dr.s office he was cleaning the breast. My surgery was 4-16-07. I too was packing and cleaning the breast morning & night. I also had oozing coming from the breast & abdominal area. The Dr. would clean the abdominal area too and I had 4 areas to clean & pack. 3 areas finally closed up but 1 area would not close and it was such a small opening. It just continued to ooze. I ended up with another surgery to clean both areas on 7-25, as it turned out the breast had fat necrosis, dead tissue. & bacteria. The abdominal area had stitches that did not dissolve. 2 weeks after the 2nd surgery I was finally healed up. Talk with your Dr. and ask him about what could be going on. I had gotten to the point that I told the Dr. I was so frustrated I was ready to remove the flap. He understood and we went forward with the 2nd surgery. God bless you and keep the faith. Von",
