My FNA is scheduled for Tuesday morning to assess what seems to be conditions that by rights shouldn't even be investigated further. The radiological report says that at 7 o'clock 5 cm from the nipple 6 mm below the skin surface, there is a 5 x 4 x 3 mm complex cyst containing diffuse internal echoes ... Also at the 7 o'clock 5 cm from the nipple, there is a dilated duct that contains low-level internal echoes. It goes on to recommend ultrasound-guided FNA of both areas to further assess. My research on the internet tells me that this type of thing is not usually investigated. Being a bit squeamish about needles and stuff, although I will keep the appointment, I really don't get why they are doing this. Kayb, you were great in allaying my fears when I first heard that I was having a needle biopsy, but I was wondering whether anyone can give me insight into why the FNA is even necessary. I am so not looking forward to the FNA, although I have to say I am really eager to get it all behind me. Log in to post a reply",

The mammogram was likewise very painful on the left, but easy-as on the right. Turned out that it was just the usual age-related and hormonal stuff causing the pain in the left breast. Even now it is hurting, but I have been assured that there is nothing of concern in the breast -- just fibrocystic and granular changes (something like that anyway). Like you, the pain in my left breast affects the areas around it too. Ironically, my right breast which has never been sore has now become cause for concern. I was called back to have further investigation on the right breast, and am looking at having a needle biopsy. Weird that the breast that hurts is fine and the breast that doesn't is of concern. I do agree with other posters' advice though to have further investigation, if anything, to put your mind at rest. All the best!",

Because the lump in the left breast was close to the outer surface, they did it without local anaesthetic. I didn't feel a thing. They then used local anaesthetic on the right breast followed by a needle biopsy. I felt a very slight sting from the local anaesthetic, but seriously a mosquito bite would be more painful. I only felt pressure when they did the biopsy. I so wish I hadn't been so nervous. It was truly nothing! Now waiting for the results, but they didn't seem overly concerned. Hope everyone else here gets good results (who is still waiting). I will keep checking. ",
