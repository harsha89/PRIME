I was so miserable my whole pregnancy and dreaded that feeling again. I am in a clinical trial for nausea medicine and hoping I don't get the placebo. They assured me I will still get standard-of-care meds in addition. astyanax66: Thanks for all the info. How lucky your husband bakes bread! Jealous! I also have terrible veins. It took 3 technicians 9 tries to get a vein before my PET scan. Not something I want to do all the time. Are steroids part of the chemo or are they something added? I wasn't aware that was a thing. Again, others have said it, but they really need to give everyone a thorough orientation. This is hard enough without having to figure everything out on our own along the way. Interesting about veggies tasting like dirt. I've been making soup and broth and stockpiling it in the freezer. Hopefully it'll taste good to me. I know I need to start exercising more. I had just gotten into a really good routine about 6 months prior to diagnosis, but immediately fell off that wagon and haven't gotten back on. I just got a fitbit and will try to get those steps in. Though I am aware that I will lose all my hair, emotionally I cannot wrap my head around it. I guess I will cross that bridge when I get there. I was going to buy a wig, but so many people on here say they bought one and wore it once that maybe I'll save the money. The problem is that I had a Sinead O'Conner obsession in high school and shaved my head to mimic her, and I looked terrible. I wish I didn't know that! Oh well, I guess I can laugh about that. It's going to be summer in Los Angeles which means temps in the 100's so I'm not sure what the best head covering solution is for the heat. Frog-on-the-lilypad: I like your potato joke. If we cannot laugh what do we have? Laughter has been a true gift during this process for me. Thank you for your thoughtful replies. This forum has been immeasurably helpful for me.",

I didn't receive any prior explantations of what to expect so this forum has been a godsend. I had my port placed last week, unfortunately right where by bra and bathing suit straps hit. I'm hoping that as the incision heals it won't be as unbearable to wear a bra. I wish I had read some forums about that ahead of time because it seems that many women have the doctor mark where their bra straps will hit and work around that. I had not yet heard of neulasta, and don't know if that is something everyone gets? I read a few people mention wearing ice pack socks to prevent the neuropathy. Do you wear these during the infusions or when you are home around the house? I read other suggestions to wear warm socks to chemo, so now am feeling unsure. Also seeing some of you used claritin prior to getting the neulasta. How long do you suggest taking it for? I wish I had been more informed about everything. Feel like without this forum I'd be going in blind. Keep reading about ice chips as well. Again, is this during the actual infusion? Or more to do at home in the following days? I have been so anxious about the chemo, moreso than I was with the mastectomy actually. I had horrible morning sickness for my entire pregnancy and my oncologist told me that can be related to increased nausea side effects. It is very encouraging to read that some people had fewer side effects than they had assumed. Hopefully that will be my case! Other suggestions I read on here that seem very helpful were to get plastic utensils since the metal might taste really bad. Also to buy a waterpik to cut down on risk of gums bleeding during flossing. Nobody told me to see my dentist ahead of time, and just read that today and it is too late to get in so I'm going to be extra vigilant with mouth health. I so appreciate all the tips everyone shares on here. Though I am surrounded by well-meaning and loving family and friends, it is so reassuring to have somewhere to go to feel solidarity. Good luck and prayers to all!",
