      "Content": "Dec 26, 2011 08:02AM - edited Dec 26, 2011 08:55AM by NCbeachgal Thank you Janetanned! I'm of course anxious for the results of the biopsy to determine if more surgery is in order or if the next appointment is with my hairdresser to get my pre-chemo cut. In the meantime, my husband and I have researching wigs, scarves, hats. As anyone ever bought a cashmere hat or a mink-like hat? These seem less exspensive than wigs and practical since they can be worn for many years in the future. I also found a beautiful leather and sheepskin hat by UGG. I love their boots on my naked feet. I wonder if their hat is as good for a bare head? Janetanned-my MO said the port could be placed and then used in the next 24 hours. It must be pretty common to get started right away. Surprising though. Jennt28-the upcoming events rule my thoughts as well. It's almost 11 am here and I haven't shed a tear so far today. I'll consider it progress. The worry is difficult to shake. My head hurts from it and I find restful sleep almost impossible. I have to keep thinking the worry will become reality and the worry will prove to be much worse than the reality. Then I can use my imagination in a more positive and productive way. Good luck and I'm so sorry!",

It has everything I need. I can tell she did some research and that touched my heart. I also found a beautiful scarf at World Market. I haven't had my pre-chemo cut yet and a part of me feels bad about heading to the infusion room with long hair. I'll have it cut this week though. Dread that too.",

I don't know if the Ativan or the acupuncture is responsible for less intense side effects, but I'm sticking with both! Good luck! Treatment 2 was better and way more manageable. Don't get me wrong, I still feel a bit \"off\" but it's such an improvement from,\" if I speak, move, eat, or smell food, I may puke!\" I hope your second treatment is better. Please mention the side effects to your care team. Most likely adjustments can be made so you can feel a little more human. WaveWhisper-I love Charleston and your photo is beautiful representation of your charming city. About the hair...I can't believe how long it takes post final chemo to get hair back! There's a thread about hair regrowth. It's called hair, hair, hair and more questions about hair (something like that). I check it out from time to time for an honest look at the future. I have also found some lovely head covers on etsy.com. I search chemo head scarves in the handmade section. Many of the offerings are handmade by people who have had chemo induced hair loss, so they know the deal and what works best. Most are very reasonably priced as well. Take care today!",

I have my port placement January 4 and my education/nurse visit on January 6. The only thing that might postpone the chemo would be more surgery. I had a follow-up mammogram on Dec 15 and a small calcification was found at the lumpectomy area and this prompted another stereotactically guided biopsy that was done yesterday. I hope to have those results on this upcoming Tuesday/Wednesday after Christmas. If that's fine, then I'll move forward with port placement/chemo. I'm not sure yet of the drug combinations that will be used but it's my understanding that I will have 8 treatments along with herceptin. I am very nervous about the hair loss and the feeling of fatigue that might come. I'm in sales and have a fairly rigorous daily travel schedule and I am the face of my company when with customers. I hope the hair loss isn't a distraction when I'm making my sales presentations. I also hope I can keep up the pace. I know we are all in the same mess with similar and sometimes completely different but valid fears/concerns. Best of luck to everyone.",

I also wanted to give a couple head covering recommendations. I bought a few things from a couple different shops on etsy.com. The first is a cotton head cover from Jemima Jackson in NYC. It has an elastic strip a the base of the skull and you simply slip it on and tie it at the back. It works great alone or with a fleece or knit cap underneath. I do feel it needs something under it though, otherwise too much of the back of my head would be exposed. the shipping was very quick. I like it. www.jemimajackman.com The other items are little knit caps by CJ Hats. The seamstress is a survivor of Stage IIIB inflammatory breast cancer. She knows what we need. These are simple, comfortable caps for around the house or under scarves. They are very reasonably priced ($5-$15), I like that. I especially like the one I bought for sleeping. It's fleece on half and then white cotton knit on the other half. www.cjhats.com. They can also be found on etsy.com",

      "Content": "Feb 22, 2012 08:37AM - edited Feb 22, 2012 08:41AM by NCbeachgal Nancy HB- people call me an inspiration and remark about how good I look and how strong I am. They remark about my positive attitude. Well, that's either my mask or I only allow contact on those good days. I also believe that when people see us \"high-functiong\"( HA!) BC patients, they are going through their own possible reactions should they be struck with disease. What I'm saying is that you can't feel bad about feeling bad or making associations with these new rituals that have been put upon us. I hate every minute of every appointment. Sure, I have a great cancer center with a very caring and professional staff of lab, nurses and providers and that helps my attitude some. There are so many things I hate-being sick, being constipated, having roids, being bald, spending money on OTC meds and head coverings ( no matter how lovely-I'd rather be having my hair highlighted and buying hair products). I know I can vent here. The outside world is more comfortable with the person who puts on the brave cancer face because the reality is too much for them to care about or simply process in the 10 minutes of uncomfortable contact they typically have with us. That's my ramble-I hope in some way, it helps. Angie",

Next time, I may take my Verizon wi-fi hotspot device for perhaps better download speed. I sound like a technology geek, but I'm not really. I too felt like the youngest (45) person in the room. However, there was a young woman in a chair across the way that looked young. She looked very settled in like she was there for a longer treatment. There were also a few gentlemen with full heads of hair. They were in and out in a matter of minutes. Wonder what they were getting? I too am surprised at how quickly the side effects came on and how difficult it seems to get on top of them, even with drugs. I had to take a Xanax at 3 am so I could get back to sleep. It worked thank goodness. Today is not bad, manageable but I'm feeling like blah, sore and with a headache. I dread the neulasta shot.",

I'm not sure if it's the Ativan or the acupuncture, maybe both. Right now all I feel is constipated and tired. Im taking Colace and Miralax. I'll be having a fruit smoothie with flax seed added later. That helped with constipation last time. On another note, my hair is falling out like crazy. Is it crazy to say that it kinda hurts? I'm keeping it in a turban so my loose locks aren't all over the place. I had my hair cut short right before my chemo, hoping to make this process easier. I've read that many of you have shaved your heads at this point. Did you do it with an electric razor that left stubble or did you do it with shave gel, water and a razor? I also wonder how long it will take for it all to just let go on it's on. This part really stinks but at least I'm not nauseated on top of it! Any encouragement and suggestions would help.

It's by RX only and many insurance companies ask for a documented trial of generic omeprazole before they will cover it. Omeprazole is fine too and it's over the counter. Go to Costco and stock up. These drugs have few-no side effects and are very effective. Another point is be sure to take all medications at least 30 minutes before lying down and take them with plenty of liquids. My DH took an aleve one night and went straight to bed. At midnight he was being rushed to the ER with chest pains, etc. He had what is known as \"pill esophagitis\". Basically the pill was dissolving directly on the muscous membrane of his esophagus and attempting to burn a hole in the process. Good luck-get a PPI in you and you should start to feel better soon. Most directions are once a day but it's ok to take them twice a day for tough cases. Be sure to ask you MO or GI doc what they think too.",

The night before my Taxol was pretty well sleepless and the only reason I napped during Taxol was because of the benedryl and I crashed for a couple hours when I got home. The day after Taxol, I felt great, energetic! When it comes to sleep, it's sporadic throughout the night. Last night I had to take half a Xanax at 3 am.",

Last time the steroids had me flying the day after treatment and the aches crept in the following day and hung round for a few days. My plan for tomorrow is to have a perfectly \"normal\" day and night and then expect to be achey and blah for two to three days. I hope your experience is similar and your reading will be \" better on steroids\". Good luck. I was terrified of Taxol but found it manageable and easier to bounce back from than AC. When the pain goes away and you start to feel good, you start to feel really good-almost normal. That was my experience after number 1. I'm hoping number 2 is similar or easier since my acupuncturist changed up his treatment last session. My MO also said the neulasta shot wasn't necessary this week, so no pain from that this week. I hope that isn't a chemo-delaying decision. Again, good luck. Angie",

Colace-save $2, biotene-save $1, aleve-save $2. The OTC helpers can really add up. I hope this helps. I've printed my coupons and will include these products in my chemo bag. My first treatment is today...AC. Wish me luck.",

I work in the pharmaceutical industry and the manufacturers really do want consumers to use whatever savings program offered. I google the RX meds as well. Copay saving card or free pill vouchers can help to be sure the medicine is tolerable without breaking the bank. Many copay savings programs represent monthly savings. The savings cards typically arent offered with generic drugs though. I hope you are well!",
