They rescheduled my PET scan til tommorrow due to my insurance taking a little longer to approve it. Sucks I was a day and a half into the diet when they changed it. Im still feeling pretty wiped out, but i get up and force myself to shower and move around. The situation with my daughter has not improved.  I think that plays a huge roll in how I am feeling too.  My daughter and son-in-law live with me and its like we are strangers now. its very very difficult and i cry every day.  I had my ex husband living with us for quite awhile before all of this and he is not the brightest star in the sky, he is lazy and I was trying to lean on him a little to help my out financially, he finally got a job and left and is helping out a little financially now but i know it was rough on my daughter, I had told her months ago he would not be back and I let him back. But now that he is gone for good, and I mean forever, my daughter changed. Maybe she doesnt trust he wont be back.  I have promised her before and let her down. I just wish she would understand how much I love her and how sorry I am for his lazy ass ever being in her bueatiful life. I am hoping in time I will have my best friend back. Thanks for listening.",

Well, I have invasive Ductal carcinoma of course and it was drum roll please.... 8cm. I had the BMX no reconstruction and lymph node removal- 13/22 on August 6th,2010.I am er/pr - and HER2 +.  PET scan is tommorrow and chemo starts Friday- Adriamycin and Cytoxan every 2 weeks for 4 treatments with Neulasta.Then Taxol every 2 weeks for 4 treatments with weekly Herceptin. then Herceptin every 3 weeks for a year. Radiation to chest wall, collar bone and underarm after chemo. This  all of course is assuming my PET scan is clear. I started taking zoloft when I was first diagnosed and don't really see any uplift yet. give it time I guess.  My biggest obstacle is that my daughter, who is pregnant with my first grandchild, and I are having some difficulties.  She and her husband are great they love each other dearly, i just feel like I have ruined everything, they don't really want to do much with me anymore, we used to be inseperable, but the past couple of weeks have seen so many changes. I cry alot and regret alot. sometimes I wonder if I will make it thru this, because it is just overwhelming to me and i want my daughter to just be happy. Dx 7/2/2010, IDC, 6cm+, Stage IIIC, Grade 2, 13/22 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

It's been very difficult, but no one seems to understand in my family.  my mother and sister are wonderful but they can never know how I am feeling. Like this may be the only grandchild I see, and it hurts when I am not included in things with the pregnancy.  My daughter and I used to be very close, best friends and now we hardly even talk. I am trying to be strong and hoping and praying that my daughter and son in law start including me again and we can be strong together to fight this cancer and welcome their new baby..",
