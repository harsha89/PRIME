I took it as well as some time to do more research, talk to more doctors and last week made up my mind to have the double mastectomy with the hormones for five years. Surgery date is May 13th at 6am !!! Not sure if I'm more scared or mad cause I have to get up so early ! I'm good with my decision although scared to death of the surgery and recovery, but am preparing as much as I can both practically and mentally and will get through it somehow. I have been so worried about the pets even with wonderful offers of dog walking etc. so installed a dog door a few days ago (65lb Black Lab and heavy sliding door) and now the cat is jealous cause it's too heavy for him so will add a cat door this weekend. Nothing like using power tools and bashing things with a hammer to help vent. I ordered a hands free leash belt today (http://squishyfacestudio.com/index.php/review/product/list/id/138/category/36/) as I walk twice a day and was wondering how I would manage the dog until my arms are back to full strength, so one more thing crossed off the \"how am I going to cope\" list. I went therapy window shopping after one appointment a few days ago and realized I can do spaghetti straps this summer, haven't been able to do that in 40 years ! Anybody know if the dents in shoulders from years of heavy bra straps go away over time ? Anyway today I'm doing a lot better although still burst into tears at the drop of a hat. I did manage to tell my hairdresser yesterday without crying ! I was so proud of myself, it was getting embarrassing lol. I moved my calendar to May yesterday and realized all this has happened in under a month, most of it in under three weeks, wow, I have lost all concept of time. Better go it's a gorgeous day and I have veggies to plant. They will be on their own for a time but may as well get them in and hope they make it! Thanks again ladies !   ",

I had a regular mammogram April 1st, got called in for a \"follow up\" April 11th and they got me in that afternoon, biopsy the 15th Told it was cancer the 16th, saw a surgeon the 17th and after a few days to try and take it all in I'm falling apart. (and here I thought I was doing so well!) This all came after getting a preliminary diagnosis of Lupus two weeks earlier which threw me for a loop. I have an appointment with a specialist on Wednesday to see about that. I'm lucky in that it the cancer seems to be stage one -ish under 1 1/2 cm, no evidence yet that it's in the nodes, so evidently I am an excellent candidate for lumpectomy with Rads and Arminidex for 5 years but I'm not sure that's what I want to do. I can also possibly have a lumpectomy etc with a breast reduction as I have large breast (34F) and don't really like them that much and can get an appointment with a plastic surgeon in a couple of weeks for a consult if I want. Problem is my gut is yelling for me to just have both removed, it was what I first thought and after days of research and having other less drastic options I still feel I just want them gone. My big concern is dealing emotionally with the scars long term I'm not sure if I can cope with seeing them every day and regretting the decision as there's no going back if they're both gone. I had a cyst removed 12 years ago and it was the last straw in an eighteen year marriage, he walked out, (I know that still haunts me) so it's just me to consider now when making the decision. My kids are grown, I'm self employed and can take whatever time off I need, within reason anyway (I do know how lucky I am in so many ways) and I have way more options than most (assuming nothing else shows up after surgery) Any one got any suggestions or thoughts ?",

Wondering what it's going to be like going from huge to flat though, talk about one extreme to another, it's going to be a whole different point of view lol  Need to flatten the stomach though to get it in proportion, so am practicing getting out of bed without using my arms, I heard it's a great ab work out !!. I don't think it has sunk in though that this could be a very long term thing. I am not stupid but can't wrap my head around the possibility that after this surgery and recovery it may well not be over. I'm still having problems with doing all this based on a blip on a screen. I can't see it, feel it, or touch it so it's not quite real. I'm making progress though and that's ok for now :-) ",

Enjoy :-)   I went for my pre op on Tuesday and met the lady that is having her surgery right after mine (I'm AM she's PM)  so we're helping each other through the next week or more. I'm still OK most of the time, am keeping busy building things, nothing like hitting things with a hammer to help vent :-) Finally got my 90 year old Mum in England the hospital contact information (email is not her thing!) so she's a bit less panicky for the time being. It's hard with the seven hour time difference but I should be in recovery before she goes to bed. I treated myself to a whole drawer full of new and colorful panties the other day and am slowly throwing my bras away. No point in washing them. Although the thought of not having to wear one again is appealing it is still a bit sad. I think I'll keep couple and use them for supporting melons in the greenhouse lol Back to power tools and hammers! Hugs to all    ",

It's mostly settling down and now I'm just trying to get strong again. I have had really good movement and strength in my arms all the way through just the pulling of the glue to worry about cause it feels like it's popping open sometimes Scary! and I'm really tired of being sore. The tubes are freaking me out though and I can look at the scars (most of the time) but not the tubes ! Eeek! freaky ! I lost 4lbs 14oz of boobs ! (yes I asked my wonderful surgeon to weigh them) Not a weigh loss program I'd recommend though and my balance is a bit off still, but it's fun to get on the scales lol I'm back walking the dog with the hands free leash belt that I am so glad I got, it's wonderful and I could not walk him without it. Other than that I am taking it easy, sleeping a lot and ignoring housework. I did clean the kitchen and load the dishwasher this morning .......and then took a nice long nap cause it wore me out :-) My pathology report came back on Monday pm all clear ! Phew, I've avoided Radiation! so I've been doing an internal happy dance as actually dancing hurts, then yesterday (Tuesday am) my navigator called and said she sending for another test to see if I needed chemo ! What ?????? No mention of that all the way through this !!!!!! did the double mastectomy in hopes of avoiding everything else which I thought I'd managed to get away with and was prepared for the hormone therapy for years but not chemo. I was half asleep when she sprung this on me so woke up a bit, did the research called back and refused the test, Oncotype DX, cause I know me well enough to know I would not do the chemo anyway just based on that. Maybe I'm nuts but it's the right decision for me although, much to my annoyance, it just completely freaked me out. That added to another appointment with another new doctor just to get started on the hormones, (just give me the prescription already !) and another load of the same paperwork and questions that arrived for me to fill out this morning. Urgh I'm sick of all this already and have only been at it since April 11th!   Hi Kellya, So sorry to hear about your diagnosis, that was me just over a month ago, complete shock and way too much info at once (hence the surprise at the test news yesterday which she had mentioned weeks ago  although not the chemo bit I would have remembered that!) The advice these ladies gave me was take your time and trust your gut and it was good advice. It took me a week or so just to stop crying and panicking I still can't tell people without crying, or just randomly crying which is getting embarrassing . For me I needed lots of information and that helped (my nurses after surgery did say I was way over prepared LOL) I did tons of research in a very short time and made the treatment choices that I am still OK with. Hard choices, yes, but once I got there I knew they were the right ones for me. I read somewhere that writing all this down as you go through it helps so I kept a notebook on my desk which ended up being my diary, phone call record, appointment book, contact list, and everything else I needed to make notes of and now goes with me to every appointment. I am not a writer but I did find it helpful to put my thoughts down as I sorted through everything. I also read that down the road, when you wonder what you were thinking, or possibly doubt why you did what you did,  you actually have a record of where your head was at at the time. Even if I never go back to it I already find it comforting that it's there (along with before and after pictures which I have not gone back and looked at yet, way too soon, but they are there if I ever want too) Hang in there.",
