I mean how much patternmaking is required to create a big rectangle?  Anyway, someone obviously got smart and decided they'd do something similar for the head and are making a bunch of money at it! The simplest things seem to be the most successful. I wore a knit cotton hat this morning to Pilates class.  I actually found it to be as hot on my head as the wig, but then I had been working out.  I still have some hair, too, which makes a difference I'm sure.

Honeybunny9, my hair's still about an inch long, so don't know about the blackheads yet, but there are definitely zits up there I'm going to have to be careful about.  Still fighting the nasty raised, red, infected acne bumps on my face from round 1.  The topical antibiotic gel my mo gave me doesn't seem to do much. Momx2, I hope you can feel your mom with you, giving you strength, because I'm sure she's there.  I hope, too, that you can find a way in this difficult time to be open to the healing love and light everyone is sending to you.

Marsha1970, I do agree that exercise helps.  I'm trying to get back into my Pilates routine.  I have been walking, but getting bored with the same old route around my neighborhood. Walking anywhere else means getting in the car, which is too much hassle. Nocompromises2013, what are survivor buffs? Loved your funny story about the wig, Lark ! So, my daughter starts this new homeschool on Monday.  We've been doing orientation the last couple of days and I've been so glad to feel my old self for it.  Part of it is on campus, which will be good, but I'm still concerned about how much I'll be able to help her on chemo \"down\" days.  I have to know the software, too, and I have a low frustration tolerance for computers . My ps has put me on antibiotics for some redness on my right \"breast\" (if you can call it that).  She doesn't think it's infected but wants to err on the side of caution considering I'm on chemo.  My second round is next Thursday.  It seems as soon as you start feeling better, the next one is due!",

This is day 10 after my first treatment and I'm finally starting to feel normal again.  Had to take my daughter to get braces today, so I'm glad I was able to \"be there\" for her instead of feeling \"icky\" myself. Doc gave me something for the acne which is hopefully going away now but it's been bad and, yes, due to that nasty taxotere.  The constant, low grade headache seems to be finally receding.  Option, I've had sleep issues, too.  I feel fine going to bed, but then I wake up in the middle of the night with a mild sour stomach and can't get back to sleep again.  This has happened several nights in a row now so I'm going to take something before going to bed tonight.  I haven't lost any hair yet, which is weird because I was losing hair (not chunks, but enough to notice) before all this on a regular basis! Like so many others of you, nothing tastes the same anymore.  I'm fancying a smoothie right now, though, with some vanilla soy milk, banana and honey.  The doc gave me the \"okay\" as far as eating soy products.  I'll let you know how that works. Daisy72, it's Monday and I hope you're not feeling too bad.  It sounds like you've been having such a tough time and my heart goes out to you. JeriGrace, glad your nurse was on top of things!  They certainly should be, though, they do that stuff every day.  I was watching the nurses at my chemo facility and they're all young and pretty but figured maybe they're straight out of college and are assigned the grunt work ... because, gees, that seems like grunt work to me running back and forth everytime someone's station \"dings\", changing out bags, etc.  Seems like the better job would be back there giving people shots and helping the docs rather than working in that depressing room.  But what do I know? Maybe it is the better paying job afterall.  ckmoss, it sounds like you've done your homework and I would be hesitant to do rads, too, especially if you feel your doc is one to go a bit overboard.  I had the toughtest time trying to make a decision whether to do chemo at all, because of the small percentage of advantage.  I could have just done Herceptin.  The jury will still be out on whether I made the right decision until I've done all the sessions. Am I the only one that likes oatmeal?  A little milk, a little fruit, nuts and just a touch of brown sugar .... yumm!  Can't taste it now, but I remember the taste and imagine it.  Hope I didn't gross out any of you oatmeal haters .

I've been busy all week trying to understand this new online school with my daughter.  On Friday, she worked from 8:15 to 7 and today she had to do a math class.  It's been exhausting, and then I had chemo #2 on Thursday.  Feel my crappiest today. I have been reading through all the posts, so here goes: HVV - I got acne, too.  Mo gave me topical antibiotic, but when my ps gave me an oral one it finally started to clear up.  My b.s told me lymphodema is rare and thought I didn't need any pt.  However, I went anyway and am glad I did.  The massages are wonderful and they've given me all kinds of good advice.  My range of motion is back to normal even though I still have some cording.  Will return after my next fill.  Regarding recon., I didn't have enough back fat or belly fat to do both breasts and my skin is very thin.  I can see the TE's through my skin and feel them pop in and out when I press on them, but after massages and stretches they're feeling a lot better now and I feel I can wait for recon when chemo's done.  Mellie289 - my ps gave me ab's for the redness on my breast, but she doesn't think it was infection, she was just erring on the side of caution.  She thinks a stitch underneath the skin broke but it's no big deal. Rambo - Illuminations in Alpharetta offers free wigs for chemo patients (the kind that are smooth on the inside and kind to bald heads).  The lady who took care of me (Julie, I think), was super helpful and, although the wigs are used, the one I got is really good quality.  I wore it to chemo and the lady next to me looked at me in disbelief when I said it was a wig.  The nurse who overheard me later came up and told me it was the best wig he'd ever seen!  Soooo glad to hear the good news about your daughter!  I know that has to be such a wonderful relief! GraceB1- the revolving room sounds quite scary.  I do hope that doesn't occur again and that you are feeling much better by now. Soriya123- Like RealityCheck, I won't be getting recon. until after chemo and am even holding off on fills.  The TE's have really settled down and, like RC, I can pretty much lay in any position I want to now.  I was getting some real discomfort at first, too. SweetheartinTX- that's a tough decision to make about radiation.  It did sound excessive at first, but reading other posts maybe it is for the best, I don't know.  Whatever you feel most comfortable with will be the way to go. Gotta go and eat and rest.  Hugs to all!",

Lark, I seem to keep getting this low grade headache each day, too.  I've noticed my eyesight is blurrier and maybe it's to do with that. Angelanature, you're making me cry!  My hair was getting so ashy and dry-looking, anyway with the grey coming in, so losing it won't be as big a deal for me, but for those of you who had beautiful hair, my heart goes out to you. Momx2, please accept my condolences on your loss. Rambo50, glad your second round didn't go too badly so far.  Good luck on the job next week.  My daughter and I will be doing orientation next week when I should be feeling a lot better.  I've asked about tutoring help and been told I'll get an answer next Thursday.  Just not sure how well I'll be able to homeschool right after treatments. Everyone else ... most of you sound like you're two down, four to go.  I hope things get better rather than worse ... you sound so strong, I know you can do it.  I won't get my second treatment until the 15th.  Saw the oncologist today and he had some good news for me.  Apparently, unbeknowns to me, my regular gyn did a test to see if I was genetically prone to colon cancer, considering I'd had endrometrial ... and I'm not!  Whooohooo!  Now I can relax about getting a colonoscopy until after all this crap is over. The Nystatin seems to be helping my sore tongue and inner lips more than the magic mouthwash did, so I'll keep going with that for now. It sounds like each treatment brings it's own problems.  Not looking forward to it.",

Just an interesting factoid....I saw on the news (PBS, and they don't usually report trivia) recently that there are preliminary studies showing that people who have been through chemo seem less likely to get alzheimers.  Anyone else see that?  Of course, chemo-brain as well as other SE's are probably not the ideal alternative.",
