I took notice did a self exam only to find a large lump on the outside of my breast. I got in the next week to the breast dr and after both an ultrasound and mamogram he said that it looked like a lymph node that was enlarged and that I needed to come back in two months to have it recheck and that by then it should be gone. Over the last two months I have watched it and it didn't shrink just get bigger. Two days ago I went in for my follow up. He did a focused ultrasound and seemed surprised that yes it had grown. He said that he wasn't 100% sure if it was a lymph node and biopsied it. I am only 31 and yes I am scared. I know only 20% of biopsys are cancer and that they can do so much to treat it now. But that doesn't override my fear. Praying to be brave no matter what! Log in to post a reply",

I don't blame you for wanting an MRI, I know I have wondered if it would be a good option for my self in light of my own dense breasts. I guess you could always get a second opinion. As far as the Tamoxifen goes it seems you would have to really talk to your BS and GYNO about that, weighing the risks to the benefits. It sounds like you have been on this roller coaster ride for a while I hope you get some answers soon!",

I keep getting told with the blood pressure that its my bad genes kicking in. It is hard with all of this that I am doing everything in my power to be healthy. Exercise, a diet mostly of organic veggies, low fat ...super low sodium. I don't smoke only have one beer or glass of wine maybe once a month and low caffine. I will keep doing all that I can and try to relax and stay calm.",

My Great Grandma died from colon cancer and out of her eight kids two had colon cancer and two had breast cancer. My Grandma was one of the ones with colon. My Mom is her only daughter and at the age of 63 she has only had pre cancerous cervical cells, no breast or colon cancer. I have read on the NCI website that breast, colon, cervical and uterine are related to mutations in the BRCA1 gene. I am just wondering why they don't normally include those in family history risk for breast. Also if anyone out there with a similar family history and chose to get tested? At this point any testing I did would be for my daughter as I am being watched because of a benign breast condition. I would love to hear your experience and what helped you consider this test?Thank you ! Log in to post a reply",
