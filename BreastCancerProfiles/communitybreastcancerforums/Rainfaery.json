    "Content": "Rainfaery wrote: Hi all, I'm yet another person who is here, wondering what steps I should take. I could use some advice from members who have been in my situation. Back story: I'm 25, and about 4 weeks ago, my boyfriend noticed that my right breast had doubled in size overnight. I went to urgent care, who set up an ultrasound of my breast. This came back negative, showing no lumps. Since then, my breast has increased in size, and I've been experiencing shooting pains in it. I have no rash or redness. This past week, I followed up with the NP at my doctor's office. She did some blood tests, which ruled out any hormonal causes of the swelling. She said due to my age, she didn't believe it was cancer, and said to follow up in six months. I am, obviously, somewhat concerned about IBC. The sudden onset of symptoms, as well as the continued swelling have me worried. I'm not sure if I should see another GP, or where to go from here. How does one refer oneself to a breast surgeon? Can you just call, and ask for an appointment based on symptoms, or is a referral necessary? I know IBC is unlikely, but in the interest of putting my mind at rest, I'd prefer to have some sort of biopsy to rule out cancer. Log in to post a reply",
