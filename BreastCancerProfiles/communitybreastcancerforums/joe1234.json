Path report was good. Was told I didn't have to have radiation because cancer was small. Was told to take tamoxifen, but still haven't filled perscription. Nervous about taking it. Wondering if the benefits out weigh the riskd in my case. Go for mammo in aug. for other breast,both had calcification removed but only left breast had dcis. Dr. will be following me closely. There's no easy decision and hoping I can stop thinking about future recurrences.",

Was told by my breast surgeeon that she was not recommending radiation but she sent me to an oncologist. He wanted me to see a radialogist oncologist to get his opinion on the radiation treatment. After going over all of my reports I was told I didn't need the radiation. Apparently there are some cases , if the cancer is low grade, where the patient can fore go this treatment. I was told by the oncologist that if would be good for me to take tamoxifen,but that the decision was up to me. I have been doing alot of research and I decided that the risks might out weigh the bebefits in my case. I am very nervous about the side effects. I do have the perscription but have not filled it yet. Both doctors said that I could take it at a later date if necessary. I am 54 and still have not gone through menopause. I'm just interested if anyone out there is in a similiar situation and how they are doing? I am being followed very closely by my surgeon. Just went for mammo on right breast. Report said probably benign but repeat mammo in six months.I find these mammos nerve racking. My dr. said it will be like this for awhile,but reassures me that I am being closely monitored. I just hope I made the right choice. I don't know if you can ever be sure.Sometimes I wish they would just tell me I had to do the radiation.Sorry I am being so long winded.
