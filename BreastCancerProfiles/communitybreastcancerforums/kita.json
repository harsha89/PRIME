I will ask at my next appt. the cd of my last pet scan got overnight fed ex'd today to the trial people so I hope to hear from them by Friday. Then I still have 2 more weeks to wait before I can start. Soliel the trial is 7 days of PARP and one day of carboplatin. I've had Carbo before and it was the last chemo that worked in a yr so I hope it does the job again with a little help from oliparib. My parents are coming for my birthday and I booked us a two our cruise of San Diego bay. Hoping I can just enjoy myself. My treatment center is doing a project to do genetic tests on all tumors if possible to try to find any markers that might lead to new medicines out there for me. My request for that biopsy has been submitted already.",

I feel like its asking for a miracle but I'm praying I'm in that group! My Dr spoke with the clinical trial people and they are still reviewing my scans. Why they need to see the actual scan before letting me on the trial is beyond me but that's the way it goes. If I am accepted I will start Oct 22. After my first trip out there I'm planning on moving home with my parents for a few months to make the babysitting situation easier. Fingers crossed the biopsy and trial bring me good news.

I love having my little princess by my side cuddling and watching tv with me. I wonder if she will remember our lazy times together as fondly as my mother has. Judy sharing something that popped into my head. Hope you all ate feeling well and you cancers are running away. \"...

However, I will not go to a clinic in Mexico (which the book talks about) that pumps you full of vitamins and says that some regimen can cure any type if cancer. Smh I want to believe it can help but I just don't know.",
