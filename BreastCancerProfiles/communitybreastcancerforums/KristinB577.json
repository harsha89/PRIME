I'm hoping that my vision will improve. Meow13 I didn't have anything noticable by physically looking at my eye. I had blurred vision in one eye and like Patti just thought I needed glasses. Turns out I had stage 4 breast cancer.",

In fact this was the first symptom (that I paid attention to) and then the breast lump was discovered.
