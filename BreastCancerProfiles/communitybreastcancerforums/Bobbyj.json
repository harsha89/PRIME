When we met with the Dr on the day of chemo #1 to ask any questions we had, they wrote a script for anything we were concerned about! We were worried about not sleeping at night....we got a script for ambien. We were worried about nausea....... we got a script for phenegran at night and zofran during the day (because the phenegran makes you sleepy, and the zofran is too expensive to take all the time!). We were worried about any pain that may occur......we got a script for hydrocodone. If we were concerned...... they wrote a script! After the treatment we went to the pharmacy and the pharmacist looked at us like we were printing them in our garage because we had so many!! LOL!!  They also provided the ativan the day of chemo as one of the pre-chemo drugs in an IV push. After just a few minutes Jennifer was very relaxed! They also gave her an anti-nausea med as part of the premeds that stays in your system for three days and would have rendered the nausea scripts useless until it gets out of her system (don't remember what it was called, but so far it seems to be working). I am assuming it will be that way before each treatment! Hope that helps! All of you are incredibly brave and the way you all help eacother out is inspiring!! Hang tough! You will all get through this!!",
