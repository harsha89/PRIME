Would the doctor be able to determine the estrogen positive/negative from the needle biopsy?  And what does that mean - is it better for it to be positive or negative? Also, would the doctor be able to determine the HER2 from the needle biopsy?  My mom has NO family history of breast cancer - her mother, sisters, aunts, etc. have never had to go through this. Is that to her favor? I think I understand that nothing else (stage, grade, etc.) can be determined until her surgery but I'm shocked at how long it is going to take for just an initial visit with the surgeon (she was diagnosed Friday and they won't be able to see her for 3 weeks).  And that's just the initial visit, I have no clue as to how long it will be until they can even get her into surgery.  Is this stupid tumor just growing and spreading all this time?   Sorry for all the questions, I hope you can help shed a little light on this emotional roller coaster I've been on since Friday.  I have alternated between crying, anger, hope, dispair, thankfulness, depression and anxiety since she broke the news to me on Saturday.   I forgot to mention that she is post-menopausal.  Is that towards her favor?   Thanks for any help or advice you can offer.  ",
