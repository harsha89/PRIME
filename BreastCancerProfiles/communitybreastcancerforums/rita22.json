I have heard of women having a birads 5 score and it not being cancer but the odds are not that great.  My mass is a similar size to yours at 2.5cm  do you mind me asking if your mass is tender to the touch?  Everyone tells me that breast cancer doesn't hurt.  I wouldn't call it painful, but it is definitely sore and tender. ",
