I don't think that your friends are tired of your cancer thing. I think they just don't know what to say or how to act. They have no way of understanding how you feel because they don't have MBC. To them you probably look great and appear to be handling everything well. Think about it. To outsiders, you appear strong. You are doing it all - working, raising a wonderful daughter, managing a household, and living with a horrible disease. To some of your friends, you probably seem like a superhero. They might not realize that you could use their support. Others might be afraid to bring up your disease because they think it will upset you. My adult son recently asked me how I was feeling and whether or not my current treatment was working. He then asked if I was sick of answering those questions. I told him that I was never tired of answering questions for people who really care. I can see why some people might think we would get tired of talking about MBC. Now, if your friends really are tired of the cancer thing, tell them you are a lot more tired of it than they are. You are never alone, Singlemom. We will always be right here for you. We know how you feel. We are willing and ready to hear whatever you have to say. You can complain, rant, celebrate, mourn, laugh, and cry with us. We will never tire of you or your thoughts. You do not have to stay positive here. We all experience bad times. It is especially hard for you, raising your daughter all alone. We understand. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

As Rosevalley said, people with mets only to the bones can live for many, many years. You will find people here who have been living with bone mets for a long time, and some of them are now NED (no evidence of disease). Please pop into the Bone Mets Thread when you can. Lots of people there can help. I know the concept of stage IV bc can be overwhelming. It is normal to feel scared, especially during the first several months. When I was diagnosed last year, my DH and I cried as I said that I would never see another Christmas. Well, guess what, I am still here, and I plan to live through many more Christmases. My onc told me to expect to live a long time. So here I am, living and breathing, leading a pretty normal life, feeling good, and making plans and for the the future. As Rosevalley pointed out, there are many treatment options available. Great developments have happened in the treatment of HER2+ bc. Your onc will give you the treatment that is best suited to your dx. I am sure others will post soon with advice and help. Let us know if you have any specific questions. Things will get better. In the meantime, here is a big (((hug))) from me to you. Remember, you are not alone in this. Lynne",

The first thing I want to do is tell you not to feel guilty or remorseful for things that you or did or did not do in the past. We can all look back and say \"if only\", but it doesnt't change anything. None of this is your fault. Please remember that. NONE OF THIS IS YOUR FAULT! There is no cure for stage IV bc, but there are treatments available that can help us live for a long time. Welcome to the stage IV forum of bco. You have come to the right place. You will find many helpful and supportive people here who will answer you questions and offer advice. It does seem like a long time to wait for your treatment to begin. When will you see your new oncologist? Make sure you are comfortable with him or her and feel that you have found the right person who is willing to work with you to find the right treatment plan for you. My onc supports my goal to live for many, many years. If your new onc does not give you hope, please find another one. Your onc should understand that there IS urgency here. You are important, and beginning treatment is very important. I understand why you feel as you do. It sounds like your doctors could have been more aggressive about monitoring for progression and identified it earlier. Unfortunately, your are now in this scary place. It is normal to be frightened. Everyone on these boards has been there. I hope that once you have a treatment plan in place and begin to see results, you will start to feel better. You will hear from others soon, and they will have have words of wisdom and encouragement for you. I am sending hugs your way. Lynne",

Yes, hope does count in so many ways. Without hope, where would we be, with or without our disease? People plan their futures on hope. They base their dreams and goals on hope. Negativity has no place in our medical teams' words. We are all aware of the fact that there is currently no cure for mbc, but we are also well aware of the fact that there are many treatments available. Many of us will live for years, some for decades. There are more treatments coming. I think that it is unhealthy for you to continue to see a doctor who has such a serious impact on your well-being and mental health. Unless he is willing to change, and since the reviews indicate that this is his usual manner he probably won't change, it seems to be in your best interest to find someone else. How far would you have to travel to see another qualified oncologist? If you must stay with him, contact the nurse navigator or the office manager and tell them how you feel. Let them know what he said, how he said it, how it made you feel, and how it affected you for the days following the appointment. Bring up the reviews that you read. Ask them if they can suggest a solution to the issue. I really hope that you can move on to another doctor, but if not, then the toxic attitude of that onc needs to change, not just for your sake but for others who see him as well. Why in heaven's name did that man choose to be an oncologist if he has no heart or no idea of the impact of his words? In the meantime, look to this forum for support. The people here know the truth and the possibilities and are willing to give you all the support you need. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

Those who do know have learned a lot from me about the disease. They are still amazed that I look so healthy three years into MBC. Faslodex and Ibrance are the combo of my second line of treatment, and I have been taking it for 21 months. My blood counts dropped so low during the first cycle that my dose was reduced. The counts still drop each cycle. Anemia is my constant state. My platelets are always low. Still, I am lucky to be like Julie or Alice, but like Mae, I don't mention it often on the boards. It feels like no one wants to hear that. (I like to hear that other people feel good. I LOVE to hear when people receive the news that they are NED or NEAD. it gives me hope.) Although my SEs are minimal, I do know what it's like to have progression. I do know how it feels to wonder about the future. I experience that same stress as everyone else when it's time for scans. I worry when my TMs continue to rise. I research new and old treatments alike to try to prepare myself for whatever treatment will be my next. I wonder how long I will feel this good. The Ibrance (and now verzenio) commercials don't bother me any more than any other commercials for prescription medications. It is impossible to represent every one of us in the ads. They generalize. I have met several others who are on Ibrance and still feel good, so I know I am not unique, just lucky. I believe that the widespread perception of a cancer patient, especially one with metastatic disease, is someone who looks frail, malnourished, bald, and is bed-ridden, in severe pain, and close to death. Many of us are far from that. How is it possible to show the true picture? Frankly, if I watched the commercial without any real knowledge of cancer meds, I would not want to touch Ibrance after hearing the SEs and warnings voiced in quick succession. There is something about hearing all those serious and potentially fatal things that could happen - I would stay clear of it. I am sorry that some people make you feel uncomfortable or out of place here just because you are doing well. I think it is safe to say that we all want to be like you. Well, actually we would like to do you one better and get rid of MBC once and for all. Abeautifulsunset, I heard that one of the women in the verzenio commercial has MBC. I don't know if that is true. ",

I had convinced myself that I was in a safety zone and that nothing would happen to me as long as the mets stayed in my bones. Last June, my scans revealed the unthinkable. Not only did I have progression in my bones, I also had three lesions in my liver, and they were mets! They varied in size from 1.2 cm to 2.1 cm. I felt like I had fallen through my safety net and was free-falling off into some scary world where my time would be measured in weeks or months rather than years. My husband and I had a good cry together and decided to forge ahead into what ever we had facing us. When we met with my MO and I told him how I felt, he took a deep breath, reached for my hand, and told me that my liver mets were relatively small (using his fingers to show me how small), that I was not feeling sick, and that liver mets can often be controlled for a long time. We discussed several possible treatment plans, and he told me why he recommended one over the others. I had done some research and was happy with his recommendation. Last December, my scans show stable bone mets, and my liver mets were much less visible. I am due for another scan next week, and I except the good news to continue. I still feel great. I know how difficult it is to come face to face with progression, but there are still many treatment options available to you. Remember that we are all here to support you. Many people on these boards have been living many years since their liver mets diagnosis. I will be thinking about you tomorrow as you go to your appointment. Big hugs from, Lynne ",

Perhaps it is because we, as human beings, have the innate desire to nurture, heal, comfort, and help others. It is difficult to feel so helpless. It makes us feel that we are failing to fulfill our responsibility to protect someone we love. I admire you for your strength and for the loving care you are giving to your mother. Caregivers are never given all the credit they deserve. It is hard to stay strong during all the ups and downs that come with a serious illness. You have it twice as hard as most since you also have MBC yourself. Although you think that you are not able to do anything for your mom, you are doing the most important things of all.

Before I die, I want to know that our children, grandchildren, and all future generations around the world will be free of the pain, fear, and burden that so many suffer with today. Lynne",

I think that all MOs have to evaluate each patient and then determine, based on the MO's experiences and recent developments, what to recommend. I had really bad blood tests before my bc dx. I had severe pain throughout my body that was originally diagnosed as polymyalgia rheumatica. Luckily, I was referred to my hemotologist/oncologist, and the correct diagnosis was made. The pain I was experiencing was from the bone mets. Anyway, among other abnormalities in the blood work, I had severe anemia and a low white cell count. Those factors probably made me a better candidate for arimidex since ibrance can lower white cell counts. I am doing well on arimidex. I have no pain and no side effects. The tumor in my breast is shrinking and is softer. My white count is now within the normal range, and my hemoglobin is getting there. My alkaline phosphatase has also gone down to normal, indicating less activity in the bones. Next month I will have TMs checked to see if they are coming down. I hope this treatment works for a long time. I hope you are also doing well. I have read wonderful things about the drugs you are taking. They seem to be an excellent choice. I will have my first Zometa infusion next month. I had to get all my dental work done first, and my dentist wants to make sure everything is perfect. Lynne",

I know it is crazy, but I would like to go on thinking that my current treatment is working it\u2019s magic and killing cancer cells all over the place. I do hope that your fears are unfounded and that you do not have progression. Our minds can sometimes play cruel jokes on us and imagine horrible things. Your mind is focused on that Your identified \u201cthing\u201d that was noted on the January scan report that might or might not be of significance. Luckily, the fears in our minds often do not come true. Many times those \u201cthings\u201d on scans disappear from the next scan - no explanation, just gone. Even if you do have progression, it will be caught early, and there are many more proven treatments available to you. MBC is a nasty disease. It seems like every time we get in a good place and start to feel comfortable, mbc steps in with a nasty surprise to disrupt our peace and joy. I know you will have trouble thinking of anything else, but do something good for yourself. Take a nice bubble bath, watch a good movie, go for a long walk, listen to your favorite songs, call a good friend and just talk and laugh and cry and then laugh some more, have your favorite snack - maybe something full of empty calories, just because, yell and scream if it makes you feel you feel better. There are no scripts or rules for those of us with mbc, so just do whatever you have to do to get through this. We are all here for you. Just tell us what you need. I am sending you a great big (((HUG))) because that is one thing that i would want! Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

I am afraid that I don't have any experience with insurance coverage problems. It makes no sense, medically or ethically, for you to be put into such a situation. Is your plan an HMO? Is it possible to get a referral to the big hospital as an exception? Do they at least pay for a second opinion at the nearby hospital? If not, is it at all possible for you to self-pay for a second opinion? I only ask because many people see a local onc for treatment, but get a second opinion in a big cancer center. The information from the second opinion can then be compared to local MO's, in your case the doc who is 45 minutes away so not so local, treatment plan, and the info can also be shared with him/her. That MO's care can then be covered even if treatment is changed from original recommendation. I don't know how much second opinion would cost, and that fee could be prohibitive. Maybe you could call the big center and explain the situation to see if they could give you a discounted rate for a second opinion. Maybe social services would be a good place to start. Medical appointments are expensive, so I am sure your question won't be uncommon. The worst thing that can happen is that they say no, right? How are you feeling? Do you have an appointment yet to discuss a treatment plan? Do you have support from someone close to you? Hugs and prayers, Lynne ",

Unfortunately, it is possible for cancer to recur, even in distant sites, after many years. The CT scan and bone scan are excellent tools. As others have said, a biopsy is really the best way to confirm the diagnosis, and the only way to determine whether or not the tumors have the same characteristics as your original bc. If your current Doctor is not planning a biopsy, please get a second opinion. If you do have mets, there are many treatments available. It is normal to feel the way you do. We have all been there. I have to confess that I still find myself in that land of denial sometimes and am quite happy there. Of course, I do continue my treatments. If you do have mets, remember what Patty said - many people live for many years with MBC. Don't think that life with MBC is always miserable. Many of us leave lives that are quite normal. Many of us work, attend school, travel, raise children, run, hike, bike, exercise, pursue lots of hobbies, etc. Although some of us have limitations, we learn to adjust when necessary. That is not to say that life is perfect, but no one's life is free of obstacles. Most of us will admit to periods of stress, fear, anxiety, depression, and uncertainty, but there is help available. Please let us know how things are going. I pray that you don't have MBC, but if you do, we will all be here to support you. Hugs from, Lynne ",

You can gain a lot of good information and receive great support from the people on the stage IV threads. Browse the site, and you will find many pertinent threads. One suggestion I have for you is the Bone Mets Thread. You will find that there are many men and women living pretty normal lives with bone mets. In spite of what you might read when you google, we can live for many years with this disease. This Faslodex thread that you have posted to is an old thread that has been inactive for a while, but there is an active thread about Falodex. Here is the link: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topics/816419 It is called Faslodex Girls 2014. It includes tips to follow when receiving the injections to help avoid soreness from the shots. I found those tips to be helpful. There are many of us on Faslodex who are experiencing few if any side effects in spite of the lists of potential issues. I have been taking it since last July, but some women have been taking it for several years. Many say that it has fewer side effects than most other treatment plans.Join us there if you have any questions or concerns. Lynne",

      "Content": "50sgirl wrote: I want to tell you a true yet timely story. I received a call from my son the other day. He was on a business trip when one of his associates received a call from his wife. She had just been told that her bc had recurred, and this time it is in her bones. The man had so many questions, and my son began texting me for information. I can only imagine the panic and fear that swept over that woman and her husband as he struggled to find the quickest flights home. He knew he needed to be with her. She felt lost and weak without having him there for support. The next day the questions continued from the couple to my son and then to me as the couple was told of treatment options. They were trying to make sure that what they were being told by her doctors made sense because they were too upset to fully process information by themselves, and they were too overwhelmed to do research. They needed help from someone like me, someone who has been through the nightmare that was just beginning to unfold for them. Luckily, their questions were about basic things that I could comfortably answer, and I think I was able to calm them just a tiny bit and let them know that they are not alone. I know they must still feel so lost. I still remember the day that I was told that I had breast cancer that had spread to my bones. I remember all the feelings I had - fear, guilt, sadness, helplessness, desperation, anger, ignorance. I also vividly remember that my DH immediately put his arms around me and told me that we would face it together. He has never let me down. So it was, that through my son, I heard of one more person diagnosed with MBC. It is one more too many. How can we end this? I really want to know. Metastatic Breast Cancer Awareness Day is just two days away. We on this site are already aware. When will we be aware of a cure? When will we have an annual event to celebrate that MBC has been wiped out, eliminated, CURED? My life has changed since my diagnosis. There are some good changes. I appreciate each day more than I used to. I say, \"I love you\" more often. I take more risks. I am less apt to let trivial little things bother me. I am slower to anger. I laugh more freely. I don't take myself as seriously anymore. I appreciate my family, warts and all. I eat better and exercise more often. I hope I have become more accepting and more kind. Don't get me wrong. In spite of the good changes, I wish I didn't have MBC. There are also negative changes to my life. I will need treatment for the rest of my life, and that is tough to accept. I am never more than 28 days from my next doctor's appointment and/or lab tests. I always worry about results of tests and scans. Actually, worry is not a strong enough word. I feel that the black cloud called progression is always waiting close by. I try not to wonder how much longer I will live, but you know how that goes. I have learned to like the word \"stable\" but dream of the terms \"NED\" and \"NEAD, two terms that may never apply to me. I have met many truly wonderful people on this site. It amazes me that there are so many people willing to help strangers without a second thought. Do you know how special you are? Your words move me. I rejoice when you post news of good test results, stability, and improvement, and I tear up when I read about pain or progression. I have suffered and cried to learn of lives we have lost. Some of the people we've lost had become dear friends to me. They gave me support when I needed it most. They gave me advice when they had knowledge I lacked. The losses are personal for me and serve as reminders of the ugliest side of MBC, a side I cannot ignore. One more thing, then I promise I will end this way-too-long post. I want to thank you all for being here. You touch my life in ways you cannot imagine. Each of you contributes to these wonderful threads even though you might not realize it. You give me strength. You understand my issues as no one else can.Thank you, thank you, thank you.

I have seen great results so far, but there is still a small part of the primary tumor in my breast. I know that Arimidex will eventually stop working for me. I am still new in this, but forthe past month or two I have wondered if I am really having the treatment I need. I can't help wondering if more aggressive treatment would yield better results (longer life)? There is no definitive answer. On the flip side, I must say that I feel great, no chemo SEs or recovery time from surgery or radiation. It is difficult to know what is best. Is this approach being taken to improve my QOL? Is it a financial decision? Would tx be different if I were younger? So many question, so few answers. Lynne",

You need to call your doctor so this can be investigated. Often times, the symptoms and what we imagine are worse than the diagnosis. As Kandy pointed out, inner ear problems often cause vertigo. It is also still possible that you have sinus issues and that the antibiotic you were given didn't resolve the problem. This is not something you should ignore. Whatever is causing the vertigo needs to be identified and treated so you can get relief. The stress alone is reason enough to call. Please call your doctor today to discuss this and/or make an appointment. (((Hugs))), Lynne",

For those of us who have been active in these stage IV boards for a number of years, we are used to searching older posts for information and do not find it necessary to ask someone to detail things all over again. For most of us mbc'ers, it is welcome news to read a post like Jen's. We want to celebrate her victory over this disease. It gives us hope, but we understand that right now exceptional responders are just that - exceptions. I have seen people on these boards who have been treated by naturalists as well as conventional medicine, have followed a vegan diet, have exercised regularly, and died within a year. I have also seen the other extreme, people who were treated only with conventional medicine, have not changed diet or lifestyle, and are still alive and being treated after ten years, some are NED some are not. There are too many factors in play to determine what will work best for each individual or for the entire group of mbc'ers. Someday, the \"secrets\" will be found, but what has worked for Jen will not work for all because our disease, genetic makeup, and who know what else are not identical. I would really like to let Jen and others enjoy the good news without the conflict that is overtaking this thread. I hope you understand what I am saying. If you search on Jen's name, you should find the information you are looking for but only if she chose to post it. You could send her a PM, of course, and she can choose to respond with whatever she wants, but please don't think that she has an obligation to answer all your questions. She has a right to privacy just like everyone else on these boards. I would like to see Jen post again in the future, and I don't want her to feel that reactions to her posts might make her uncomfortable.  ",

Micmel, i don't post here often, but I read your posts about your frustration with your children. Alas, that journey into adulthood can be so challenging to the parents! My children are all grown now. I do remember moments that might give you some hope that you are appreciated and are doing the right thing. When we dropped my oldest son at college, his new roommate's mother said she was taking her son downstairs to show him how to use the washer and dryer. My son gave me a shocked expression and later said he was glad I had prepared him for college and at least he knew how to wash his own clothes. I laughed, remembering how he had grumbled about doing his own laundry. When son number 2 came home from Christmas break during his freshman year, he thanked me for having rules and setting boundaries when he was growing up even though he didn't like them at the time. He said that his good foundation served him well as he saw others step over the line and get involved in things that were risky or just plain dumb. It was like a mother's best dream - my teenaged son thanked me for being that mean mom he had complained about for years! Don't get me wrong. My sons were not perfect, they were just normal adolescents, but it was good to know that my DH and I did some things right. So take heart. Things will click with your kids eventually. As I said, mine are all adults now and they are off on their own, but they step in to help when we need it. Scwilly, Enjoy your time with your son. Lynwood, I have a dentist appt this week, too. I love the way my teeth feel right after they have been cleaned. Is it weird to enjoy my time with my dental hygienist? She is great! Nothing exciting planned for this week, I will do some babysitting for two of my granddaughters, ages 1 1/2 and 3, plan to do some sewing if my back can take it, and want to start cutting back some of the plants in my gardens.Fall has arrived. I hope everyone has a good day. Hugs, Lynne  ",

You have experienced great challenges, loss, and pain, yet you have survived and have risen above them to find the joy that remains in your life. Your niece/daughter is so lucky that you have been there for her. You are such a special, loving, giving soul. I lost my only sister when she was only 36. It was devastating to my parents, her husband, her son, and me. I still miss her. I am adding that information here for two reasons: Reason 1. I know that some of you fear that your children will not remember you or that someone else will take your place when you are gone. My sister had one child. Her son turned 13 the day my sister died, so old enough to have experienced many things with his mother. His father did remarry, and his new wife treated my nephew well. They did grow close. My nephew is now an adult with two children. He still talks about his mother often. His children have heard many stories about the grandmother they have never met. They have visited her grave in Paris several times and left their grandmother little gifts - a toy car, a little doll, rocks. No one will ever replace his mother in my nephew's heart, and he will never forget her. He did have room in his heart for his stepmother, but that does not mean that the love and loss he feels for his mother is gone. Reason 2: sometimes people close to us disappoint us or our relationships break down. Sometimes the reasons for the breakdown are so serious that the bond cannot be repaired. Perhaps there have been malicious or violent or nasty, mean things done. If that is the case, we need to move on, pray for wisdom, and look forward without ever restoring that bond. If that is the case, it is healthier to live with the rift. Sometimes that other person has so many issues or hate or problems, it would be detrimental to our own well-being to encourage a reconciliation. In some cases, however, the reason that a relationship breaks down is petty or due to our own stubbornness or pride and we are hurt and cannot find a way back to forgive. Sometimes our loved one has truly changed and wants to come back into our world. In that case, we need to decide whether or not we want to have that person back in our life, whether it might be a good thing, whether we can forgive and/or forget. Maybe a reconciliation is still not possible and we need to move on, but maybe it is worth a try. We each have to decide for ourselves the direction to take. I wish I could still see my sister and talk to her and tell her what a wonderful son she has, but our relationship was a good one. Micmel, it sounds like your relationship with your sister has been poisoned by her problems and history. It seems that you would like to consider a reconciliation, but think carefully. You have lots of stress in your life right now, and I am not sure that it is a good time to add more. My prayers go out for you. I am sorry for rambling on. Hugs and prayers, Lynne",

Unfortunately, we cannot be all things to all people, and sometimes the demands of meeting the needs or wants of another person are outweighed by our own need to survive emotionally and be happy. Life is short, as we know all too well. Someday things might change for you and your sister, but itsounds like it is in your best interest as well as your family's to leave things as they are for now. Your sister made choices, and you had no control over them. You have no reason to feel guilty. Concentrate on what you have instead of what you don't have. Focus on the love and happiness that you give to and share with your family. Lynne",

Yes, there will be challenges, but our lives are usually enriched as we face them. I can't wait to see your posts as you tell us about each step you take in the process. Of course you are nervous, but but sometimes we just have to take the leap and have faith that things will work out. If things ever feel overwhelming, come here and we will help you through the situation. In the meantime, enjoy decorating. Mae, thanks for more great pictures. I think I gain two pounds every time I see the food in your posts. It always looks so good. Gracie, I hope you receive good news about your scans. Is it possible to request the results from the place where you have your scans? Maybe that way you can read them before your next appointment. Chelle, Your decorations look elegant and beautiful. Your house must be full of excitement about Christmas. This has always been my favorite time of year. I hope you sleep better tonight. Micmel, How are you doing today? Have you done much of your holiday shopping? Will you be cooking Christmas dinner? Minnie, it is good to see you here. It sounds like you share a very special love with your DH. I try to enjoy every day I have with my DH. Maybe we have many more years together, and maybe our days are numbered, but we have learned not to dwell on the future we cannot see. Btw, I do wish I could send you a few of my extra pounds! Leapfrog, You are a strong woman, and you will make whatever decisions are best for you. Enjoy your garden. Lynnwood, Are you still celebrating? How do you like retirement? I miss my paycheck, but not the stress of my job. I still see and talk to many people I worked with.

I am telling you about her to give you hope since MS is often not the rapidly debilitating disease that many of us think it is. There have been some research breakthroughs, and there are new medications available. I know this information will not relieve your fear or stress, but I hope it gives you some hope to hold onto.

I was told that my 11 year old granddaughter was shivering by the 4th quarter, but like any true Pats' fan, she watched the game without complaint. I was a bit nervous during the first half, but relaxed after that. I have to admit that some of the games have been real nail-biters. My DH and I came up to Bretton Woods after my onc appointment today. We will be here all week. It was minus 5 here when we arrived. They have had 65 inches of snow already. I heard it will be close to twenty below by morning. I think we just might both be crazy to live in NH. Mel, My 3 year old granddaughter's name is Avery, and my grandson's name is Camden.

If so, I will give you a recommendation -great experience, great people, and 2 minutes from Aulani. Oh! You will be there during whale season - fantastic! I will tell you more later.

When will you get the results of the scan? Tanya, Dinner with some family members sounds wonderful. I like the idea of trying each other's dishes. I can't tell you how often I look at my dh's food and wish I had ordered what he did. MJH, I have to admit that I thought the Patriots were going to lose half the games they ended up winning this season. I actually started clapping and cheering when Gilmore knocked down that pass the other day. That wouldn't be unusual for someone who was at the game, but I was sitting on the couch in my family room. Luckily, my DH is well awareness of the fact that I am a bit crazy. Gracie, I hope the bleeding has decreased or stopped. I had nosebleeds during my first few cycles of Ibrance. The SEs of that medication seem to vary from one person to another and from one cycle to the next. Update on my MO appointment: My MO had planned to change my medication because new lung nodules and prominent lymph node combined with TMs that have increased steadily for several months in a row suggest progression. We talked about it, and he said that if I had only the lung issues without the TMs, he would be willing to leave me on current meds and rescan in 3months. Benign nodules would not grow in that period of time, mets would. I asked if the nodules could be from the cough, cold, and wheezing I had a few weeks before scans, and he said that it is possible. After more discussion, he said he would be willing to leave me on faslodex and ibrance for three months then rescan. Otherwise, I would go on tamoxifen. Then he asked what I wanted to do. I told him I wanted to stay on I/F because I feel good and don't want to move on to something new until absolutely necessary. He is good with that, so we have a plan. Lesson learned, always listen to what MO has to say, ask questions, voice your opinions/concerns, and make sure MO is listening to what you have to say. You are the important one in the relationship, and your feelings count.Btw, I was pleased to hear that tamoxifen will be my next line of treatment. We shall see what April scan shows. Hi to everyone else. I hope you are all avoiding the flu. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne (the other one)   ",

I can understand how that would happen! Minnie, You are right. None of us will ever be the people we once were, but I am not sure what I would be now if I didn't have MBC. My life would certainly be different if I didn't think of cancer every single day. I have heard some people say that they are glad they have MBC because it made them a better person or something. Well, let me tell you that nothing in this world will EVER make me happy to have MBC. NOTHING! On the other hand, if I didn't have MBC, what would I be like? There are the obvious things - My life would have fewer dr appts, tests, scans, medications, and on and on. Would my DH and I be less appreciative of each other? Possibly. There is nothing like coming face-to-face with our own mortality or that of a loved one to make us appreciate what we have to lose. I used to think that I wanted to know how and when I will die. Does MBC give me that insight? Of course not. I might die of MBC, but I could die from the flu or pneumonia or a plane crash or choking or a heart attack before MBC gets me. My DH told his PCP that I only have one functioning kidney because the other one is atrophic and nothing but a bunch of cystic tissue. (I call it my dud.) His PCP asked me if I had gotten a brain scan because some percentage (I forget the number) of people with that condition have a brain aneurysm. I laughed and told him that I have metastatic breast cancer and figure that it will kill me before a brain aneurysm has time to get me. I am sure he thinks I am nuts for laughing, but if I can't laugh, how will I get through the rest of my life? When I was diagnosed with MBC, I thought I would be dead within a fewmonths, but here I am, more than 2 1/2 years later. My life is different, but it is not defined by my cancer.

It must be a relief that your neurophils are rebounding more quickly now. That is one less thing you need to worry about. I hope you have many more years on leterozole and Ibrance. It is amazing to think of the impact that the development of Ibrance has had on so many of us. Just a few years ago it wasn't available at all, and now it is considered a standard treatment and has opened the door to similar drugs. Let's hope and pray that more impactful drugs are released soon and that they will lead to longer lives and even a cure. I should say cures, not cure, because I believe that the answers are complex and varied, just like MBC. Lynne, I hope you are starting to recover from your hell week. I admire your attitude.

You are lucky to have everyone so close. Are you all getting together for Sunday's big game? Micmel, A WEDDING? HOW WONDERFUL! I have all sons, no daughters, so I have never been the mother of the bride. I sometimes think that I really missed out since I couldn't go shopping for gowns with a daughter. On the other hand, I do remember how exciting it was to shop with my sister for her gown. She lived and Canada, and I went up there to shop with her. My mother wasn't there......hmmm, there must have been more to the story. Maybe my mother went there for a follow-up shopping trip. Well, at least my Mom helped me shop for mine. She was very helpful, but looking back, I think she knew which dress I loved and wouldn't have spoiled it by telling me if she didn't really like it. I have wonderful memories of those days with my mother even though it was 100 years ago. I also remember the big smile on my Dad's face as well as the tears welling up in his eyes as he walked me down the aisle. These next 8 months will create wonderful memories for you, your daughter, and the rest of the family. Enjoy every moment. Oh, so much to do. I am excited just thinking of it. Bigbhome, What a frightening experience you had with your dh's accident. I am glad that you were able to talk to him before you saw his truck. How is he feeling? Did he experience soreness, aches, and pains the next day? How are you doing? As far as pulling up stakes and traveling is concerned, there are no right or wrong choices. None of us can see into the future nor can we go back for a do-over. We just make the choices, follow through on them, and enjoy the path we travel. If you decide to continue on your current path, you will find happiness and perhaps a bit of heartache once in a while. If you decide to go in a different direction, you will find a different happiness and different heartache. That's what life is all about. I have a feeling, just from what you post, that no matter what you and your DH decide to do, you will focus on the joys and stomp on those disappointing moments. Like others here, I think that I found these discussion boards through Google, so I know that posts are out there. I never thought of the fact that the mods could read my PMs, but I hope they have better things to do than that. None of my messages have been worth reading by anyone other than their intended recipients. I would hope that the mods wouldn't share those messages or any personal information they contain with \"outsiders\". Frankly, it seems that nothing in this world is truly safe from outside observers these days. I guess we have to be careful. Oh no, I always seem to go on and on and post very long messages I will stop for now. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne  ",

I think they usually tell people to do a more thorough job. Minnie, Navigating between pages on an iPad can be challenging. My iPad often has a mind of its own. I can be typing along, and when I look up, some of my words have been completely changed. Sometimes I watch as an entire sentence and its meaning has been transformed into gibberish. I see that the words were typed correctly but then change. Really, I am not crazy. If you ever see that one of my posts makes no sense, it could be because I didn't proof-read. Then again, maybe I have lost my mind. I went out for breakfast with a friend this morning. She is one of the few friends who knows about my MBC dx. It was refreshing to know that we could still spend 2 1/2 hours chatting together without talking about cancer. (Both her parents died from cancer, so she understands what people go through.) She did ask how I was doing, but it was just in passing as if it were like any other normal subject. Micmel, The bouquet is beautiful. I have never seen one like it before.

Would you consider having a CT scan instead until things stabilize? And Grannax, it is awful that the cost of Trulicity has gone up so much that it is out of reach for many people. It seems that the most expensive drugs are those that are featured in commercials and ads the most frequently. The marketers make the drugs seem appealing and the answer to prayers, but the costs are prohibitive. Oops, there is Alice on tv now. She is the new version of Julie.

At the end she is sitting on a porch looking at photos with a friend. She is not shown running, as Julie does. She lives her \"new normal.\" Hugs and prayers, Lynne",

Our granddaughter took the test for her purple belt in Jujitsu, so we watched that and also watched our grandson's soccer game. The weather was wet and cool. Yucky is the word that comes to mind. We will leave for Florida on Thursday. I am hoping for good weather there. We will be there for a month. It sounds like a very long time to me. My next MO visit, blood tests, Faslodex injections, and next month's Ibrance cycle will be delayed two weeks due to my trip. I am a bit nervous, but it will be nice. I haven't had more than 4 weeks between MO visits since I was diagnosed almost 3 years ago. My TMs were up again last week. That is 4 months in a row. I guess when I repeat scans in April I will find out if I made a mistake when I decided to stay on current medications rather than start a new treatment plan. Hmmm,. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

You probably don't want to add up the cost of everything you have bought or ordered. Sometimes ignorance really is bliss. I can't wait to see pictures of the big day. Tell us about your dress. What color did you choose? What style? Have you decided on shoes? The wedding pictures are all wonderful. Everyone looks so beautiful in the photos. It is so much fun to see the different styles. Each is perfect for the woman who chose it! Next we will have to post our baby pictures. Just kidding! My MO called this morning to talk about my rising TMs. He wanted to move up my scans even earlier than scheduled (and that was already earlier than normal). He knows I am heading out of state and was hoping to have them done before I left, but that won't happen since there is not enough time. Instead, he is having them rescheduled to as soon as I get home, so early April instead of late April. We talked for a while, and he stressed the fact that although it is \"concerning\" that my TMs have risen steadily and I have new nodules in my lungs, that fact that I still feel great is the most important factor. I am going with that. When I leave (at a way too early time) on Thursday morning, I will leave my MBC concernshere in NH. Tanya, I have looked at the weather forecast, and I see that you have come through for me. The weather is expected to be perfect. Thank you. I hope everyone is having a good day.

She was quite dramatic, and I have no doubt that my parents' and I would have been subjected to a huge hissy-fit as my sister vividly described the many ways that I would ruin her entire life by going to that prom. Of course, I was only 13 when she graduated from high school, so it would have been humiliating for her to have her 12 or 13 year old sister at her prom. We were very close, but she had her limits.

I laughed when I read your words about worrying about your grandson's favorite pants and the cooking and clearing everything out. Those are they same kinds of thoughts that pop into my head.

I was reluctant to be away for an entire month. My MO agreed to let me take a longer-than usual break from Ibrance and a longer than normal interval between Faslodex injections, so I had no excuse for avoiding this long time away from home. Of course, I have missed three miserable storms in the first 13 days, so I won't complain, but I do miss my children and grandchildren. Thank goodness for texting. One of my sons will be coming down late next week and staying for six days. My dil and two of my grandchildren will be coming with him. Yay! My dil's parents are in Naples for the winter, so we will all go out to dinner one night and to a Red Sox game one day. My DH and I spent most of the day at the beach today. The weather was perfect. We did lots of walking there. I will try to remember to post a picture. Lynne and MJH, All I can say is I am so sorry for all that snow again today. I tuned into WMUR and heard that Manchester had 17.5 inches so far today with several more expected. Then they added salt to the wound by saying that another nor'easter could be coming early next week. Seriously? Quick, hop on a plane and join me here. Here is a picture of Bonita Beach where we went today.  Here is the picture of my mom, my dad, my sister (sitting looking like she was about 21 but was only 15) and me (age 11). I am the only one of the four who is still alive. It is part of a family picture at my aunt's wedding. The big photo also includes my grandparents, two aunts, three uncles, and two cousins. My sister was a junior bridesmaid, and I was in charge of the guest book. I felt so grown up wearing that corsage. I remember shopping for my dress with my mom. The color was lilac, and I loved it. Isn't it funny what we remember? I am laughing at that picture of me. Why in heaven's name were my bangs so short? Did I cut them myself? Very possible. The rest of my hair was in a ponytail, very fashionable for a young girl, but in the photo I look like a boy with short hair instead of a girl with a ponytail. Lol.  Hugs and prayers from, Lynne",

You go for your appointment, and as you are leaving your MO says, \"Oh, by the way you have an appointment for scans first thing tomorrow morning.\" Maybe you wouldn't sleep that night. Maybe you would be filled ithe anxiety, but it would just be for one night! I realize that such a thing could never happen. We might not be available on short notice. The MO's office would have to schedule at appropriate time. Slot would have to be free. We would eventually recognize that there's a pattern to the schedule, etc, but I can dream. It seems to me that at times each of us here thinks that every change we feel, every little ache and pain we experience, and every odd result we see on blood tests are symptoms of progression. Unfortunately, sometimes it is progression, but it is impossible for us to make that determination on our own, so we assume the worst. I do trust my MO, but I still have control issues. I find myself doing excessive amounts of research on what I feel will be my next treatment option. When my MO starts talking about it, I ask all sorts of questions about potential SEs and length of time it is likely to work. After we finish our conversation, he often laughs and asks me if he has forgotten anything or if he got it right. Luckily we do get along. I think it's perfectly okay for you to question your MO. You have a right to get explanations about everything pertaining to your treatment and your disease. You are in charge. I wish I could help you feel better. We each have to deal with things in our own way. I hope your trip will help you forget about MBC for a while. I hope it's a vacation from MBC. I truly hate this disease and what it does to people. I wish that no one here would ever have progression. I wish I could declare the next six months a progression-free period so that for those few months we wouldn't have to worry about ourselves or each other. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

Divine, it is nice to hear that things are finally settling down for you and your DH. You must be exhausted. Micmel, You should talk to your MO about your lack of appetite. It is not healthy to eat as little as you have been. He may suggest something to stimulate your appetite. Maybe your palliative care physician could suggest something or, if the lack of appetite is from your medications, recommend adjusting them. Tanya, I read When Breath Becomes Air several months ago. It was well written. I also read The Bright Hour. I did not think that it was as well written, but I had read that the widow of the author of When Breath Becomes Air became friends with the Widower of The Bright Hour when the latter contacted the former after his wife's passing. He wanted some advise on how to survive such a loss. To the mothers among us, have a happy Mothers' Day tomorrow. For those among us whose mom is still alive, give her a call tomorrow. If you love her be sure to tell her that. Words are easy to say as long as they are true, and they mean a lot to the person you say them to. For those of us whose mom has passed, take a minute to think of a warm memory of her. It could bring a smile to your face and a warm feeling to your heart. If you mother was or is a real witch, ignore her and just enjoy your day. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

It seems like you have an appointment almost every day this week. Is there any way to combine some of them or have them back to back in the future? I always have blood tests, treatments, and MO appointments on the same day in the same place. If I needed to see a palliative care doctor, I would have the option to see him there on the same day, too. Granted, it would be a long day, but at least I would get it all over with. The scans, of course, are a different matter for most of us. Maybe you could at schedule at least two back-to-back? Of course we all have different preferences. I am probably just a weirdo for liking to have them together. Maybe different days for everything works out better for you. It was sad to read Kaayborg's dh's post this morning, but I did find a bit of comfort in knowing that Missy continued to live her life regardless of what this disease threw at her. She and her DH even took one last trip a little more than a month ago. They went to St. Thomas because she wanted to feel the warmth of the sun and experience summer-like weather one more time. I am glad they decided to go and spend some special time together. I will always remember the picture she posted when she returned. She was standing on the beach, smiling. Lynne, I am happy that your scans show no progression, but sorry that it means you can't change treatment. I know your current chemo is not easy. I loved today's weather, but there is rain and thunder here now. I sent you a PM. I don't know if you had a chance to read it. Your granddaughter is obviously talented and creative. Butt piano playing? I laughed when I pictured you out there mowing your lawn in your nightgown and sneakers with your bald head soaking in those rays of sunshine. Your neighbors must never be bored. Mae, It sounds like you are having a dream vacation. I am gaining weight just reading your food posts. Bigbhome, I haven't seen you here lately. Are you doing okay? How is your DH? Grannax must be sitting on the beach enjoy the sunshine. I look forward to seeing her pictures and hearing about her experiences. Gracie, Not all anemia responds to iron supplements. When I was diagnosed 3 years ago, I was severely anemic (hemoglobin was 7) , but tests showed that there was plenty of iron in my body. Sometimes chronic disease or medication can cause the number of red cells to decline or be smaller than normal. I think anemia is very common for people with MBC, especially while taking Ibrance. My MO has never recommended an iron supplement, but of course we are all different, that's for sure, and you might respond well to the supplements. MJH, I look forward to seeing you next week. I will send more info about time and place soon I am looking forward to hearing more good scan results soon. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne",

I know what a traumatic event it is to have a child born so early. NICU staff is full of caring, highly skilled, highly motivated people who know how to treat each child that enters the unit. It is still difficult for the parents to see their precious child experience the inevitable ups and downs during treatments and recovery. How old are your grandchildren who are staying with you? Is there anyone who can help you? Three months is a long time. Are they in school? Do they attend camp in the summer? Maybe their friends' parents' will be willing to have them over for occasional play dates or sleepovers depending on their ages. Is there anyone who can help with meals, like your daughter or son's neighbors? I was hospitalized a distance from home for a couple of months when I was pregnant years ago. Within 24 hours, without even being asked, my neighbors had organized a plan to provide dinners for my DH and children (14 people cooked for them while I was hospitalized), and several people volunteered to watch my two year old during the day. One of my friends had started rallying people at church to provide meals, but it was unneccessary because of the generosity of my wondeful neighbors. I mention this to you only because there is sometimes help out there - friends, neighbors, church, etc. I wish I lived closer to you because I would try to help out. What you are doing is an amazing gift to your grandchildren, but recognize the signs if you begin to overdo it, and ask for help. (((Hugs))) Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

When I go back to the area of my roots, there is no one left from my early years. I am the only one still alive from my original family, and my home town has experienced so much change that I hardly recognize it. I do have many memories right here, of course, since my DH and I met while we were still in high school. I also have all my parents' photo albums, my mother-in-law's pictures, and some of my maternal grandmother's. Sometimes I look through some of them on dreary days, and memories flash through my mind. I can still remember the warm hugs from my grandmother, my grandfather's big welcoming smile whenever he saw me, the little notes my mother would give me that were always signed, \"Love and kisses, Mom and Dad\", playing with my father in the waves at the beach, the day my sister and I hugged and cried when she left for college. Needless to say, I end up with tears in my eyes. I am so darn sentimental. I sometimes wonder what my children and grandchildren will remember about me. And who in heavens name is going to want all these pictures when I am gone? Ugh, sorry, I didn't mean to make this all about me. It sounds like you have many good memories of those days by the harbor. I hope that the grief you felt was one caused by the emotional impact of those memories and not due to regret. I think those days and years made you the strong, sensitive, caring person you are today. We are formed by all the experiences of the past, and we continue to grow and change as we live each day. You are a special person, and we are blessed to have you in our lives. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

I am deeply sorry for the way you have been treated, for the fear you feel for your DD's safety, for the loss of her presence in your life, and for the intolerable behavior of the young man your DD has chosen to marry. It has always amazed me that the law would seem to side with someone like your freeloading boarder in a case such as this. I realize that it is to protect the innocent, but it is sad that it must also apply in this case. I know how painful it is to see someone you love suddenly turn on you and reject you. A few months ago, one of my sons decided to leave here with his family and will no longer speak to me, so I know how painful these situations can be. Someday maybe I will tell you more, but today is all about you, not me. I know you don't believe in the power of prayer, but I do, and I will pray for you and your family. There is one thing I want you to remember. You cannot change the course of your daughter's life. If she wants things to change, she will have to choose to do it for herself. She is an adult. If she comes to her senses or feels that the life before her is not what she wants, she will find her way back to you. You are not to blame for any of this. You loved your daughter and her choice of a husband and gave them everything. You welcomed him into your family. You supported her throughout her life. I repeat, she is an adults and made her own choices. Now you must mourn what you have lost - the future of your relationship with your daughter. Cry, scream, throw something. When you are done, pick yourself up, dust yourself off, look in the mirror, and tell yourself that you are the person you must put first now. You and your DH still have a wonderful future ahead of you. You share a deep love for each other. You will get through this, and you will be happy. Now to money issues. Can you get the deposits back for the wedding arrangements? Is that what you want to do? I find it shocking that they have the nerve to go through with the reception since you contributed so much, and the wedding gown, UNBELIEVABLE. Maybe there will be some sort of reconciation, but it must come from them, not you. Remember, put yourself first, immerse yourself in the love you and your DH share, and be happy.

I am willing to bet that those pesky little liver mets will continue to shrink and your bones and lungs will also show more improvement as time goes by. I chuckled when I read your comment about asking about your liver mets when presented with information about a possible compression fracture. It is funny how our thought processes change and adapt. I hope you are celebrating your good news. I am doing the happy dance for you. WOOHOO! Runor, Thank you for that thought-provoking post. I think we all have different approaches and thought processes as we face cancer and our future. There is no unique right approach and certainly no wrong one. We often react in unexpected ways to each of the good and bad things we experience during our lives. Some things become learning experiences, some make us shrink back in fear, some make us blossom in strength, some help us reach out to others, some makes us withdraw. I have had many good and bad experiences in my life, and I could never have predicted how any one of them would affect me. I have nothing good to say about cancer. It sickens and kills way too many people and destroys families and friendships along the way. I wish it could just disappear. Even though that statement is true, I cannot say that my own cancer is the worst thing that has ever happened to me. Some may be shocked by that statement, but for me it is true. I lived through the death of a newborn child, the loss of my sister (my only sibling), the deaths of both of my parents, the loss of friends during wartime, the loss of my father-in-law after years of Alzheimer's, the suicide of my friend's daughter. Those are finalities. I will never get those people back. They will never see today's world, feel the sunshine, see the warmth of a young child's smile. There is no future with them, only memories, as sweet as they are.You are right. Things will never be the same as they were before my MBC diagnosis, but every major life experience, good and bad, has changed me. Yes, I have cancer. Yes, it will probably kill me someday, but not today. Today is still mine as are as many tomorrows as I am allowed to have. I choose to look ahead and enjoy as much of life as I can because I like being alive. I have many people in my life who bring me joy, surprises, disappointments, sadness, comfort, and love. What more do I need? On the other hand, I am no Pollyanna. I have dark days just like everyone else. I have crying spells, I hated hearing about progression - both times. I am tired of blood tests, medications, infusions, scans, doctors' appointments. I fear bad news with every scan. I have been lucky enough to be able to push past it most of the time. So, here is my message to you, dear Runor. You are perfectly normal, and so am I,and so is every other person here. Even though I do not feel sad, tense, scared, uncertain, and unmotivated right now, I DO want chocolate and coffee. So, I am going to get a piece of chocolate from my secret stash (oh yes, I do have one). I want you to imagine sitting with me at my kitchen table as we enjoy our chocolate and raise our cups of coffee in a toast to a cure for cancer. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne  ",

The fact is, I have been living a wonderful life that has had some tragedies along the way. The good times far outweigh the bad. I had a happy childhood. My parents and grandparents taught me the importance of love, faith, kindness, justice, hard work, loyalty, trust, education, individuality, and family, among other things. They also instilled in me a love of reading and lifelong learning. I got a good education, have had wonderful friends, and married my high school sweetheart. I have sons I am proud of. They are not perfect, of course, but they are loving, curious, and open-minded. Let me list of some of my favorite memories: Christmas (every Christmas), birthday parties, going to the beach, watching my father finish a marathon, going to summer camp, being in the delivery room when my first grandchild was born (can you imagine? i would NEVER have allowed my MIL in the delivery room, much as i love her), my wedding, traveling with my husband, taking my kids to Disney World, receiving a note from my then-8 year old son that said \"Dear Mom, Here are two dollars - one for love and one for happiness. Thank you for being the best Mom in the world\" (He signed it with his name as well as his two younger brothers. I still have that note. I read it often when he was going through those lovely teenage years. I still read it now, too, and i still tear up), being a stay at home mom for a while then having a successful career, having my college-aged son (not the same one as the 8 year old) thank me for having those strict rules when he was in high school because it gave him a good foundation when he went out in the world, having the honor of spending time with my father during his last days (yes, they ARE precious memories in spite of the outcome), zip lining with my dh, skiing, visiting Washington DC area with my aunt and uncle, seeing my mother earn her masters degree when she was 66 years old. (i was so proud). Bringing my dh home from the hospital after 3 months of being very sick and having him here now healthy and happy. I could go on and on because my life has been full of good memories, but i know this is really boring.. hugs and prayers from, Lynne",

We will be thinking of you tomorrow as you have the MRI. Gracie, I hope you are feeling okay after today's chemo. Lynne, I hope that sciatica resolves soon Mary Jane, What a gorgeous picture. I am glad that you enjoyed the wedding. Have fun at your grandson's birthday party and also at Moosehead Lake. Muddlingthrough, Happy anniversary. Woohoo! I think we all feel guilty and angry that we need to depend on someone else for things we want to do ourselves. I am not a good patient, and I tend to resist my dh's help at times. I know that makes things more difficult. Anyway, think about how it would be if your roles were reversed. How would you feel if you were the caregiver and your DH was the person needing some assistance? You would most likely be happy to help because of the deep and enduring love you have for him. You would be sad and frightened, too, but it would be good to know that you could do something to help. I am sure your DH feels the same way. Love and life are full of ups and downs. It is easy to enjoy the good times, but it take an enormous amount of shared strength and love to weather the bad ones. You are fortunate to have a relationship that is strong and a very special husband who wants to share in every phase of your life. Embrace it. Take full advantage of this special day. Put on your favorite outfit. Savor every bite of that Mexican dinner. Give your DH a big hug and kiss, give a special toast with that wine, and enjoy your time with your special person. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

WOOHOO! Lynne, Good luck with your chemo session tomorrow. I hope you and your family have a wonderful time at the wedding. I will keep my fingers crossed for good weather. Today I am blinded by the sun. My eyes are trying to adjust. I think I was beginning to mildew. How is your MIL doing? Does your DH think she should have additional treatment? I am not sure what I would do if I were in her shoes. I know that at this point in my life, I want to continue living and will continue treatment. I enjoy my life and my family. As you well know, I am no spring chicken, but I am not done yet. Would I feel differently I feel I were your mil? I don't know. Everyone is different.I will pray for her. Stephanie checked me in yesterday. I thought of you, of course. She was her usual charming self. Tanya, Enjoy your trip to NY. I hope you post pictures for us. Micmel, The shower looked and sounded beautiful. You did a good job. I am sure the reception will be even more memorable. You can do it. Holmes, It is normal to worry about scan results. Just don't let that worry take over your life and overshadow all the wonderful experiences you are having. I tend be just the opposite and assume the best until progression appears. I have had progression twice so far, and you know what? I got upset, sad and scared, then I adjusted and moved on. If I dwell in the negative, I would miss all the joy. MJH, Maybe when things settle down for you, you, Lynne, and I can plan another lunch. It's tough to reel you two very busy women in. Hi to everyone. I have to run. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne",

Luckily, the hospital where I have my scans posts the results on their patient portal within two days. If I feel really anxious, I can go to medical records and get the results the day after scans. I am not a patient person. Your trips sound wonderful. You certainly have a busy September. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

We all hope to be exceptional responders. Perhaps many of us will be once we are matched up with the right treatment plans. I tend to live in my own little land of pretense where I don't have MBC and I will live for many, many years. News of progression forces me back to reality, and I tend to swing towards the other extreme of thinking that I'll be gone in weeks. Luckily, I have been able to pull myself up and continue. The lives we live are not easy. Regardless of the care I get and the support system I have, in some respects I feel like I am in this alone. I sometimes feel that this body that I have always treated well - no smoking, good nutrition, exercise, and all - has betrayed me. Then I think about the fact that it holds on as it battles this disease for me, and I feel good. I try to focus on what I have and enjoy my life. I have no idea what will come next, but I suppose that would be true even without MBC. I hope that the increased Xeloda slams those cancer cells. I hope you enjoy every minute of your vacation.

I am happy to hear that your husband is recovering and did not require surgery, but finding him on the floor and unresponsive must have been awful No, awful isn't strong enough.

Some people have discovered that their cancer changes characteristics over time and after treatment. For example, some people change from HER2- to HER2+. That opens up additional treatment options. Do you know how soon you will be seen at Fox Chase? It is hard to tell if you have had any chemo since your stage IV dx. I don't see any listed in your profile.

I did find it necessary to add a washcloth between the socks and my feet because they ice was just too darn cold to keep on. I bought an extra set of inserts for the socks and change them half way through the infusion. I am hoping that the icing works as well for me as it has for Pboi. This week I had tumor markers tested for the first time since I began Taxol. CA27.29 dropped from 2932.1 to 1799.4 after just 5 weeks of Taxol. I realize that this is still high,but I am encouraged by the significant drop. BSandra, The icing is done to prevent neuropathy. I have not read that it would prevent symptoms of lymphedema. My understanding is that the icing helps to prevent the Taxol from penetrating the surface cells in the hands and feet and prevents nerve damage that causes neuropathy. I don't know how well it works or if it works for the majority of people who try icing, but I thought it was worth the try. Hugs and prayers from. Lynne ",

This horrible disease is hard to control, and sometimes it feels like a crap shoot as our medical teams try to determine what is next for us. There have been many people before you who have seen Taxol fail them but go onto another treatment that worked. Every one of us is different, and so are our diseases. I have been lucky enough to have had two treatments work before progression set in with each one, but my last two treatments failed by allowing progression without giving me any benefit. I know how discouraged you feel. I have not yet had my first scan since starting Taxol, and I am crossing my fingers that it is working. If it is not, I will be on to the next offering. In my opinion, right now you are in the worst time of the process - waiting for a new treatment plan. I am sure you are feeling powerless, sad, nervous, and impatient. When will you learn what the next steps will be? Please keep us informed about what is going on. In the meantime, I am sending you a virtual (((hug))). Remember that you are not alone. We are always here to listen to you and support you. I hope your next course of treatment knocks out those nasty cancer cells and keeps them under control for a long, long time. TerrySB, I am sorry that your six years of NED came to an end. I wish I had some good advice for you. Hopefully, TDM1 will bring you back to NED quickly. I have seen that happen to others. I think that the combination of radiation and chemo would be a big assault on the body, so it might explain why you feel so bad. Has your MO recommended anything to help you feel better? How soon will you have another scan? Just remember this - treatment brought you to NED once, and it can do it again. I will keep you in my thoughts. Grannax, Have you swallowed your first handful of Xeloda pills? I hope theytreat you gently while they beat up those cancer cells. May you have a long successful experience with Xeloda. I hope that every one of my fellow liver-metsers is finding some joy in this day. To those who are in pain or emotional turmoil, I hope you find relief soon. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

She had had SBRT for her brain mets, and apparently her cancer continued to spread. It seems that she went quickly. She was a kind woman with a beautiful soul. Cancer shows no mercy. Artist, I hope Gezmar brings you quick relief to that ascites. Are you still waiting for COBRA info to be forwarded to the appropriate places? Sometimes a former employer will help by contacting the insurance company and asking them to push thing through their system and in turn contact your provider. There is no excuse for that to hold up your treatment since the paperwork has been submitted. Red tape, ugh! I recently read that many of the doctors affiliated with hospitals and medical centers have been given guidelines for the amount of time they should spend with patients during office visits. They were told that 11 minutes is sufficient. That explains why most appointments are booked at 15 minute intervals. It gives the physician time to go from one exam room to the next, but it doesn't provide enough time to satisfy most patients. Now you know that there will be a patient or two whose visit will take longer, so things get behind schedule. That's when we find ourselves seeing the dr run in and out of the room in 5 minutes flat. It's all about money and volume. I do have a urologist who spends a lot of time with me. She reviews scans and lab results with me, explains everything in detail, and answers all my questions. She also runs late - always. Now that doesn't bother me because I know why it happens, but I am sure many people are aggravated as they sit in that waiting room. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

She is such a kind and giving person who always seems to know exactly what to tell us here when we need support. During the past six months or so she has experienced treatment delays several times due to inadequate response to her calls to onc's office, bad reactions to treatment, and most recently the horrible delay in COBRA processing. No one deserves to go through all that, but I know she is not the only person to have those experiences. I am angry, but my concern for Artist is much stronger than my anger.

Eight and a half liters sounds like an enormous amount of fluid to drain off. No wonder you were in so much pain. How long have you been on Ibrance and Exemestane? How are the SE's? I hope they are tolerable and that they don't down those mets quickly. Grannax, I am sorry for the loss of your friend. We tend to concentrate on the treatments available for MBC, and they certainly are not enough, but it is clear that we have many more options than people with other types of cancers have. Z, it sounds like you are coping as well as you can with chemo. I fear that I would never do well with fasting. First of all, I am a stress eater. Second, if I know I can't have something, I immediately want it. Tell me I can't have foid, and I will knock you down to reach the refrigerator. I hope you see excellent results from Abraxane. Kaylynn, I am sorry to hear of your progression. It sounds like a good time for the trial. I hope it is just what you need to see improvement quickly. I know you all feel the same way, but I have to say once again....I hate cancer Hugs and prayers to everyone from, Lynne",

My experience has been that my MO calls quickly with bad news so actions can be taken and not as quickly with good news. There are several possible reasons why you have not heard back from the nurse. 1. Many times it takes up to 24 hours for the staff to respond to non-emergency phone calls. Even if the results are good, they may not realize how urgent it is that you hear them. Apparently the don't realize that waiting sucks and makes us imagine the worst 2. Some doctors just don't like nurses to deliver scan results, good or bad. I don't know if it is a control thing or if the doctors want to be there to answer any and all questions that you have. 3. The nurse hasn't had time to review the results or the doctor needs to review them first before the nurse can discuss them. Can you contact the radiology department to get a copy of the results? Most places have them available to patients within 24 to 48 hours after the scans are complete. You probably will have to go there in person if you want them quickly. I hope the results are good, Lisjo. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

I do not understand why people with no compassion decide to pursue a carrier that intimately impacts so many lives. Does he really think that you or any one of us would be likely to choose to \"opt out\" after only one treatment of just three months? He was irritable when you cried? Did he expect you to smile and say \"thank you?\" I am so upset for what you experienced. WHAT IS WRONG WITH HIM? DID HE NOT THINK ABOUT WHAT HE WAS SAYING? Is Xeloda not available in Denmark or does that doctor feel that it is not an appropriate choice for you? Is it possible that he feels that using a stronger drug like taxol would knock down the cancer more quickly? Would you be a candidate for Xeloda after a period of taxol if taxol is effective? There are many people on these boards who are being treated with taxol or have had it in the past. It can be very effective. Is there any possibility that you could have the blood tests and taxol on the same day so you wouldn't have to make that long trip twice a week? Perhaps they could make some arrangements for that under the circumstances since you live such a distance away. Is there any way that you can see someone else? I know that you are not able to choose your own doctor, but is a second opinion possible? Even if he or she makes the same recommendation, the other doctor might be more willing to have a better discussion with you. Is there a nurse navigator or case manager at the center? If there is, you should call and tell them how today's doctor made you feel. That person could also help you in this situation by setting up an appointment with someone else or helping to arrange tests and treatments for the same day. I feel such anger for the way you were treated and such sorrow that you had to experience such treatment. I wish I could give you a big hug. Please don't give up. There are options for you.

It means so much that you have reached out to us during this sad period when you could easily have put all of us in your past. I will pray for comfort and peace for you and your beautiful daughter. You will always be one of us. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

      "Content": "May 28, 2018 02:51PM - edited May 28, 2018 02:52PM by 50sgirl Lisajo, There is so much you are facing right now that I don't know where to begin. Friends, money, vacation, sleeplessness, vomiting, worrying about FISH results, concerns about your liver - it is hard for me as an observer, I can only begin to imagine what it is like for you. Your post brought tears to my eyes, and I picture you sobbing just thinking about how overwhelming all this is. I know that it is how I would feel. First let me talk about your friends' actions. I know that they have your safety and health in mind when they said you shouldn't go, but I think they have not taken your feelings into consideration. You were looking forward to getting away with them, and now, just days before you were supposed to leave, they asked you to stay home. I would be sad, disappointed, and angry. Nice? NO, NO, NO! NOT AT ALL NICE! Do you feel strong enough to go? You said that you have two airline tickets. Were they both yours or were you planning to take someone with you? Next, let me talk about how you feel on day six of your second infusion of doxil. Like leftfootforward, I think you should call your MO's office. If you are vomiting, feeling weak, and unable to sleep, it is difficult to cope with anything. Perhaps you need fluids, as leftfoot suggested. Maybe there is medication that can be prescribed to alleviate your SEs. Maybe your next infusion should be a lower dose. Perhaps you are anemic. At any rate, it is worth a call to your onc's office. I know that when we have new aches, pains, or symptoms we immediately think the worst, but maybe the vomiting is from the doxil and not from liver failure. Even the rising ALP can be from several different things, as your doctor has stated. If you do not get any satisfactory help from your onc, think about getting a second opinion. You also said that you are out of sick days. Do you have short-term disability at work that allows you to take some time off and still get some pay? I wish I had all the answers you need. I wish I could make all the pieces of the nightmare go away. I wish I could make you feel better. I wish I could take you to the Outer Banks and give you the beautiful, relaxing vacation you deserve. All I can do is let you know that I am sorry that you feel the way you do. I am sorry your friends made you feel unwelcome and disappointed. I am sorry you have MBC and everything that comes with it. I hate this disease, too. I hate what it does to us. I hate what it does to our loved ones. I hate what it does to our minds. I hate what it does to our lives. I hope that your MO can find ways to help you get through this rough period and make you feel better. I am praying for you andsending you (((hugs))). Please let us know your test results and gives us an update on how you are feeling. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

Faslodex does cause that for some of us, particularly during the first several days or up to a week after the injections. It is harmless and is not from an infection. The odor is nothing like ammonia. Several people on the Faslodex girls 2014 thread have noted the odor. Some have described it as smelling like a barn or a barnyard. Yup, pretty funky. I hope this helps. And yes, sometimes we have to talk about bodily functions. Without that sharing, how would we learn? Lynne",

Of course, I am not a doctor, but with all the chemos out there, I would think that there are many treatments yet to consider.

There are many wonderful, intelligent women and men here who provide support, answer questions, and share their knowledge. You have certainly been though a lot in the past 16 years. And now you have cysts in addition to mets? That is just horrible. I have to say that I think it it is amazing that you are seemingly so strong and level-headed when you have baseball-sized cysts on your ovaries. You must be extremely uncomfortable. I suspect that you are correct in thinking that most (if not all) of your pain is coming from those cysts. They must be putting a tremendous amount of pressure on your abdominal area. I think that you will see a great deal of relief onc even out recover from surgery. I have had no pain, elevated liver enzymes, or other symptoms with my liver mets. My mets were found through scans. My experience is not unusual although some people do have symptoms.

I thought my life would go through a dramatic change - full of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or worse. I have been on Taxol for 5 weeks now, and I have been pleasantly surprised. I had achy legs the first week, but I feel quite strong and normal now. My blood counts have dropped a bit, but so far not low enough to need to skip treatment. I have lost my hair. I realize that hair loss is a major concern to most of us, but if taxol works, I would gladly trade my hair for stability or improvement in my liver Mets. Of course there are several other IV chemos, and many of them do not cause hair loss. Maybe IV chemo won\u2019t be as bad as you think it will be. If you try it and cannot tolerate it, you have a right to ask for or something one thing else. Please keep us informed about how you are doing and let us know if you have questions.",

That makes sense, of course, since things change during the course of a couple of years. My MO's address had changed, so I contacted the project through emailto give them the new information. I have to say that the person I communicated with was very nice, helpful, and accommodating. It was so refreshing in this age of impersonal, rushed interactions.  ",

Today I heard that although a cure is needed, the main focus of my state's bc coalition right now is on screening and prevention. (They went on to say that there is really no way to prevent the disease, and that although some eating and exercise recommendations are out there, nothing is guaranteed to prevent bc. I did like that part of the statement since I remember someone asking me if my MBC was due to skipping mammograms or not having checkups. You can imagine how that made me feel right after dx.) The radio interview made me sad to think that so many people still believe that it is acceptable that a cure is not at the top of priorities. I realize that screening is important, but I know first hand that screening does not prevent deaths from MBC. Many MANY of us with mbc followed all the rules and recommendations, yet here we are. Claudia, I do try to educate people about MBC. I had no idea about it prior to my own diagnosis, so I can't blame people for their lack of knowledge. Those Juliesque commercials do little to educate. I suspect that they do generate requests for prescriptions from patients, but that's probably it. One of my friends did ask me if I am taking Ibrance. She knows that my blood counts tank every month, so at least she is paying attention. I think that more research projects are beginning to focus on MBC and a cure. Unfortunately, It is likely that no one cure will fit every case of MBC. It seems that we are still learning how many unique characteristics exist for this disease. We see again and again that a treatment that works well for a while for some people is useless for others even though all the people receiving the treatment appear to have the same \"type\" of cancer. We are still scraping the surface. Since there are so many areas of research now, I am hopeful that cures for all will be found. Better treatments with fewer side effects until a cure is found? I am all for that! We need more and better treatments that work longer with few or no SEs. Devine, Thank you for reposting that wonderful video here. Shetland, Thank you for mentioning our loved ones who suffer right along with us. I feel guilty for putting my DH through this even though the situation is beyond my control. I know he wants to help me, to save me, to make me well, and he feels helpless and frustrated. I can see it in his eyes everytime test or scan results aren't as good as we had hoped for.   ",

My guess, for what it is worth, is that your Onc has an established relationship with the urologist you were referred to and respects his or her skills. That relationship is probably tied to the fact that they both treat cancer patients. It makes communication between the two physicians easier and more comfortable. When my Onc referred me to a urologist, they talked about my case ahead of my first visit, after the first visit, and several additional times during the past three years as either of them had concerns. Another example is my DH. He needed a hepaticojejeunostomy last year and was referred to a surgeon at Dana Farber. The source of the stricture in his common bile duct was not cancer-related, but that particular surgeon was the best qualified. Try to relax. Your Onc probably chose the most qualified person. The fact that you aren't being seen till September is probably an indication that they believe it is not an urgent situation. I know it's hard to do, but try push it to the back of your mind and enjoy the rest of the summer. We can get through it together. I have to wait for scans in mid-September to find out if the jump in my CA 27.29 from 814 to 1600 in just 6 weeks is from tumor flare from tamoxifen or because tamoxifen is not working at all. I choose to believe it is tumor flare, a rare but known occurrence for some MBC patients who start tamoxifen. I had intense bone pain from head to toe for two weeks beginning at day 14 of treatment. Sounds like classic tumor flare to me. Of course I am fine now, but my TM is still 1600 and as my on told me, it is concerning. (But not as concerning as it would be in the absence of tumor flare symptoms.) So if your nerves get the best of you, let me know. I am the queenof the land of denial.

I did sign a release to have my medical records and a piece of my tumor sample sent to them. They did receive everything. I will not receive any individual results of the research since the intent is to learn more about the disease, determine why people respond differently to treatments, and ultimately to find a cure. They recently announced that they are now ready to release preliminary data so others can use it in research. As you probably know, researchers historically have worked in silos, not sharing data, and in some cases duplicating efforts. I met Dr. Wagel last year at the annual MBC symposium at Dana Farber. At lunch he sat with me and another person whom I met on these boards. He is a warm, friendly person who is passionate about his work. His is the first project that reached out directly to people with MBC. I hope their efforts pay off. It would be very nice if we benefited from the research, but if they find a cure, even for future generations, I am all for it. They need to eliminate MBC or at least turn it into a no no-terminal disease. Hugs and prayers, Lynne ",

I am also glad that you didn't have to stay at the hospital. You must have been completely exhausted by the time you got home. Enjoy your time in the timeshare with your daughter and grandsons. Relax while you are there. Your wedding pictures are beautiful. The dress is breathtaking, and you look stunning. The Manchester Country Club is a great place for a wedding reception. Gracie, I am sorry to hear that you haven't been feeling well. I hope that you body begins to adjust to the Ibrance. What dosage are you taking? Hello to everyone I have missed. I will check in soon to say hello. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

Do you know which trial your MO is looking at? At least the appointment with your MO is tomorrow, so you don't have to wait too long. Sorry for all the questions. Let us know what decision your and your MO make. I am here pulling for you. Now on to other things - how much snow did you get? Looks like a lot!

It better be gone before I return home at the end of the month.) I am sad about all the losses, and even more sad to know that many more of them are never reported here. I, for one, will not ask my DH to pass on information about my passing. I just want to fade away and save everyone the sadness and reflection that accompanies such news. As some of you have said, the news not only causes grief for the loss of someone we have grown to know and love, it also serves as a painful reminder that a cure still does not exist. This can reinforce our fears, anger, and frustration. I have to admit that I have not become less affected by these losses as time has passed. Each loss is overwhelming, from the very first I read about to the most recent. I still shed tears. I still get mad. I still hope for a miracle. I pray for all of you here as well as all our MBC sisters and brothers. Find some goodness and happiness in your day today. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

My DH and I have no dogs right now, and I miss that wonderful greeting that a dog provides every time its owner opens the door, enters the room, wakes up, says its name. A dog is all-forgiving. If you are in a bad mood, your dog will still wag its tail at you. If you are exhausted, it will lie down right next to you (or maybe even on top of you) and keep you company. You know the responsibilities that come along with a dog, but you will get much more from that dog's companionship than you give. If you are stressed out, you will feel more calm just by petting your dog. If I am not mistaken, you are not stage IV, right? Please don't let our fears and challenges bring you down. You shouldn't assume you will develop mets. Believe it or not, the odds are against that. Try to focus on that. Even if you do have a local recurrence in your breast, that is not a death sentence. It does not mean you will develop mets. I know it is sometimes hard to be optimistic, but please don't let our experiences put a dark cloud over your head. None of us want that to happen. Now back to the important stuff. What kind of dog are we talking about? If it only lives 7 or 8 years, does that mean it's a big one? In case you don't already know this, I think you should get that dog if you really want it. Of course, only you can make that decision. Any decision you make will be the right one for you. I can't wait to hear what you decide. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

I was diagnosed in June of 2015. I was convinced that I would not live to see Christmas that year. I \"knew\" that I would never survive long enough to see my new granddaughter walk. I even cleaned out my closet and dresser drawers and gave everything except a few outfits to charity so it would be easier for my family to clear things out when I was gone. I laugh about that now. I did have to do lots of shopping to slowly rebuild my wardrobe, btw. I started doing research on MBC and found BCO.org. Thank goodness for all the wonderful people on this site. They gave me hope and made me realize that I could very well be around for a long time. I changed my thinking. I decided to stop thinking about what MIGHT happen and tried to enjoy what IS happening. I try to find joy every day. I do make plans for the future including trips and famiky events. If they don't happen, well they just don't happen. Holidays have always been special to me. Each one is a unique experience, so I savor each one. There are many things in our lives that we cannot control. Sometimes we just have to let go of things and let life happen. Yes, I have MBC, but that is only part of my life. I refuse to allow it to control who I am. Micmel, I hope you are doing okay. You don't want us to throw your own warning at you, do you? You know your \"I know how to PM you\" warning Hugs and prayers from, Lynne",

I do think that the stress of recovering from surgery along with the pain and your medications are making it more difficult for you to deal with an already difficult situation with your DD. There is nothing you can do to make your daughter change. There is nothing you can say that will make her realize that she is taking advantage of you. There is no way that you can open her eyes or mind to let her know that she is turning her back on you during a time of need. She needs to do all that for herself, and that won't happen until she is ready. Sometimes all we can do is accept people the way they are. It is not your responsibility to make her into something that she is not. She is an adult. I know you are going through a lot right now. I hope that you will find it easier to deal with everything when you have recovered from surgery. Recovery is exhausting. Healing takes all your body's resources. Ride it out. Don't rush it or push yourself. Take time to truly heal. What I am going to say next might not be what you want to hear. I am trying to help, so please take these words in the way they are intended. I hope I don't offend you or anyone else here, and I apologize now if I am out of line, but here goes. I know that you are afraid of MBC. We all are! I have listened to your description of your history, and of course it sucks. No one should have to go through all you have experienced. Let's face it, MBC sucks. I am seeing your experience from a different perspective, and I want to tell you about that. . When I first read that you had a mastectomy, surgery to remove your liver tumor, radiation for your bone met, and chemo, I had two thoughts. 1 - Wow, that is a lot for someone to go through, and 2 - Wow (again), that MO is going for a cure as some MOs are brave enough to aim for with their oligometastic patients. I wished I had had the opportunity to be offered such an aggressive approach. (I had mets throughout my body, so that approach wouldn't work for me, and I have accepted that.) You have been given a gift. You are in remission, and that could very well last for many, many years. Of course there is no way of knowing how long it will last, but for now it is good. Very few of us are in the position. I know from where you sit, I am talking nonsense. You know what they say, \"The grass is always greener...\" I am not implying that you are lucky or anything. NOT AT ALL! No one with MBC or any type of cancer is lucky, far from it. I pray for everyone here every day. I pray for many things. I pray that you will some day accept what has happened because it can't be changed, then look around you and see that you still have a life to worth living, warts and all. You have a husband who loves you more than anything else in the world. You have children, however imperfect, who love you even if they don't act that way. You have friends, including those of us right here, who have come to know you and love you and enjoy having \"conversations\" with you. You are still you in spite of everything. I pray that you will someday embrace all that you have and find happiness again so you can find a little joy in each day. MBC will still suck big time. Your kids will still drive you crazy. You will still have challenges, just like everyone else, maybe bigger challenges than most, but I pray that you can sometimes look past that and find joy waiting there. I will stop now. I hope I have not added more stress. I wish I knew how to help you, Micmel. I don't like to see you so sad and upset. I am, however, glad that you can vent here. We all need to do that.

The kidneys are workhorses but are sensitive to certain things since they are tasked with filtering impurities from our blood. It is a fact that NSAIDs can cause kidney inflammation. For that reason, people with kidney problems are instructed to never take them. If your MO and the radiologist were overly concerned, they would insist on further testing immediately. (I know this from personal experience. I have been a regular visitor to my urologist's office since my first CT scan almost 3 years ago showed wonky stuff going on in my kidneys. Nothing similar to yours though.) Although waiting can be hard for us, sometimes it just makes sense since time can give a better insight into a situation. What I really want to say is, try not to worry. Please don't imagine the worst, instead assume the best. The blood tests show nothing out of the ordinary. You feel good. Have another piece of lemon cake. That sounds delicious to me, btw. I think I might have drooled when I read that you had a piece. My DH isn't fond of lemon desserts. I love them, but I never make the because I would have to eat it all myself. Take a few deep breaths and remember the good news on your scan. Lungs and liver clear. Bones stable. Kidney is normal size, no swelling, no formed mass. Excellent news! Hugs and prayers from, lynn",

It is true that many of us have limitations from MBC, but it is exciting to hear about the things you were able to do. The memories you and your family took away from that trip will replay in all your minds over and over again. I am so glad that you were able to go on that trip and that you had the best vacation ever. I cannot control myself, I am doing the happy dance that I usually reserve for good scans.

Thereis no fairness when it comes to life and death, and no explanations. I understand why you would gladly have taken your grandson's place, but we do not have the power to make those decisions and moves. I will not tell you that everything happens for a reason, because that just is not true. There is no good reason for the loss of an innocent, beautiful, precious child like your grandson. My heart aches for you and your family. He is in God's arms now and at peace. Do not feel guilty that you are still alive and he is not. Your life is precious to your family, your friends, and to us. You have many difficult days ahead. I will keep you close to my heart and in my prayers. I am sending you my love, my strength, and many hugs Hugs and prayers to you during this sad time, Lynne ",

The sadness is crushing. Not only do these losses rob the world of the lives we have come to know and value and, in one case, a life that had barely begun, but they are jolting reminders of our own situations and the inevitable end that we must all face. Elena wrote on one of the other threads that no one will leave this life alive, and it is a sad truth, of course. By connecting with strangers on these threads, we open ourselves up and allow ourselves to feel friendship, love, and concern for people we would otherwise never hear about. Those connections allow us to give and receive support at the times that it is needed most. We celebrate good news, fear bad news and suffer through the inevitable periods of waiting for any news at all. Those very same connections expose us to sadness, losses, and pain that we could have avoided if we hadn't allowed ourselves to become involved. That is a choice we have made, and we can choose to remove ourselves at any time. I have considered that many times, but here I am. I have been trying to understand why I keep coming back, mulling it over in my mind, trying to understand why I expose myself to the pain that I feel so deeply that I cry until I can cry no more...until the next time when I cry again. I think the answer is that I value the love and support too much to abandon the bonds of friendship and sisterhood I have made here. I believe that true friendships, true support, includes mourning and grieving the inevitable losses that come with them. Eventually, we will move on somehow although our hearts become heavier with each loss. Death is not something we can get used to, nor should we. To mourn the loss of a friend or loved one is the ultimate demonstration of respect and love. Hugs and prayers to each and every one of you, my friends, from Lynne ",

I did see an article about a vaccine that has been tested on mice. It uses the mouse's own immune system to destroy the cancer. It has been injected into tumors of mice, and the vaccine strengthens t-cells and those bolstered t-cells not only target the cancer cells in that tumor, but they seek out other cancer cells even in distant metastases and destroys them. I think they they are planning to begin human trials in lymphoma patients. The researchers believe that the treatment would work for many kinds of cancers. It has a long way to go of course, but they believe it could be a promising immunotherapy-type of treatment. I think the research is taking place in California. Stanford maybe?

This year's increase should have been based on this past year's performance. You worked hard to manage difficult projects. I wouldn't blame you if you left immediately, but I think you aren't built that way. Although your boss deserves to be left in the lurch, you would probably feel guilty for the effect it would have on your coworkers. Do what feels right. What are you plans for retirement? We all know that you aren't one to sit on the porch twiddling your thumbs. Well, today is the third anniversary of my diagnosis. I remember that moment like it was yesterday. The words kept spinning through my head like a bad dream. I thought I would be lucky to make it to Christmas, but here I am three years later. Not only am I still breathing, I am feeling good and enjoying life. I like to think that I appreciate things more now. Many things have happened in my life during those three years, good and bad, in fact very good and very bad. That's what life is like, of course. For me the trick is to survive the bad times any way i can, immerse myself in the good times, and celebrate the best times. So today, I celebrate three years of bonus time. Thank you all for being an important part of my life. You have made a difference. I went for my monthly MO appointment yesterday. Blood counts are low, so I have to go back next week for retest before I can start next cycle of Ibrance. Last month I bragged that my Faslodex shots were painless. Well, this month made up for it. Lol. I have two huge red lumps that will undoubtedly turn into bruises. This only happens with one nurse (Christie for Lynne's benefit). She has only given me the injections twice in 24 cycles, and this happened both times. Of course, I shouldn't complain since it is just a temporary annoyance. It could be a lot worse and is worth it since Faslodex seems to be working. Gotta go have my teeth cleaned. I will catch up here later. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

Lynne, You Mini trip sounds like so much fun. Several years ago, my DH and I were driving home from the mountains, and we saw a bunch of Minis in a parking lot on the side of the road. Maybe it was part of that big group you ride with. This is motorcycle weekend. I am surprised it's not raining. It seems like there has been bad weather for the motorcycle for the past few years. Stephanie was not at the desk when I checked out after my appointment on Monday. I have to go back for repeat labs next Monday (neutropenia here too but platelets and RBC also low). I already have my next appointment, so I won't have to see her. That ride down Mt. Washington scares me. I find myself leaning to one side as if it will keep the car from careening off the road. It would be a long tumble down. The view is beautiful from the top. One time we took my mother-in-law up there on Labor Day. When we got to the top, it was snowing like crazy and the wind was howling. We didn't even have jackets with us. Of course, there was no view anyway.

My DH had one eye done a while ago. The other still seems to be okay. I was amazed how quick the surgery was. He sees really well now. He hadn't realized how much the cataract affected the color and clarity of his sight. Of course they implanted a lense, too, so that helps Has anyone heard from Bigbhome?

I said it aloud to my DH, and surpringly, I started laughing. As I said it, I had flashbacks to all the times my MIL had said, \"Oh, this could be my last Christmas.\" I think she started saying that when she was about 50 years old. Unlike us, she did not have any diagnosed disease or condition that would likely shorten her life. She does have a lot of heart disease in her family, and her mother and two of her sisters passed away at young ages. Anyway, my MIL is still alive today, and she is 99 years old. I have never again said that it could be my last ANYTHING because no one ever knows how long they will live. I guess my back is to the train, too. I have written several poems during the past few years. I finally printed them and gave them to my DH to read. I thought they would give him a written record of how important he is to me and how much I appreciate his support. Instead, it brought tears to his eyes. I feel bad. I realize that I expressed feelings that I have not always shared with him. I know he doesn't want to lose me, and I also know how hard it is to love someone who has a serious illness. This disease really sucks. Hot weather is coming this way for the weekend. We will have 18 people here for our family day tomorrow.

It is bad enough to have MBC and the SEs from treatment, but you have arthritis and tendinitis, too. Ugh! I used to tell my kids that life isn't fair, but this goes way beyond that. If your weather was anything like ours, it was probably really hot out. That doesn't help any because the stores usually have trouble keeping their buildings cool when high temps begin to hit. I tend to get \"hangry\" at times, and that condition rears its ugly head when I go shopping. My DH is convinced that the Snickers commercial was wriiten by someone who had accompanied me on a shopping trip. Now when he sees it starting he suggests a snack break. I always take a bottle of water with me when I go shopping. It helps to keep me hydrated. I have gained weight since my diagnosis, too, and it is so frustrating. So, when I go shopping, I don't feel the effects of arthritis or tendonitis. Instead, I am an overheated, hangry, thirsty woman whose spine mets hurt after standing too long and who is convinced that the people in the stores have changed the sizes on the tags of all the clothes because I can't possibly really need a bigger size now. As you can imagine, I am a joy to shop with. I know the shopping trip was miserable for you, but you should realize that none of it was within your control. You shouldn't be embarrassed since you did nothing wrong. Think of it this way. If anyone noticed, and it probably wasn't noticed by nearly as many people as you imagine, you will probably never see them again anyway, so who cares. People did ask if you were okay, and that is because they were concerned about you. That was not negative attention at all. It was genuine concern. Your husband didn't understand why you were embarrassed because he understands that you did nothing wrong. You did nothing to cause the situation, so he sees no reason for the embarrassment. I am glad he was there and was supportive. I have had my share of meltdowns and crying episodes. We all have. You need to just put it aside and move on. You are normal.

I already have a scan scheduled for September, and I hope it shows improvement. Lynne, I am thinking of you as you have chemo today. I saw Stephanie when I checked out the other day. She was super-nice to me. Maybe she was told to be nice to everyone named Lynne. Do you have scans scheduled yet? Bigbhome, Your husband sure has had big challenges. That's a lot of surgery is a period of just a few months. I know what you mean about being a caregiver. In some ways it is more difficult than being the patient. Make sure that your own health isn't compromised by everything else you are doing. Runor, Are you feeling any better about things? You had so much bottled up inside. Micmel, Has your mouth improved?

Take some food and water and a phone into the chair with you in case you become trapped. Can you imagine the 911call? \"Hello, this is Gracie, and I am being held captive by an overgrown recliner.\" I apologize. That is in poor taste. Apparently deep down I am a mean and evil person. I do know someone who had a lift chair, but I do not know the brand. It was very useful. I think the best plan would be for you to try out several different brands and models because, just like recliners, there are different sizes. You want to get one that is comfortable, apporopriately-sized, easy to handle, with a good warranty. I hope you do well on Abraxane with minimal side effects while knocking out those nasty cancer cells. How often will you receive treatment?

Are you going to have scans or has your MO decided to wait to see how the liver numbers look at your next appointment to see if they are continuing to rise, stabilizing, or going down? Do you still feel good now? When were your tumor markers last checked? (That was a very significant reduction at that time.) I hope that these latest liver numbers turn out to be of no consequence.

He is probably so afraid of the possibility of seeing you sick or, worse yet, of losing you, that he chooses to try to ignore it and refuses to discuss it. Unfortunately, you do not have the luxury of ignoring the reality. It sounds like he would benefit from a family or caregiver support group. I suspect that he is unwilling to go. I wish that I had some advice that would change him, but it sounds like he is unwilling to face things even though it looks like it's been two years since dx. With that in mind, my advice is for you, not for him. Find a good support group in your area. Your MO should be able to help,you find one. Talk about anything you want in that group. Is there anything you need help doing? There are organizations that can help. Again, your MO can point you in the right direction. Are you active in your church, temple, or synagogue? Join a club or group there or talk to your religious leader. He or she give give you some support. Do you have a close friend who knows you have MBC and is willing to listen to you while still treating you as \"normal\"? If you do, have lunch or go shopping with her every couple of weeks. Meet for coffee, or just talk on the phone. Do you have relatives who can come for a visit, maybe for several days at a time? I am sure that others will have better advise. Perhaps they have solved the problem of the husband who detaches himself from MBC. In the meantime, we are here to support you. We will listen to anything you want to say. To everyone who is having treatment or scans this week, I hope they are going well. Micmel, Those TM results are spectacular. WOOHOO! I suspect that your scan results will be just a good! Sadly, I arrived home today. There is no sunshine, no swaying palm trees, no warm ocean waters, no trade winds,no 80 degree weather. Sigh! Hugs and prayers to all from, Lynne ",

When I was diagnosed, I thought I would be gone in six months, but surprise! I am still alive and kicking, and I plan to be here for many more years. Today we had 10 people here for Thanksgiving dinner. Two of my six sons (yes, 6) were here along with two of my daughters-in-law, two of my granddaughters, and my dil's parents. Oh, and there were three dogs and a cat, too. I ate way too much. Ugh! There were some animated discussions during dinner. My dil's father tried to have a little debate about the Civil War with my other dil ( not his daughter). What made it really amusing to me is the fact that my dil has a PhD in history and is a history professor. Her area of concentration is American history. Needless to say, she had facts and knowledge on her side. The other dil's father doesn't like to lose (he is an MIT-educated engineer). When I thought they had had enough, I changed the conversation. Luckily, it was all in good fun, so everyone was still smiling. They left a few minutes ago, and now I have a refrigerator full of leftovers!!! I feel particularly blessed this Thanksgivingbecause my DH had his semi-annual scans on Monday to check for recurrence of kidney cancer. The scans showed no evidence of disease. WOOHOO! Each day is a gift. Enjoy every day. Happy Thanksgiving. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

If the scans do indicate progression, then it is good for you to know that there are still many options available to you. It looks like you have been on Femera, so would your MO start you on Faslodex along with the Ibrance? I have been on that combo since August of last year, and I have found it to be quite tolerable. Let us know what you find out. We are pulling for you. Tanya, Some doctors do not think that tumor markers are a useful tool, and they rely on how a patient feels as well as other blood tests and scans and do not include tumor markers. Although TMs are good indicators for some people, they do not rise or fall with progression and healing for others. My MO tests my TMs every four weeks now along with the CBC and CMP. My MO looks for trends rather than the actual number since, like Leapfrog, my TMs are always high. You should ask your MO for an opinion on TMs Deb, I am glad your MO is being cautious and scheduling scans. Hopefully, the results will be good and you will be able to celebrate. 32 months on your first line of treatment? I am impressed. That is wonderful. When and if the time comes to move on to a new treatment plan, I hope you respond as well or better and for as long or longer. You are already an exceptional responder in my mind.

Nurses should also be aware of the fact that the injection should be done slowly. I did get a bump and bruise when one nurse gave the injections, but that's really the only thing I can complain about. I do massage the areas and walk a bit after the shots. Good luck.

Let someone spoil you for a few days. Mel, Did I tell you that your tree is lovely? It is very pretty. My 3 year old granddaughter put on many of our ornaments this year. As you might imagine, one section of the lower part of the tree is heavily decorated leaving the rest of the tree looking a bit sparsely populated. My DH and I decided to leave it that way since it was so much fun watching her place things so carefully. Her sister, who will be 2 on Christmas Eve, needed help putting the decorations on, but she directed the placement of her share. She wanted each one to hang next to a blue light. Gracie, I hope you aren't sore after today's injections.

No need to apologize though. I want you to enjoy that warm weather for me! Yes, many spouses find it difficult to cope with this disease or with any serious illness. Two years ago my DH was diagnosed with kidney cancer. His case was complex, surgery was long and difficult, and multiple complications were life-threatening and lasted for months. I was frightened, angry, nervous, and sad. I tried to be strong, and I didn't want my DH to see how upset I was. In truth is that I felt that my life was in turmoil. I didn't want to lose the most important person in my life. I had my meltdowns in private so I could be strong for my DH and sons. Many people, like your husband, who are in similar situations find it difficult to face the situation. It is hard to know what to say or do. They feel helpless when all they want to do is make things better. Men, in particular, often think that they should be the strong one, the protector, the fixer. It is a scary place to be when there is no way to fix things. Do you think he would consider a support group for families of cancer patients? I hope he will soon be able to respond in a way that is more supportive. I wish I could tell you how to change things, but it is really up to him to find his way through this with or without some sort of help. Is he willing to talk to you about what he is feeling? Sometimes just talking is a good place to start. Maybe he is unaware of that he is being distant. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

Linda was still driving herself to appointments shortly before her death.

I can't say that I am sorry that I am missing the storm. I am glad that the wind wasn't too bad there. I was worried that a tree would fall on our house while we are away. I watched ABC news tonight, and they showed videos of the waves splashing right over the roof of houses in Scituate, MA. My SIL lives there. Luckily she is not on the ocean. Micmel, stay safe in that horrible storm. Keetmom, How are you doing? Remember that we are all here for you. Tanya, I am enjoying this wonderful weather. It looks like it is going to be around for a while. It is just what I wanted. My DH and I spent time in the pool today. The water temp is 88 degrees. It was great. I laughed when I read that your DS slept through your infusion. Apparently, she wasn't feeling any stress. I just realized that the Oscars are on Sunday. I probably haven't seen any of the movies that have been nominated. It's always fun to see the gowns that people wear. I am sure there will be several political comments. So much has happened during the past year. Gracie, I hope you feel better. You have a slight fever? My MO has the same rule as Micmel's -call if temp gets up to 100.4. Hugs and prayers everyone, Lynne ",

The condo complex where we are staying is a good place to walk, so my DH and I have been walking every day. I have been getting in at least 10,000 steps a day. I hope I continue that when we return home. We have also spent time at the pool each day, so I have done some laps there. Swimming has always been my favorite form of exercise. It has a calming, soothing effect on me. We haven't been to the beach yet other than a quick look. There are red tide warnings around here, and it can cause respiratory irritation. Since I want my lung nodules to show as stable or improved when I rescan next month, I am avoiding any possibly lung irritation. If the nodules have not doubled in size or increased, they will be assumed to be benign and I can stay on Faslodex/Ibrance. We are hoping that the beaches are clear by thursday, and we will go then. I did take a few pictures of Naples Beach. I will try to remember to post one. Tanya, Thank you for this perfect weather. I asked for low 70's to low 80's, and you delivered. I heard that we could get some showers tomorrow, but rain is needed, so I am okay with that. Micmel, MJH, and Lynne, I am sorry that you are expecting that nor'easter tomorrow and Thursday. I wish that it would blow out to see. The ski areas will be happy. Of course, the school kids will like getting another day off, but I am sure they will have to make it up in June. Magda, I am glad that your hoping adventure is going so well. It is so exciting. I can't wait to hear more updates from you. Grannax, I am happy that you spent time with your grandchildren. I am sure it will be nice for them to get settled into their new home. For me, the one downside of being in Florida is that I miss my children and grandchildren. I have received some text messages from three of my older grandchildren and some of my sons and also some phone calls from some of my sons, but it isn't the same as spending time with them. Micmel, Both shoe styles are just beautiful. You were wise to get those kitten heels. Comfort is all-important. No one needs achy feet at a reception. Minnie, I hope that all goes well at your appointment. Sciatica is a painful (very painful) nuisance. Is it getting any better? Mae, Wow, I don't think I have owned that many colors of jeans over my entire lifetime. I am basically a boring person, but I would like to be more adventurous in my wardrobe. I do like the color red, but usually buy red shirts, not red pants. Time for me to branch out. Divine and MJH, There is a botanical garden here in Naples. I am planning to visit it while I am here. In the meantime, I am enjoying the beauty of the trees and flowers around me. I look forward to cleaning up and tending to my gardens at home. Planting has to wait until late May for the most part, but my perennials will start popping through before that. MJH, When will you get your scan results? Do you have to wait until you see your MO or are they posted to the patient portal ahead of that's? You probably already told us. Leapfrog, I will definitely read your blog this evening. Lynne, is this chemo week? I hope you are feeling okay. I also hope that the snow melts quickly. Keetmom, I hope you are feeling well. I continue to keep you in my thoughts and prayers. Hi to anyone I missed. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne   ",

I also take my trusty little notebook with me with a list of questions. If I don't have that list, i will forget to ask somethings. I know my MO well enough to tell him if I need clarification or more information about but what he says. That is not to say that I always do that, but he is never surprised when I have questions or comments. Micmel's idea is also a good one. You can call and talk to a nurse navigator, nurse, or PA. They should be willing to provide you with the information you want. My DH and I went to the botanical gardens here in Naples, FL yesterday. It was a perfect day. We walked and walked and walked. I can't wait to start digging in my garden this spring. Have a good weekend, everyone. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

Back in the day, there were many hard feelings between the Scots and the English. Lots of history there - land disputes, ruler disputes, wars. Apparently some Scotsmen in my grandfathers' generation still held onto some of that bitterness. Luckily, it passed eventually.

Maybe your MO feels that scans aren't needed too often because you are doing so well. Are your mets in bones only? My MO scanned less frequently when I had bone-only mets and was stable. He said that he would do a scan sooner if I became symptomatic or my blood tests showed anything suspicious. I plan to be around for a long time and don't enjoy scans or exposure to radiation more often than necessary, so I was okay with that plan. Once the metsspread to my liver, I had scans more frequently. I am hoping that I can go back to every six months soon. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne  ",

If you want to get away from the activity on the sand but still have a great view of the beach, go to the beach or the walking path in front of it, look back at the Aulani resort buildings and find Amu Amu (restaurant). There are several rows of lounge chairs in front of Amu Amu. My favorite place to sit was the second row from the bottom, the first two chairs on the right as you are looking towards the resort. During the times that we were there, we had shade from the umbrella and/or palm trees most of the day. The sign on the gate says you need to use your resort key to get up there, but that is not true. The gate is only locked at night. One other thing. There are two places to get your towels and bracelets for pool and beach. The one closest to the building is easy to find, but sometimes the line is long in the morning. It moves fairly quickly, but if you get tired of waiting, there is another one past the big pool, to the right, down a few stairs. It usually has a shorter line and has one line exclusively for DVD members. Your DS or DIL will have to show a DVC member card in addition to the room key to use that line. That line was always very short or non-existent when we were there, but I have never been in May, so who knows. I am sure you will have a wonderful time. Don't forget to post pictures. Oh, the shops and restaurants across the street are easy to walk to. Go out the driveway, turn left, cross at the lights, and there you are. Several restaurants and shops there. Aloha!

I am glad that things are getting back to a more manageable level. What can I say about family? They are great to have around as long as they behave themselves. They try really hard to help sometimes, but let face it they either go overboard or they don't do enough. I know that they cannot possibly know how we feel or what we want, but treating us like invalids is not the answer. And talking about us like we either aren't there or are two years old, well ugh! When I told my children, who were all adults, about my MBC diagnosis, I gave them each a list of \"Mom's Rules.\" It was a short list, but made it clear what I wanted and did not want from them. It included a note that they were not to treat me like an invalid. It ended with a statement saying that although they could ask me as many questions they wanted anytime at all, they were not allowed to challenge my decisions. I said that that If they tried, I would always win. None of the were surprised that I gave them a list of rules, and each has adhered to them. Do you think it would help if you sat down your family members and told them how they are making you feel? Maybe you can give them some suggestions of things they could do that actually WOULD be helpful. Instead of trying to do everything for you, maybe you would like them to sit and talk or go to the park or look at old pictures or something else. Maybe they could cook a meal or do some chore you really hate to do like clean a closet or clean the bathroom or do grocery shopping. They probably mean well but really don't know what to do. I would also make it clear that talking about you is not acceptable. If you want your husband to know about how you are and what you are doing, you are capable of telling him. I really don't' think you would be hurting their feelings. They might be glad to have suggestions. Friends and acquaintances, of course, are a different story. I have learned that some people know how to act, and others seem to develop numb-brain and come out with really stupid remarks. I have only told a few friends about my MBC. When the time comes that my treatment causes hair loss, things will be different. I have read your posts on other threads, and I think you are a strong person. You will decide whether you will don a wig or a scarf or just show off your bald head. No matter what you decide, you will still be the same person you are. If someone gives you an unwanted comment or that horrible sad puppy look, stand tall and have a quick retort ready for them. It could be something amusing or serious, that is your call, but it should be something that will cut them off. Maybe, \"Yes, I am on chemo, and doing fine, thank you.\" Or \"Oh, do you like my new do?\" Or, \"Well, I am still here and I am living my life to the fullest.\" I am sure others here will have better ideas. It will be great to have your sons around for the summer. It sounds like they have made good choices for their summer breaks. Enjoy your cooking classes, days out and duvet days. I look forward to hearing about them. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne  ",

They are adults, and it is their responsibility to earn money to pay for a place of their own. Let them turn to his family, his friends, or his church for help, if need be. You need to let them figure it out without your help. If they both need to have two jobs, so be it. They are not ten year olds. They are adults. It is time for them to know what real life is like. My DH and I have worked hard for what we have, and I say that with fierce pride, not resentment. My children work hard, too. They appreciate what they have, and those who have children are showing them that actions have rewards or consequences. Have I ever helped them out when they needed it? Of course, but i wouldn't help any of them who treated my DH and me the way you have been treated. Earning one's own way in life can be hard at times, but it is worth it. Sometimes we have to struggle in order to enjoy the rewards. If we treat people with cruelty and disrespect, we should expect to suffer the consequences. This is particularly true in this case since you and your DH have done so much for two people who turned on you. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

If we could go through life getting only what we deserve, the world would be a much different place. Your DH did not marry you to be with you only for the rainbows and sunshine. He promised to be with you during the bad times as well as the good. Life is life. Love is love. He loves you, and I am sure he wants to carry you through all this bitterness, disappointment, and chaos. You did not plan this, and he understands that. I am sure that you daughter's behavior hurts your DH as much as it hurtsyou. Why? Because he loves your daughter. She has turned her back on him as well as you. This ugliness is not the only experience he has with you and your daughter. He also has lots of good experiences and memories of joining you in the family. He is not an outsider looking in, he is smack dab in the middle standing right next to you. He has treated your daughter as his own. When you two married, you became one big family with all the joys, responsibilities, and pain that came with it. You both took on added responsibilties, expanded roles, and unknown adventures, happy times, and perilous times. Life has no guarantees, Micmel. Every one of us has experienced tragedies, sad times, and scary events. We cannot avoid them, and somehow we have survived them. I know it doesn't feel that way, but you will survive this, too. Your relationship with your daughter will never be the same, but she is not your entire life. Let her move on and live her own life. Take the opportunity to look to the other things in your life. You have others whom you love, your DH, your DS, your DSS. Build on those relationship. Believe me, once your daughter and son-in-law move, you will feel the tension level in your life and in your home decrease dramatically. You have been suffering through their relationship and attitudes for too long. You and your DH deserve peace. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

WOOHOO! Micmel, I did hear the news about the soccer team in Thailand. Tears starting flowing when I heard that they were found alive. It is truly a miracle. So many things had to happen to allow them to be found alive. The boys' coach must be a special person to remain strong in order to keep those boys alive, calm, and hopeful. Many rescuers, planners, and people with knowledge of the area had to put their heads together to find the boys. Everyone had to keep going without giving up hope. The water level had to stop rising before it completely filled the cave. Enough air had to be available to sustain life. So many things had to fall into place. I can only imagine the emotional roller coaster that their families have gone through. I am praying that everyone gets out safely and recovers. It is still incredibly hot here, as Lynne mentioned earlier. The temperature in my pool reached 80 degrees, and I have been enjoying it. I hope everyone is cool, dry, and safe. So what's going on with the recent string of progression here? Time for it to stop! I think Mae called a halt to it a while ago, didn't she? I hope and pray that everyone's treatments start working or continue to be effective, and we have a long spell of good news for all of us. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne",

There is no way that I will catch up on this thread, so if I don't address you here, it is not intentional. Gracie, I have been thinking of you all day, but I had no internet in the mountains. Even my phone did not get a reliable signal. Did you have your first infusion of Abraxane today? How are you feeling? Did the nurses tell you what to expect for SEs and when they are likely to begin? Were you given medication to counteract some of the SEs? I hope things went smoothly and you are feeling okay. Mae, I am not sure how I would react to a singing surgeon. I did chuckle at the song choice of the surgeon in the linked article. It was so appropriate! Lynne, Are you able to eat during hell week? Do you have to stick to certain foods that are gentle to your system? Do other foods make things worse? I hope your week isn't too bad this time. Tanya, Your pictures are beautiful, as always. You have a very tall cousin in Washington, DC. It appears that your mom did not inherit those genes. You travel to some beautiful places. I am sure that I will never see Morocco, so it is a real treat to see your photos. I hope the antibiotic is doing its job so you feel better soon. Holmes, it is nice to hear from you. How are you doing? I don't remember hearing about your dh's kidney issue. What happened? How long ago was that? Is he okay? Blueshine, It is wonderful that your house sold so quickly. I hope you find a condo soon. I don't envy you for the packing and unpacking you have ahead of you. How long were you in your current home? Divine, We do all have ups and downs. I try to appreciate the good times, but sometimes it is easy to take them for granted. Luckily, for me anyway, there are many more good times than bad. At least it feels that way. Daniel, No AC? Whoa, I would have been one cranky woman if I had gone through last week's heat wave with no AC. Micmel, I hope feel better tomorrow so you can enjoy the day. Minnie, I have a journal that I started when I was diagnosed three years ago. I wrote in it often during the first several months, but I don't make updates often lately. I did notice that the content and purpose seemed to shift over time. It started as a place to document my feelings and fears about MBC, but it morphed over time. After a while I started entering passages that were really thoughts for and about my DH. I wanted to give him a written account of my feelings for him, things I remember most about our lives together, concerns I have about his future when I am gone, etc. I also started writing more poems, but I already showed most of them to him as I mention a while ago. Writing has always helped me work through my feelings. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

I hope your port surgery goes well. I am lifting you up in prayer. Lynne, I lost a very long post. I had asked if you were nearing the end of your hell week. I am happy to see that you are. It must be disappointing to eat a sub without being able to taste it. I hope it wasn't a Nadeau's steak and cheese. Grannax, I am glad that your DD is feeling better since her valve adjustment. I hold she continues to improve. It is too bad that your son has to wait so long to retake his exam. At least he has a job that he enjoys. Divine, Do you know how you broke the bone in your foot? Will you need to wear a cast after surgery? Are you using crutches now to keep your weight off your foot? Is your surgery scheduled for the 20th? Chicagoan, I don't worry about what I look like in a bathing suit. I know I will probably never see any of the other beach goers again. My parents used to tell me that our differences and even our perceived imperfections are characteristics that make each of us unique. Think how boring this world would be if we were all alike and perfect. Bigbhome, I am sorry that Xeloda is causing you so much discomfort. Fatigue and nausea are a difficult combination. I hope the reduced dose helps to alleviate the SEs. I am a lurker on the Xeloda thread, and I have noticed that many people have required dose reduction. It makes me wonder why some doctors prescribe such high doses when lower doses are just as effective. And now to you, Micmel, I was happy to read that you and your daughter have begun to repair, restore, and build upon your relationship. The house thing is just an example of how young adults think. She will continue to mature and understand the realities of life. In the meantime, enjoy each other. In an earlier post, you seemed very down. I know I have talked to you about this before, here and in a PM. I will reach out to you here one more time, then I will shut up. If you don't want to read my worlds, feel free to skip the rest of my post. To my untrained mind, you seem depressed. I know this is not something you chose for yourself. I know you have many riches to be happy about, but you are unable to enjoy them. You suffer from severe fatigue, lack of appetite, and loss of energy. These could be effects of your medication. They could also be from depression. Of course, the depression itself could be a SE of medication. I wish that some wonderful, kind, skilled doctor would meet with you and review every one of those 18 or 19 pills you take every day. I wish he/she would take the time to listen to every one of the symptoms that haunt you daily. I wish that she/he would then come up with a plan to fix everything . I wish that he/she would continue to monitor you to confirm improvement. I wish you could then enjoy life again. Unfortunately, I feel powerless and cannot help. One other thing you mentioned in that post is that you feel like you are searching for an inner peace or comfort. Some people find it in their faith, but that isn't the case for you. Maybe you can find that inner peace outside of yourself rather than inside. Maybe it sounds crazy, but have you thought of volunteering for a good cause? It is just a thought and may not be for you at all, but I am mentioning it anyway. Some require as little as a couple hours a week. Maybe by helping others you can help yourself. Examples: Red Criss takes all sorts of volunteers to serve snacks, do administrative work, schedule blood drives, plan disaster kits; Meals on Wheels needs driver; nursing homes need people to play cards, board games bingo or just talk to patients; schools need people to help in the library, the office, and the classrooms; food banks need people to sort and inventory food; hospitals need help in gift shop, data entry, general office duties, distributing newspapers, Wild life organizations need people to observe wildlife, trees, and plants in community; clothes pantries need people to sort donated clothing; museums need people to guide visitors and answer questions. There is no end to opportunities. Okay, I am done. I picked the first ripe tomato from my garden today. To make it even better, the squirrels and chipmonks hadn't taken any bites from it. Here is a picture. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne     ",

I don't know how often you would need to travel to Boston, and that might be deterrent, of course. I think that the short chemo break will be good for you. I know you don't want to wait too long to restart treatment, but with all that your body as been through during the past few years, a few weeks without chemo might be a welcome relief for you.

Mine is nothing compared to his. I will only be in the hospital for 1 to 2 nights thanks to robotic-assisted laparoscopic procedures. Amy, I feel the same way you do about childhood cancers. I have a friend whose daughter had leukemia years ago. It was back in the days when chemo was much more toxic than it is today. I remember how difficult it was for my friend to see her daughter so sick while going through all her treatments and to wonder if she would even survive. Her daughter was only 4 years old at the time. Today she is a healthy adult. Like you, I am grateful for the fact that I have a good QOL right now. I, too am one of the lucky ones.

I still hold out hope that KD rebounds, grows stronger, and has more time with you. I worry about both of you. You selflessly care for KD, and of course that is the right thing for you to do because you love her so much. I do fear that you might neglect your own health while you care for KD. Please don't let that happen. I have been in the role of caregiver as well as patient. My personal experience is that the caregiver role can be much more difficult. It is emotionally challenging to see the love of your life suffer. It is easy to forget to eat and sleep. Take care of yourself. We are here to support you. I am lifting you and KD up in prayer. May God's loving arms surround you both and give you strength and comfort. LindaE, I am sorry that your first taxol treatment hit you so hard. I hope that you rebound quickly and that your next Taxol treatments are easier for you. As always, you remain in my heartand prayers. Hugs from,Lynne",

You are a beautiful soul, and you don't deserve this. No one does. The second thing I want to discuss is your MO. You were suffering with acsites for way too long before your MO recognized it or even showed concern for your symptoms. Then it was first diagnosed by a dr in the ER. In my opinion, she has not been giving you the attention or support you need and deserve. She also presented her opinion in a very ugly inappropriate way. Is there an NCI designated center you can go to for a second opinion? What type of resources are offered at the local center? Are there trials? Will they be willing to offer you alternatives to your current MO's recommendations? Last, I want to say that I truly hope that you respond quickly to whatever treatment you decide upon. Big guns? I would tend to go with them for now, too. It would be good to knock those buggers down as soon as possible.

I think a care package would be a welcome gift. As far as being there to help is concerned, do you mean being there to support your friend or her mother? What type of help are you considering? I ask because I think it might be particularly stressful for you to watch the declining health of your friend's mother. Even though you are receiving life-prolonging treatment, and she is not, when you see the changes in her, will you be able to keep your mind from going into those dark places where some of us occasionally find ourselves? You shouldn't take on something that will make things harder for you. Your friend will certainly need support. You could make yourself available to listen when she needs someone to talk to. If you are going to the store, you could call to ask if she needs anything there. If she is having a bad week, and you feel up to it, you could take her dinner. Of course, I have many questions. Why is her mother forgoing treatment? I have to admit that when I was diagnosed I thought that I would refuse treatment, but then I did research and learned that my QOL could be pretty darn good. Is she aware of the fact that treatment for MBC is usually not as harsh as for early stage? Does she know that the published statistics are not up-to-date and that treatments have improved and choices have increased? You have probably already talked to your friend about all this, but I still had to ask. Of course, maybe your friend's mother is 110 years old and figures what the heck! Big hugs and prayers to you, your friend, and her mom. Lynne",

I naively assumed that it was standard practice in most European countries. I do understand that the doctor you met with is only delivering the message that was agreed upon by the entire group of physicians. Although he did not deliver the message with tact or compassion, at least you know that the decision wasn't made in a vacuum. I have not yet received Xeloda or taxol, but it is my understanding that taxol is a stronger drug that can attack cancer cells more quickly than Xeloda. That, I am sure, is an oversimplification, but there are people on these boards who have taxol to get the cancer cells under control, then move on to Xeloda or some other treatment. There are others for whom Xeloda has failed, and they move on to taxol. What I am trying to say is that taxol could make sense for you right now since you saw significant progression in a relatively short period of time. Many people tolerate taxol well. I must say that I am surprised that you were told that there are more treatments available for people with hormone negative tumors. I believe that is not true. Women who are triple negative do not have as many options. Do you have a copy of Bestbird's free guide to MBC? It is a comprehensive guide that she compiled, and it describes available treatments for different types of MBC and their side effects. Now, on to the issue of transportation. If the taxi service mentioned by Blume is not available in Denmark, I wonder if there are any volunteer organizations that provide transportation services to cancer patients' appointments for treatment. There are such organizations here in the U.S., and volunteers do provide rides to patients who cannot drive themselves. Your cancer center should be aware of any such services or organizations available in Denmark. If not, perhaps you can reach out to a church organization or a cancer society in your country. I hate to think that you would be unable to receive treatment simply because you have no transportation. I wish I could fly to Denmark and help you through this difficult maze of obstacles facing you. I feel helpless here. I obviously have taken for granted all the services and referrals available at my cancer center. I am praying that you find solutions to all the issues facing you. Hugs and prayers, Lynne ",

Most never end up being hospitalized. I am sure that others here will confirm that. There are few, if any, who would say that the treatment was not worth doing. The chemotherapy given to women with Stage IV bc is not as strong as chemo given to people with lower stages. Some people do suffer with nausea and/or vomiting, but it can usually be controlled by medication. It is possible to maintain a good quality of life. There is a thread about taxol where you can find information and ask questions of people who are receiving that treatment. The link is: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topics/790290 I hope these links work. It concerns me that you have treatments that have the potential of extending your life for quite a while and yet it seems difficult for you to get to the treatment center to receive it. I don't want you to give up. I believe that taxol, although no picnic, is not nearly as bad as the doctor led you to believe.

I also understand why you are reluctant to begin chemo. You have been kind to your body -no alcohol, no smoking, healthy diet, regular exercise. Now you are thinking of putting toxic chemicals in your body. Look at it this way, your body has been treated well. You have done everything right. Now, because of your healthy lifestyle, your body is in the best possible condition to withstand the toxic effects of the treatment and let the meds kill those cancer cells. If the treatment becomes too difficult for you, your doctors might be able to lower the dose so the side effects are less severe. If it is too difficult for you to tolerate, you can stop the treatment and ask if there is an alternative. It is your decision to continue or stop. Hugs and prayers, Lynne ",

The list is full of trials for Triple negative patients. Several years ago, researchers began the same type of push for HER2+ BC. It was identified as an aggressive type of bc with few treatment options. Now, if you look at the people on these boards who are NED, you will see it has an abundance of people who are HER2+. Some of those very same people have remained NED even after coming off treatment. That was unheard of several years ago. Is it a miracle? No, it is the positive result of increased research and testing to treat a population of MBC'ers who had been difficult to treat and ostensibly left behind in the quest for new treatments. Now the focus is turning to people with triple negative disease. New treatments, testing, and trials show great promise for that population of patients. People are being successfully treated, and lives have been extended. More treatments are coming as different drugs are testing in combination with immunotherapy. There is hope. Please do as Z suggested and contact the Cancer Research Institute to find out about clinical trials that would be appropriate for you. Talk to your MO about future options as well.

I know that there have been many times in the past when I used the word amazing to describe Babs, so I will start there. She truly was an amazing women for many reasons- her ability to continue to live her life on her terms, determined to experience every joyful moment and event while ignoring or adapting to the setbacks or limitations of mbc, her love for her family: her husband, her daughter, her son, and her grandson and granddaughters, her continued caring and supportive posts to others here, celebrating our good news and helping us through bad news. Over the past several years Babs has shared her adventures and life stories with us. We experienced her daughter\u2019s wedding and pregnancy as well as the birth of Bab\u2019s first grandson. We heard about her travels and holiday celebrations. She became an important part of our mbc family and eagerly awaited her next adventure. Through it all, the strongest message I heard throughout her posts was the unconditional love and concern for her precious family. I was happy to read that she was able to spend more time with her beautiful granddaughters recently. I know all her grandchildren were precious to her. I am lifting her family up in prayer and wishing them comfort and peace during this difficult time. Babs was a special person and will be missed. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

There is a Weekly Taxol for stage IV thread It is not very active, but I did find support there as I began taxol.Here is the link. https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topics/790290?page=1 I did get a port before I began taxol. I was told that my veins were tiny, so the port was a must. I find it convenient since it is used for blood draws as well as infusions. I was given two prescriptions for nausea and vomiting, but I have not needed to take them. I have lost the hair on my head. My eyebrows are now looking thin, and I haven\u2019t had to shave my legs in four weeks. I know most people are very upset about their hair loss, but I have accepted it as a good trade off if this chemo helps slow down mbc. I did buy a wig and several scarves. Many people hate their wigs, but I like mine. I don\u2019t wear it very day. I am given premeds before taxol infusion, a Pepcid and Benadryl pills and decacadron infusion. Their purpose is to prevent an allergic reaction. After those premeds, I have to wait 30 minutes before they can begin the taxol infusion. Taxol only takes an hour. I have to admit that I tend to fall asleep on the couch when I get home. My nap is thanks to the Benadryl,I am sure. I was told that the steroid (decadron) would keep me awake on that first night, give me an enormous charge of energy the next morning, followed by a big crash that afternoon. I have not experienced a my of that, but I know others have. I was hesitant about taking IV chemo, but I have been pleasantly surprised. My white counts dropped the first several weeks, but they have leveled off. My red counts have been dropping, but that seems to have stabilized this week. If they drop too low, I will skip a week of treatment. That is very common. My MO is most concerned about neuropathy and told me to report any signs of it right away. It can become permanent and affect functioning, so we would skip a week or stop treatment depending on severity. So far, I have had no symptoms of it. Some people ice their hands and feet during the infusion because it has been shown to help prevent neuropathy.Let me know if you have any questions. I am no authority, but I am willing to give you any information I can. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

I hope you are feeling okay. Micmel, Are you feeling better? Chelle, How is your DH doing? I don't understand why the police department is not stepping right up to pay his medical expenses. Even if the think that the person who caused the injuries is responsible for paying, I would expect the department to pay then go after the other guy or his insurance company for reimbursement. You and your DH should not have everything hanging over your heads. You have been through enough. I am sorry that you have to be concerned with lawsuits and all that. I pray for your dh's continued recovery. It is interesting that so many of us are awake in the middle of the night. My DH tells me that I worry too much and do too much thinking in the middle of the night. He could be right. I keep my iPad on the nightstand, set for night-reading. I seem to do most of my reading at 2 or 3 a.m. It helps me relax and get back to sleep. I also write sometimes, just random thoughts or things I would like my DH to read when I am gone. I reread some of my poems the other day. Wow, many of them are quite dark and depressing. I was surprised by my own words because I am a pretty optimistic person who tries to think and act positively. Maybe by putting all my dark thoughts into my writings, my mind is better able to face things head on without bringing everyone down. Who knows! Enjoy your weekend everyone.

You have trouble sleeping, you worry about your scans and your future, you are tired all the time, you have pain. You have mentioned that you take many medications, and you don't like having to do that. Have you considered seeing a palliative care specialist? Palliative care doctors help treat people with chronic or serious illnesses and aim to improve QOL. It is NOT like hospice at all. A palliative care specialist can be seen very early in an illness or anytime along the way. They can review all your medications and might recommend adjustments to better manage pain, anxiety, and sleep patterns, for example. This would be done in consultation with your MO. Most cancer centers either have a palliative care specialist on site or can refer patients to one. It's just a thought. Maybe you can ask your mo. I worry about you and want you to enjoy life more. Of course, you might already see such a specialist. Btw, you can just tell me to mind my own business! Chelle, yes, you do have a tough week ahead. I hope at the end of it, you can still tell us that you are NEAD. Good luck to everyone who is having scans this week. My thoughts and prayers are with you. Hugs from, Lynne ",

I am looking forward to it. Micmel, That oral contrast is awful, isn't it. I used to have my scans at a facility that gave contrast that was added to bottled water. It was pretty much tasteless. I picked up two bottles of it the day before my scans and took them at home before my appointment. They didn't bother me. Now I have those nasty thick drinks that they have the nerve to calls smoothies. Ha! I suppose they are given for a reason, and I try to keep that in mind. They serve a good purpose. I hope you have your scan results soon and you join the NED club with Chelle. As far as Ibrance is concerned, I have been lucky.

I have to squeeze grocery shopping in there, too.Wednesday, of course, I will be baking for Thanksgiving.

It is always so special to get together like that. I am glad that you were feeling well during the trip. I must confess that you were right - the relationships by marriages are a bit confusing. Lol. As long as you can keep them straight, that is all that matters. Mel, The picture of you and the puppy is really nice. Of course, the puppie's head is about twice the size of yours. He is ONE BIG PUPPY! Although you cannot see it yourself, you are still a beautiful woman. You might look different than you did once, but our looks are constantly changing throughout our lives. You changed more dramatically than you had anticipated, and not as you wanted, but the results are still quite wonderful. Do not be so hard on yourself. I see you with an unbiased eye, and I see beauty there. No1, Have you had a liver biopsy before or will Thursday's be the first one? How long does it take to get results? Are they checking to see if the tumor still has the same characteristics as in the past or are you going to have testing such as Foundation One?

Minnie, Welcome to the thread. Gracie, I am happy to hear that your progression is still confined to bone. I think you will find Faslodex and Ibrance to be a relatively easy combo. I have heard that Femera has more SEs than Faslodex. If you haven't already done so, please go to the Faslodex thread and read the recommendations before you get injections. They seem to prevent soreness from the shots. For example, make sure the injections are done slowly and that the syringes are warmed before the injections are given. I have had very few issues with Faslodex and Ibrance other than low blood counts. My life remains pretty normal. I know I have missed people, but this post has grown into a book. Hugs and prayers to everyone from, Lynne ",

It can make us feel helpless as parents. You and your daughter have much to be proud of and celebrate. Lynne, I hope the next week is better than most of your post-chemo weeks have been. I am not enjoying this cold snap any more than you are. Hugs and prayers to all from, Lynne (the other one)",

My sister remained good friends with her first husband even after they had both remarried. They were definitely the exception. Of course they lived an ocean apart, he in Canada and she in France, so that might have helped. LOL. Chelle, You are correct. Scarlett's birth was definitely a bright spot during a very scary time. You know what it was like because you have experienced those frightening moments, too. I hope things fall into place for you so you and your family can enjoy many happy times. Here are a few more pictures, one more of Scarlett who doesn't like to smile for the camera, one of her three year old sister, and the other of their 12 year old brother.     ",

That $2 taxi drive is quite a deal as well as a convenience. I have never heard of anything like that. Grannax, belated happy birthday. I am sorry that I am late with that wish. Christmas Day and New Years Day? That is very special. This must be a bittersweet day for you. I know you miss your husband, and I am glad that you will have family there to share the day with you. You must have wonderful memories that fill your heart and mind today. I will be thinking about you. I hope your DS's offer on the house is accepted. Is the house anywhere near you? Taking on a renovation is challenging but well worth it. I hope to hear good news about your scans on the 11th. I will have scans on Friday (weather permitting). Micmel, Take care of that cold. Drink lots of liquids and stay inside where it is warm. It is still very cold here today. I am tired of this already. We might have a heat wave on Wednesday, way up to the 20s before a potential snow storm hits. Then it is back to this frigid weather. I know most of the country is suffering from this extreme weather, too. Time for a January thaw. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

How are you doing? Mel, You are probably already on the road by now. I am sure that the pride, love and happiness you feel for your DSS will help you through this day, and you will be magnificent. Your DSS has accomplished something that is incredibly challenging. Just enjoy this special day. Chelle, The job at the airport sounds like it could be a good fit for your DH. What do you think? Will you be okay with it? I am sure you feel protective of him, and for good reason. If this sounds promising to both of you, then I hope it works out. You both deserve it. My scans went well yesterday. I can call for results early next week. My thought is that if I don't get a call from my MO before I call him, it will be good news. If I get a call from MO on Monday morning, maybe I just won't answer the phone. LOL. I am not really nervous. I am had scans this week because my TMs have been climbing for the past three months, but I feel great, and my liver numbers couldn't be better. The TMs could just be a fluky thing. I am prepared for anything, but I have to admit that I am not ready to change treatment plans. I have had very few SEs while on Faslodex and Ibrance for the past year and a half. I know that the past 2 1/2 years have been a gift, and I will continue to enjoy life as long as I can. Minnie, Yes, freezing it is. (That sounds like Yoda talk. Hmmm.) I went out this morning, and when I returned, I told my DH that I will not leave the house again until spring. I am dreaming of my gardens that are buried somewhere under all the snow. I refill my bird feeder every morning because I feel sorry for all those birds. The parade to eat is continuous from dusk to dawn. Lynnwood, Do you think changing to a different AI would help relieve your aches and pains? Or maybe a different brand of the same AI? I have even read on some threads that changing brands of the same AI can help because different inactive ingredients can affect people differently. The new year can be emotional for all of us. I wish that were not true, but it seems to be a time for reflection. MJH, we got about a foot of snow here, too. That white fluffy stuff looks really nice, doesn't it? Well, looks can be so deceiving. I have had enough of this weather. Btw, I own long undies from LL Bean, but not the silk ones. If this weather keeps visiting us, I will order some. I did hear that it is supposed to be considerably warmer by Thursday. Do you think they are just teasing us with that forecasts? My son and daughter-in-law have been in Florida for the past two weeks. It was nice and warm at first, but not so much now. Right now they are at WDW running the Dopey Challenge. It is aptly named, I think, since participants run a 5k on Thursday, 10k on Friday, 1/2 marathon on Saturday, and marathon on Sunday. They have to be nuts! They run Dinsey races several times a year. Anyway, the races start really early in the morning, so I am sure they bundle up this year. Lynne, Were you able to have your chemo yesterday? It was mighty cold here when I left my house at 7:00 am. I thought of you as we drove over the Bedford line into Manchester. If you did have chemo I hope your hell week is milder than in the past. Stay warm. Enjoy your weekend everyone.

Tanya, What does molokhia taste like? Is it sweet? Bitter? Salty? Is there any other vegetable with a similar taste? When you make it with rice, do you serve it mixed with the rice or on the side Do you add the garlic, chicken broth, and tomato as your friend does? I have never noticed it in the store, but I am going to look for it. Minnie, Your oncologist has a patient having her 67th treatment and you just had your 19th? That is encouraging, isn't it? I hope you find the treatment to be successful for at least that long. You will be having a scan in just a few week? When was your last one? Have a good night everyone. For those of you who are sick or in pain or recovering from a car accident, rest up and get well soon. For everyone else, stay away from those flu germs, stay healthy and safe.

I must be completely honest and tell you that I will be complaining about Summer's heat, too. I guess I just like to complain. Bigbhome, Your posting has me worried. First you - are any additional tests planned? Are there any medication that you take that could be contributing to the way you feel? There has to be some explanation. Will you get a second opinion? Would your PCP be more likely to investigate non-cancer reasons for your symptoms? Sometimes MOs (and we mbc'ers) assume that everything is due to cancer, but it could be completely unrelated. It might be something that requires different blood tests or at the very least a different perspective. I am sure the stress in your life isn't helping. Now your DH - You said that your lives will be forever changed by the accident. My heart stopped when I read that, it sounds so dire and scary. I know that you don't want to reveal info here, but I do hope that things improve. I hope you don't mind, but I have said a special prayer for both of you. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne",

I am determined not to let cancer control my life, and sometimes things on the boards can become overwhelming. At any rate, I am fine, and so is my DH. Lots of things going on in my family, so we have been busy with that. I also decided to do a deep top-to-bottom cleaning of my house. That led to painting the family room, redecorating guest room, rearranging things in kitchen cabinets and pantry, and on and on. You know how it is when things get started. Oh, and then I helped shovel the snow last week, too. Somehow it is my week for Ibrance break already, and Monday will be time for MO appt, Faslodex shots, and blood tests again. Where did the time go? I suspect that my platelets are low because I have bruises on my hands and arms, but that is par for the course. I have a lot to catch up on. You have all had so much going on. I will check in tomorrow for a longer post. Right now I have to pull my grandson away from the tv once Shaun White finishes his last run on the half pipe. (My grandson spent the afternoon and evening with us and is spending the night here. He will leave for school after breakfast tomorrow. We thoroughly enjoy having him here, and loved the fact that he asked his mom if he could spend the time with us. He is a very sweet 13 year old.) oh good, White won the gold. Have a good night.

You are strength. 2. Caring - You care for your family and many people on these discussion boards. You feel the pain of progression of people here as well as the grief of the losses. You worry about your DH and your children. You are caring person. 3. Supportive - You do not hesitate to step in to support your DH when he is worried or feeling down or trying to sell his house, etc. You support you children in every possible way, going to your stepsons Eagle Scout ceremony, helping your DD with wedding plans, helping your son when he needs you. You also support people here when they need a few kind words or a joke or good thoughts. You support everyone. It's time to support yourself, too. 4. Friendly - You reach out to people here, extending your virtual hand in friendship. You want everyone to feel comfortable. You are a friend to many. 5. Funny - You know how to laugh and how to make others laugh. You know when it is appropriate to make jokes and when it is necessary to be serious. You make people laugh. 6. Complex - You have many sides to you. Your life experiences include some painful times as well as some good times. Both helped shape your character and made you the person you are today. You are filled with delicious complexity. 7. Organized - You keep things moving forward even when your DH is not at home. Just look at how quickly you organized everything for your dh's wedding. It made my head spin. You are super organized. 8. Giving - You give of yourself every day - your heart, your hand, your thoughts. You have a giving spirit. I hope you see all that when you look in the mirror. If not, don't be so hard on yourself. Stand up tall, take a deep breath, put on your glasses, and look again. Have a good night.

My scans are more-or-less stable. My TMs are continuing to climb. I liked your description of the Maine snorkeling experience. We always say that we go as far into the water as we can before our feet become numb. Mae, Your pictures are beautiful, as always. You always face life head on, and I love that. I hope your knee is getting better. Micmel, Have you recovered from your fall? It is time to wrap yourself in bubble wrap for your own protection. Runor, You are welcome to drop in and sit at my table any time you want to. I am always open to a good conversation. Bigbhome, How are you and your DH? You have had more than your share of challenges lately. It is time for your luck to change - time for something good to happen to both of you. I sense that you are finding strength from each other, and that is somehow helping you get through all this. You are in my prayers. Hugs and prayers to everyone from, Lynne   ",

It seems like a good sign that your Onc said that your lungs are clear and your blood work looks good. My DH had high potassium during one blood test, and I was surprised to learn some of the foods that are high in potassium. I knew about bananas, but oranges and potatoes were a surprise.

I was hoping that things in your life would ease up a bit for you so you could just concentrate on your dh's surgery. Life seems to have other plans. I am sorry things are so complicated. Right now, I want to talk about you. I know, I know, you have other things to think about and you are pushing your own needs aside, but just listen for a few minutes. Humor me. I am concerned that you did not take your Ibrance yesterday or today. I hope that you reconsiderthat decision. Here is my reason. Yes, you have had progression, but right now it is just in your bones. What if ibrance and the anti-hormonal therapy are preventing your mets from spreading to other parts of your body? Maybe they are keeping the mets out of your liver or lungs. Treatments can do that. Ibrance and Faslodex have wiped out evidence of cancer in my breast, chest wall, and liver, but my bone mets have not improved. Please don't take that chance of risking further progression that you might be able to prevent. You ask yourself what is the point of taking Ibrance. I can give you several reasons. 1. You need to stay as healthy as possible so you can help your DH during his recovery period. 2. Your DH would be devasted to learn that you took such a risk because of his condition. 3. Your DH wants you to stay around as long as possible. 4. We care about you and want you here on these boards. You are a thoughtful, supportive, valued friend to us. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

Enjoy every moment of the commencement and celebrations. What is he planning to do now that he has graduated? Will he be starting his career or going to graduate school? The world is a much different place than it was when I finished school. There are so many different paths to take now - more opportunities but also more competition. I don't know what direction I would take if I were starting out now. I just know that I would be excited and overwhelmed at the same time. Have fun on your trip, but don't overdo it. Lynne, it sounds like your trip was fantastic. I love all those pictures. How is your mom doing now? I hope she is okay. MJH, I am glad you have had this time with your sister. It is too bad she doesn't live closer, but I am sure you two enjoy being together whenever you can. Lynne and MJH, We have to make plans for lunch. Lynne, let me know when you will be done with this month's hell week. MJH, let me know when you will be ready to meet. We will plan accordingly. I have no more trips planned until the end of June. Micmel, I hope things work out well for your mother. I was lucky to have two great parents. They were always around for my sister and me and later for my children's events and activities and had close relationships with all of us. They were very independent, sometimes too much so. As they grew older, they never asked for help so I forced myself upon them. Lol. They appreciated everything I did for them, and I love the time we had together. I know that isn't the case for a lot of people. They taught me by example. They were kind, loving, giving, accepting people. I hope my children will think the same of me some day. (But they will probably just talk about what a mean, grouchy old mother I was Hahaha.) Bigbhome, How is your DH? I hope he is feeling better My DH and I arrived home yesterday. The trip was lots of fun. It was amazing to see so many young people learning, thinking, and competing. There were 800 teams at the competition, 400 middle schoolers and 400 elementary schoolers. They were divided into 5 divisions within each ( 5 middle and 5 elementary), so 80 in each division. The division winners (2 team pairing) plus one wildcard team pairing competed in the finals. In the elementary group, 9 of the 12 finalist teams were from China and 3 from the US. There were many countries represented. The US, of course, has the largest number of teams since it took place here. The Chinese robots were amazing. My grandson's team was paired with them in one match, and they received their highest score with them. (Since 2 teams compete together rather than against each other in matches, both teams receive the total match score.) It was a good experience for my grandson and his teammate. They met many children from all over the world. Teams often met before each match to plan their moves. They learned to communicate and strategize with people who did not speak English by using diagrams and various sign language. Google translator was available to them, but the kids seemed to get along without it. The entire event was amazing. It was well planned, well executed, and fun. My grandson's team came in 21st in his division, so they didn't make the finals, but the still had a great time. I will catch up with everyone later. We had our wood floors refinished while we were gone and have to finish moving the furniture back into the rooms. The floors look brand new. I just want to leave the rooms empty and stare at the floors! I have blood tests and MO appointment on Monday, Faslodex injections, too. I think I have gained 100 pounds since last month's appointment. Way too much good food! Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

You know that we are all here to support you, but I realize that it is not the same as having someone right there beside you to pick you up, support you, comfort you, cry with you, laugh with you, and sometimes just hold you. I truly wish I could knock on your door right now and give you a big hug. Everyone needs that. I would like you to take a deep breath and think of where things stand and what your options are. I know that the thought of progression is frightening, overwhelming, and depressing, but this is the way I see your current situation. 1. You do not yet have confirmation of progression. Tumor markers can be useless for some people. Low TMs do not always signify disease regression, and high TMs do not always mean progression. I know that five weeks is a long time to wait, but until you have scan results, do not assume that there is progression. 2. If you do have progression, you do not have to agree with the treatment plan that your Onc recommends. If he wants you to begin IV chemo and you don't want that, tell him that. You have the right to say no. If you are currently taking Femera and Ibrance, ask about Faslodex alone or about Xeloda. Those are both medications that work very well for some people. Although Xeloda is chemo, it is taken in pill form, so no IV. The main SE is Hand and Foot syndrome, and many people get relief with a lower dose. 3. If your MO refuses to try anything but IV chemo, ask why. Knowledge is valuable. Next try a second opinion. If there is no reputable Onc nearby, contact one of the big cancer centers such as Dana Farber. They will sometimes give a second opinion even if you don't go there in person if you send them your records and scans. It doesn't hurt to give them a call. This is an important step that many people to do not take advantage of. Even if someone likes their MO's recommendation, it is wise to listen to another's point of view. 4. You are a beautiful soul, and you deserve to be with other people and not feel so alone. Can you join a support group or a church group or volunteer somewhere just to make some new contacts so you don't feel so alone? The schools here always welcome volunteers. Some towns have women's groups that get together for lunch. What about a garden club? Does your local library have a book club? Do you like to sing? Is there a local singing group or choir that you might enjoy? I have read of some cancer groups that find a support person with whom you can talk on the phone. They pair people up even when they don't live near each other. Maybe you can call your nearest breast cancer support organization to see if something like that exists. If not, many local hospitals have support groups and services available for cancer patients. Do you want to call one of us? I wish I could help you. Please know that we love you and support you.

I suppose the cells circulating through my blood stream will eventually find their way past Ibrance, Faslodex, and my immune system, but for now, I feel good, and there has been no visible progression. When the day comes that there is an infiltration by those cells, in other words progression, it will be time to move to a new treatment plan. Until then I am doing okay. Have a good night.

My TMs have been increasing steadily since October and by a larger amount each month rather than fluctuating. They have increased by 400 points in 7 months and jumped 140 points this past month. I am not stressing over it since my scans show stability. My MO said it is \"of concern\" and \"needs to be monitored\", but TMs alone are not a reason to change treatments. Interestingly, some of my other blood tests have improved during that same period, and this month for the first time in 3 years, I am not anemic. I know that eventually I will once again see progression, and I know from experience that I will handle it.That time has not yet come, so I will celebrate stability and continue to enjoy what my DH and I call our bonus time. (He and I were both diagnosed with cancer in 2015 - me stage IV denovo, and DH stage 3. I, of course was initially convinced that I would not last 6 months (so dramatic), and DH was in serious to critical condition for months after surgery. It made us appreciate what we have and grateful for every day, so we decided this is bonus time.) Anyway, Leapfrog's information is good to know because I think many people see their TMs fluctuate. Lulubee also added that being dehydrated can cause a temporary slight increase in TM results, also good to know. These boards are a wonderful source of information. Keetmom, How is Emma doing? How are you handling all this? It sounds like you have a plan to try to control the headaches. That is good to hear. Sending you hugs. Mae, That sand looks so soft. Save me a beach chair. I am on my way. Tanya, You have another graduation to go to? You are a very busy mom. I look forward to more pictures. Micmel, I hope you have a good day. What is the date that you DD is getting married? Are she and her son-to-be husband planning to move out then or not until September? I have been busy running around to grandchildren's baseball games, soccer games, and track meets. I love seeing them smiling with their friends and teammates and having such a good time. We are planning to go to Massachusetts tomorrow to see two other grandchildren in their baseball and soccer games. The weather has been really nic lately, but tomorrow it is supposed to rain. Unfortunately, the soccer game will be played in the rain and the baseball game will probably be cancelled. We shall see. I have done some weeding each day this week, but like Mary Jane (honorary Lynne), I am not supposed to plant anything new until late May. My perennials are growing nicely, and I did buy some petunias to put in a pot for my front steps. I just needed that touch of color. Hello to everyone that I have not called out here. I think about all of you and include you in my daily prayers. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne  ",

As far as your menu is concerned, it all sounds good to me. What time should we arrive? As Iwas pulling weeds (again) today, I looked over at the fairy garden that my DIL planted with my granddaughters last year. Well, my DIL did most of the planting. The girls just got dirty. They aren't living here anymore, and it is kind of sad to realize that they won't see all the little flowers blooming. Of Course the girls probably don't remember the flowers, just the dirt and mulch. Well, I am enjoying the flowers anyway. They have lots of room to spread.

We all have a part in supporting each other. There are no rules that say how often or when each of us should post. A lot of it depends on how we feel and what we have going on at any given moment.i know that I sometimes get so wrapped up in my life that I don't take the time to respond to people. I am just sorry that Gracie feels let down, and I wish we could help her. MBC really sucks, and everyone needs support. We need each other. I hope she comes back soon. Here is a picture of part of the fairy garden. There were miniature cottages and other objects scattered around, too, but my DIL took them in for the winter. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne  ",

How long have you been growing it? It's so nice to see that you have your great grandmother's wicker planter. I have items that once belonged to earlier generations in my family or my dh's, and I wonder if anyone really wants them when I am gone. I guess I should find out. I should also document the stories behind some of them. I have told my sons some of the stories in the past, but I suspect they don't remember them. Will they know that the china and crystal in my hutch was given to my mother-in-law as a wedding gift from her parents 75 years ago? Will they remember that my parents, sister, and I gave my grandmother the Hummel nativity set one piece at a time on holidays and birthdays when I was a child? Do they recall that the semi-ugly China tea set I have belonged to my great grandmother who only used it on special occasions including when she served tea to my mother and aunt when they were in their teens? There are so many things like those. None of them are valuable except in my heart. Will their histories be a mystery to my sons like the bell I came across when I was cleaning out my dad's place after he passed away? I do not recall seeing it before that day. By looking online, I discovered that it was used by air raid wardens in Scotland and England during WWII to warn of impending gas attack. It is dated 1939. How the heck did it end up in US? I wish my dad could tell me because I would love to hear the story. Oops, here I go rambling on and on again. Back on track....your grandson's garden sounds like it has a lot of variety. He will probably love seeing those big bright sunflowers grow. It is wonderful that you do so much with him. He will carry warm memories like that throughout his life. Lynne, Your roses are so pretty. The white fence is the perfect backdrop to set them off and complement them. I laughed when I read that you told your daughter that when you finally have your empty nest you are going to change the locks and run around naked. I am going to use that line on my kids. I can just see their faces now. My DH and I have been empty nesters for 3 months now. I do miss my grandchildren, but boy did my stress level come way down. My house is really clean, too. Lynne and MJ, we do have to make plans to get together again. I will be away next week. My DH and I are going to the Bahamas for 4 days. Hopefully we can do something after that. We will have to work it into our schedules. Keetmom, I hope you are getting some rest. How are you feeling? Mae, When is your last day of work? Bigbhome, I hope your scans went well. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

When is your appointment? It's good that you are still going camping. It sounds like it will be a wonderful trip with lots of fun. Life goes on, and progression is no reason to stop enjoying yourself. Claudia, I would choose to ignore the aortic issue or non-issue, too. I like that plan. If they don't mention it, it doesn't exist. You certainly have been busy. Don't worry if you too busy or tired to post often. Just check in once in a while if you can to let us know how you and your DH are doing. Grannax, When will the doctors decide between the stent and the shunt for your DD. Prior to surgery or during the procedure? Do you know what day surgery will be done? How long will she remain in the hospital? She is in my prayers. When will your DS receive the results of his boards? I hope they don't make him wait too long. I am sure you will be happ with your remodel once it is done. It will be worth it. Will you post pictures? Minnie, Good luck with your scans. We look forward to hearing good results on Tuesday. Lynne, My DH and I are flying to the Bahamas. We will only be there for 4 days to celebrate our anniversary. We will be staying at the Grand Hyatt Baha Mar. It is a fairly new resort. We are planning to relax and unwind. They are supposed to have a good beach and lots of pools. We will not be renting any scooters. We did that years ago in Bermuda, and I thought my DH was going to kill both of us. He stayed on the correct side of the road most of the time, but every time he turned the corner, he went onto the wrong side. YIKES!! I hope you didn't see Stephanie today. Mae, I am tired just reading about your plans. Well, you won't be bored. I have never been to the Bahamas before. My DH and I plan to stay at the resort most of our stay. We will snorkel, kayak, swim, read, and enjoy oh, and eat of course. Sometimes it is just nice to get away. I have scans scheduled during the week I get back. I have been baking today. It is something that I like to do, but I don't do it often now. It turns out that my DH and I have very little willpower, so I don't have sweets here very often. I am baking some simple things for Saturday's family get together. I made brownies, cookies, and dinner rolls. The house smells amazing. I think I gained five pounds from breathing in the aromas. I also made hot fudge so the kids can make ice cream sundaes. Tomorrow I will make healthier items like salads. It won't smell nearly as good. Well, I will squeeze lemons for lemonade, so at least it will smell fresh, right? My granddaughter told me that she and my son are going to bring a really yummy dessert. They love to bake, so I can't wait to see what they bring. Hi to everyone. I enjoy reading all the posts and seeing the pictures. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne New flowers are blooming now. Here are a few pictures for you. This is a mountain laurel. They grow wild here, so I can't take any credit for them. We have been seeing fewer for the past several years. They seem to be coming back now. This is one of several growing near the edge of the woods in our yard.   These are sundrops. They are just beginning to bloom in my garden. There is a bee pollinating the flower in the first photo.   A rose bush that my daughter-in-law planted in the fairy garden last year. It is blooming beautifully. My rose bushes, on the other hand, are just beginning to bloom, so no pix. ",

Blood in the urine in not uncommon. It can be caused by UTIs, kidney infections, kidney stones, inflammation, medication, and, as my sister-in-law discovered, from a little blood vessel that has an innocuous leak that needs no action. My DH had kidney cancer and never has had any blood in his urine. I have had several different kinds of urology scans, tests, and procedures due to a few different kidney issues, so if you have questions, let me know. Oh, and I have NO cancer in kidneys, ureters, or bladder. Try to relax. Urology ultrasounds are quick and easy. I have my next one Monday at 7:30 a.m., and I will probably be out of there by 7:50.

Several of us on this thread have had one or more treatments that have failed, and we know how upsetting that is. You have had a rough 15 months, and it must be emotionally overwhelming for you. I know it must seem like hope is fading, but hope is still there. Lynne (the other Lynne) has not posted lately. She was planning to spend a week at one of the lakes in NH, and I think she is either still there or just settling back home. I am sure she won't mind if I tell you a bit about her treatments. She can tell you more when she returns. Lynne is on her 7th treatment in six years. Some of her treatments failed quickly, but eventually she was given some that worked. She remains active and enjoys life and spending time with her family. All it takes is the right treatment plan for you. In the meantime, I have a few questions and suggestions. 1. Get a second opinion. Your MO will not be offended, and it will give you a fresh set of eyes and a different mind to evaluate your options. Lynne goes to an MO at Dana Farber each time she need to change treatments. Btw, that MO recently told her that she has several more treatment options after her current one. 2. Have you had a biopsy lately? There have been some people on these boards whose tumors have changed characteristics over time. It is not common, but certainly worth investigating. This could change your treatment options. 3. Have you had Foundation One testing to identify genetic mutations? This might identify things that could be targeted in your treatments or identify why some treatments have failed. 3. Have you looked into clinical trials to see if you qualify or would be interested in one? I know these aren't for everyone, but it's another option. 4. Do you have someone to talk to? Someone supportive? It doesn't change the situation but can make it easier to get through. 5. Are you taking anything for anxiety? No one can say that having MBC is easy, and sometimes medications can help. I wish I had a magic wand that would make all of this go away, but I do not. When will you start your new treatment? I hope you find it a tiny bit easier to deal with everything once you are back in treatment. In the meantime, let us know if you have any questions or if we can do anything to help. I am lifting you up in prayer. (((Hugs)) Lynne, I hope you don't mind that I \"talked\" about you while you were gone. Gracie, WOOHOO for the good results. Grannax, I hope you get good news, too.

She remembers making tiny mistakes and my grandmother would make her rip it out and start all over. Who knows what the reality was. I laugh to think of it. My mom was an exceptionally bright but stubborn, independent-minded person, especially for a female of her generation. She must have made things interesting for my grandmother. My mother did knit. She could make a sweater in a week or two. I don't think I bought myself a sweater until my mom's arthritis got so bad that she could no longer knit. Gotta go. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

My dad's favorite picture was one of him with my mom and my sister who was an infant at the time. He was wearing his Marines uniform. My parents' generation held a deep sense of patriotism and pride that we have not seen in the U.S. since that time. My dad was sent to China. I have many pictures of him there since he sent my mom letters and photos often. My mother and even my grandmother worked at Raytheon during the war since so many men were gone. The women altered their normal Iives to help in the war effort. My mom worked in the factory and my grandmother worked in the cafeteria. Mags, I am sorry that the war had such a deep negative impact on your father's life. The horrors that he witnessed at Pearl Harbor must have been burned into his mind. How does anyone ever recover from that? I did have the honor of visiting Pearl Harbor a few years ago. The memories still bring tears to my eyes. It is a holy, spiritual place, and I couldn't help but feel it surrounding me. I knew I would be touched, but I was still surprised at the depth and breadth of my feelings. I cannot imagine the fear, the shock, the pain, and the sadness for the people who were there. My dad always wanted to visit, so I had his memory with me. There were two survivors sitting at a table while we were there. They answered questions for anyone who stopped to talk to them. Many just said thank you to them. Grannax, I am glad you will be going there. You will be touched. Grannax, I think I told you this before, but I will say it again. Aulani is beautiful. The rooms are spotless and are beautifully decorated. My DH and I have stayed in a studio and also in a one bedroom. Let me know if you have any questions about the place. Gracie, You are on my mind today. We all have times when everything seems to go bad. It is hard to get through those times. I am lifting you up in prayer. I hope we hear from you soon, but you are in my heart no matter what. Keetmom, I hope you continue to feel well. I have no doubt that you will be glad to get those rads behind you and find out what the next steps will be. We are all eager to hear about it. Lynne and MJH, What is happening to our Patriots? Amendola, Butler, and Solder - all gone? Whoa! One of my sons took today off and went to Bretton Woods today. They had almost 3 feet of snow from the last storm. He sent me a picture of the driveway. He took it this morning. The driveway had been plowed before he arrived last night, so the snow was just from the overnight \"flurries\". I will post it. Boring picture, but I am a dull person. Hahaha. Lynne, BVI, wow, fancy. Have a good time there. You will be down at WDW before you know it. Did I tell you that I love Disney? When I go there I turn into a little kid. I giggle, I ooo and ahhh, I take in all the sights and sounds. It is a happy place. Micmel, I hope your surgery is a breeze, the recovery, too. I have to confess that I didn't notice ant increased energy when I had my long break from Ibrance last year for my kidney surgery. It is probably because I had a horrible uretal stent for two months before and seven weeks after surgery. Those stents were so uncomfortable that I probably didn't even notice the increased energy. Darn, a lost opportunity. Btw, my long break from Ibrance did not cause any negative effect on treatment. I hope that lessens any concerns you have about that. Minnie,Those pictures are beautiful. Nature can take my breath away and give me a sense of peace. Pool day, so saying good-by. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne From Bretton woods.  For Grannax, a picture of Aulani   ",

I can't say that I am sorry that I have missed all those nor'easters. We are here for another 9 days. The time has flown by. The weather has been perfect. One of my sons has been in W. Palm Beach on business this week. He is hoping that he gets bumped from his flight home tomorrow so he can spend more time in the warm sunshine. Lol. I wouldn't mind that since he would be able to drive over here for a day or two. One of my other sons is coming to to Naples tomorrow morning. He and his family (our daughter-in-law and two of our grandchildren) will be here for five days. We are all going out to dinner tomorrow night, and my son's in-laws will be joining us. On Saturday all 8 of us will go to a Red Sox game in Ft. Myers. That should be fun. If that's not enough, yet another of my sons with 2 more of my grandchildren are hoping to fly down here Saturday night and stay for 4 days. Can you tell that everyone has had enough of that northeast winter? I have missed my children and grandchildren, so it will be nice to see some of them. I wish they could all come. I hope that snow surrounding your house melts quickly. I will be thinking about you next week as you have surgery and also as you recover. Deep down you know that you made the right decision for yourself. It can be scary to go through surgery and recovery, but try to concentrate on why you are doing it and what the end result will be. The surgery and recovery are just temporary events. You are healthy and strong. Lynne, it sounds like NH was spared the brunt of the storm. Thank goodness. The warmth and fun of Disney will surround you before you know it. I enjoyed seeing the St. Pat pictures. My Irishman of a husband doesn't like corned beef and cabbage, so green shirts were as celebratory as we got on St. Patrick's Day. I always think of my late father-in-law on that day. He had Alzheimer's and was in a nursing home for several years before he passed. He could no longer speak or respond to people, but my mother-in-law and her sister visited him every day. One year on St. Pat's Day, some Irish step dancers visited, so they wheeled him down to the gathering room to watch. Tears started streaming down his face as he listened to the music and watched the dancers. My mother-in-law didn't know what to think. She was so afraid that he was somehow aware of what was going on, and she wanted to believe that he did not because she didn't want to think that his mind knew about the state of his body. Oh, that was depressing. Sorry if it is inappropriate. Alzheimer's is such a horrible disease. That was many years ago. My mother-in-law is now 99 years old. Can you imagine all the changes she has seen in the world? When she was born, women couldn't vote! Mags, That closing is coming soon. It sounds like a dream to move without having to pack. I bet you can't wait to get moved and settled in. In the meantime, get some rest. Hi to everyone else. I will check in again later. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne Here are some shots from a trip to one of the many beaches we have visited. gopher turtle in parking lot, pelicans fishing to dinner, view over the dunes    ",

I know it is not an easy feat, but you need to stay strong. I am worried about you. You have so much going on. You and your DH are in my prayers. Micmel, Friday will be here soon, and you will be back home before you know it. It will soon be behind you. I am praying for you, too. Your shoes are beautiful. Are you practicing walking in them? Tanya, Welcome home. The pictures are beautiful. Thank you for posting them. I am still in Naples, and this Florida weather continues to be perfect. My DH and I are enjoying all this warm sunshine. My DH and I went to the Red Sox game in Ft. Myers yesterday. One of my sons, daughter-in-law, grandson, and granddaughter are in FL on vacation and went with us. My dil's parents also joined us. We had a good time. The Red Sox won 6-0. MJH and Lynne, I gasped when Sale was hit by a line drive. Luckily, he was not seriously injured, so he will be able to pitch the season opener. My son and his family will be returning home on Tuesday, but we are all going to the beach together tomorrow. My DH and I will be returning to NH on Saturday. The month has flown by. I am not happy to leave this great weather. Next week I will return to reality. I have appointment at onc's office for blood tests, Faslodex injections, and Zometa infusion on Wednesday, and I am also supposed to have scans next week.. If that is not a good time, I don't know what is. WOOHOO. Gracie, WOOHOO for your scan results. Stability is a good word. It sounds like TMs might not be a valid value to track for you. Keetmom, I am glad that you aren't having bad SEs from chemo. I hope the chemo knocks down those ugly cancer cells. Bliss, I hope your mother continues a smooth recovery from her recent surgery. Lynne, How are you feeling? April is almost here, and before you know it you'll be flying off to WDW. My grandson ran in the Shamrock shuffle today. It was his first race. He was all excited and texted me a picture of his result slip. It looks like there were thousands of people in the race. Have a good night everyone. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

I must say that your family is really taking advantage of your kindness and generosity. I am sure you will enjoy seeing everyone, but wow, you need a break. It is nice that your family is so close, physically and emotionally. That is rare these days. Try not to overdo it on Sunday. Grannax, That prep is awful isn't it? I was half way through the prep day a few months ago, but my MO's office called and said that my platelets were too low for the colonoscopy. I was so happy to get that call because all I had been thinking about was real food. Gracie, My DS and DIL are KU fans, too. They earned their PhD's at KU, and the basketball team was always a big topic of conversation there. Mae, I am hoping to hear from you about good MRI results today. Tanya, You always post beautiful photos. Thank you. Micmel, In just a few more days surgery will be behind you. We will all be there in spirit. Just close your eyes and you will feel our support. MJH, How are you feeling now that you have begun a new treatment plan? I hope your SEs are slight or non-existent and the results are outstanding. Well, it's official. I don't want to leave Florida on Saturday. The weather has been wonderful, of course, but this has also provided us with sort of a vacation from cancer - no scans, no blood tests, no shots, no IVs, no appointments. I wish it wouldn't end. Oh well, I really shouldn't complain. I have it much easier than many others. So, scan on Monday, all the other \"stuff\" on Wednesday. I am not at all nervous about scans. It's just not how I would like to spend Monday morning. Lol. My DS and his family returned home to Massachusetts yesterday. We had lots of fun with them while they were here. My DIL's father ended up in the hospital while they were here, so DIL was glad to be near him. It turned out that his breathing problems were caused by all the smoke from the wildfires not too far from them. He only stayed in the hospital overnight. Luckily, the smoke has not reached this area of Naples, but we can see it in the distance every evening. I hope you are all having a good day. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne    ",

Micmel, I am laughing at your cleavage remark. I envision you buying all new outfits to accentuate your newly acquired curves. Lol. I hope you continue to feel better every day. Lynne, What can I say about yesterday's weather? It was disheartening to see yet another coating of snow on the ground. At least most of it is gone now. I felt so bad for the marathon runners in Boston. I heard there was hail at the beginning of the race followed by torrential downpours, strong headwinds, and cold temperatures. Yuck! My dad used to run that marathon many years ago before it became as popular as it is today. He proudly finished it 5 times. I remember watching the race with my mother and sister. We would go to several points along the course then be at the finish line when my father crossed it. Every one of those finishers looked exhausted and sick to me. 26.2 miles is a very long way to run. No thank you! So, three more days till Disney? I am so jealous. Have a great time, and don't forget to post pictures for us. We will have to plan another lunch once you are back and before MJH's Y-90 procedure. Lynnwood, I am sorry you are having to worry about possible progression. I hope your increasing TMs are just some kind of fluke. Everyone's markers seem to be unique. My MO and I would be shouting for joy if mine ever went to 2 digits, but for you, I know that 76 is quite elevated. Although 36 months on your first line of treatment is fantastic, I realize that it is scary and disappointing when you have to move on. I was sad to leave Arimidex behind, but Faslodex and Ibrance have been good to me, so they are now my best friends. If you do need to move on, I hope you get at least 36 months from your next treatment with few or no SEs. Let us know when you have a date for your PET scan For me, the waiting is always difficult. I will pray that the results are good. Tanya, I am waiting for that 60 degree weather to reach NH and settle in for a while. I do miss that wonderful Florida weather. Gracie, I am glad your MO is sensible and realizes that rising TMs alone do not need to be worrisome. Mine have been climbing steadily for 6 months. They had been stable at about 140 for quite a while but after the 6 month climb, they reached 400 this month. Scans seemed okay. I am going to ask my MO lots of questions at my next appointment. Maybe we shouldn't be checking them if they are no longer accurate. Hugs and prayers to all, Lynne  ",

He or she has absolutely no idea what will happen to any patient during the next two years - not you, not anyone! My MO has told me that he does not have a crystal ball and has no way to predict what will or will not happen to me nor can he predict how quickly or slowly things will change. He can talk stats, but stats are nothing but data points and generalities that cannot accurately be applied to any individual. You are not a statistic. You are a human being filled with unique properties. Your MBC also has unique characteristics. If we were all the same and all had identical disease, researchers would have had a much more focused task, and there would be a cure by now. I could last another twenty years or I could drop dead tomorrow. No one knows, and I like it that way. I know I won't live forever, and I have taken care of what I needed to, but I just go on with my normal routine. So I think you have several ways to deal with your doctor's statement. 1. You can choose to completely ignore what your MO said. 2. You can believe that your MO has powers to see into the future and throw in the towel. 3. You can have a pity party then continue to live your life. 4. You can consider your MO's statement to be what it is, an opinion, an estimate, a generalization. I think that there will be more treatments available to us within the next few years, and I suspect that survival rates and lengths will continue to improve. None of us should assume that there is no hope. I am sorry that you have to go back on steroids. I hope you are off them soon. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne   ",

What on earth did you say to him? I would have been speechless, and I am usually full of questions. You are too kind when you call him a quack. The Univ of Wisconsin Medical Center is doing research on long term survivors of MBC. While I was browsing information about the study, I saw articles about two women. If I remember correctly,one of them has been living with MBC for 38 years, and the other woman has been living with it for 40 years.They were both originally treated by a doctor for whom the cancer center is named. They have outlived him. They still receive treatment there, and apparently live normal lives. No one really knows why they have survived so long. There seems to be nothing about their MBC that is unique or brings an \"AHA\" moment into the medical team members' minds. One woman credits her longevity to her active lifestyle. In her early days, she went for her chemo treatments then returned home and went right out to milk the cows. The other woman believes that her attitude helps her live longer. I have no idea what the secrets to their long lives with MBC are, but I hope someone discovers and shares them and is able to use them to find treatments/cures. In the meantime, such stories fascinate me and fill me with hope. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne  ",

The robotics program is designed to encourage interest in STEM and applies those subjects. At the beginning of the season, the teams are presented with the \"challenge\" that will be used in competitions throughout the fall, winter, and spring. Each team of kids has to design, build, program, and test their own robots. They are also required to maintain a design notebook describing what they did and how they did it. They also document any changes made. ( My grandson's team redesigned their robot a couple of times during the season as they saw more efficient ways to work it.) The robots must meet certain size and materials requirements, but the robots can vary in functionality, shape and design as long as they are within requirements. Each team works with a coach or mentor, but the coaches/mentors are only there to advise. They are not allowed to design or build or program. During competitions, the kids participate in several matches paired up with a different team for each match. During the world championships this week, each team was in 10 qualifying matches. Highest Scoring teams moved on to finals. In addition to the matches, the team's are interviewed by the judges to see how well they can describe their work and issues they had. Several teams were disqualified and unable to be in the finals because the robot was designed or built by the coach/mentor. Anyway, the team's learned to apply math, technology, engineering, and science as well as teamwork and collaboration. I was happy to see girls participating, but there were still not as many as the boys. The organization is actively working to get more girls involved. At the end of the day, the participants are just like all other kids. The teams were made up of all kinds of kids with all sorts of interests. How did the celebrate the end of the world championships? They all went to the amusement park next to the expo center and had a blast. Kids are kids! Does the place your mother is moving into have activities? Many of them have a lot of group activities for all sorts of interests, and they encourage new friendships and get people involved. It can be fun. Maybe your mother will find things to do within that new community of friends. As someone else said, sorry I can't scroll back to see who it was, most senior communities offer transportation to stores, doctors, etc. they also have field trips, some of whichseem quite appealing to me. I hope your mom gets involved in all that. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

Did you already have mets in your humeral head? I can't even guess if the report indicates a need to change medications. Is there a summary or general impression section that gives a better picture of the findings? Sometimes the summary is more clearly worded than the detail sections. I hope this is nothing that will cause you to change treatment, but if you do need to move on, we will be here to help you through it. There are many choices out there, and you and your MO will be able to find the one that is best suited for you. To me, the eternal optimist, the report doesn't sound so bad. It is still in the bones and apparently only one area is of concern.For now, try to stay positive. Let us know what your MO says. I am anxious to hear. Keeping you in my prayers, my friend.

Did you see me do a double-take when I went around the corner and saw you sitting there? I bet you thought I was stalking you. It was nice to see you even though it wasn't planned. I think that the scheduling at the onc's office started going awry when the new record-keeping system was implemented. I have noticed \"fake\" appointments on the patient portal several times. They usually say \" not scheduled\", but I suspect that they hog some of the space in the chemo room. My impeccable (cough, cough) analysis leads me to believe that the new system calculates treatment dates in advance based on physician's orders and puts time on hold for infusions and injections. When the actual appointment is made for a different date, the one that was serving as a placeholder sometimes stays there. It can confuses the people booking appointments. Of course, I am probably way off base, but I am one of those people who needs an explanation for everything, so sometimes I have to make things up. Whatever the reason, the treatment you received was unacceptable. If they do not have room to treat all their patients when needed, they have to fix the problem. If they don't, they are going to lose patients. It is not as if they are unaware of the seriousness of the treatments and services they provide. Geez! Mary Jane, It sounds like you Y-90 mapping went well. I hope that next week's procedure hoes as smoothly. You must be looking forward to getting it over with and seeing the results.

For the past two years, my granddaughter, who was living here at the time, went out each morning during strawberry season and ate all the strawberries that had turned red. We never picked any of them because she didn't leave any. Luckily, I never used chemicals on them, so they were okay to eat right off the plants. The funny thing is that she wouldn't eat strawberries from the store, only the berries from the garden. I don't really have a green thumb. I have planted lots perennials over the years. Sometimes deer come and eat some of them, even those that are labeled \"deer-resistant.\" Perennials are very forgiving, so the plants just keep coming back. I add a few news ones each year, so my gardens have expanded. I must say that I am really good at growing weeds. The vegetable garden requires a bit more attention than the flowers. Last year a squirrel kept stealing ripe tomatoes right from the plants. I looked like a crazy woman as I ran outside and yelled at that fat squirrel. Hmmmm. It makes me wonder why I enjoy gardening so much. I am glad you had a good appointment with your palliative care doctor. I hope the price of medical marijuana comes down soon. It's crazy.

Elle, I am thinking of putting in some peonies this year. Have you ever grown them? When I was a young woman, my mother-in-law's next door neighbor used to give me a bouquet of peonies every spring. His name was Joe Murray, and he would sit in the window waiting for my DH and me to arrive. He was in his 80s, and a wonderful man with a great smile and laugh. He always had beautiful blooms on his peony bushes. As he handed me the flowers, he would always tell me that he had dipped them in water to get rid of any beetles that might have been on them. I think of him every time I see peonies. I don't know if they are difficult to grow. I will have to do some reading. A couple years ago I planted some hydrangeas bushes, which I love, but I haven't yet seen an abundance of flowers, just a few. I am sure they need something that I am not giving them. I planted some rose bushes last year. They look healthy right now, so I am hoping I see lots of flower again this year. I hope your shots and infusion went well.

Keetmom, I hope you are feeling okay and taking it easy. Micmel, Your DD will always be your daughter, and your home will always have a special place in her heart. Tanya, I can't remember if you are traveling again. I met with MO today. Thank you to all of you who wished me well. My TMs (CA 27.29) had been rising steadily since October. They reached 591 last month, and my MO and I both knew something would eventually show up on scans. My April scans showed 3 tiny spots in my liver. My previous liver mets had disappeared while I was on Ibrance and Faslodex, so those new little spots were not a welcome discovery. They were too small to classify in April, and the report said they could be cysts. Well, now they are bigger, can be classified, and are not cysts. They are mets. They are still relatively small, and since I am not feeling ill, I was given my choice between Tamoxifen and Xeloda. I decided on tamoxifen. I feel that it will keep me off chemo a bit longer, and with luck, it could work for years. We shall see. At any rate, I was not as upset about progression this time as I was two years ago. I knew it was coming, and I had feared something much worse, like a massive invasion of new mets all of a sudden. This is manageable. Actually, I am better off than I was two years ago. During my two years on Ibrance and Faslodex, my breast tumor completely disappeared, my bone mets showed slight improvement followed by stability, and my \"new\" liver mets are smaller than they were when they originally appeared two years ago. I got one year out of my first line of treatment and two years from the second line. Maybe I will have an even longer period of success on this third one. Three or four years would be great! In the meantime, I don't need blood tests as often now, and I won't be getting shots every four weeks. Other news, I had to be given a reduced dose of Zometa today because my kidney numbers were elevated. If it's not one thing it's another! Hugs and prayers for everyone from, Lynne",

I have been following your posts and think of you all the time. I hope that your pain is under control. Micmel, I am glad that you are feeling better. I read about Mags, and it is upsetting and sad. I wish circumstances were different, but we should be comforted by the fact that Mags has made her own decision to enter hospice. She still feels well enough to make that decision based on valid reasons. From what I read, the treatment has begun to cause more harm than good. As you know, she suffered heart issues, weakness, and severe shortness of breath due to a fairly rare side effect from her chemo. She chose to stop chemo in order to improve her QOL for the time she has left. I am sure she thought long and hard before making that decision. She purchased her dream home, which she seems to love. Her bedroom looks comfortable and homey and is decorated just to her liking. She has a loving person to be with her as she enjoys this period of her life. She has a deep faith in God, and I am sure that eases her mind and lightens her spirit. I have missed Mags' posts. I wish things could be different for her. I wish that she would get better. Life is not fair. There are things we just cannot change. I think that Mags should be admired for her actions. When the day comes that my treatments begin to be more harmful than helpful, I hope that I will be aware enough to recognize the signs, strong enough to voice my wishes, and brave enough to make the right decision.

You have been on your current chemo for a long time, and it sounds like it is tough to tolerate. I have to add that I admire the way you handle it. You are wise to get a second opinion, especially at Dana Farber. I just wish they were around the corner instead of in Boston. So your empty nest is being repopulated? Well, there are worse things of course. You did say that it was very quiet there during the day. Maybe your daughter and her boyfriend will iron things out. Divine, My mother had a copy of the Serenity prayer on the wall when I was growing up. It has always stayed in my mind. I think she often found strength from those words. She gave my sister and me each a charm with that prayer engraved on them. I am sure you know this: God grant me the serenity to accept things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. I don't always adhere to this, but those words have popped into my mind many times over the years. Some have said that we should not blindly accept things we cannot change, and there is truth to those words, but some things truly cannot be changed. In those cases, all we can do is accept them and move on.I will be thinking of you tomorrow and hope that surgery is quick and boring. By boring, of course, I mean without complications.

I think it will be easy compared to what most others are on. The last week and a half have been full of severe bone pain with a bonus of a pulled back muscle and even stiff neck - oddly, no joint pain which I had expected. I am on the mend now, I think.

I was in pain and had no energy, and my DH was my rock. He worked to hard to keep up our spirits and to find things that I would eat. In addition to watching tv, we watched our favorite movies together. I always liked a silly little movie called \"Waking Ned Devine\". It has no deep message or anything, but sometimes when I was in pain or feeling down, my husband would pop in that DVD, and we would sit on the couch watching it together and chuckling. You and your wife probably have some favorite movies, too. Listen to some music and sing along to your favorite songs. Spend some time looking at photo albums. Sit outside and relax, look at the garden, watch people walk or drive by. Contact friends or family who live a distance away from you using Skype. Shop online. Rearrange furniture as your wife directs you. Try some puzzles together. Make sure you use a table where you can leave the puzzle and go back to it since your wife will get tired. Little things can go a long way. You don't have to leave home or use a lot of energy to find some enjoyment together. I know this is a difficult time for both you and your wife. I am sure your loving care and concern are a comfort to your wife. I will say a prayer for you and your wife. I hope the scan results are better than you expect and that your wife responds to treatment. Lynne",

You need to give yourself credit. You have been through a horrific year, but here you are, asking all the right questions, doing all the right things. Foundation One is just one of several companies that perform genetic testing. That fact that you did have genetic testing is good regardless of the company. Clinical trials can be done anytime, but it it really a personal decision. They are not for everyone. There are a few people on these boards who jump in with both feet and participate in several trials one right after another early in their treatment. Others wait until later in their treatments. Some, probably most, on these boards never participate in trials. Note that I am on my third line of treatment and have not considered a trial. Will I do it some day? I honestly don't know. I talk a good game, but will I ever do it? We shall see. As far as a second opinion is concerned, that can be done at any time and can be done multiple times. Sometimes the second opinion is the same as the primary one, and it can give you the comfort and confidence that you are on the right track. Sometimes the second opinion differs, and it gives you the opportunity to ask what the advantages of each option offered are. You can ask both doctors to give you that information so you can make an informed decision. That is not to say you have to get a second opinion. It is just important to know that it is available to you. It is okay to have meltdowns. We all have them from time to time. Several years ago someone posted her method of handling them. When she felt a meltdown coming on, she set a timer for what she considered a reasonable amount - 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, whatever. She allowed herself to cry or scream or throw herself on the floor until the timer went off. Then she would pull herself together and try to get on with her day. It worked for her, but it won't work for everyone. Antidepressants have been helpful for many people. When I feel particularly stressed, I try a technique I learned at Dana Farber's Metastatic Breast Cancer Forum two years ago. I sit in a chair, close my eyes and try to relax my body. I take a slow deep breath and say to myself \"I am\" as I inhale. Then, as I slowly exhale, I say to myself \"peace\". I repeat this several times and really do feel more relaxed when I am done. I know, I know, it sounds silly to breathe in and out with silent \"I am\" \"peace\", but it works for me. I am glad to hear that you have started your new treatment plan and that you are feeling pretty well today. I hope that it destroys those nasty tumors and gives you few or no side effects. I hope you continue to post here so we know how you are doing. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

Did your local MO give an opinion about whether or not she thought you had ascites? Do you know if your bloating and discomfort could be SEs from your treatment? Sorry for the questions as I am sure you don't really want to hear them. It is never easy to decide whether or not to change treatments when there are no obvious reasons to choose one path over another. If you were experiencing substantial progression, it would be an easy decision. I think that the best thing you can do is listen to the pros and cons that your MO presents, then follow your gut. There are never any right and wrong decisions for us. Each choice just pushes us through to the next chapter. We should never look back and say \"what-if\" or \"maybe I should have\" because, let's face it, it's impossible to know what might have happened under different circumstances. Trust your instincts.

I think that my MO will put me on Xeloda when I see more progression in my liver. It seems to work well for many people on these threads. There is a Xeloda thread, as you might already have discovered. It will give you lots of advice and information. I do read that thread as well as the Affinitor thread on a regular basis so I will be well-informed about SEs when it comes time for me to change treatment. I think it will keep me armed with questions for my MO. Xeloda's most common SE Is hand/foot syndrome. Many people on the Xeloda thread recommend lotions to help prevent and treat it, and they also say that a reduced dose can help. Some doctors prescribe taxol instead of Affinitor or Xeloda. It seems that many dr's prefer this if someone has pain or other physical symptoms or very quick, extensive progression. (Actually, that is just my opinion of their thinking from what I have read. Obviously, I have no medical background, so take these tidbits of information with that in mind.) if I remember correctly, you recently had a liver biopsy, so that is good. I am not sure if treatments are different in Denmark. Let us know what you learn at your appointment on Thursday. There are many effective treatments available, so focus on that.

There is certainly no reason to be embarrassed. The cruel fact is that MBC attacked your body and set up house there. You have no reason to feel embarrassment, guilt, or any other way that would imply that you had any control in this. The fact is that many, perhaps most, of us did everything right and still, here we are. Someday they will discover the true contributing factors to cancer. I suspect that they will determine that very few, if any, factors are directly or exclusively tied to the individual's habits. If they were, then every overweight, meat-eating, dairy-consuming, cigarette-smoking, alcoholic, couch potato would have cancer, and those who live a healthy lifestyle would be immune. There is much more to be learned. I do know that you did not do this to yourself! Instead of being embarrassed, I want you to feel proud. Why? Because you are strong enough to live with this disease, brave enough to go through all the treatments, powerful enough to enjoy your life, and lucky enough to have people who love and care for you. Here are a few picture I took of the view from my lanai. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

I wrote a long post early yesterday, but I must have forgotten to hit submit or something, because when I got back to the hotel last night, the post was nowhere to be found. I understand why you are feeling so much anxiety about your scans. I hope you find out that you still have NEAD. Chelle, it sounds like you have had wonderful results so far. Hopefully, all other your results will be just as perfect. When will you have your surgery? Do you think you will recover quickly enough to truly enjoy Christmas or will you wait until the first of the year? It sounds like your MO is targeting aiming for a complete freedom from MBC you. I hope and pray you get that! Claudia, I know that when I thought I was posting yesterday, I was responding to your remarks about Ebru. Ebru was a special presence on the boards. I will always remember her wonderful sense of humor, her eagerness to help all of us at any time, her determination to live every day she had to the fullest possible, the grace and acceptance she showed when she had to change treatments due to progression, her reports of the violence going on in her city, her descriptions of her parents' summer house by the sea, her concern for her son, her gratefulness for seeing her child grow into a young man. I feel a deep sadness each time we lose another friend here. I have sometimes taken breaks because of the losses, but I always seem to find myself back here. I want to know how my friends are doing, and I truly need the support from people who understand what it means to have MBC. Yesterday my DH and I went on a dolphin watch/snorkeling cruise. We had a wonderful time. We did have a surprise. Instead of just seeing the Dolphins from the boat, we had the experience of seeing them while we were in the water snorkeling. There were dozens and dozens of them. They swam within two armlengths of us. We stayed still and watched them all swim by. It was a beautiful sight. It gave me sense of calm and peace. It reminded me that each day is truly a gift. In addition to the Dolphins, we saw 100s of colorful fish. The surrounded me, and I felt like I was swept up in nature. Today, as we were sitting on the beach, my husband touched my hand and said, \"Two and a half years ago, did you expect that we would would be sitting here today?\" Wow, we both know we are lucky to be alive. Anyway, enough about sappy me. I know that many of you have scans coming up. I want to remind you that you are all in my daily prayers. I hope you all report excellent results. To me that means words like stabe, NED, NEAD, improvement, and no change. I hope there is no bad news, but if there is, we are here for you, and we will help you through it. Got a go. Here is tonight's sunset. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne P.S. I love this weather. Lynne -I heard it is getting cold in NH. ",

Think of it this way, every six months you will hear that great news again and again and again. You blood tests must be excellent, too since you don't have to have them monthly.

It makes me very grumpy. If I lived there in the summer, you would probably see me on the evening news yelling for no good reason at some innocent person in the middle of some downtown area. I am sorry that you picked up a bug. I hope you feel better soon. Well, Chelle, now you have two recommendations for your move. It is a bit more expensive here in parts of New England than in TX and FL, I think, although NH is not nearly as expensive as the Boston area. I would love to have you as a neighbor, of course. In fact, all of you are welcome here. I think I can speak for Lynne (Manch) and say that we two Lynnes will greet you with open arms. You will have to get through the cold winters though, and that would be an adjustment for some of you. We are about an hour from Boston (actually longer than that with the usual traffic, but I did make it in an hour at 3:30 a.m. last year), an hour from the ocean, and an hour from the mountains. Of course, our mountains are just little bumps compared to Colorado's. I am making pretty good progress on my Christmas shopping. I still like your idea of giving experiences, Claudia. Those experiences will create memories that will last forever. Has anyone sent Nan a PM to ask how she is doing? Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

Of course, now there is no Weathervane, there is too much traffic to safely cross the street, and the woods have been thinned out a lot. I hope it stops snowing soon. Micmel, There is one other reason that I would not want my DH or anyone else from my family to come here to post about my death. I would never want them to read what I have posted. I disclose things here that I would never want them to know. I try to shield them from some of my fears. I know how difficult it is to be the spouse of someone who has a serious illness. I try not to add to that stress. I need to talk about something good because I think I am bringing everyone down. My DH and I went to the movies last night. We saw The Darkest Hour. It was very good. The acting was excellent. The makeup/mask/whatever on Gary Oldman was amazing. He looked nothing like himself. People in the audience applauded at the end of the show. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne ",

I love looking at old photos and movies of my children, my grandchildren, my DH, and me, and we are all still here. I can only imagine how much better it would be if I could hear the conversations that accompanied those times. I think back to the dreams I had for my children. I didn't even write them down, let alone record the. I imagine how it would be to share a video now of myself talking about those dreams. Would my dreams be different now? If I had recorded something for them to watch as they graduated from college, would my words still be relevant or powerful or just silly? Would they appreciate those words? What if I had a video of my children talking to me about what they wanted to be when they grew up. Oh, it would be so much fun to watch those videos with them now. Oh, and think of future generations. Imagine how intriguing it would be for your great-grandchildren to see you and hear your voice and listen to the wisdom you imparted to your own children.

If you had called to change the appointment, it would be one thing, but in this case, it was the physician who requested the change. Under those circumstances, it is completely unreasonable for them to expect you to wait until April for an appointment. The appointment should have been rescheduled for a timeframe within a week or two of the originally schedule date. They should have accommodated you even if it meant adding an appointment slot at the end of the day.Onto the MO - lots to discuss there. A local MO is a convenient option ONLY IF the treatment you receive is of high quality and you are able to get appointments in a timely manner. I see breakdowns in quality or follow-up in several places. You are on Affinitor? Their website suggests that patients be given a prescription for mouthwash before treatment begins because mouth sores are common and painful. Next, low blood counts are frequently seen with Affinitor, and doctors should order regular blood tests. Of course, just ordering them isn't enough. Ordering them implies the responsibility to review them and take actions when needed. Although a hemoglobin count of 8 is the threshold for considering transfusions, it is sometimes not done until the count is a little lower. In your case, however, if you continued on Affinitor, the expectation should have been that it was likely to drop further. Carefully monitoring and follow up should have been done. It also seems unreasonable to have to wait 6 weeks to get an appointment when you have just started taking a drug like Affinitor. Is your MO's patient load to big for her to handle? No matter how good a doctor is, if you can't see her when you need to, it isn't good enough. Is your MO aware that you have been winded and weak? Those could be from the anemia, of course, but since they can also be caused by Afinnitor, it might be a good idea to be seen by your MO. The choice to stay with your current MO or change is all yours. Do you think that the issues you have experienced are indicative of the way the MO handles her patients or just a series of bad luck? If you talk to your MO, will things improve? If not, can you continue with such treatment or do you thing it puts your health at risk? You don't know what the new MO will be like, right? Maybe you can start with a second opinion to see another perspective and personality and go from there. In the meantime, I am worried about you. Please let us know what you decide to do.

Worrying will not help, but the vacation will be good for your soul and your spirit. Here are some steps you can take. 1. It sounds like it would be a good idea to get a second opinion. Many centers will provide appointments relatively quickly. A fresh perspective by a different MO could help clarify things for you. 2. I have read that MRIs give the best detail of the liver, so I would be inclined to think that its results are the most definitive. Is there another IR or radiologist who can review the results? MOs are good at what they do, but they are not experts at interpreting MRIs. 3. You could go back on Ibrance and leterozole and rescan to see if those tiny \"things\" have changed. It must be several weeks already since your last scans. See where things stand 2 1/2 months from now. Yes, you are taking a chance that they will grow, but right now you are on no treatment. Maybe there will be no change or even shrinking after the next few months. In that case, there will be no need to change, and AA will still be there for you later, if you need it. The down side of this, of course, is that you could see progression. How would that make you feel? Would you be kicking yourself? You need to be willing to do this without second guessing yourself three months from now. 4. You can start on A/A now. I sense that you are reluctant to take that path, and I understand why. You could be changing treatments unnecessarily. Of course, only you can make this decision. I tend to take the conservative approach, so I would go with #3, but that is just me. I know that I would not look back with regret if it didn't work out. I am praying that you find the decisio that is right for you. Put this in God's hands.

Unfortunately, I seem to have more questions than answers, but maybe we can help each other through this over time. My DH does not like to talk about this at all and refuses to do so. I hope to live for a very long time with this disease, but I realize that I might not. My DH becomes very emotional if I bring it up. I can see how upsetting itbis for him, so avoidance has become my habit. Wouldn't it be nice if we could decide when we could die and how? Of course, the when would be more of a problem for me than the how. I know I don't want my body to outlive my mental functions, but how would I know when I cross that threshold? (Especially if I am on the doorstep of losing my mental capacity....hmmm.) I would like drift off to sleep and never wake up while sitting in a lounge chair overlooking the ocean while my husband has his arms around me. Fat chance of that happening, of course. I think that sometimes one's subconscious is aware of impending death even if we ourselves are unable or unwilling to face it outwardly. My Dad had been ill for sometime but was not ready to die. He enjoyed life too much to want to give it up. Everyone thought he would live for several more months. One day he told me that he was having very strange dreams. The one that I remember most was about Paris. He told me that he dreamed that he was in Paris, a city that he very much disliked, btw. He said that in his dream people spent an entire day teaching him how to jump from an airplane over Paris. He said that he was not afraid, but he never reached the point that he jumped. Here is the significance, in my mind anyway. My sister lived the last 8 years of her life in Paris, and she is buried there. My parents visited the city many times. My Mom loved Paris and even earned her Master's degree there at the age of 67. My sister died 30 years before my Dad, and my Mom died 3 years before him. I think that his mind knew that he was dying soon, and he was ready to join the two people he missed most, so in his dream his mind went to the one location that those two people both loved, Paris. He passed away in his sleep 3 days after having that dream. When I visited him the night before he died, he woke up, looked at me, and told me it was his best day ever because he had slept all day. He then told me he loved me and thanked me for everything I had done for him. Then he went back to sleep. I think he was ready, and he let go, jumped. I know it all sounds a bit corny, but it is all true. As far as advice is concerned, I don't really have any, but if you are willing to listen, I would like to continue to post my thoughts to this thread. Maybe if enough of us talk about it, we can help each other out. Lynne ",

It included a list of documents that should be gathered, a list of people who should be notified, benefits that apply to certain people such as veterans, and much, much, more. Bon had placed all her pertinent documents in a bag and hung it in the closet so it will be readily available to her husband upon her death. She wants her husband to be able to take all the necessary steps as easily as possible without having to hunt for items. I intended to print those lists and use them as guidance as I try to prepare things for my family. Unfortunately, Bon has withdrawn from these boards, and at her request, the mods deleted all her posts. I do have start my \"gathering\" so things can be as easy as possible for my family. Of course, those lists would only cover the practical side of preparing our families. It is my belief that it is impossible to truly prepare someone emotionally for the loss of a loved one. We have spent our lives ensuring that we have close bonds with our family and friends. We become vital parts of their lives. We have shared joy, disappointment, loss, accomplishments, and so much more with them. Losing someone who is dear to us is very painful, and there is no escaping that. All must grieve. My hope is that my family comes together to support and comfort one another. My DH was very ill this past winter and in and out of the hospital/ICU for several months. It was painful and terrifying for me. My children, who are all adults now, were always there to help my husband and me through it. I now feel confident that they will help my DH and each other when I die. Here is my only or at least my biggest concern. I know they will be there for a while, but my sons are all married, and they will continue to receive comfort and support their wives. Who will help my DH after those first few weeks? He will be here alone. I hope that my sons will continue to help him, but I don't know....... I have stared writing letters to my husband and my sons. I will tell my DH where they are so he can distribute them after I die. They aren't yet finished. There will be a separate, unique letter for each of them. My intention is to tell each of them how much they have enriched my life and how much they have been loved so they never doubt that. I am including a fun or funny experience I had with them, something that they did that really touched me or made me proud, and how they made my life better. I hope to live a long time, so I will need to update each of them periodically. I don't know if the letters will help them, but it will help me feel that I am giving them something that they can read anytime they want. In the meantime, I do not dwell on dying, but I try to enjoy each day I have. When I see my children and grandchildren, I give lots of hugs, tell them I love them, and enjoy their great big smiles. I hope they all have good memories of me, but most of all I want them to be happy. How can I make sure my DH is happy when I am gone? We have been together for so long. What can I do? That is where I feel most helpless. It troubles me because I know that if the roles were reversed, I would feel lost and devastated. He will get through it, but I don't know how to make it easier for him. Oops,I apologize for the length of this post. Lynne   ",

This is not the place to debate the subject, but I have to admit that I have thought about the pros and cons of DWD for me personally (not for others). I can understand why someone would make that choice. I have even thought that I might decide to die that way. There is a certain appeal to being able to take control at a time when all control is lost, to end it while I am still lucid and can avoid further suffering, to die peacefully. I would even consider moving to a DWD state, if I made that decision. On the other hand, I doubt that I would ever decide that it is my time to leave. I fear that I would continue to hope for one more day. I also think that it would put my DH in a difficult position. Right now the very thought of my dying saddens and upsets him. I don't think he would want to know that I was willing to take medication to leave this earth one minute earlier than I have to. I know, I know, he wouldn't want to see me suffer any longer than necessary either. Humph. Since Jennifer began this thread, I have been doing some thinking about how I feel about things. I have come to realize that although I can talk about dying, and I know that I have an incurable disease, I don't really think about dying anytime soon. Am I in denial? Is it because I feel so good? Is it optimism? Am I just living my life as I would have without the diagnosis of MBC? I have made some preparations and made my wishes about death and dying known, but I still see a future for myself. Am I the only one who feels this way? Am I crazy? I really don't know, but I think it is working for me right now. I know things will change eventually. Is my way of dealing with my life going to make it harder for me to deal with progression when it happens? Does it matter? Life is not simple. Lynne",

Beautiful lady, you do not deserve any of this. There are no sugar-coated words to explain all that you have been hit with. All I can do is offer you hugs and lift you up in prayer. I don't care if you have faith or not. The fact is that I do, and I hope that through my prayers and prayers of others who will join me, some relief and peace will be sent to you. I won't pretend to understand your sister's reasons for keeping your mother's downturn and passing from you. Maybe she thought she could spare you the stress that comes along with making arrangements, etc. She was probably still reeling from the enormity of everything going on around her -your mom's final decline, making arrangements, clearing things out, filing documents and on and on. She probably went into an automatic response, just trying to get through a difficult time. It really doesn't matter what she was thinking. What does matter is that you lost your mom, and you need to grieve. As Claudia said, it doesn't matter how old she was or how long she had been ill. Your mom was your mom, and the loss is personal and huge. You did everything you could do under the circumstances. You knew she was being well-cared for. You kept in touch. You did all you could. Now on to your son. It sounds like you know that he is acting his age. That doesn't make it any easier, of course. Some young people find that sudden sense of freedom that comes with the first year of college a bit overwhelming. Sometimes it is just to easy to screw up. One of my sons had a terrible first semester of college. I swear he thought it was his duty to socialize rather than study. Luckily, he wanted to continue to play baseball (oh, and LIVE since he knew I was ready to strangle him), and he straightened out. My DH and I did have a long talk with him and explained what we expected and also that we were not willing to throw money down the drain for him to get poor grades. Btw, he is now an attorney, husband, father, and youth coach. As far as your will to keep going is concerned, there is no magic formula. I think that you need to wait to hear what your MO has to offer. Listen to his plan. Ask questions about how effective he thinks the treatment will be. Find out what the common SEs are. I doubt that he was being dishonest when he said there are options available. Where there are options, there is hope. Another thing that you have to consider is this: You have been hit over the head with more horrible issues all at once than many people face in a lifetime. With all that is happening, it is tough to face the reality of progression and new treatments. Taken by itself, it would seem more manageable. It is a personal decision for each of us to surrender and give up. When we think the time is coming, we owe it to ourselves to really think it through, to determine the true reasons for our choice, to breathe deeply, close our eyes, clear our minds, and look deep inside. Right now might not be the right time for you to think about it clearly since your mind is so full of emotions. I have read many of your posts, and you have always been supportive to others. It is time for us to give back to you. Others will come along with more help than I have offered. Hugs and prayers from, Lynne  ",

There were so many interruptions and excuses. The cat, the neighbors, the reporter, the hook. He didn't really have to stop every time. He could have continued. Why would he care about the cat or other people if he intended to die at that moment? He knew a lot about construction from the experience of fixing up his parents' former home and should have known enough to use the right hook and anchor to hold his weight, but he failed. If he shot himself, someone would have found his body eventually. Why not just do it and get it over with instead of stopping when he did? Why would he feel the need to stop and help someone or talk to them if he was going to be gone in an instant? Did he really want to die? He missed his wife and wanted to be with her, but maybe some part of him wanted to live and was looking for a reason to fail at all those attempts. Just a thought",

I would really prefer to die at home, but like Fitztwins, I am not sure my husband will be able to handle it. It is a difficult role to take on, I do not want to add his burden. I do not want to die in a hospital or a nursing home. A hospice center would be acceptable. I do realize that I might not be able to be where I want to be. Wherever I am, I would like to have my husband with me. My DH says he wants to be there. I don't know if he will change his mind as we approach that day. I will not think less of him if he chooses not to be there. I would like to have hospice services. I think that they will help me through the stages towards death, keeping me as comfortable as possible. They will also help my family as my health fails, as I die, and after I am gone. My hope is that my death will not be difficult for my DH to witness. If it is, I don't want him there. I wish I could control that. These are things my DH and I have already discussed. He doesn't want to talk about it again. I have talked to my MO about what I expect from him as I approach the end of effective treatment. I think I have some time to go, and so does he. I told him that I expect him to tell me when I am nearing the end of treatment. He said he will tell me when I reach the time when treatment will no longer help, will not continue to allow me the QOL I want, will not allow me to live and be aware. I will still have the option of continuing treatment at that point, but I hope I decide to end treatment and enjoy as much of my life as I can. I hope I know when my time is approaching. There are so many unknowns. I still don't know how to die. I know it will happen anyway. Some part of me will know what to do Lynne ",

The story jumped back and forth between past and present, but I think that was a good way to help the reader get to know Ove. It was refreshing to read a book that was not full of violent scenes or despicable characters. I do have to agree with Kessala since I also expected more humor in the book. I did find myself smiling at some of the interactions between Ove and Parvaneh, but no laughing out loud.I was surprised to learn how young Ove was, because frankly, he did act like an old curmudgeon. His habits, his thoughts, his perceptions of people all seemed like things I would associate with a much older person. I do think that the term fit his personality even though it didn't fit his actual age. What stood out most for me was the message that it seemed to give. There is goodness and warmth in some people who seem drawn into themselves and devoid of positive emotions. Is this true in life? I would like to think so, but I don't really know. In Ove's case, as the story began, he was living the only way he had ever lived, the only way he knew how. He was a man with a routine, a man who lived by the rules, a man who knew right from wrong, a man without emotional attachments. He was also a lonely man who thought he had nothing to live for. New people entering into his life were somehow able to teach him to care about living again. They gave him a purpose, a feeling of being needed, a reason to live. Parvaneh was my favorite character. She was a strong yet warm and caring woman. She made it her job to help Ove through the crisis that she seemed to sense Ove was going through. She pushed him to do things that he wouldn't ordinarily have done, yet she never pushed him so hard that he backed away. Ove had definitely given up on life. His wife, the one person he truly loved and cherished had died, his job that he had held and worked so hard on for 30 years was over (and not by his choice), \"people\" no longer respected rules that were so important to him. Life, on the other hand, kept pulling him back. Regardless of countless attempts at suicide, he was still alive. No matter how many times he tried to withdraw from society and life, someone always needed him for something important. Life pulled him back again and again. Ove's neighbors came to him one by one to engage him in their lives. The needed him to help them through difficult situations. They needed them to stand up to bullies. They needed him to get them to the hospital. They needed him to repair things or teach them how to learn new skills. By interacting with him and each other, they built a strong community for all. Although Ove seemed to reject Cat, Cat continued to pursue Ove. Pets can play a big part in someone's life. It is comforting to have a pet for company. They are always accepting of you, always happy to see you, always there to share your life. They don't care if you are grouchy. They are just there! The ending did catch me by surprise because it seemed to come out of left field. Ove had been a solitary man who ended up with hundreds of friends. Well, I suppose because he opened himself up and helped so many people, it is possible. The money thing? That was surprising..hmmm. It seemed like everyone in the book ended up happy. All the seemingly difficult situations were resolved. I wish real life could be more like that, but let's face it, life is full of challenges. I will have to think of a book to recommend. Sorry this is so long.",

Microscopic cancer cells can just sit there waiting to grow, and suddenly, we have mets. That is an oversimplification, of course, but the fact is, we were all shocked by our stage IV diagnosis. I will never forget some of the first words that my breast surgeon said to me with my stage IV diagnosis. She told me NOT to feel guilty. She said that there was nothing that I had done to cause the cancer and nothing that I could have done to prevent it. I cried when she told me that because I was filled with guilt - guilt about what it would do to my family and friends, guilt that I should have seen it coming, all sorts of things. Those few words touched me, so I pass them on to you in hopes that they will help. NONE OF THIS IS YOUR FAULT! What kind of chemo are you having?

Think about how much your body has been through. First of all, there is this \"little\" MBC thing. Then you have had progression, several infections, surgery, several treatment changes including chemo, reactions to chemo, and on and on. How are you blood counts?

I think that chemo will start working more quickly than Ibrance and Faslodex or Letrozole, and that is probably why your doctor has recommended it for you. That does not mean that you will be on chemo forever. Once those cancer cells are under control, your doctor can reassess the situation and might recommend something else. There are still many other treatments out there. You have been through a lot in the past year. It is understandable to feel the way you do now. Anyone who has seen progression, even without all the other challenges you have been through during the past year, would feel the same way. I do like Janis' term of \"progression depression\". It describes the feelings perfectly. Do what you need to do. Cry, rant, scream, have a big piece of chocolate cake and a glass of wine. It takes a while to adjust to the fact that things have progressed, but believe me, eventually you will adjust, and you will realize that this is just another bump in a road full of pot holes. You seem to receive great support from your family, and we will always be here for you, too. Planning for the future is never a bad thing, but be prepared to change plans often. My plan at diagnosis more than a year and a half ago and then again when things progressed to my liver 6 months ago was to bow out quietly and gracefully because I thought things would end quickly. Well, here I am now feeling healthy as a horse, and I am anything but quiet and no where ready to bow out. My liver mets are\"less conspicuous\", and I am loving life. I will keep you in my prayers.

I think every patient should have an advocate, someone they are close to and trust, stay with them in the hospital whenever possible. The advocate serves many roles including a second set of ears when the doctor makes rounds, asking questions if the patient is unable or reluctant to ask for him or herself, monitoring the care given, keeping a record of medication given and when, asking about test results, and most importantly, supporting the patient emotionally. Most hospitals allow advocates to stay with the patient well beyond visiting hours ( round the clock if in a private room). Of course, not everyone has someone available to spend the time. Stephanie, From my perspective, you have not done anything to shut down this topic. I have not posted to this thread lately because I was so consumed by Nancy and Jake's updates. I have so much respect for both of them. Nancy lived a full life, and she left this world in a peaceful atmosphere surrounded by a Jake's love. Their unfolding story made me think about this thread and how my thoughts about dying continue to evolve. I have said that I would like to die at home, but after reading Jake and Nancy's blog, I am beginning to rethink that. Nancy had a peaceful end in the hospice area of the hospital. It sounds like it would have been overwhelming for Jake to continue to care for Nancy at home. Nancy was at peace. Hospice caregivers are not in the home round-the-clock. My DH would be responsible for doing many things for me as my health declines. Although there are hospice houses in this area, I do not know of any hospice sections in our local hospitals. Although it is easy to get home hospice here, it seems to be more difficult to get into a hospice house until you are within days of death. I fear that by that time I will already have become a burden to my DH, and I don't want that. Will I end up in a nursing home? Does anyone really want to end up there? I am still doing well right now, but this is the time for me to make decisions even though I could change my mind later. I have to consider my DH in those decisions. Ugh. I feel more confused now than I was before. Lynne",

I know that other people had made some suggestions, and there were still some from Fitztwins original post. Some of my friends suggested The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry by Gabrielle Zevin and The Girl from Everywhere by Heidi Helig. I have to admit that I know nothing about them. I am open to anything because I love to read. How about everyone else? Do you want to do this again? Fitztwins, what do you think? Lynne",
