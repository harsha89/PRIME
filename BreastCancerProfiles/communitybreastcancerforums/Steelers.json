I felt so at ease and loved my PS and BS. I decided to have a uni done And tram flap reconstruction on January 21,2014. And I couldn't be happier everything went wonderfully  BS said it was up to me if I wanted to take tamoxifen for five years. I did all the research on it and I'm not going to lie to you it freaked me out.  I have decided not to take it.  With all the side effects it scares me.  So I'm at home and can't wait until the weather breaks so I can get out and walk in the sunshine  I plan on enjoying each day to its fullest !   Thank you all for being here to \"talk\" ",
