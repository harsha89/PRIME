      "Content": "rebellady wrote: Hi everyone About 8 weeks ago I noticed that the tip of my nipple on my left breast was after getting bigger.After a couple weeks I went to my GP who said because it was different for me she would refer me to breast clinic. I am in Ireland so slightly different way of doing things. Anyway that appointment is for December 7th. Last night I noticed a tender area at 2 o clock on my left breast. I am aware of it but it's not sore unless I touch it. Has anyone else had symptoms like this? I know pain can be a symptom but after a lot of internet scouring I have not come across the swollen nipple symptom! Thanks Log in to post a reply",

That normally doesn't bother me at all. TBH if I didn't have the swollen nipple tip I don't think I would be worried. I am 40 with children. Had my first at 21.",
