What about individuals with different health issues, should they have their children taken away? How scary! I am recently divorced as well. Fortunately for me my children are teenagers but I often wondered what would of happened  if my ex made as issue of my past  colon cancer  and recent breast cancer diagnosis. Let's hope this decision is reversed for this woman, hasn't she had enough stress and pain!",

Also, can I have an MRI if I have titanium staples in my colon and I hear the metal marker in my breast is titanium also? Please pray for me as I need to be her for my daughters! God is great!

Can someone tell me what to expect, I dislike closed spaces. The plan is as follows:Lumpectomy, having 4 weeks of radiation and a breast reduction and lift. Sentinel node will be checked, doc feels it has been caught early and he would be surprised if there are any cancer cells present. I was so sure I wanted both breast removed but after consulting on this forum and speaking to the doctor I realized I was overreacting. What should I expect after surgery and how much time should I take off from work? Thank you!

You are blessed to have a wonderful husband/marriage who is there for you. It touches my heart to read messages from spouses. I wasn't so fortunate, my ex left me and our daughter's during my first stage 3 cancer diagnosis in 2007. On the day of my divorce this past year I came home to receive a message from my breast surgeon to hear \"you have cancer\". I am not complaining, I am fortunate to have my children and I feel great!
