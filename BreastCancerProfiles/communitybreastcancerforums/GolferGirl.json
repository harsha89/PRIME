Ok, I'm of to start the freezing process.  Hope you all have a great day! GG",

Leanna- great pic and great news on the MRI!  Yay! LibraryJenn- so glad you enjoed your weekend out. fotopet- I wish I was walking this year, but for me it would be Aug 13th and I just wasn't sure I could do it since that's in the middle of rads and really, I wasn't sure how chemo would go.  But I know I will miss being part of that this year.  I will definitely go to cheer the walkers.  Hope your last treatment goes well! njb, summer, drim, etc - I'd love to drink vodka on the beach with all of you!  Or anything else your drinking for that matter... I know I am missing many of you, sorry, I did read all the posts, but I am just not sharp these days.  I went to the grocery sore last night and forgot what I went for.  Came back with totally different stuff and nothing I had planned.  Sheesh!  It's all I can do to focus at work these days.  Good luck to those finishing and hang in there to those with more to go.  We can do this!  GG",

I've been keeping up on my cell phone, but can't post from there.  Work has been crazy and my BF got a new job.  It's his dream job, so that is great, but his commute is about an hour one way on a good day (and in MI we don't get those most of the year!) and he's been logging 12 hours day, so we've been a little stressed.  He is going to rent a little flat to stay at during the week so he doesn't have to drive so much while we try to figure out where to live long term.  It's temporary, but I miss him :(    I have finished 21 of 33 rads and so far, so good!  I would say use the lotion and be generous!  So far I have not had any skin issues, but I slather that stuff on at least 3 times a day.  I feel so bad for those of you who will have to drive so far for rads 9summer, LibraryJen, etc).  It's so quick; you will be spending so much more time in the car than is rads.  Wish you could find closer places.  I also started tamoxifen about the same time I started rads.  So far, it's not been too bad.  Definitely has made the hot flashes more often and a little hotter, but that's about it. Had some plumbing issues at first, but those worked themselves out after a day or so.  Overall, I don't notice being on Tamoxifen which is a relief since its for 5 years! Day- hope you are feeling better and the pain is subsiding.  I had a lumpectomy and SND and the SND was the worst part for me.  Felt like a had a tennis ball under my arm for a while.  Paxton, patricia, wellsey, leanna- Hang in there!  I really hope you feel better soon.  Each of you is usually so positive and uplifting for the rest of us, its hard to see you feeling down.  I hope things get better soon.  Like the others, wish I lived close enough to help you out!  Sending you ((hugs)) Packjen I had to pluck chin hairs today, too!  Boo!  Funny thing, my eyebrows are still kind of thin, but there are all kinds of out of place hairs up there.  Definitely need some tweeing/plucking, but they are still thin so I hate to do it! Irishtess and Patricia, your trips sound great!  I know someone else is going to Vietnam in Jan, was that njwbhgirl?  I can't remember and I can't o back or I'll lose my post...anyway, you girls have the right idea!  i could really ue a vacation and need to seriously think about one.  But with the BF's new job, not sure he'll be able to get away anytime soon.  maybe I can join you all on the Coast in Sept?  Let me know what weekend and if I can swing it, I will!  Martinis, the beach and a group of May warriors sounds great to me! Drim - glad to see rads is ging well for you, too.  Hope the tamoxifen goes wel, too.  I did not know there is a test on the effectiveness, I'll have to ask about that next visit. One more thing, on the chemo weight gain.   I ended up gaining about 12lbs. :(  My rads doc said people tend to lose weight on rads, so that made me happy!  Then I told her I had started tamoxifen and she said \"oh that can make it harder to lose the weight\"  Boo!  But, surprisingly, without even really trying, I am losing weight, slowly but surely.   My rad onc actually asked me last weekif I was eating or if there was a problem because I lost 2lbs in one week. But really it's just that my appetite is definitely (thankfully) back down to pre-steriod levels, so hopefully by the end of rads, I'll be close to my pre-chemo size again.  Phew!  I was dreading having to do weight watchers again, but looks like I'll be able to avoid that :) I know I missed people and I am sorry!  I still have chemo brain and though I read all our posts, I swear i can't retain anything other than what I am typing at the moment.  Oh, that reminds me of Kim- MONKEY BRAINS- I double dog dare you too!  Hope your return to work is going well and you are feeling good! Ok, off to cool off before I have another hot flash...((((hugs to all))))",

Day, hope you are feeling better soon.  I had the flu a few weeks ago and it really knocked me out, too.  Much worse than anything I usually get; and I had a flu shot!  Go figure!  I think our immune systems are still recovering but I hope you feel better soon and its just a pulled muscle from coughing. I have my first mammogram since being diagnosed next Monday.  I'm oddly nervous, though I am sure everything is ok.  Denise and Leanna, like you, I don't think I was diagnosed as soon as I could have been, either.  About 18 months before I found the lump myself, I had a mammogram that mentioned a shadow where the tumor ended up being.  I can't remember the exact words, but there was a mention of something where the tumor turned out to be.  I didn't see that report until after I was diagnosed and asked for copies of all my mammograms to take to a second opinion.  Interestingly, that same mammo with the shadow mentioned, mentioned 2 other suspicious areas.  I had biopsies on those areas (negative), but they completely missed where I actually had a tumor, even with the shadow wording.  Not sure why the doc only biopsied 2 out 3 in that case.  Also, I had a mammo 4 months before I found the lump myself.  Got an all clear report on that one!  Oh well, all I can do now is tell my friends, get your mammos and get the actual report, not just the letter saying all clear.  And feel yourselves up!  I've learned the hard way you really have to be on top of things yourself.  (((HUGS))) to all! ",

Sunflower, sorry to hear of your reaction and hope you are doing ok now.  Jen, I went to a Look Good, Feel Better class put on by ACS at my local hospital last night. It was fun and they gave out a free make-up kit and showed us how to draw on eyebrows.  You should see if they have that class locally for you, too.  Oh, and they had wigs to try on and showed some turban tying techniques,too.",

LibraryJenn- Wow, that's a lot of cooking!  Good for you!  Glad you are feeling better.  I had checked Cancer Fighting Kitchen out at the library when I first started chemo but never did get around to using it.  I need to get it back and try again. Patricai48 - that's quite a commute!  Glad you made it. I usually felt queasy after chemo so not sure I would have made it. Day -  there is a naturopath doctor that practices in my cancer center.  I had been toying with the idea of going but it just seemed like one more appointment to deal with.  But after reading all your posts and a book called Life Over Cancer by Dr. Keith Block, I decided to go ahead and make the appointment.  Unfortunately, she is booked til the end of Sept!  Still, I am excited to go and get some good advice on natural, complementary meds. leanna9- I'm impressed with the garage cleaning and energy!  My BF would looove it if I did that, but somehoe I'm never that inspired (or energetic!)  I did start back at the gym this week, but boy am I pathetic!  I am wimpy with the weights and slow on the treadmill.  But I figure a little more every day. I start rads on Monday.  Fortunately, there is a clinic 10 minutes from my office were I can go on my lunch hours so I am hoping it is uneventful.  I also got my Tamoxifen prescription today.  I have to mail it in so won't start it for a week, but my onc warned it could make my hot flashes worse.  Ugh!  I go hot and cold so much at night already...it would be nice to just sleep a full night again.  I am also still waiting for my appetite to settle down.  I used to think it was the steroids, but 21 days out, I worry I've just turned into a hungry, hungry hippo! Hope you all have a great weekend!",

Leanna- hope AC was uneventful for you today and your side effects a minimal. Summer- I would love the recipes with the weight watchers points.  I'll have to scroll back for your email.  I did weight watchers 2 years ago and it worked til chemo added 12 lbs back!  Hoping I don't have to do it \"officially\" again and can just lose it myself by eating smart again.  Thankfully, it seems my appetitie is finally settling down, though I do think it is still a little bigger than before.  Just not overwhelming anymore. Nanaof2- very scary stuff on your eye and heart rate! I really can't believe how low your heart rate was!  Hope both are better now. Drim- have fun in Peurto Rico!  I am so jealous!  I would love a vacation but don'thave anything planned yet.  I'm also always late for work, so I get that!  I'm not late to much else, but somehow seem to always push it at work. Day- Wow!  Great pic.  I wish I could grow hair like that but mine gets thin and straggly and doesn't seem to grow much longer than it is right now. DancerMel- thanks for the article!  I just printed it so I have some bedtime reading tonight.  I've had 2 rads sessions so far, and they are no big deal.  Took me longer to change today, I swear!  I'm relieved its no big deal so far and I really like the new clinic I am going to.  Not the same clinic where I had chemo; I decided to go to a clinic closer to my work for rads, and luckily its really great so far! Ok, my ride is here.  (((HUGS))) to you all!  GG",

NJgirl- so sorry about your Mom.  Hang in there!  Maybe we can do a reunion next May instead to celebrate our 1 year of togetherness?!? Tess- so glad to hear rads are going well for you.  And your trip is right around the corner!  Patricia's too!  Yay!  Is it just me, or is time flying? DRIM- I'm so excited you colored your hair!  Please keep us posted.  I've had 2 haircuts, and my hairdresser thinks my hair can take coloring no problem, but I've been too chicken to try it yet.  But, I am back to styling as usual: blow dryer, mousse, hairspray and all, just not colored yet.  I'm still only washing about every other day, too, but my hair is actually better with less frequent washings.  Who knew? On the Mom issue, mine lives about 2 miles away from me.  She doesn't drive, so I only see her when I go over there or pick her up, but it's still about 2x per week.   For some reason, she also feels the need to tell me all kinds of medical horror/downer stories.  Last night I went over for dinner and within 5 minutes she had her poor dog diagnosed with congestive heart failure, kidney disease and hip dysplasia!  He's an old dog, he might very well have all this, but come on!  I thought she was going to get up and dig the hole for him in the yard last night!  Oh, and she just got hearing aids, which she took out to show me and then left on the table while we were talking last night.  Hmmm, I don't think they work that way?    I also wanted to let you all know that I went to see a Naturopath doctor last week.  She works out of my cancer center and coordinates with my oncologist.  She sent me for a full blood work up, so I am anxiously awaiting those results.   She says chemo can really mess with your vitamin levels and can also trigger high cholesterol.  I'll be interested to see how I do!  She loaded me up on the following: a multivitamin with natural folic acid (I guess if it's not natural, it can be bad for breast cancer patients), vitamin D and calcium (I was already taking these, but she upped the vitamin D), Fish oil (I haven't tried this one yet, I know I need to, but yuck!), Black Cohosh for the menopause symptoms, something called DIM complex (this is supposed to be the good stuff from broccoli, cabbage, etc in condensed form) and then at night, something called Adrenvive to help cleanse my adrenal glands?? I think? I don't have my notes with me, but if I recall, chemo and menopause induced by chemo beat up your adrenal glands so this helps.  Also, she has me taking melatonin every night (you should Google melatonin and cancer- it might be a breast cancer wonder drug, though there are not yet enough studies to confirm - no money in it for drug companies, so they don't test it.  But check the info out on Google and ask your doctors!)  The melatonin and adrenvive make me sleepy, too, which is a bonus!  I call this \"Phase 2\".  Phase 1 was treatment, Phase 2 is getting and staying healthy.  She also really pushed yoga and guided imagery.  She was really big on getting regular exercise and de-stressing.  I liked her a lot and am going to pick up a book she suggested called The Healthy Breast Program by Sat Dharam.  If your cancer center offers a naturopath, I'd highly suggest going! One last thing, I am so moody lately!  The doc asked if I was depressed or suicidal and I can honestly say no, it's nothing like that.  I just get so irritated so easily these days and I feel just kind of blah.  We are hoping the black cohosh will help, she thinks it may be due to the chemopause.    Anyone else having this problem?  I hope once I start getting to the gym regularly again, that will help, too.  I have only lost 4 of the 12 lbs I gained and am still wearing clothes a size larger than usual.  I've been trying to eat healthy and less, but it's just not going away and that's getting to me, too.  My doc says just keep eating healthy and exercising and it will eventually come off, but you know, I'd like it off sooner than eventually!",

As far as the Tamoxifen goes, I haven't really had any side effects except that I seem moodier.  I am not sure if this is the Tamoxifen, post treatment blues, still being in chemopause or all of the above.  But that seems to be the biggest side effect for me.  Well, and I am having trouble dropping the chemo weight even though my appetite is more normal now.  My doc did say it would be harder to lose weight while on Tamoxifen and in chemopause and that certainly seems to be true for me, so far.  I am hoping the healthier diet and getting back to the gym will kick start the weight loss. Leanna- One week til your surgery.  Yay!  The countdown is on! Jeanne- Hoping things get easier with your Mom and that you feel well enough to travel on the 7th. Daiva- Your trip sounded great!  I haven't gone any place to celebrate yet.  My BF has a new job and no time off, so haven't been able to get away.  Hoping to get away with some of my girlfriends for a little xmas shopping/spa weekend maybe in Chicago in early December.  Sorry about your painful TE's!  Ouch!  But I love that you have a Chris Jenner wig.  I love watching that show in sort of a train wreck kind of way.  So far the supplements are good.  I love that the melatonin and adrenvive supplements are good for me and help me sleep!  Still haven't tried the fish oil, yet.  I am having a mental block with  that one! Denise- I hope you can get your port out soon!  I was so excited to get mine out.  My rad onc told me I could get it out anytime before, during or after rads.  She didn't need it and it wasn't in her way.  I chose to get it out before...I wanted it gone!

Drim-  We do seem to be on the same path and time table, don't we?  Do you know how they assess if the tamoxifen is working?  I am seeing my oncologist next week.  I'll have to ask and see what he says.  He did tell me that it takes time to build up in your system and it stays in your system for 21 days after you take it, so it may be that you are not quite at full strength yet?  My hot flashes did subside quite a bit in the weeks leading up to the return of my period.  I just assumed it was because the weather was getting cooler now, but who knows?  I still have occasional hot flashes, but they don't seem as frequent or as strong.  Daiva- bummer your surgeon won't do a local to remove your port, but I suspect it will still be a pretty quick and easy procedure.  I do take calcium.  I was just taking Oscal with Vitamin D before but the Naturopath switched me to Calcium citrate-malate (I think?)  The brand is DaVinci if you want to Google it and I take 250 mgs a day. Jenn - Yay!  Done with Chemo!  Great news! Denise- How funny he didn't notice your hair at first!  I guess that is a good thing.  I always tell people about this site too, so glad to have found all of you!  Definitely makes the whole experience easier when you can share and realize you are not alone.",

Scary.  Anyway, because I use the caps for freezing, I got a late start and late finish so was too tired to post last night.  Nuelasta on Monday and then hopefully chemo behind me.  Next up:  port removal, tamoxifen and rads.  I see the onc again in 3 weeks, I assume to start the tamoxifen.  Rads planning session is scheduled for 7/21 with actual rads starting 7/26, though I may push that back a week as my Dad is having surgery that week and I want to be available to help him and my Mom out (my Mom doesn't drive and Dad won't be able to).  My rads doc wanted me to wait to do planning until the 28th anyway, I was the one pushing for sooner, so we'll see. CleoB- so glad to hear about the progress and thanks for reminding us to stay positive.   I am feeling a bit down as my period returned and yesterday's treatment kicked it into high gear.  Was really hoping for chemopause, but so far, not.  But, my onc said the chemo is still working and not to worry.  He said 60% of women my age don't go into chemopause with the treatment I've had, so that made me feel better.   I am trying to look at the positive side, at least this time I am normal (unlike the whole BC thing in general, when they say, \"Oh but your too young to have it\"- hah!)  Patricia48- I ordered the Cancer CD you suggested to xray-girl. I've been loking for some good meditation/relaxation/inspiration CD's so thanks for sharing the tip.  PS, Love Tuffy!  She is sassy! packjen- So glad you were able to take the time you needed for your family.  Sounds like you had a great time!  So far, 24 hours later, treatment 4 seems better than treatment 3, which kicked my butt.  I already feel like I have more energy than last time, and I don't have the burnt stomach feeling I had last time. Treatment 4 seems to be going the way of treatment 2 so far, which is good news as that one was not bad at all. Leana9- great news on the hubby's job!  One less thing to stress about.  Phew!  LibraryJen- Hope you enjoyed your Date night!  My BF and I are planning one for next weekend when hopefully all the SE's are behind me.  You'll have to let me know what movie you saw and if you liked it.  I don't even know what is playing these days! sacphotomom- so glad the nurse was able to fill you in.   Must feel so much better knowing what is happening.  I hope your Dad continues to improve and is home soon. Drim- good luck on Tuesday!  I will be sending prayers and positive thoughts your way!  Last TC!  Yay!  And to everybody else with treatments this week (pack jen, redbarb, etc),  Good luck and hope you have no SE's!

Thinking of calling my BS tomorrow just to ask.  I have a mammo scheduled for the end of the month, but not sure I want to wait.  Plus, the mammo didn't find the problem last time, so I'm not too trusting of those things...I also still have some pain under my arm from the SNB, too.  Not bad, but its there when I stretch or lift too much.  Hoping its just a result of finally getting back to the gym. Ok, enough worrying and whining.  I agree with Laura. I am so grateful to have connected with all you.  BC sucks, but having all of you to share the ups and down with has been a great, unexpected blessing this year.  A friend of a friend was recently diagnosed and I told her to get and get chatting!  I still have high hopes for 2011 and wishing us all good health, happiness and a chance to meet each other in 2011!  Happy New Year!  Beth",

Will have to fix that next time. I am also doing the cold caps like Drim, so my treatment day was also about 7 hours (the chemo only took about 2 hours). The caps are more of a pain than actually getting the chemo, but I am willing to put up with it if it works!  Drim, I posted more about this in the cold caps thread.  I ended up getting a port last week and am glad I did.  Much better (IMO) than having an IV for several hours.  1 down and 3 to go!  Good luck to those starting after me!

Thanks for posting that. I will be getting a Nuelasta shot on Monday.  I asked my onc about taking Clariten.  He said he had not heard of that, but has no problem with me taking Clariten during treatment, so I will be taking it to be on the safe side. I use it as needed for allergies anyway, so two birds with one stone as the saying goes. Beth",

We had her try on both the blonde and brunette wigs and I can't imagine her as a long haired brunette.  She opted for a blonde wig based on our feedback.  Funny, huh?  Says she had always been a brunette before, but I can't see it.  She was excited to try a new look; it was fun to see.",

Drim- lucky you, Puerto Rico sounds great!  I have my rads planning sesson on 7/21 and will probably start on 7/26.  My rads doc also suggested taking a little time of between chemo and rads, so I may push taht back, but my BF wants to go to a siminar in Vegas at the end of Sept, so I will probably start rads as soon as possible so i can be done in time to (hopefully) go to Vegas!  Bad news for us weight gaining gals, my rads doc told me I cannot lose more than a couple lbs during rads or they'll have to redo the alignment, and they hate to do that.  So she told me no dieting during rads!  If you guys hear something diferent, let me know.  I really want to lose this weight asap! Sorry, I am wiped out today.  It is HOT here and though the weekend was fun, between the heat, ealking today and going back to work after a few days off, I am beat.  Sorry for not posting to each of you, but I am sending positive vibes to you all and will post more when my tired brain is functioning again.  Oh, and one more thing.  My period started again today.   Completely unexpected, and totally off any kind of cycle.  3 treatments and 3 periods so far.  Seems I am not in chemopause after all.   Ugh!   GG",

Day, thanks for all the info on the teas, etc.  I tried to find the Brassica tea around here, but so far no luck.  I'll probably end up ordering it online if I can't find it this weekend.  I'm anxious to get started on it! LibraryJenn and LauraM - on the drinking thing, I saw a nutritionist at the hospital where I am being treated and she told me that we all have estrogen in our fat cells and that drinking stirs up that estrogen so if you are ER+ (like me) you shouldn't really drink, even after treatment.  When I asked if one every now and then mattered, she said one every now and then, or even in moderation, is fine, but less is better.  Not sure on this, but since I am not a big drinker I didn't really question it more.  Tuesday was my birthday and I had my first beer since April.  I swear I felt loopy after about half, but since I wasn't driving, that was ok by me :) sacphotomom - hope you are feeling better soon.  Back pain is the worst.  Hang in there! x-ray girl and Leanna9- People ask me all the time if I will be cured.  Maybe its the whole Komen for the Cure thing?  I don't know, but I get it a lot.  And that makes me think about it.  I usually just tell people \"that's the plan\" .  Before I was diagnosed, I took a 401k quiz that said I will live til 104.  I'm holding on to that thought and just trying to make sure I do what I can to get there.  I've made a lot of changes already in my diet and exercise.  I need to start working on finding that zen place though because I am a worrier and I let things stress me.  I keep calling that Phase 2 and saying I need to work onthat, but so far I haven't made much progress on Phase 2.  I just got the meditation cd's Patricia48 recommended, so hopefully those will help me jump start phase 2. Ok, I know I missed a lot of you.  Sorry!  But I will read all the posts and catch up this weekend.  Take care, hope you are all feeling good today and have great weekends! xoxox GG",

Daiva, I'd love to hear your F cancer monologue.  I might even have a few lines to add!  I'd also be interested to hear what the doc says about your vitamin D levels.  I take a vitamin D supplement, too.  I didn't know your levels could be low if you are taking a supplement?  It's very interesting, I had a parathyroidectomy about 5 years ago.  The parathyroids are next to the thyroid and regulate calcium and vit D (I think?) in the blood.  Mine were messed up and I had too much calcium in my blood and not enough going to my bones, which caused kidney stones to boot.  Anyway, got that surgically fixed 5 years ago but all my BC docs have been fascinated by that and how my vitamin D levels were really, really low before that surgery.  Makes me wonder how much those low levels affected or contributed to the BC? I am thrilled to say I finished rads today!  Hooray!  And for the most part, my skin held up pretty good.  I've already been taking tamoxifen for a few weeks, too.  I have noticed a few side effects with that.  I was losing weight when I first started rads, but I've already plateaud.  Not gaining, but not losing either.  My rads doc thinks that's the tamoxifen.  She says most people lose weight easily on rads, but not if you are taking tamoxifen.  Grrrr.  I didn't want to have to buy fall clothes in a larger size, but that may happen as its getting chilly and my regular clothes don't fit yet.  I'm also having more insomnia/restless nights.  I haven't used sleeping pills yet, but may have to break down and get some because I am not sleeping well and am pretty crabby because of it!  Thankfully the hot flashes haven't been any worse since I started.  But you know what, today I don't care about any of that.  I am just happy to be done with rads and have another step behind me.  I celebrated with homemade apple muffins tonight. Not good for my weight, I'm sure, but good for my mood!  (((HUGS))) to all, sorry I missed some of you.  I need to catch up this weekend!  Hope you all are feeling good!  Beth",

Day, good to hear from you!  Hope all is well. I went to the eye doctor today.  Need to up my prescription a bit, but he said its due to age, not chemo.  I said my eyes seem worse since chemo, but he said no, its age.  Ugh.
