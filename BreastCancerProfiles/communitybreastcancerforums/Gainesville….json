Since I posted, we went out for lunch with friends and shopped at Publix. What a difference from yesterday when she barely felt like getting off the couch. Living normally, as much as she can, seems beneficial both physically and psychically. \"Normally\" includes teasing her, when she was looking at shampoos or conditioners, that maybe she should skip the large economy size. Yes, she laughed.",

Sunflower's advice on ginger and on defizzed ginger ale were suggestions she had also heard from our family member (the oncological P.A.). We will have to check out the chemo shopping list Racy mentioned. Our oncologist \"promised\" she will lose her hair so we went by a shop that specializes in head garb for chemo patients. Found some possible choices (my wife is wary about a wig, but open to the possibility). She rarely wears a hat but looks really great in them. At least the wide brimmed kind. But I'm not sure they work on a shorn head.",

She slept later than usual (good!) and felt pretty normal in late morning and while we went out to lunch and ran an errand. Did a few chores around the house then rested, read and napped for 2-3 hours this afternoon. That is the difference from pre-chemo. Never used to nap. Still a good day.",

She had a mammogram and ultrasound this morning with a new doctor who is very experienced - tens of thousands of patients over 30+ years. She spent a lot of time with us. Went over both the ultrasound and mammogram images very carefully. Didn't seem to see anything beyond the nipple area. Used the ultrasound on the lymph nodes and seemed to think they were clear. We felt my wife's symptoms suggested Paget's Disease, a rare form of breast cancer. Happily (since that is often more aggressive) the doctor felt that was unlikely. Then an MRI this afternoon. And she sees the surgeon tomorrow - who will have all this info. (We also really liked the oncologist whom we saw last Thursday - who will be in charge of any radiation or chemo that is needed post-op.) Technology today is amazing. The doctor this morning had obtained, via computer apparently, my wife's mammogram images from her annual exams over the past several years. She brought them up side by side on a big screen to compare changes over the years. We are both tired - especially, I think, from the recent days' anxiety - but were encouraged by this morning's meeting. And by something as simple as the doctor setting up an appointment to see her again in nine months for another mammogram.",

We are still trying to figure things out. Will this be her normal cycle after chemo - several rollercoaster days, some miserable - followed by a good spell? Or to what extent did Phenergan relieve her GI discomfort and resultant nausea? Time will tell. But far more encouraging than the daunting prospect of four and a half months of non-stop bad days. Fingers crossed.",

So, if her tummy continues to permit, she will probably stay with the book until bedtime and will put off following up on suggestions until tomorrow.",
