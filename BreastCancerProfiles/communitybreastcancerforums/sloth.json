I was on steroids for several weeks and strong antibiotics for a month...well the drainage is now almost clear and hardly perceptable, its amber clear at worst and thats way diff then it was and its not coming out by itself anymore. Im sorta upset because I had to call this surgeons office back eventually and finally did and the stupid scheduler got all huffy w/ me when I asked her a question. I asked since I was on steroids which reduce inflamation (the duct) and strong antibiotics could it be I dont need this done now? I cant afford to go thru w/ it if its not ness. She gets all p o'd and puts the doctor on the phone who gets even more snotty w/ me ! I was very nice polite and just said should we repeat and u.s. to verify the inflamation is still there? The surgeon said I dont know why youre having such a hard time understanding me this needs done (what one question is a problem!) if you have any fluid still..(my thyroid doc said clear basic drainage can be from my thyroid and I told doc this at prev appt.)She went on to lecture me she doesnt do uness surgery she isnt the type. I tried to tell her I wasnt saying that at all I just thought the meds maybe changed it all and she hasnt seen me so I thought Id ask. I just dont like how she treated me and they are making me feel like a problem, I did cancel once from the bronchitis and they have had to wait but geez. Wasnt it a perfectly good question? Dont woman get infections that antibiotics and prednisone couldve cleared up? I may call her tomorrow when im supposed to confirm and tell them to forget it. What would it hurt to wait and see and then I will have to go elsewhere I guess. Thanks for input and reading me its so good to have somewhere to go about this...its been so long since the emotional upset of hearing I had this problem to now Im just sick of thinking about it and upset I guess. After thinking about why this bothered me maybe I dont want to think if\" Id have cancer I have to hear it from this person who is so cold and that wont be a time I want to take time to find a diff' surgeon, do I really want someone who treats me like that doing my mastecomy (if Id need one)?

I have had to delay my ductal excisional biopsy for nipple bleeding and inflamed duct because I have bad asthma and allergies and am going thru' a bad period I cant shake w/ allergies. (iv sedation only w/ surgery) The doctor had to give me a cortisone (kenalog) shot at a one half normal dose to help me. The oral prednisone was killing my stomach and I still needed the meds. The immunologist/asthma doc says get the surgery you need it done and its been since early december I found blood. He says I will be fine and its such a low released dose I will heal fine. (he said simply dont tell the surgeon!?) Problem is if I tell the surgeon she wont do it. I have to sign things saying i disclosed all Im uncomfortable lieing. Is there much danger to having the surgery after the cortisone shot it will have been several weeks later but it stays in body for months.

I keep giving it to God and then I yank it back if you know what I mean Well apparantly this surgeon was in the process of getting clearance for surgery for me from my asthma doc (why cant I take responsibility I know when my asthma is bad he shouldnt have to take liability for my her surgery), and he didnt get back to her till last week and she called to talk w/ him multiple times since last month! Now he wont approve it till I see him, fine but why didnt asthma docs call and tell me this before now! My surgery is sched for june 7. If I go in this internist office and catch a cold like I often do...there goes surgery again..Im crying now...I cant stand the thought of them cancelling me yet again! And my breast is sore now in a spot it wasnt and its not hormonal. Im scared out my wits and want this over! Im stressing about the debt the co pays are putting us in and on top of that they are laying off at hubbys work, we cant afford cobra insurance not even a little bit could we. We are praying he has enough senority to stay on. I know they \"cant\" fire him for using insurance too much but it happens and they just cover it up I know. Cancer treatments cost a lot ...what if they find out and cut his job! UGH!! Im taking a breath I mean what will be will be but geez! I mean who waits six months to get bloody discharge checked! (it wasnt by choice but still) If they resched' me Im going to blow my top! Ya know what really burns me is this internist asthma doc is who I depend on to give info to a crisis doc I may see, he knows me long history, I dont see others. If it was this hard to get this info for her (surgeon) what will it be in the future needs!? Im afraid to complain to him, I mean is this even his problem (my surgery). signed...one upset sloth!

Apparantly she couldnt take the stress of my issues. I didnt find this on mammogram anyway, my nipple was bleeding for petes sake. Sigh. I need encouraged to go back for check ups because we are financially strained (no one helps I wont take it thats not what mom meant). And everytime I go they biopsy me and its hard w/ my other health issues. So itd be easy not to go back I dont need to be discouraged not to go back!
