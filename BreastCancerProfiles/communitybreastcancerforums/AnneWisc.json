A problem with mastectomy is lymphedema.  The more tissue is removed, the greater the chance of this happening.  Also if you want reconstruction, there are many things that can go wrong.  So I would not rush into mastectomy thinking it is the safest alternative.   Good luck.  Post as many questions at breastcancer.org as you want.  The support here is incredible. ",

I agree with Diana50 that this is something you can learn to do and get better at.  Try to channel the energy into things that will help your mother, such as housework, asking her what she would like from you, and being cheerful even if you have to force it a bit.  If you can't enjoy things, can't eat, and can't sleep, you might already have a clinical problem that will only get better with professional help.  Since you don't want to discuss your fears, perhaps medication such as antidepressants or anxiety drugs will help you get through a bad spell.  Give yourself a week or two and if it isn't getting better, see a doctor about this. Good luck, for you and your mother.  ",

Stereotactic biopsy with something or other injected (dye?) was painful.  They supposedly \"numbed\" the breast for that ... nuh uh!  Wire insertion before the lumpectomy was painful.  For the lumpectomy I requested Valium and got it.  They did a nerve block that I don't even remember (way to go!).  I have a planning session with radioactive dye injection coming next Monday - I've asked for Valium and got it.  Will take it an hour before, and planning to throw a hydrocodone in for good measure. It's very upsetting to politely but assertively ask for pain relief and have that disregarded.  But if you don't speak up, you probably won't get anything to help. Best wishes for your procedure, Chrys. ",

I never need any more treatment.  Cancer treatment keeps getting better and better, but I hope that quality of life and side effects profiles will become an area of greater focus as cure rates go up. ",

I am fortunate to be treated at a Comprehensive Cancer Center which has a whole Breast Center within it.  The coordination has been excellent, and I feel there is a multispecialty consult at every step of the way.  At times I have had to push for the options that I wanted, and I sure do NOT believe they tell you all your options ... but once you express your opinion, they do help you get it. Actually \"whole breast radiation\" is still the \"standard of care\" so nobody could fault the doc for giving it to you, but they should at least tell you all the options and the pluses and minuses. ",

Saw my radiation oncologist today.  We agreed that partial breast radiation would be acceptable for me.  She wants to do more research on interstitial brachytherapy for people with history of keloids (excessive scar formation) and wanted to be sure I knew about that possibility.  She also would be open to the external beam partial breast method.   She said she had never had anyone be as \"proactive\" as I was.  Is that a good thing or a bad thing, I wonder? My planning appointment will be in a couple of weeks.  Then, the actual treatment whether internal or external would be either one or two weeks. I can live with this!   ",

Of course, \"time will tell\" whether this was the right choice.  But I've been reading journal articles from 2010 or so that suggest for selected women, this is a wise course. ",

Alternatives to bankruptcy, what the hey.  As if we needed these kind of issues while we're fighting for our health. ",
