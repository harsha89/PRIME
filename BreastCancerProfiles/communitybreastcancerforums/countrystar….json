I have mega prescription creams,, Nothing is helping. Unfortunately the steroids are causing my Blood sugars, to go high. . Trying to keep my Blood sugars on an even keel, has been very frustrating. When they are high I feel even worse over all. I also had my hair cut short before starting chemo. I didn't feel, I could handle, hair down to the middle of my back, falling out. Thing is ,Dr. said because they had to, put me on a different chemo, because I'm diabetic it would only thin. Ha I think, at the rate it's falling out today, I'm going to be bald. I'm feeling, pretty down today.  Most days are ok, I try to look on the bright, side of things",
