I've never had any lymphedema symptoms, and by surgeon seems to think there's nothing to be done unless I have symptoms, but to date I've missed a cousin's wedding and my nephew's First Communion because I didn't want to risk flying, Both events happened fairly recently after surgeries so I used those surgeries as the reasons, but honestly, it was fear of getting lymphedema. I do want to start traveling again, though. Should I wear compression on flights? Will wearing compression when I don't have lymphedema cause any harm?",
