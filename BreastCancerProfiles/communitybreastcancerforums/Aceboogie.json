I noticed it in the shower one morning. I didn't think anything of it because in my mind, I was assuming that breast cancer or anything is so infrequent in men, and especially younger men that there's no chance that's what this could be. My girlfriend thought otherwise when she brought up the fact that my mother had gone through screening due to a lump that she had found. Hers was removed and that was the end of that. Now that it's past 6 months and it seems to have gotten bigger I am somewhat more concerned and it is just as painful. It doesn't really move when I try to poke around it, and it hurts! I have yet to get screened as being a young man it is somewhat embarrassing. Thanks Log in to post a reply",
