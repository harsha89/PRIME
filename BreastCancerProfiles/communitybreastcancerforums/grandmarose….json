At my appt. my BS ordered a ultra-sound and I was diagnosed with thromboses in my right calf.  So I was put on warfrin to thin my blood. By the following Fri.-the 28th I had a large blood clot by my knee, about the size of a sausage link on the inside side of my right knee-cap.  I wound up in the hospital for a week, being on 2 anti-biotics and two blood thinners.  Home now and doing much better.  My question to the heavens is what are you going to throw at me next.

My back and neck pain has decreased too. I don't know if that was an issue for you or not but my surgery helped me.   Good luck with your up coming surgery and a speedy recovery.",

After surgery I have my BF birthday on the 19th, a friends BD on the same date, my post-surgery appt. on the 20th and my Granddaughter BD party on the 22nd.  At that point I think the time will be flying lol.  Best wishes to all who are having surgery between now and the weekend.  Have a speedy recovery with no complications.",
