There are a number of drugs available to help you and perhaps you haven't found the right one yet.  Before I had rad's late this past summer I was having a lot of pain I just couldn't get under control.  Sometimes something would work but it would wipe me out, not good.  My family Dr. switched me to slow release morphine twice a day and also gave me quick release morphine (5mg)for break though pain.  The dosage is something your Dr or pain management group(hopefully your cancer center has one?)  can help you with.  It took awhile for us to find just the right amount to relieve the pain and not flatten me.  Slow release morphine comes in different strengths too. I have not had liquid morphine but from what I read on the internet, it is a quick release form of morphine  used for breakthough pain.  I hope you can get some answers and help from your family Dr or pain management team.  Life just looks and feels better when you are not in so much pain. Ask your pharmmacist what the difference is between liquid morphine and pill form of morphine (5mg) commonly used for breakthough pain.  I hope you find some relief and are able to have the rad's soon too.  The rad's made a big difference for me and my back problems. take care, hugs.......Jill M",

And yes, the protocols seem to differ from provience to provience. I do know that a protocol can be changed IF you get your onc to agree and then it must be in writing to the board.  I know this because when I was on Taxoter in '06, their protocol in B.C. was every three weeks and my onc wanted me to have a low dose every week for three weeks with one week off. So my list of drugs since dx in '05: 1) Letrozole/Femera April-Aug with bone progression(given in Alberta) 2)Exemestane/Aromasin Aug-Dec (Alberta) liver progression 3) Taxotere-weekly 15 rounds ( moved to B.C.) slight liver progression 4) Exemestane/Aromasin repeated(?) June-Aug '06 liver progression 5)Capcitabin/Xeloda Aug.-Dec. 06 liver progression 6) A/C Jan.-May'07 with small liver progression 7) Letrozole/Femera(repeat?) June and still on it until Dec.  I have asked why she repeated the two drugs, Femera and Aromasin, her answer was , less toxic and to give me a break.  I do know that the U.S. uses more drugs than they do here which I think is good. Canada seems to be very conservative when it comes to using drugs even if they have been tested and used else where. Good luck Debbie with your treatments, take care, Jill M ",

I too have a lot of bone mets (dx in '05) but I never really had a lot of pain (in 05 & '06) until this summer. I did have some rads to my spine which took most of the pain away.  Before the rads I was taking a lot of short release (5mg)morphine which just kept me gooned all the time.  Then they switched me to slow release,10mg twice a day,with the short release for \"break though\" pain.  After the rads, I went back to the slow release twice a day. For the most part, the pain is now under control.  You said you are in Bahrain for 6 mths.  Will you be able to get another 3 mths supply of morphine to last you until you get home?  Perhaps if you talked to someone at the Canadian Consulate, they could help you get another 3 mths supply? In reagarads to the bone mets, it means the cancer has spread to the bones.  I know it sounds scary but there are a lot of us here who have been living with bone mets for a very long time. For some of us, the drug treatments (Zometa or Pamidronate)help with the pain after a few treatments. When we were living in Alberta, I was on Zometa and I got relief from the pain after the second infusion.  After moving to B.C. they switched me to Pamidronate/Areida as they don't use Zometa very much here. That too seems to help. The Zometa and the other bone strengthening drugs, help to stop and or repair the damage to the bones and does help with some of the pain. Please let us know if you will be able to get more meds while you are there.  I really hope there is someway for you to get pain meds until you get home.  By the way, where is home? take care, Jill M",

Our clinic has also started using Falsodex as well.  As far as changing Dr. or hospitals, that really isn't that easy to do here in Canada, even if you have the $$.  We are assigned to a cancer center nearest to where you live.  I could switch to Vancouver which is a very large center, but I would either need a reccomendation from my Dr. or we would need to relocate.  Relocating is not an option for us. Also,each province has it's own protocol it follows for every type of cancer.  I did however, find out how to get a drug that is available in Canada but not on our proviences protocol.  I am going to continue to collect information and any other advise that you gals have and really work on getting my thoughts together before I see her. I am soooo not ready to quit yet.  We are having our first grand baby in Dec.and I really have dreams of taking that little girl to her first day of kindergarten. Thaks again ladies, any other suggestions for chemo/hormones treatment would be very helpful. Jill",

Last year I was on weekly Taxotere, 3 weeks on and one off. I was also taking dexamethasone 3 days on and 4 off.  In spite of having the dex, I developed large, severe blisters on my hands and feet so the decision was made to take me of the chemo.  While I was on Taxotere my bone and liver mets did stay stable, but my onc was concerned that staying on the drug longer would only cause more severe reactions.  I recently finished 6 rounds of A/C , the liver mets still progressed. My onc wanted me to have a \"break\" from chemo so she put me back on Letrozole/Femera which I was on in '05 when I was first dx.  Didn't make sense to me to reuse a drug that had failed before but I think it was to just give me \"something\" durning the break, I don't know. I live in Canada, British Columbia so our chemo choices/protocols differ from yours in the U.S.  Canadan has recently approved Abraxane for use here and I was very happy to here that dex was not required with the chemo.  I didn't tolorate the dex very well either. I know, I'm rambling but I guess I am just looking for something to tell my onc when I see her Nov.2  Every time I bring up the question of doing another taxane chemo she reminds me of how sick I was from the dex. I would like to hear the good, bad or ugly from anyone who is or has been on Abraxane.  Are there other taxane type chemos that don't require dex?  I would welcome any imput you have, tks, Jill M Dx 4/9/2005, 2cm, Stage IV, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I know my onc is concerned about what to give me that won't cause the kind of reaction I had on Taxotere.  The Dr's here have never seen any thing like it.   I am hoping to convince my onc that we should give Abraxane a go.  My onc seems to think that there isn't much use in giving me any more chemo as, in her words \"you have had so much chemo with little or no results\". Okat she confused me when she said that. Maybe I should recap what I've had: Letrozole/Femera:  April-Aug./05 Exemestane/Aromisin:  Aug-Dec./05 Taxotere-(weekly):  Dec.05-May.06 I was stable on this but very sick Exemestane/Aromisin:  June-Aug.06 Capcitabine/Xeloda: Aug-Dec.06 A/C: Jan.-May.07 Letrozole/Femera: June to now I guess I need to be more assertive with my onc but don't want to piss her off either.  I should have asked her \"what's with repeating two drugs (Letrozole, Exemestane)I have before that failed??\"  I feel like she is tossing me aside and telling me I'm done.  Don't I get to decide when I'm done?  oh geez, I seem to be ranting.  Guess that's been inside of me for awhile, ever since my last visit with her at the end of Aug. I feel very frustrated with her. I just need something to suggest to her without coming on as a nut case.  I should probably go somewhere and let out a good scream, then think logically.  Yeah having a chemo brain, logic comes easy...LOL I do appreciate the info and the space to rant. take care, Jill ",

Try to get some action tomorrow from Tom Baker as they are usually very good if they know how much pain you are in. Good luck and let us know what happens with the pain/management team. soft hugs to your poor sore bones, Jill M",
