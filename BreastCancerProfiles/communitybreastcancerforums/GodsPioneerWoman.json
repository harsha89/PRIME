I noticed after my most recent chemo (a week ago) that the metallic taste and impact to my taste buds was worse than usual.  I would love to get input from those who have been doing Taxol and are on the 'long term IV chemo plan, to find out answers to the following: #1) Did the metallic taste get worse (accumulative) as your IV chemo sessions went on? #2) What coping methods did you find to be helpful to combat this issue? #3) At some point did this issue become so severe that you had to switch to a different IV chemo? If so, what did your Dr. switch you to?  Thanks! Virginia  \"This is the day that the Lord has made.
