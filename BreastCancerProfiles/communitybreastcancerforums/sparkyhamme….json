Luckily our insurance will pay for a second opinion so we are trying to research for an \"expert\" now in the event the biopsy news isn't good.  We are confused as to whether it should be an oncologist or a breast surgeon specialist and probably won't decide until the biopsy results, hopefully today. Luckily we seem to be headed to the \"right\" hospital for this type thing....I finally just asked my most outspoken and forthcoming employee if she knew \"anything\" about this....and lo and behold she has been through it and my wife was completely surprised that she had so some of the fear is being allayed just by that. It's going to be a long day.....I have a hard time understanding how she must feel...I feel helpless. thanks for \"listening.\"",

Eighty-nine percent of those treated for breast cancer will survive five years, and 82 percent will survive 10 years [1]. (It is important to note that these numbers show survival for people diagnosed up to 10 years ago. With more recent advances in treatment and early detection, people diagnosed with breast cancer today may have even greater survival rates.) So a 4 out of 5 chance of making it 10 years as opposed to ?????? How can I find statistics for those that don't have surgery?  She wants to know......  I want to convince her not to take such a chance.  I'm going with the premise that it depends upon the type and stage at this point and until we know that.....",

I think the radiologist and surgeon were definitely working together and the GYN was in via phone I know.  Everyone's expression and answers just seemed to convey....cancer....I suppose based upon experience.  There were no \"spring chickens\" involved.  20-30 years for all. But we are definitely going for second opinion at a specialty care center I found. ",

She swelled like you wouldn't believe all the way to her collarbone and bruised really quickly. But ice pack took it down and the bruising is very faint this AM and the swelling is much smaller. Still painful to move around but doing much better.  I don't think she's going to hit Black Friday though. :)  Initial biopsy report during process again is negative in both areas this time. WONDERFUL....but surgeon remains concerned and wants official results.  Still says he is not ruling out mastectomy but did say the worst it could be would be DCIS.  Continue praying for negative tests....she's taking a fighting stance on this mastectomy now and there will defintely be second opinion if that's the initial recommendation. Happy Thanksgiving to all! and thanks to all, again.",
