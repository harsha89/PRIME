I agree that rad is scary, but have also heard that it is not as bad as chemo. I am also concerned ab heart and lung damage, but wont know how close heart and how much lung tissue will lie in rad field until the do next step.I too am concerned ab lymohadema-had a little bit the other day after expansion, so am hoping it was just a side effect from that and not something I will need to deal with during rads. It feels as though cancer took control of my life and now that chemo is done, I am beginning ro feel like I am in control again. I look forward to hearing your experiences as we go through this process together. I have gained so much info from the sept. group.",

However 5 days later wound up in the hospital for a week with almost no wbcs. did get it after the last 3 and it kept me out of the hospital, but I still dropped white cells really low and ran temps each time, so was on antibiotics after each round. Tried Claritin after shots and it seemed to help quite a bit. Took pain meds to help with bone, muscle and nerve pain. For me, it took ab 2 weeks after chemo to start to feel better again, however if the chemo dropped my counts that low, I have to assume that it also was just as tough on the cancer cells. Have you decided to do taxotere?",

I bounced back good after the previous round but this last one wiped me out. Counts were good, but more fatigue than I had and am sleeping so much more. When I was in chemo didn't sleep a lot or well and now can't get enough. Starting to see signs of new hair growth, and unfortunately am losing what hair I had left-am wondering if this is because it didn't grow at all during tx and maybe now its the body repairing and getting rid of all the chemo meds. Hopefully this will pass soon. have been reading all the posts ab depression and tears-thank you all for sharing your thoughts. Sometimes I don't think about all the chemical changes we are going through and the effects of surgery, chemo and all the meds that go along with it and realize how much our bodies need to repair. Your posts really help to know that while we are all experiencing different things, we are all going through this experience together. Being able to read what you are going through makes me realize that I am not alone. Thank you all for sharing!!!",

I wish I had pushed more when I first noticed it and showed it to MO. I was also concerned because I wanted to evaluate it before I staredt RT. Was suposed to start today and after 45 min of lining everything up, they decided to rework the plan and now will start tomorrow. Another day and I so want to be done like all of you are saying.  I am also worried bc I still have expanders in and its overexpanded anticipating some tissue shrinkage during RT.

I am completing chemo-last round TC next week, then 4 weeks off before statrting radiation 4-6 wks. Initially, my medical onc. said prob no radiation, but follow up with rad. onc. So I went in expecting no radiation and was blown away when she recommended it. With 1 pos. node, I fell into the gray area. If I had 4 everyone would have recommended it from beginning. I wish I had seen rad. onc. right at the beginning. The hardest part was thinking I was almost done w treatment and could have last piece of reconstruction done and then hearing this. My thoughts are with you. Will begin radiation ab Oct. 10th-will know def. in a few weeks. Anyone else out there at this point? Wanted to thank you all. Reading your experiences and thought has been the best \"medicine\" ever. Thank you for sharing. It really helps. Deb",

Also some of the larger hospitals have a pt advocate for you. I cannot say enough wonderful things about the techs in my area. They are very aware of privacy and have really tried to minimize exposure. When anyone wlse needs to come in the room, as one of physicists who was a male they asked if he could come in and explained why-they were having some concerns about the tx plan and both he and the Dr. needed to come in. They made sure the unaffected side was covered and asked before they entered the room. I hope your facility really listens to you. I had an axillary node disection and also have the swollen feeling under the arm after tx 2. Feels better with lymphatic drainage and stretching exercises. I am getting CBC drawn every week as around week 2 is apparently when the counts start to drop. I had a problem with low wbc during chemo so they want to watch every week. Hope you all have a great weekend. Am praying hair will grow soon. I didn't lose all of my hair, but now it seems as though I am losing what little hair was left.

Over the weekend without tx, it got a little better. When I started up again on Mon, it flared up again. I have expander in place and the swelling was obvious and more swelling in hand. Saw PS who was considering taking alittle fluid out of expander but doesn't really want to do it on rad skin and would need antibiotics, and if it got infected would be a mess. My wbc count is also heading down after a week, so don't really want to take any chance w infection. went back for OT today and they did lymphatic drainage and I did it last night and breast is softening a little and the awful presssure let up a little, so am going to hang in there and see if this helps. My chest is achy. I would let your techs, nurses and/or doc know. They know your tx plan and history and can tell you if this is expected. And they can probably offer you suggestions how to best manage your response to rads. Hope you feel better. fayebu-I never thought to look at Westchester-it's ab 35 min from me.

This journey has been an experience. designer mom-I wish in some ways I had looked more at face down, but I got to the point where I felt like I was second guessing myself and worrying about everything, and felt so lousy after chemo that I didn't feel I could deal with any commute. I liked the idea that it offers more protection to heart. Hope you are doing well. If I remember, you are further along in your txs?

I was going to have some fluid taken out of expander, but RO talked me out of it.

I am ab 8 weeks out from and had ab. 1/3 of head hair still intact-then it all started falling out. eyelashes and eyebrows were good, but now they are thinning again. Onc tells me it's prob a delayed reaction. But am starting to feel a few fuzzies-almost like baby hair. I had hoped this part would come back earlier. However, am lucky that skin has been holding up. They have stopped using gel pad and are focusing on subclaviculars now, so am getting a little tracheal irritation and bronchitis like cough, in addition to swelling and discomfort-it never stops, does it. TE are holding up, but skin is getting stretched really tight. I have 5 to go and hope skin will make it. Saw PS and he is concerned ab incision line-am praying it holds untill all this is done. Hopefully, next wed. shd be my last and I can truly celebrate Thanksgiving. Joan, Joan, Roberta,and Linda- Congratulations, you did it!!! It seemed for me that when we started it would be so long.  I can't wait to be able to post this. QCA- it sounds as though you will be done today-can't wait to see that post.

People who have not experienced it really don't understand. I don't think they understand how hard it is to lay on that table for a treatment that you know is damaging your body. I still have those days when I just don't want to go and am ready to throw in the towel. And I am lucky to have a supportive environment-everyone there has been wonderful and done their best to support me. It sounds as though after today, you will be in single digits!!   My thoughts are with all of you.

The MDs are focused on treating the cancer, but there are so many other areas avalable also. I have started working w a therapist, support group, and looking at naturopathic options as well as some meditation, gentle yoga/stretching classes for BC pts. had a little hand swelling-possibly from expansion or poss early lymphadema, but showed Onc who wasn't terribly concerned-was more concerned w wbc but for me both were a problem. I will start rads in ab 2 weeks and am worried because so many people have said that it is so much easier than chemo etc. I don't think anything about this journey has been easy and if we are not our own advocates who will be. I think we need to find the right combination of resources that helps us get through this. The women on these discussion boards have also been a great source of information and support, This is one place where we can go where everyone, although we experiences very different responses to treatment, understands what we are going through. Thank you all for sharing. designer mom-there is an older discussion board that talks about face down radiation. was very interested after you mentioned it and will ask my ONC ab it. I need L side rads and it looks as though this protects lung and heart tissue more. Unfortunately, it looks as though the closest place doing it for me would be NYU.",

Another interesting experience to figure out. I was hoping might be able to do the quicker rads but no.  Rad onc said only is considered for intact breast ie after lumpectomy and is gen not recommended for left because of increased chance of heart and lung damage. So ended up with 25 txs to start in 2 weeks. didn't find tatoos that bad. Also asked about shielding thyroid, but said it won't work as the will need to rad nodes high on chest wall and any shielding would block those nodes. Glad to hear good reports from so many.",

You keep making me realize that this is managable. momo-you said it. I am so done with this whole cancer thing, but everytime I complain, I am reminded that so many others are facing bigger challenges than me. I have a friend who is battling inflammatory BC. She has been in tx for almost 2 years to try to get tumor to shrink so they can do surgery, and was almost ready for surgery when it flared up again. Some new meds and hopefully they will work. She is also getting RT for bone and brain mets. This is such a lousy disease.",

They told me it was too early to feel like that. Today went to PS who confirmed that it is very swollen and is worried ab incision line and whether infection could be developing, so will have blood work drawn tom. If still really swollen by fri, is considering taking some fluid out of expander, but doesn't like to put needle through radiated skin and if it has to be done wants to do before a weekend to give skin a rest. but then it could change treatment plan.

Quiche-I am just beginning to feel more normal again after last rnd of TC. Had that heavy leg feeling, soo fatigued and couldn't get rid of the eyelid twitching. I know you said you are getting some lymphadema. I started getting some after last 2 expansions. Don't know if it is related-anyone else have this happening. Have you gome to compression sleeve or are you working with massage and exercises? I will be starting tamoxifan next but med onc said to wait after rads. Toni30-I plan to ask rad onc tom about shorter tx. I have seen it referred to as Canadian protocol. Don't know if I can do this. From what I understand, you are getting same dose of rads-a little more with each tx, so don't know if too much of heart and lung tissue will be in rad field. Mine told me that will also determine how many txs. I would ask though. Everyone's treatment is soo different. I kept looking at the chemo protocols that we were all on. Even though we have similar dx, most protocols were different. Can't wait til end of Nov for this to be over, then on to final exchange surg hopefully 3 mo later depending on how skin holds up and heals. This has been such a long 9 mo and I really can't wait until I am no longer a patient. Thank you all for your thoughts and support. Hearing all of your stories has made this much more bearable.",

Generally they have considerable experience and could communicate with the others to create a plan of care that meets your needs. Lymphadema and infection do scare me.

I am now starting on Wed bc developed some lymphedema in arm on site to be radiated and needed to get consult and start therapy for that as it is anticipated it will get worse when RT starts. I am amazed at chemicals inproducts and thought I was pretty good about that. Have found some interesting nat. products that I might try, however, my onc only recommends aquaphor and Toms so will start with that and see how it goes. I just hate aquaphor. We are only ab an hr apart. I am in ct right over the border. Was actually considering NYU for its prone program, but after chemo decided I didn't want to commute everyday for 5-6 weeks.On weekdays traffic can add another hr or more. Hope all goes well for you today. rose6 and working mom-saw your post ab 5% heart damage. I am also concerned ab that as am having L rad-that was why I was considering site that did prone rad. I have asked and never got an actual risk. I am curious-is 5% your potential risk and is it because they need to radiate area where heart falls into the field. I am staring wed and will be meeting with RT before and need to understand this more-please let us know how you do.It seems like everyday there is something more to learn ab and make decisions about. I hope I am making the right one all the time. Can't wait to be done being a pt. Had also hoped that I might be a candidate for the shorter course, but apparently they will only consider it with an intact breast. And then on to tamoxifan. anacy91355-will be starting wed 10AM-will be thinkingg of you. mhp70- I started w cord tightening and achy heavy feeling in arm-started after last 2 expansions-got 400cc each side to be overexpanded as apparently RT causes shrinkage. PS said not related so may be coincidence. Got some slight swelling a couple of weeks ago and while everyone said it was mild asked for OT consult. I really believe in early intervention. I thought it was just a small amt of swelling, but consult showed a 13% increase in arm size on affected arm-so now need full program of massage and wrap and sleeve. However after just one week of massage seems much better-have not started wrapping yet per OT, so I am optimistic.am also working w exercise group through one of our cancer support services)Lebel method) which really has reduced the tighness.again so much to learn about and decide. Anyone having lymphedema issues or an kind of arm swelling??? thanks deb",

Feels like I get expanded more with RT and swelling-get the muscle spasm and back pain and is really tight, but I found that no tx on the weekends really helped and a lot of the swelling went down by Monday. I don't plan on being this side after surg, but couldn't talk PS out of final expansion. I wish none of us had to go through this. So sorry to hear that many of you are dealing with insensitive techs. I have to say that I am grateful for my facility. They have been on time, work as hard as they can to keep you covered and have been terrific. I can't say the same for the OT working w lymphedema. Took 2 weeks to get in for a consult, then they couldn't get me a daily schedule until this week and just when I was going to start w daily wrapping, they cancelled a couple of appts or when I went in had new OT unexpectedly. I did have a little meltdown at them just because no one even took the time to tell me they were changing my appt and substituting someone else because my OT needed to see that person instead.  Someone said there is a light at the end of this tunnel. That is what is keeping me going-shd be done by 1st week of dec. You are all so right. We do need to be our own advocate and we shd expect good care. I think at this point we are tired of being a patient. So much hits you right after the dx and it feels like we get on a treadmill. This board has made such a difference-knowing you are all there and you do truly understand.",

Chemo is not easy-some days good, some days not, but the lesson I learned was to remember to take care of yourself and tell your MO or RN about symptoms early. They can help you with different options. It feels as though you are shoved on a treadmill, First biopsies, then surg, then chemo and for me then rads.

Other people try to be helpful, but after experiencing it, I can say I never fully understood it and I am in healthcare. Support groups are wonderful if you have a good one in your area. I also think the diagnosis was harder on my family. They were afraid for me and didn't want to worry me.

I have expanders and will have surgery sometime after rads. I saw my PS a couple of weeks ago and he wants to expand quite a bit more before rad-his last chance to do this. so ab 2 weeks ago he put another 250 on each side and wants to do it again the last week of sept before I have the simulation etc done. I have never been this big but apparently tissue can shrink auring rad. Who Knew? He told me that I will prob have a diff incision for the replacement, however, scars can be fixed at that time if I need it. He also said that things will depend on how tissue reacts to rads, so  while I wish I had clear answers, it looks like everything will also depend on tx. Did you need to have fluid removed during rad. I am also concerned ab that.  also have a little swelling in my hand after last expansion but seems to be slowly getting better. Am worried ab lymphadema-have not seen anyone reporting this. Is anyone having problems??",

Don't know if you are on the sept or oct rads group-there is a lot of good info there and a lot of people who are just finished chemo and begun or will begin rads. I am 2 weeks from last chemo and thought I would feel normal now, but SEs are taking longer to go away. I think our bodies have been through so much and we expect them to bounce back too quickly. I have also made an appt to work w a therapist-got hit with sev other things in addition to BC. Join the rads groups-great support there from people going through many things. my thoughts are with you.",
