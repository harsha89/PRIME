I am not talking much about any alternative medicines because I do not believe in them. I live in southern part of India. I have had very good support from Harmala Gupta who runs Cancer support group in Delhi. I think it will be very helpful for you to get in touch with her.

They are not strong and bothering in anyway. I am survivor of 13 yrs and I have lost my Mom and sister to BC. So what I say is based on my experience but I don't want to discuss that here. Everyone should do what suites them the best. What you say about women not having life after cancer is just a bullshit. Sorry for the language. Take back that sentence where you say even the survivor does not have a normal life because there are women on this board who can prove you wrong.. me being one of them. Good luck for your Mom",

I had 4 1/2 yrs old son and 11 month daughter with special needs when dx. My sister was in last stage of BC. I knew she would not be there around much longer and my son would witness her die of cancer. So I decided to explain him that cancer does not mean death always.. but was not sure what words to use. So took help of a counselor and then talked to him. Like you said it was easier back then. Now I don't know how would I break news to them.. they are 13 and 17 yrs now. I agree with Blue above that may be what your son thinks and assumes could be much worse than the reality. It would be good if you let them know. There is no way we can hide cancer from people close to us forever.. something leaks out. Some words, actions, tears .. they all drop hints that something is wrong. Kids are more quick in grasping things then we ever imagine. Struggling at the school could be an indicator that something is troubling him.. may be his instincts tell him something is wrong with Mommy. I am a Mom like you and I am too in a dillemma as to what is good for the kids.. it is so tough making decisions. In my opinion it would be better to explain to them lightly about the recurrance and let them know Mom is going through another sickness and she will fight very hard to win second time around.. for them. Because she loves them and wants to be with them.. Love and hugs Farila",
