The doctor wrote in my report to see surgical consultution giving my concern about left nipple so i guess now its up to my obgyn to send me to or not.I am still worried i told her about the discharge and she said it was normal as long as i didn't have to squeeze to get it to come out i had read on line the opposite.The nipple discharge i was having came out on it's own but i could also squeeze it to get it to come out as well and it was a yellow color which then turned to clear with some red in it like blood too which was maybe because i kept squeezing it,I am still concerned because i know i feel something there i will admit i never much did any breast exam on my self until i seen the discharge so maybe it was like that before but the doctor has done breast exam on me before and never noticed it ,im so confused about this she also told me my breast look fine on mammogram not dense but my paper i was giving said i had dense breast.What should i do now if my doctor doesn't refer me to a breast surgeon?My mind is still not at ease",
