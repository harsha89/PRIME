Hair came back short and curly and I've kept it that way.  Question for everyone... my eyebrows stayed put throughout the entire chemo and for about 6 months afterwards.  Then they fell out quickly and have not reappeared! Has anyone done permanent eyebrows (pretty much a tatoo)?  Any side effects and are you happy? Take care and lots of love....",
