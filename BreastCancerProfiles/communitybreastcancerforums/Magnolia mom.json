It is close to chest wall, but I may have enough fatty tissue separating it. I also have 1 swollen auxiliary lymph node that tested positive for cancer. Will know more after surgery, but will never know for sure the number because of doing chemo first. I'm in chemo now- 4th round of Taxol after AC. Anyone else with this size tumor?

I fear the worst. I spend all day crying or in a daze. I can't sleep or eat. I homeschool my 3 children aged 3, 8 & 10. This is every parent's worst nightmare, but with homeschooled kids, they don't get a reprieve from my grief and I'm bringing them into my swirling vortex of despair. I just want to escape. I feel like I'm free falling with no net and can't catch anything to stop my fall. I sleep 4 hours with Ambien then pop back awake into this nightmare. I have an appt with my primary for anxiety meds on Monday, but this seems far away. Watching my children go down on my sinking ship intensifies my guilt and sadness. I apologize if this is too much sharing, but I am feeling desperate.
