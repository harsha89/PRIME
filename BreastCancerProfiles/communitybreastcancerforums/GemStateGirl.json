    "Content": "GemStateGirl wrote: I have an appointment for a second opinion on Wednesday at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance and am working on my questions. I've had MBC since December 2013 and have gotten about 6 months on all my treatments (Faslodex, Xeloda, and Halaven). I just started Ixempra a month ago. I'm worried that I will relatively quickly run out of options since the anti-hormonals (Tamoxifen and Faslodex) ultimately didn't work for me. My main concern is getting advice on what to do going forward and in what order. I'm also curious about clinical trial recommendations and testing for genetic mutations (Guardant360 and Foundation One). I also want to re-test my estrogen/progesterone and HER2 status and possibly test for androgen receptors as well. I was just wondering if any of you would ask about other things and, if so, what they would be. Thanks in advance for any help you can give me. I feel like I must be missing something since I'm not coming up with a lot of questions. Original dx Stage IIIc, July 2011; bone mets, December 2013; liver mets, May 2014. Treatments: Mast (Rt), ACT Chemo, Radiation, Tamoxifen, Faslodex/Zometa, Xeloda/Zometa, Halaven/Zometa, Ixempra/Zometa Dx 7/27/2011, IDC, 3cm, Stage IIIC, Grade 2, 28/28 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
