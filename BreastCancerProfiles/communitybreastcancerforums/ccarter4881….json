I've been there for 3 treatments now and I am amazed at the competency and how comprehensive they are.  My cancer seems to under control for now, but the depression has gotten very serious and locally I'm not getting the help I need.  I saw a therapist yesterday and she told me that honestly if I were her sister she would tell me to get my mental health care also at U of M where they are trained to treat and council patients dealing with my special needs.   My husband called today and they are setting me up immediately with help.  I can't believe what more than 3 1/2 years of the trauma, mistakes and incompetence of the medical communities I've had to deal with.  I was only a couple of days out of the hospital back in July and that morning I felt the light and hope go out of me.  I'm no longer living...I'm just existing. I haven't always felt this way since my diagnosis.  I used to have hope, I used to laugh, I used to enjoy my family but now I have none of that.  I don't even know if they can help me at U of M. But knowing what I know now, I would NEVER go anywhere except one of the 10 top rated cancer centers in the country.  I checked out CTC and BCBS would cover all but 20%, afraid we could never pay that much out of pocket. Lydia is in Michigan, and I so hope she calls U of M for help. Carla",

My doctor out of G.R. Lack's was never on the same page as the staff.  He would order something scheduled and staff was supposed to call that day and nothing, over and over again.  If I didn't have my scan reports faxed to me directly I wouldn't hear about what was on them for weeks.  When I was in the hospital back in July rather than my doctor telling me he really didn't know what happened and only scheduling a brain MRI, he should have scheduled a PET/CT and not have waited a month or so to do it. I'm glad for you Janis that your experiences have been better, but if things ever do feel like they're not quite right don't wait as long as I did.  Not only have I suffered significant progression, but now I am going to have to fight my way back from depression and anxiety.  All I think now, is what's the point; I'm going to die anyway; why even try.   Carla",

Two years before my diagnosis my mother died at 63 years old and my sister and who I had been close in age and heart my entire life had a huge falling out. I suffered terribly and believe me I made sure we mended that fence when I was diagnosed.  I knew I needed some emotional peace.   I don't think I have ever really handled stress well; always making things a bigger issue than they really are.  Always the over thinker and the worrier to the point of making myself a wreck.   I was misdiagnosed for over a year and my mammograms/ultrsounds showed such an explosion of the cancer over those months of stress.  I just know in my heart that my inability to control and process stress was a huge factor in my illness.   I does seem cruel though to think stress may cause such a horrible disease when the disease alone causes so much stress of it's own.   ",

I'm hoping for a grandchild or 2 before too many years and hoping I'm here and feeling good.  I guess none of us know for sure how long we have on this earth but before BC I didn't think twice about planning for the future.  Now I even think twice before renewing my magazine subscriptions, but I do it anyway! Also my husband and I helped with some of the cost, but since my daughter-in-law and her Mom had been planning this shindig since she was a little girl I didn't have to do anything.  It was all catered and at a beautiful country club which made everything so much more stress free.

I also had my first chemo round of AC, but found out my doctor had changed the \"A\" to a similar drug that was supposed to be a bit less toxic to the heart.  Didn't think about it at the time, but later it made me wonder if something had showed on my MUGA to make him go with the other drug.  I've had no side-effects with the chemo, that I can tell are new anyway, already was having bone pain so pain isn't new.  No nausea or vomitting so that's all good. My appointment with University of Michigan has been scheduled for Tuesday, so am relieved to be finding out their take on my condition.  The woman from U of M told me the only one's she had problems getting my medical records from was my oncologist's office; no surprise there.  That office never seems to do anything in a timely manner; hence my reason for deciding to go to a major leading cancer center.   I had something happen yesterday that broke my heart and I'm still upset and crying about today. My son works for CMU's football team and since the weather was nice my husband and I decided that maybe I was strong enough to go to the game.  The last few months have really knocked the strength out of me so have been laying low at home most of the time.   Well nearing the end of the game I told my husband I was going to head up to the main level and use the bathroom and wait for him up there until the game finished.  Big underestimation of how weak I am.  Because we were low in the stadium I had to take steps UP with no side railings and no seat backs to support or steady myself.  I took 6 or 7 steps up and got very tired so had to sit in one of the vacant seats for a minute and then started up again.  With my balance off and my strength gone I staggered some and had to be helped by a couple of people.  I thought that with my hat it would have been obvious that I was an \"ill\" person not a \"drunk\" person.  But once I got to the platform there were comments from some people about \"thought that kind of stuff was just for the young kids here\" and \"thought I could smell alcohol\"!  I couldn't believe that there were some people that instead of thinking I was ill thought I had been drinking.  I stood there for a couple of minutes stunned and then went into the bathroom and broke down sobbing.  I can't believe how much that hurt; don't know why I let such ignorance from strangers get to me, but it did. My husband and sons were furious when I told them.  Course my husband was also upset for letting me take the stairs alone.   Guess that's my \"worst thing anyone has ever said to you\" since being diagnosed.   Hugs, Carla Crystal, MI",

You're right about just wanting to be here a long time!  Usually that is where my thoughts go on my down days.  On those days I can't see a future, but when I'm back to my \"normal\" the future is still there; right along with the hope I was lacking at the moment!  Here's to a better day tomorrow dear Kim.

I had post partum depression 14 years ago after my youngest was born.  I had no idea what was happening to me; thought I was losing my mind and I would never be the person I was before.  I recovered from that and had another episode a year later, so I'm definitely not a complete stranger to what it's like.  I had actually been quite amazed that I had gotten through a lot of trauma with my cancer diagnosis without falling into a major episode and then \"whoops\" spoke to soon. I even remember the day it started; went to sit on the couch one morning shortly after that hospital visit and it was like the lights went out.  It's been like that and getting worse. I definitely think the Effexor is way too low.  My thyroid levels have been very low so he is also trying to work on those too and my last test showed I was now getting too much synthroid.   I did something I probably shouldn't have tonight because narcotics scare the crap out of me, but I took two Vicadin because it lifts my mood enough that I can stop crying and actually think rationally. I have oxycontin too, but I don't touch that only for severe pain.  I'm not an addictive personality, but that stuff is so powerful for not only pain, but for making life seem perfect.  Downside is that it can have the opposite effect when getting off it. I know narcotic drug addiction is not the answer. Thanks so much for writing to me Elizabeth.  I know we are all struggling so it means so much to me when the wonderful women on this board still offer up hope and support.  You made me feel better and not alone.

You may be one that responds very quickly to anti-depressants and won't have to wait as long as I have been for relief.  You like me have a lot to live for.  My family when I expressed how badly I felt making them suffer just told me not to worry about them, they just want ME to feel better. Let yourself be taken care of so you can start feeling better soon.  We can both be on the road to recovery together. You will have other options with your treatment too; so there is a good chance you won't have the bad side effects you had with the other regimen.  Plus there is so much more that can be done to make you feel better while going through treatment.
