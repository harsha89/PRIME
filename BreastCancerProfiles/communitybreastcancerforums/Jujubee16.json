You're a priority, you're beautiful, important, special and worthy of all the support and love in this world. I'm saying that from my heart. Please make yourself #1 right now. I promise you support, compassion and love will come from the most unlikely of places. My only sibling died a month and a half before my diagnosis on 12/31 and I have found people who I didn't expect, some I barely knew and some I didn't know at all came to my aid. These people cared for me, helped me, felt my pain, and showed me unconditional love when I expected those closest to me to do it. I was lucky to have a good man, friends and family by me but I KNOW you will soon find you are far more loved than you imagine. I'm here. Email me if you ever feel like you need a friend. We are sisters in our battle. United we will beat this disease. May God bless you and keep you strong. You're not alone. everyone here cares",

It had been over a week since my biopsy so I mistakenly told myself nothing was wrong because bad news travels fast. But my doctor was just trying to let me get over the holidays before telling me the news. I insisted on going yesterday as I was off and didn't want to miss a day of work next week. I knew as soon as I walked in something was wrong. The doctor had a nurse with him and he sat very close to me. I was diagnosed with DCIS in one area and IDC in another. I have an MRI next Friday. Just last month I lost my only sibling a 30 years old. She died in her sleep and we are awaiting autopsy results to find out the cause of death. She left me a little 4 year old girl who I plan to raise as my own. Just don't understand why life had to throw this my way. To say I'm overwhelmed wouldn't truly begin to capture my feelings. I haven't even told my poor parents. I feel horrible that after losing their child I'm going to deliver more bad news. I know even if I tell them it's going to be ok they will be afraid. I pray this year I have the strength to get myself healthy again and I will keep all of you in my prayers. Glad this board exists....I feel like no none else would really understand me right now God is within her, she will not fall!

Makes you feel less alone. I was diagnosed on 12/31. Had my MRI friday. If I can give you any advice it is to mentally prepare yourself. I had one back in March 2015 and it was horrible because I didn't know what to expect. This time it was not bad at all. Prepare for a lot of noise, an unusual positioning of your body and most likely an IV for the contrast fluid. If you stay super still it's over in 20 minutes (just relax your mind and think positive thoughts...I'm sure that's a challenge right now...it will be easier). If you move it takes longer. The contrast fluid will make you feel nauseous sometimes or just odd so drink tons of water after to flush it out. As far as your question, I am not an expert so I'm unsure. Maybe one of these kind ladies will answer. I'm curious to know. Sending tons of love and positivity your way. God bless and fight.",

That smile you see in my profile picture hasn't left me. I have my moments. But I have them, wipe the tears and feel a little stronger. My strength comes from accepting I have cancer but also from constantly reminding myself I'm not going anywhere. I'm not afraid of scars, of losing both my breasts, chemo, nothing....my life is my priority. I have always believed there are no mistakes in life, no accidents. Everything has a purpose. At 33 you wouldn't expect to have cancer but I believe there is a bigger purpose to all I'm about to go through. My sister left behind a little girl. And I look at her and see all the motivation and strength I need. Look around at all the people who love you and need you. They are your strength. Think of all those you will inspire. How many women you can lend a helping hand to someday. Once your team is in place you will feel more at ease. But in the meantime know you have myself and all these fellow warriors here with you.

Today I finally met with my doctor who assigned me a breast surgeon, oncologist and plastic surgeon. So I officially have a team yipeee! Until my surgery I won't know the exact stage but so far it's pointing to a stage on. Due to the fact that there's IDC and DCIS in one breast it was recommended that I get a mastectomy followed by chemotherapy. Although I hoped for neither of those I'm happy to finally have a plan. I feel peace knowing that I have a team of doctors on my side and that I am taking the necessary steps to become cancer free. Now I have to mentally prepare myself for surgery. But to be honest I'm not afraid anymore. The will to live kicked in and now I want to fight with all I have. I would appreciate any advice and tips from the ladies who have undergone mastectomy .
