I woke up this morning and my hand (which is my problem area) was a little sore and a little more swollen than usual. I didn't think much about it and just put my glove on as usual (I don't usually need the sleeve unless doing something active w/arm). Then I noticed couple of times during the day my arm was a little sore. When I finally looked at it this afternoon I saw what kind of looked like a light red bruise and then noticed there were more. A few tiny spots look kind of like some sort of bug bite, although I don't think it is, and the other spots look like light red bruises. Another reason for concern is I'm flying to Texas for vacation on Tuesday and if it's an issue w/the lymphedema I need it resolved by then so I can use my compression sleeve and glove to fly. I guess I should call someone tomorrow if it's still there, but in the meantime thought I'd check here for any insight you might have. Thanks, Pat Log in to post a reply",
