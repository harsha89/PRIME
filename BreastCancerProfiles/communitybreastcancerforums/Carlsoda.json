Friday I find out when I start; I asked for early mornings so I can get it done on my way into work. It was however super depressing sitting in the waiting area waiting for my turn. There was about 8 elderly people there talking about chemo/radiation and I'm like...what am I doing here?  It is interesting to see how everyone's routine is different. Mine they just provide a towel in the actual room and you slip off your top and bra and leave it on a chair by your purse. They said I will be in and out usually in 5 minutes. We shall see when I start! Tomorrow is follow up with MO for all my million tests and hopefully oncotype back.  Now sleep....I am wiped out!",

I was explaining to my husband last night how these daily appts have felt like a safety net and I have felt emotionally secure going to a medical appt daily. Once its over then I move from daily care to watching for reoccurance. It is going to feel odd and scary. But I decide last night that it will all be ok. I love my MO and totally trust her and I can move from being a cancer patient to a cancer survivor! I have her watching my back :)",

We are just waiting for the oncotype test to come back before I start treatment. You should at least have an appt with your surgeon. Good luck and big hugs!",
