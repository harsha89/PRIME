I'm someone who gets seasick easily, so of course for me the nausea was pretty bad. It lasted a full week after the first 2 treatments, and then about 9-10 days after the last treatment. Definitely take any drugs they give you for nausea, especially if you are already prone to it! I slept a lot the first week after treatments. Constipation was also an issue, and I got mouth sores after the third treatment. I lost almost all of the hair on my head, but was lucky enough to keep about 20% of my eyebrows, so with a wig on I didn't look too sickly. A couple of weeks after the last AC treatment I felt mostly normal, although bald. I forced myself to keep exercising, and I think that made a big difference. Now, a year later, I look back and notice that this year post-chemo I had 2 UTIs (never had them before) and one asthma incident (lung inflammation). Not sure if it's coincidence, or if my immune system was weaker this year. I also have a full head of curls for the first time in my life, but my oncologist says 90% of people revert back to straight hair a year or two after chemo (fingers crossed I get to keep the curls.) Most importantly, my last mammogram was clear, my life is back to normal, and going through AC is just a memory. I would tell anyone who's facing AC that you can do it! It's just a short-term, painful phase you have to go through to get healthy. A year from now I hope you'll be like me, back to living your usual life. Possibly with curly hair.",
