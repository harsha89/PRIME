      "Content": "Sep 6, 2009 07:38AM - edited Sep 6, 2009 06:55PM by Juli-CA I'm new here and appreciate all of your posts.  Here's where I am:  lumpectomy on July 14, ER+, PR-, HER2+, IDC 1.4 cm, stage 1, grade 3.  I started chemo TCH on Aug. 18 (four days after my son's wedding) every 3 weeks for 6 cycles.  I'll be on Herceptin for a total of one year. I attended a chemo information class two weeks before the beginning of treatment which was very helpful in preparing me and calming me down.  What I learned:  Water: two quarts a day beginning the day before the first treatment.  Take all meds for nausea as directed BEFORE you feel queasy.  Be prepared for hair loss, those receiving Taxotere lose their hair 98% of the time.  So I bought a wig and sewed some head coverings.   Two weeks to the day, my hair started thinning so I had it cut short.  Four days later, that's today, it is very thin.  One thing I did buy ahead of time was a head covering to wear at night so that when the hair is falling out, it doesn't get all over the pillow from  www.tlcdirect.org   When it started to come out, my scalp felt slightly sensitive, as if I had combed my hair one way for so long and then tried to comb it the opposite direction.  I think that I will just shave it off after church tomorrow and get it over with.   So after my first chemo, I felt like a time bomb.  I didn't know if or when the side effects would occur.  I didn't feel anything until day three and that was some fatigue.  By day 6, I needed to say close to the bathroom.  Day 7 tired but OK and dizzy in the evening.  Early on day 8 vomiting, fever and tired.  Off the the ER as the doc said anything over 100.5 means trouble.  I was admitted for two days and two nights and given IV antibiotics.  I must have picked up some virus because all of the blood cultures came back negative.  Some might think this would make me more apprehensive about the next treatment, I figure that I came through this and survived so I am tough enough!  Funny thing, that first night in the hospital, I slept like a log, hadn't slept that well since the diagnosis!  Must have been too rung out from being sick. I have signed up the for Look Good Feel Better class right at the medical center where I receive infusions.  I am really looking forward to that. Next treatment is on Tuesday the 8th.  Juli",

Lisa, I'll ROAR with you!  Thanks for sharing your great attitude. I agree that all of the new ladies should read this thread from the beginning as there is valuable information there.  Also, the whole forum is fantastic.  I especially found the chemo bag a great help.  It is detailed in this thread:  http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/69/topic/478386 Juli",

      "Content": "Sep 17, 2009 08:54PM - edited Sep 17, 2009 08:57PM by Juli-CA I have not posted here for several days but I have been reading.  Maybe I can add a few things.  I'm on day 9 of my second cycle of TCH.  My energy is back and I felt good enough to do some early Christmas shopping.  Wow, how good it felt to feel good! Decadron-it makes me sort of hyper which is fine during the day.  I take it the day before chemo and for three more days but it keeps me awake the night of the first day so I end up taking a sleeping pill.  I feel like I'm chasing  so many drug side effects with more drugs but I won't complain because it keeps the nausea away.  I haven't noticed any weight gain from the decadron.  Wig-I ordered two from TLC before my hair started falling out.  I have a large head so I was pleased that their wigs are sized.  I really like one of the wigs and it looks good on.  The other I will donate to my local ACS wig room so someone can use it.  I also ordered the lightweight night cap that catches your hair as it falls out so you don't have a pillow covered with hair in the morning.  It isn't pretty but it works well.  Hair- mine started falling out 14 days after the first chemo tx and I had it cut short that day: just a bob.  Seven days later, it was so thin I cut it close to the scalp.  That was not easy but my husband of 30 years shaved his mustache for the first time.  That's right, I have never seen him without it until now.  It was a fair trade. LGFB- attend this class on Monday and really enjoyed the experience.  Great volunteers and a nice group of ladies in various stages of chemo.  One has her hair back but told stories of having her wig blow off in the Target parking lot and having to chase it across the lot as the wind blew and it blew off in the car to the back seat when the window was down.  We need to laugh and not cry during some of our adventures.

I am with you on the watering eyes.  Mine have done the same as you have described and there are days they stream down along the side of my nose.  It has not resolved itself so when I see my onc. tomorrow, I'll him ask for solutions.  I have read about the tubes and I hope that will work for you. My hair is about 1/2 inch long and very salt and pepper colored.  My \"natural\" color was medium brown so when I started to turn gray, I colored it.  I'm 51 and a grandmother now but I still think I'll color it again.

My hair is about an inch long and covers my scalp.  The sides are straight but the top seems to be growing in swirls.  Very odd. Before chemo, I colored my hair for 10 years to cover the gray so no one knows me with anything but brown hair.  Now the natural color is mostly salt with some pepper and I do not intend for anyone to see it that way! Since I have several good looking wigs from  tlcdirct.org that's what the outside world sees.(I like the wig liner from TLC too)  At home, I don't wear a wig as they are too warm for me.  Last weekend my husband was taking me to dinner in San Francisco for my birthday.  It had been a busy Saturday running errands and such so when it was time to leave, I changed clothes, grabbed my purse and we headed out the door.  We were down the street when I reached up to scratch my head and noticed I didn't have my wig on!  I told my husband to turn around so that I could go back for it.  He said he had noticed I didn't have it on and thought I looked fine and since I would not see anyone I knew that night, what better place to go without a head cover,  So off we went and had a nice dinner.  DH refers to it as my coming out party with him as the only guest.
