      "Content": "mrshall wrote: Hi, Really appreciate this community.  I just had an U/S guided core biopsy of a 1.6 cm mass (4 samples) that all came back benign.  However, the doctor said that it did not turn out to be a fibroadenoma as expected, instead found sclerosing adenosis, fibrocystic changes, and intraductal papilloma. Basically, he said it's a little round tumor that should be a fibroadenoma, but isn't. Because of this and finding the intraductal papilloma, I'm having a vacuum assisted biopsy that he says will likely remove all of it. This is apparently to be sure that there is no hidden pre-cancer or cancer cells in the mass. Does anyone have any idea how often intraductal papillomas are accompanied by cancer?  Just not sure how worried I should be that I could still get a cancer diagnosis.  Thanks.
