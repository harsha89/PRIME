I'd appreciate any encouraging words that I can print out and pass on to her from those of you who have been through this. I'm sure she'll need all the encouragement she can get...she will have to face chemo and radiation and possibly be put onÂ Tamoxifen after this? Thank you for any advice for after the surgery or how her family can help her through this? Log in to post a reply",
