He sent me for diagnostic mammo and ultrasound. Radiologist came in and told me there was something very concerning on my LEFT breast pics! SHOCK! He wanted me to come back for a biopsy in 2 days. I kept asking, \"What about the lump I found in my right breast\"? He just kept telling me we would worry about that later, my left was extremely concerning to him. Well, had the biopsy, came back the next day, CANCER. \"WHAT\"?????????? This is not happening!!!!! I was told I needed to see a surgeon and that the surgeon would have my treatment plan. Besides surgery, he of course, did not. Radiologist did not explain this process very well. I'm still not quite sure when I see the oncologist. I'm assuming after surgery. So, the surgeon sends me for an MRI to see whats going on in my right breast and get an exact size of the tumor in my left breast (1.7 cm). MRI comes back with 2 very suspicious spots in the right breast. I need to have 2 biopsies done on the same breast at the same time. Let me just say, OW! My breast looks like, as my one daughter told me, \"It looks like your boob is decaying\"! It is black, blue and red all over! Biopsy on my left, did not bruise like this. Get a call from the hospital the next day. The 2 areas are benign! Yea!!!!!!!!!! Whoa.........wait, what? Don't even remember what they said about the first area, something about fibrous tissue. All I remember is her talking about the second area which happened to be close to my nipple. \"You have some FUNKY stuff going on in there.\" Her words, not mine. It is called radial sclerosing. OKKKKKKK..............what the heck is that? She was not very helpful with it, except to tell me they recommend a lumpectomy. So, then I go on an internet search. I find that this is somewhat rare. It can up my chances of breast cancer by 150 to 200%. Can find ABSOLUTELY NO information on having the cancer and RS at the same time in oposite breasts. I called the American Cancer Society to try to get some statistics, they have nothing. They recommend I contact the NCI Seer program. They may have these statistics. My surgeons office, of course, was closed. Praying I hear from them today. Really need someone to go over these results with me again. Anyone out there have these two together in oposite breasts, IDC and Radial Sclerosing? I'm thinking along the lines of bilateral mastectomy. I had already decided to to remove my left breast. I just keep thinking that if this RS ups my chances of breast cancer 150 to 200%, how much more do the odds go up being that I already have breast cancer along with it? I'm thinking they go WAY up! I don't know. I still have 3 of my 6 children to raise. I want to do everything I can, to make sure I don't have to do this again. That if I can do ANYTHING to make sure I'm here to finish raising my babies, I'm doing it. Even if it only ups my chances by .01%. I don't want to mess around! I don't ever want to put my family through this again, because as much as everyone is telliing me. \"This is about you, your body and what's right for you\", it isn't for me. This involves my entire family. From my parents and in-laws to my two grand babies also. They are ALL going through this with me. I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength.

Had a sentinal node biopsy before he began the mastectomies. Was told after surgery that he decided to send everything out instead of getting results from the hospital where the surgery was perfomed. At this point, I don't really care. I am just sooooooooooooooo relieved that the surgery is done and that I feel so good physically. Go back to the surgeon this Friday, the 20th. Should have all results then. Praying to have at least one of these drains removed! Thanks for all the prayers, I really can tell people have been in prayer.

He was informative, concise and had the best bedside manner. He even sort of quized me to make sure I understood everything he said. He thinks because of my age, tumor size and grade (which he said is a 3 not 2) he is recommending chemo. He ordered the oncotype dx test right then and said even if I score in the gray area (which he believes I will) he is recommending chemo. If I score low then we'll pass on it. I left feeling like a weight has been lifted off of my shoulders. I can handle all of this physical stuff, BRING IT ON! It's the mental that has been killing me. Now, I know what the plan is and can move forward, feeling confident! I go back in 2 weeks for the results and if it's to be chemo, he's going easy on me he said.
