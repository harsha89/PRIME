Both my husband and I came to term with the prospect of cancer. At my appointment today, they down graded me to a 4a and told me I didn't even have a lump. I did however have a cluster of microcalcifications and we proceed with the biopsy. Not sure if they are still pleomorphic and in 10 days I will know forsure. I am over the moon with my new stats but also a little angry that the first radiologist was so off. Anyone else have abi-rad change? Log in to post a reply",

When I was given a 4c I convinced myself that it was most like to going to come back with bad news and prepared myself for it. Now that it's a 4a I'd like to say those thoughts when away but they didn't. I should find out the results any time now. They said 7-10 days. If I could reasure you on anything, if you have a stereotatic biopsy it looks scarier than it is. Really easy procedure. And 4b still has good odds . Best of luck :)",
