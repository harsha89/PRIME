The first line in my report actually used the word huge. It was very terrifying. I had my radiology report checked again with my breast surgeons ok and it was what they said the first time. I had surgery first and they were able to remove it all with clear margins. I had 3 lymph nodes invaded. It was a very slow growing cancer grade 1. It is a comfort to read long term survivors stories. I am into my chemo now and finding it pretty hard to handle. DD AC is finished and I just started Taxol. I did have to give up on most house cleaning but I can\u2019t give up my bed full of kitty cats. My onc just said let my kids do the litter box. I wish you all happy days ahead",
