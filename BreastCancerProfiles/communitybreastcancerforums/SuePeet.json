I have an appointment with the onc this morning - but know he will have no words of wisdom! 2 treatments left!!!",

I was diagnosed April Fools Day!  My treatments started June 2 so I hope its OK to be in the May group!  I had every side effect mentioned that first round and was told that that will happen. My biggest advise to anyone - eat lots of fruit and protein before the treatment and right after.  I think what gives me the most trouble is the anti-nasea drugs - I get severly constipated and ended up in Er.  THat was probably the worst experience ever.  The good side - I lost 7 pounds! My friends make meals for us that first week - the problem is that they are meat and potatoes or lasagna meals - the first 2 days after treatment - I would just eat what people gave me as I didn't have the enregy or thought process to care.  After going through this agony twice (yup I am a slow learner!) I am setting up a diet plan my family is responsible to give to me!  I have 4 boys - only three now at home and they range from 10 to 23.  I live in Red Deer Alberta - I have to have 6 treatments where all you guys have mentioned 4 - just wondering why the difference!  I like 4 better!",
