One might predict from this model that raising an animal's temperature would lead to greater resistance to fungi. Lowering body temperature would then be expected to make animals more vulnerable to fungal infections. Frogs and other amphibians in decline around the world - in part because of infections with a chytrid fungus - may provide some evidence that the theory is correct. Warming up infected frogs can help clear them of the fungus, Heitman says. Reducing a mammal's temperature in the laboratory to find out whether lower body temperatures lead to fungal disease is difficult because messing with body temperature can affect many other biological processes. But hibernating bats may provide a clue that Casadevall is onto something, says David Blehert, a microbiologist with the U.S. Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wis. Blehert studies white-nose syndrome, a fungal disease that is killing bats in large numbers in the eastern United States. A fungus called Geomyces destructans infects bats while they are hibernating - a time when body temperatures drop from 40˚ C to about 7˚. \"They're not warm-blooded when they get infected,\" Blehert says. When bats are up and around and at their normal body temperature, they seem impervious to the infection, he says. In a report published November 11 in BMC Biology, Blehert and others described how the fungus, which erodes and replaces the bat's skin, damages wings and leads to death. Casadevall's idea has \"become important in our thinking about this disease,\" Blehert says. The idea of a link between fungal disease and body temperature is not controversial among scientists, Blehert says. \"It's very logical.\" YamahaMama, you mentioned toenail fungus and also your hands cracking. I've noticed a lot of women on these boards have to deal with toenail fungus.  Also, after my daughter moved into a new home, her hands begin to crack like you described.  They discovered the home had mold (fungus) growing in the attic.  (She also had fertility problems and PCOS - Polycistic ovary syndrome during this time, that I feel was related to the mold as well.)  Once the mold problem was remediated, her hands cleared up and she got pregnant.  Anecdotal, I know but just my thoughts and observations. Fever is a way for our bodies to ward off or fight infection, yet when we are sick and we get fever, we try to suppress it with fever reducers. I have never understood that.  The question is...What makes us have low body temp???  I am definitely interested in resetting my body temp.  Thanks for this thread MBJ!!  I have read quite a bit of that website you linked but I'm not really sure what to do to begin.  Sorry about being so windy, just trying to keep warm",

DebRox, looks like you were in a vicious cycle; bacteria, then antibiotics, then yeast, then diflucan.  We all have yeast in our bodies (our intestinal tracts, etc). The key is to have a balance of the \"good\" bacteria and yeasts. But chemicals and meds such as antibiotics kill the \"good\" bacteria thus allowing the yeast to grow out of control.  It all becomes a vicious circle.  I know I have yeast overgrowth and have started taking probiotics to try to get the good bacteria back.  They have helped my digestive symptoms immensely (As long as I take them, I dont have constipation which is something those of us with low body temp all probably struggle with.). Do you take probiotics?  I've read that anyone who has ever taken antibiotics would be helped a great deal by replacing the good bacteria.   ",

It takes over and decomposes our remains, just like a piece of bread molding.  Dust to dust...it's fungi's job. ( A little morbid...sorry).  When our body temps are low, I wonder if the fungi get the message that it's time to start doing their job and we begin to mold (cancer).  Most of us are overrun with candida (fungus) in the first place which could exacerbate the problem. It may seem far fetched to some but that is my mental picture. ",
