I have been in touch with the Hereditary Program and hopefully I can be tested and see if I am positive for the BRCA 2 gene. If am positive I will have the other breast and my ovaries/tubes removed. I went to see a counselor today at the breast clinic and that helped. This is such a nightmare. I will let you know how it goes next week after the surgery. Has anyone heard of \"Inspire Health\" in Vancouver. Thanks",

She also said I should have a total hysterectomy and I was just thinking of removing my ovaries and tubes. I spoke with my gynecologist and after I told her that my sister is positive for BRCA 2 she said that we should discuss my options. I know people are trying to help you but scaring me is not the answer. Finding out I have BC is hard enough to take but also finding out that my sister is BRAC 2 positive really scares me. I am in the process to see if I carry that gene and from that I will decide what I will do. Thanks eveyone",

I wish I didn't loose my hair but I know I will get better and this is just one thing that I have to go through to get there -  then I guess I will be wearing many hats!!! I went to the Look Good Feel Good Program and had a good time.  I lost my eyebrows a couple of years ago I guess due to hormones so I thinking after chemo maybe they will grow back and I actually will have eyebrows - lol  Good luck to everyone this week going through your treatment.  Remember WE CAN BEAT IT!!!!!",
