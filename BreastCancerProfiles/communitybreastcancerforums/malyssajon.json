I feel for you and the non-stop vomiting, I hope they will be able to give you enough meds to control it, somehow I think vomiting after this type of surgery will not be fun!! I went to preop today and I felt like they really didn't tell me anything, physio went over some of the exercises to do after but that was about it. I kinda still feel like I'm walking into the unknown...and I forgot to ask if I could have valium or something prior as I know I'll be super nervous...oh well hopefully I can ask for something the day of!
