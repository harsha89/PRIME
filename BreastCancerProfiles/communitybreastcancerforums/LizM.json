I am comfortable with this,  I am very in tune with my body and if I have any pain or symptom out of the ordinary I wait for 2 to 3 weeks and if it doesn't go away, I contact my oncologist or family physician.   ",

I then chose to remove the other breast prophylactically (sp) because of having dense breasts and also so that they would match. It is my understanding that lumpectomy plus radiation is just as good as mastectomy as far as distant recurrence and overall survival. However, having a lumpectomy does carry a slightly higher risk of local recurrence in the breast. Most surgeons and hospitals push breast conservation as opposed to mastectomy but there are still a lot of us who choose mastectomy for peace of mind. It's a very personal decision.",

Anyway, my arm back to my shoulder blade has been hurting more this week and I wondered if that is a symptom of lymphadema or does one always have swelling of the arm? The only other problem I have had so far is a lump that was formed from fluid build-up in the muscle under my arm which was there during rads but is gone now.

My surgeon is the chief breast surgeon at one of the top cancer centers in US and he was fine with only 8 nodes removed.

I had dose dense chemo (AC X 4 followed by Taxol X 4) and opted for radiation after mastectomy due to studies showing reduced risk of local recurrence when adding radiation with 1 to 3 positive nodes and rads oncologist wanted to radiated the auxilla as well.  Then I opted to remove my ovaries to ensure I could take an aromatase inhibitor since studies show them to be more effective at reducing risk of recurrence than Tamoxifen. (have been taking AI's since 2006 with very few problems)  Chemo put me in chemopause but no guarantees I would stay in menopause unless I surpressed ovaries and at age 50 didn't think I needed them anyway. I was very aggressive with my treatment as my oncologist reminds me when he see me but it gives me peace of mind to know I did everything I could to prevent a recurrence.  In my opinion, your first shot is your best shot.  I know how hard these decisions are to make but we have to do what is right for us.  I followed by gut through my treatment and my gut has served me well.  I do not regret any decisions I made with my treatment.   ",

They went back and tested the specimen from the first biopsy again and it still came back ADH but there was no ADH only ALH in the larger specimen from the excisional biopsy. Due to this I was put on a six month screening program with mammogram (but no MRI). I did ask my breast surgeon if I could also have an ultrasound. Fast foward to Sep 05. Mammogram was clear but ultrasound found a suspicious mass. Biopsy came back as invasive ductal carcinoma. Opted for bi-lateral mastectomy. Final pathology was insitu and infiltrating mammary carcinoma with ductal and lobular features (IDLC). I have since had chemo, rads and am on Arimidex and so far so good. I am telling you this because I am one who had ADH and ALH and ended up with IDC and ILC all in the same breast. Also, the pathology on my prophylactic side came back as ALH so it probably would have developed into IDC and/or ILC down the road. Please ladies be diligent in your screening and I highly recommend having MRI's as part of your screening. My sister was also diagnosed a year and a half before me.",

My advice would be to not get too ahead of what you are currently going through.  Just take it one step at a time.  Your first step will probably be chemo so I would visit the chemo thread and start reading for tips and advice on all things chemo.  You will probably have radiation but that will be after the chemo so you will have plenty of time to prepare for radiation and at that time you can read the radiation thread and learn everything about going thru that part of your treatment.  There is also an area in the forum for those of us with breast reconstruction and for those diagnosed with stage III so you can speak with those with a similar diagnosis.  Breast cancer is very very scary but there is so much treatment available and over 2 million survivors/thrivers.  We are all hear to help through each step of your journey. ",

I have been coming here since fall of 2005 when I was first diagnosed and they have helped me through each step of my treatment and beyond. I was diagnosed in Sep 05 and had my bi-lateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction in Oct 05 (4 weeks from diagnosis to surgery but I had to coordinate surgeon and plastic surgeons schedules). I also had multi-focal breast cancer. I started chemo 5 weeks after surgery. You don't want to wait too long but I don't think a week or two delay in coordinating surgery and reconstruction will adversely affect your wife's outcome. It does sound however, that her breast cancer is somewhat aggressive so I wouldn't want to delay too long. I don't know where you are located or where your wife is being treated but if it were me I would consider having her treatment at an NCI designated cancer center. You wife's situation sounds a little more complicated with the intramammary node so I would ensure she is in goods hands with a very experienced breast surgeon. I am so sorry that you both are dealing with this. Hang in there and feel free to pm me if you have specific questions. Take Care.",

My tumor was 2 mm from the chest wall which also played a part in my decision and my tumor was also close to the skin near my lymph node. My breast surgeon assured me it was not in the skin as he said he took out extra fat which tested negative for cancer; however, I just felt better getting the rads. I also felt better about having my auxilla radiated with the one positive node since I only had 8 total removed and I don't worry about a recurrence in that area as much either. Good luck with your reading and decision and feel free to pm me. Liz",
