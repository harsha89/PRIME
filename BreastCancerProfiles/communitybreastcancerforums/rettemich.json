But this campaign usually doesn't reach these people anyway. Personally I feel it's a marketing scam. They jump on the bandwagon to sell their products, not to raise money. The amount that is donated is usually extremely low. I am just furious at the lack of funding that goes to researching a cure and not just treatment. Kommen is a good one everything on their site pushes just treatment and not actually pushing for a cure. I think most, especially BC are over treated. You are always told that the plan is designed for you, but actually it isn't. They have standard protocols for which ever type of cancer you have. When I really questioned my RO about the radiation treatments, I asked why I had to have the maximum amount even though my cancer was DCIS. The answer \"Standard Practice of Care \". There is no individual program. Now there maybe a few Dr. that do but those are usually private practices. There needs to be a \"revolution\" in demanding a cure, and not just treatment. October should recognize all cancers not just BC. Next we have to start pushing companies to make our food without pesticides, weed killers, GMO's, fillers, toxins need to be taken out of everything not just food.",

That it can take several months for everything to \"settle down\". Was even told Not to bother even looking for a regular bra for at least 3 months. These surgery's are like trauma to the body.  Don't panic and just give it time. I am close to 2 months out and am still swollen and look a little goofy. My PS won't reevaluate until 6 mos out. To allow all the healing. It will all be good just hang (no pun intended) in there.",

My little brain can't absorb all that is going on. I want to have this test as I am on the bubble about the HT will be having Rads no chemo. Plus hoping to reduce the chance by having a reduction proving my margins come back clear. If they do should be doing it within a few weeks after lumpectomy, on 3-25 .

I inquired about a bilateral reduction at the same time but my BS basically wouldn't do it. She said she wanted to be sure the margins are clear first. One minute I think a \"get it\" the next it still confuses me.  I have a tentative appointment on the 28th for the report. If margins are clear I will meet that day with the PS again. He said he would probably do the reduction within a week of that. RADS to start about 4-5 weeks after. Oh I'm a 36 H so yeah been looking forward to it.  But I have no issue with him taking more duct. Should I inquire about having more duct, lobe removal?",
