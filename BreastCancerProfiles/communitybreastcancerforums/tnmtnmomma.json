My diagnosis was 10/8/08. I had a mamo, ultrasound and biopsies of the tumors and arm nodes all on the same day. Got my results within 3 days and met with the surgeon and onc to lay out a plan. Then went for PET/CT scan and test to be sure my heart would take the stress of chemo. I had my chemo first to reduce the size of the tumors (6 treatments 3 weeks apart). Chemo significantly reduced the tumors which made surgery easier. Had surgery 6 weeks after finishing surgery - modified radical mastectomies on both breasts. Margins were clear on both breastsÂ with clean lymph nodes on the left and 4 of 5 with cancer on the right. Currently finishing rads - counting today just 3 left of 33 treatments. As of Thursday afternoon my treatments are behind me. I am really pleased with the group I'm going to, all test results have come back within a few days and the staff has always been great when it comes to informing me of results or anything I would need to know. Most of my questiions were answered before I even though to ask them.",

You need to insist that your doctor does a biopsy and, if he refuses you need to find another doctor. Contact University of PA or another large university for a recomendation if necessary. I am currently in the last 2 1/2 weeks of radiation and then this journey will be behind me - 6 chemo treatments, surgery, radiation (33 sessions). I know I'm a survivor as of 3/9/09 (my surgery date) and will be around for a VERY long time. Also, you really need to discuss this with your husband. You will be surprised how supportive he will be. I was aprehensive to discuss this with my husband (we will be married 45 years in September) and I can't believe how wonderful he as been though this journey. You are in my prayers Maryanne",

I went into the hospital at 7:30 am, had a modified bilateral mastectomy and was discharged the next day. Had 2 drains that I had to empty several times a day and an automatic pump that released local anestetic in the surgical area. That was GREAT! Never had any pain and when it was empty (6 days later) I never felt a thing when it was removed, same thing with the drains. What really fasinated me was there were no stiches on the outside of the insisions, my surgeon used something similar to super glue to close the insisions and the \"bandage\" reminded me of plastic wrap. I didn't have to change it and, since it was water proof I had no problems taking a shower. Life was really good! I'm curently doing rads - only 3 treatments left counting today.",
