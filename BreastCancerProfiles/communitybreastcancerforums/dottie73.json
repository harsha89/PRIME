I try to keep my focused on something or else I start to drift into the \"what if\" stuff.  Just had an MRI today - follow up needed from last week's mammo and ultrasound.  First appt with the surgeon was almost three weeks ago - she took a skin punch biopsy which came out negative but went ahead and sent me for the scans as my symptoms are still present (swollen, tender, pitted/stretched looking skin on my \"girl\" that was irradiated two years ago).  My mind has gone into every dark alley when I heard she either suspected radiation recall or IBC.  Waiting is so hard.  For me, it helps to come on these boards and read posts from positive people who are truly genuine and can relate.  Sometimes that's all I need to get me through...knowing you are not alone. Chin up and pray that all works out well for you.",
