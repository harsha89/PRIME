My onc. said it is more common than you think.  He said I must have suffered some blunt trauma.  I did fall off my bed and land on my left back a month ago or so.  But like other posts mentioned, my onc. said it can just happen without trauma too. I didn't know it could be a lifelong problem, tho.  I have really good bones...but I have always been very accident prone. So I guess I have to be even more careful now.  I hope you don't suffer too much.  Like I said things do heal.  But your attitude is always have the battle. Keep smiling.",

I had 33 radiation treatments (completed 9 months ago) and I have felt drained, fatigued, along with aches and pains in my body.  Especially achy are my hands in the a.m. and shoulders. Now I have nerve pain and numbness on my right leg, which feels like sciatica. My internal med doctor finally did a RA panel. I've read that radiation and/or chemo compromises your immune system.  So any underlying immune problems are either triggered or worsened by such treatment.  Anyone hear something similar?  My numbers were elevated for rheumatoid arthritis.  I have been off of Tamoxifen for six months.  Didn't react well to that.  Doc trying some mild time-released pain meds for now. Ryzolt (tramadol).  Will see a rheumatologist next. Keep your chin up!",

      "Content": "chaparrita1 wrote: In addition to a post rad fractured rib, I am told that the reason for my few to lack of periods, is because radiation usually ruins the uterus. I had an biopsy, no cancer, but my hormone test (FHSA?) is 11, which is way below menopausal numbers.  My gyn says that I am very much pre-menopausal.  This confused me even more.  I thought if anything treatment would 'shoot' me into menopause.  And that my hormone numbers would be high (menopause) This began right at 44 years of age. Is this normal?  She is recommending D&C or ablation and tubal ligation.  Or do nothing.  If I'm supposed to stop menstruating, well that's great.  But if my numbers don't indicate that, and I should be menstruating, what is going on?!?! Or should I thank my good fortune for just being almost done with my periods? BTW I only have 1 ovary and I am still taking precautions. HELP.
