That day I wore a pretty floral tied simply at the back of my neck. I had just checked ot of the supermarket and was walking past the other checkout stations when I noticed a small boy, maybe 4 or 5 years old, jumping up and down and tugging at the hem of mom's shirt. \"Look mom\", he yelled at the top of his voice, \"a PIRATE!!!\". Mom turned bright red and tried frantically to shush him as I, and the other folks in the market, broke into gales of laughter. It still is one of my favorite chemo moments.",
