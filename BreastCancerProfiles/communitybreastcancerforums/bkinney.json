I think far more people will themselves into disease than out of it, so you are pretty special. If you do end up under the knife, that's okay too. I think it's best to keep an open mind, and take advantage of every option that feels right. Healing yourself is hard work, and there are no guarantees. If a little surgery puts you over the top, it's all good. I wish I could help you out with some info about ultrasounds. I've only had mammograms and a biopsy myself, so I put all my energy into understanding what those might mean. Becky",
