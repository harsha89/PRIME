I was initially diagnosed in 2005, bone met in 2007, spot on liver in 2008. My husband told me in Nov that he did not love me anymore...had feelings for someone else. Turns out it is someone I introduced him to. We are currently trying to work it out, but I am not sure what will happen. I was very positive and strong up until this point. He told me at the start that I did not have to worry about him leaving and could concentrate on getting well. Now, I am supposed to work, raise the kids and deal with metastic cancer. I can not even begin to understand what men are thinking.",
