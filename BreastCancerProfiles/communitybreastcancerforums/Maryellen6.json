I am 65 years old, DX with ILC, mass was 2.1cm, stage 2B, Grade 2, ER and PR POSITIVE, HER2 neg. Mass did not show on mamogram but on ultrasound and MRI after I found it myself. I had a bilateral masterctomy in May, 2013  and reconstruction with tissue expanders. They are quite uncomfortable but hopefully worth it. Three lymp nodes were positive (although two with only micro size and one with macro measuring only 3.4mm). I had clean margins at 7mm away. I will be starting chemo this week...4 rounds of A/C followed by 4 rounds of Taxotere. Will also be on Arimedex for at least 5 years following. So the big question for me is radiation. I have consulted with two radiation oncologists at length and they have left the decision to me and I don't want to get this decision wrong and would like some impute please. I spent a couple of hours with both RO. Both RO have said that due to my age (65) they would not recomend radiation. Both have said I am \"on the fence\" for either having it or not having it but at my age both have stated they don't think the benefits outweigh the risks at this point in my life. Both have said radiation gives me about a 3-4 % increase in the cancer not returning. Not a big percentage if you ask me given the side effects.They both went over the treatment and side effects in great detail...pros and cons... My children are grown  and independent and I have a wonderful supportive husband. I want to make the right decision. I really don't want radiation because of the immediate and long term side effects but on the other hand I don't want to look back and regret my decision. Have any of you struggled with this decision? The big factor here seems to be my age, the fact that I had a BMX and will be doing chemo... I know there is no right or wrong answer but am interested to know if any of you struggled with this decision and how you made up your mind. Thank you so much for your impute..
