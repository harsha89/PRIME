In the meanwhile I have downloaded the BCO Pathology Report , made homemade liquid  laundry soap , a homemade  version of Lavender Downy .   A batch of Aloe / Cucumber Eye Gel and prepping to make a Turmeric Beauty Mask . I'm fatigued but have a nervous anxiety. I should probably be outside soaking up some vitamin D  but the moment I stop moving is the moment I start wondering.   So I meditate with positive thoughts of white and blue light's of  ribbon's surrounding me which represent  energy, healing and safety . I pass these ribbons of light on to you as angel's guide us all and keep us healthy .",

I am concerned  as I should be .   I know what I saw on the screen .  What's odd is , as I was explaining the results to my husband I was stopped in mid sentence with the burning needle sticking sensation  after being told all is clear and B9 and  also as I type now . There is obviosly a problem , yet I have no answers as to what is causing this sensation  or the jolt of pain recently.... other than , I have a  small mass .  The exact words  today were  \" It' smaller than a pea \" I hope to get some answers soon .  Take Care and Thanks Again  .",

I had a much better view  on the US .  It was not round , nor was it smooth . It was a black blob on the screen ... definitely not round with lacey looking edges .  I have felt larger  in my left armpit  and did not realize it was my lymph nodes  until I saw my GP about 2 weeks ago .  I thought I had pulled a muscle  or lifted something and just forgot about it but never had any  pain in my armpit .. And was shocked when I was told the mass had not grown but had been there since 2011. ",

Last night while talking to my husband  he asked what was said about the lump in my left breast , what  was the size of the lump etc.... So I called the breast center  today and asked a couple of questions . I was told the 1.2 cm mass  has not changed since your 2011 mamo  . The mass has not grown  and all looked B9. WHAT ?  I didn't know I had a lump in 2011 !  ... no one told you ?  NO !. I said there obviously are changes  . My lymph nodes in my left armpit are swollen and for some time now I have had a burning , itchy sensation with a sensation of needles sticking me  in the area where the mass is located , along with a lightening bolt pain shooting up to my armpit and down my arm   recently .... that's the entire reason for going to my GP and the reason for this Mam and US .  The mass that I thought I had found around 2 weeks ago has been there since 2011 . So I'm assuming I have to return to my GP and ask to see a BS  ?     I thought I was prepared ... but obviously not .  I'm not even sure what the next steps are  . I have exceptional insurance  , thank God..  At this point I would like a biopsy  whether the mass looks B9 or not  .. It's giving me problems  even after 2 weeks of antibiotics. Any advice would be appreciated . Thanks Log in to post a reply",
