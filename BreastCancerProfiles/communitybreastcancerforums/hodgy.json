January 2015 I was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma Stage 1a grade 2 ER+, PR+ at 90% , Her2-, 0 nodes on my right breast. I chose lumpectomy because the ductal cancer was less than 2cm and the invasive was only 8 mm - tiny. I was followed by 16 rounds of radiation. My oncologist did not recommend the oncotype test - wish she did...we all want to know our recurrance percentage. The oncologist assured me the risk was low so I moved on and was thankful I didn't have to do chemo. I still wish I had the oncotype test cause I really want to know I am a low risk. Is it too late to get the oncotype test 6 months later? Also, yesterday I had my 6 month follow-up mammogram. When I arrived they said they only had orders to do the right side. Isn't recurrance possible to come back on the other breast? Shouldn't a mammo on both sides have been appropriate? As we all know - the fear of recurrance is very scary. Any thoughts on this would be appreciated - thanks all! ",

It's good to know I am a low risk for a contralateral breast cancer from my primary bc. Yes, I will be sure to follow up with the annual mammogram.",

The first couple of weeks the radiation is a breeze. Then, your breast becomes very sensitive. Try a sports bra! I'm a size 34 DD.... and I can tell you that a sports bra was very comfortable. I wore it to bed also as I got further into treatment. I also kept wearing it for a couple of weeks after treatment until the sensitivity ended. Don't forget to use the Aquaphor... it helps, too! Best wishes to you!",
