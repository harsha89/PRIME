Working on the brows but am discouraged hearing a lot of women lost them multiple times. However, my hair seemed to be coming in quickly at first. Now I feel like I've hit a plateau. Basically have a little all over but no length to really speak of. Has anyone tried biotin?",

I was totally bald first go around, lost everything. I can't imagine going through this multiple times. I can handle the hair on my head, for some reason eyebrows and eyelashes just bum me out.",
