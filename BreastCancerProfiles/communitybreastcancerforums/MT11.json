Last year February my mammogram showed a small area of calcification on my right breast. I did biopsy, MRI and with agony surgical biopsy in July to remove that small area. The pathology report showed that I had ADH and the surgery removed the remaining fragments of ADH cells left from the initial biopsy. Oncologist did not strongly suggest taking Tamoxifen. She said it is up to me. I declined taking Tamoxifen since the surgeon indicated that if it was her, she would remove the small area rather than taking the tamoxifen since it has side effects. (another institution I went to would not perform surgical biopsy. It recommended medication like Tamoxifen and monitoring closely, or if I don't want medication, just monitoring it closely). I thought I am done with ADH with the surgery. 10 days ago, I went in for the first follow up mammogram. Got a call to go in for Diagnostic mammogram. I went in yesterday. The mammograms show I have a small area of calcification on my right breast and there is even smaller area of calcification on my left breast. The fear creeps in, mentally stressed. Not sure what I am going to do next. I think I should at least do the biopsy. The radiologist suggested that if I do biopsy on the right side, I should do the left side even though the area is very small. I have friends with DCIS and BC. When I told them ADH, they do not know anything about ADH. I feel so alone. I hope there are people out there who have similar situations can share with me their experiences. With grateful heart. ",
