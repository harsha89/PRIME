He also said that many times the shorter treatment involves more effort in planning and positioning to keep heart/lungs out of the field. My assessment of that is that not all Drs are skilled enough or care enough to try, especially if they are getting paid less! (My RO is salaried too). So far I just have mild discomfort in whole breast and my nipple is really sensitive. My skin is doing fine. That could all change this week though...",

I've paced myself with a few short Christmas shopping trips after treatment and occasionally lunching with a friend. Most of the time I just go back home. I am thankful for my friend that has driven me a few times. I didn't think I needed it, but on Tuesday morning I was really tired and shaky, I wouldn't have wanted to drive. Another piece of advice I might offer is to ask your techs to talk to you and explain what they are doing. I am not too proud to say that I had a bit of a panic attack on Monday when things didn't seem right and it was silent - nobody talking to me or in the room. It felt like everybody left for lunch and forgot that I was face down on the table. On Tuesday I asked them to please explain any delays for my own comfort. Surpringly !Voila! Since Monday I've become a real person to them instead of a lab specimen! I also call that progress :)",
