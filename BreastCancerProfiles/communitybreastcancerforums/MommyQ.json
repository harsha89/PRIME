My RO said that a part of my lung will be clipped by the radiation, but the only side effect that might occur is short term asthma, which can be treated. He also said that although they direct the beams to minimize contact with the heart, the heart would get some of the radiation, and although there is the potential for some damage, it's nothing that would \"make me die any younger.\"  So, I'm hopeful that it all goes well. I had my simulation last Wednesday (9/3) so I should be starting treatment sometime this week. If you're super concerned about heart and lung damage, you might look into proton therapy, which is a newer type of radiation treatment. They can control the beams better in proton therapy to stop the radiation beam before it reaches the heart & lungs. The problem is that it's available only in a few hospitals and is not covered by all insurance plans. I wanted to do proton therapy but my insurance doesn't cover it.",

Only negative thing I found out this week was that with my esophagus situated to the left of my spine, my esophagus is getting radiated and will get irritated. So the RO said to expect some mucus build up and a cough/sore throat. In preparation for this, he sent in a Rx for Mary's Magic Mouthwash for me, but the formulation he prescribed was not covered by my insurance, and would cost me ~$60 every 2 weeks out of pocket, so I asked him to see if he could find a different formulation that IS covered by my insurance. I'll find out Monday what they can do. mortmain - Sorry for the slow response. I've been away from this board since Wednesday. My RO also said Tom's of Maine deodorant would be ok for the NON-RADIATED side only and to use nothing or just cornstarch on the radiated side. But I really haven't need deodorant at all recently. Ever since I started Chemo back in April, my sweat doesn't smell at all. I guess the chemo killed all the bacteria? I'm monitoring myself to see if that changes, since chemo is over with, and have a Tom's stick ready in the cabinet to use if needed. :)   As far as the rad-blasts, I recounted yesterday and got 11. On Thursday, I counted 12. Either I can't count or they've been changing it daily! They come from all different directions. Yesterday, I paid attention to where the blasts were originating and found that 3 come from my right side above the table, 5 from my left side above the table, and 3 from my left side below the table. They are blasted sequentially as the gantry rotates around me from one position to the next. The RO said that by doing this, they can avoid my heart and lungs for the most part, although the heart still gets some low dose radiation, and the top part of my left lung is getting hit too. It's the best they can do with IMRT (Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy). jhodro - You're not alone in having problems with memory. I just recently noticed that I am struggling more with remembering things, like names or even just words. I guess chemo brain is what it is! This morning, I saw one of my friends who had his daughter with him and I just could not remember her name! Good luck with your job hunting. What's \"hydrogel?\" Is that Rx or OTC? Puffin2014 - Congrats on finishing chemo! Woo hoo! Happy day! :) Bow1965 - Welcome! I have the same fear as you that they'll radiate the wrong place! I guess we just have to trust they they know what they're doing, since they've been doing it for long time. We're on the same schedule almost. I just started rads Monday and will be done the Wednesday before Halloween. Jaimieh - I get x-rays daily on the table right before each rad treatment. I told my rad techs that was a lot of x-rays, and they said that combined in total, the 33 x-rays will give me less radiation than one regular chest xray. PontiacPeggy - Glad to hear you will get a little break soon to help you rest and recover.",

We'll both be done with rads and get our super Hulk powers by Halloween. :) HomeMom - Bummer about having to deflate your TE.  Will it be deflated completely or just a little bit? You asked if anyone else had had a mastectomy with reconstruction. I had a BMX with TEs and the skin looks ok so far. I've only had 10 sessions of radiation though. lilyrose53 - The machines that administer the rads have to be kept cool, which is why that room is always so cold! My techs always offer a warm blanket to lay over my legs, and I usually have jeans on, so the combo is quite warm. Maybe your techs have blankets too, but just forgot to ask if you wanted one? Or if they don't have them, you could probably bring your own blanket to lay over your legs. charusa - That's funny you asked people to sniff you! Congrats on finishing! I'm glad to hear you made it through with only minor skin issues. Gilesmt - Sorry to hear chemo gave you blood clots in your lungs & that chemo was so hard on you with all the side effects. Hopefully, radiation will be much kinder to you. I didn't even know blood clots was a possible side effect and I was on the same Taxotere Cytoxan cocktail you were on! I hope they can dissover the clots for you quickly. As far as fatigue, my doctors tell me that radiation does not make you fatigued like chemo does. I'm surprised you didn't lose all the hair on your head, like I did. I also lost all my armpit hair and all the hair on my legs, although my arm hair stayed put completely. Well, rest up and I hope you feel better soon. genny5775 - Wow, 60 minutes is a long time to lay still! Maybe you can find a way to distract yourself during that time to make it feel shorter. I know if I think about different things during treatment, like what I'm going to make for dinner and things I have to do later that day, it goes by faster. Good luck. MomMom - Congrats on finishing! Now you can get back to a normal life. Woo hoo! I'm so looking forward to that. Jagerin - Sorry to hear about the horrible skin reaction post rads. Glad to hear your dermatologist helped you out. Thanks for telling us about the Rx (Atrapro gel, Neosalus cream) that helped, in case any of us also will need it. Well, it's late, so I'll sign off here.

I'm continuing to moisturize daily with my Body Shop aloe body butter immediately after showering using Dove bar soap. My chest muscles feel super tight across my TEs. Anyone else experiencing this? I asked my RO about it today, and he said that rads shouldn't cause that at this point, although after rads are done, some scarring could occur and cause some of the muscles to feel tight. Jules_NY - I too am having IMRT with a bolus (which is really just a wet towel they place on top of my chest). They explained that the bolus would help them be able to radiate closer to my skin. mmtagirl - That's a tough decision on whether or not to have radiation. I didn't have a choice. My MO basically said I needed it based on my diagnosis. I think back in the April Chemo board, someone posted an article about how radiation was being recommended more now for folks with lymph node involvement...but I'm not positive.

Then, on the dry run, they'll use permanent markers to mark reference points. He said they don't do tattoos anymore unless patients specifically request it. I'll go for the markers. Less painful and not permanent. Like MakeLemonade's ROs said, they will clip a part of the lung, but it shouldn't cause any problems. He said that now that they can map out our anatomy with the CT scans, they are better at directing radiation away from the heart and lungs.  There is a very small chance of radiation causing asthma, but I think he said it was really rare, and if it happens, he can treat me with meds and it'd be temporary. And he also said that there is slight potential the heart could be affected but it's not anything that would make me die at a younger age. I guess I just have to go through with it and hope for minimal problems. On the 25th, I go to my PT to get help on getting rid of this cording so I can be more comfortable during the radiation treatments.",

My arms are each supported by 2 C-shaped rests that are each about 6\" wide, one supporting the upper and one supporting the lower arm.  My hands are dangling with no support, which I found uncomfortable at the simulation, so at the dry run Friday and at today;s treatment, I intertwined my fingers so they could support each other, and that was comfortable. 1 down, 32 to go! :) And then I start Tamoxifen.",

Regarding SEs, you might not even get any, like Peggy said. But you could consider working part time and having your treatments in the afternoon (towards the end of the work day), so afterwards, you can go home and nap if you need to. That's what I'm doing. Most of my treatments are at 3pm. clarrn: I am working part time (25hrs/wk) while doing radiation. Not sure if it's a good idea or not yet...too early to tell. I took short term disability time off during my 5 months of surgery rehab and chemo, so I was ready to go back. I just hope the fatigue doesn't make even part time difficult. genny5775: Sorry to hear of the insurance woes. Insurance can be a royal pain sometimes. Wish it were simpler.  Peggy: Hang in there.

I had #24 of 28 full breast rads today, and will have 5 boosts after the full breast rads are done. My skin has turned a dark reddish brown with dark spots in the pores in the radiated area, and just started peeling about 2 days ago. I've been using Body Shop aloe body butter on my skin daily after my shower since day 1, and started putting on Aquaphor in the evenings around treatment #15. I also started applying aloe \"juice\" from my plants just this week. The doc said keep up the routine because my skin looks good. I just started feeling the fatigue after treatment #20. It's not too bad, although I needed a 2 hour nap last Saturday! Bride & Blownaway: Regarding the sore throat, my RO had warned me early on that I might get one because my esophagus runs down my neck area closer to the left than in the center, and I'm getting rads on the left side. He prescribed me Mary's Magic mouthwash for it. You might want to ask your RO for a Rx for this if the sore throat continues and is bothersome. Best wishes to all having treatments!",

I just have to be careful to wash carefully in that area so I don't wash the marker off. At treatment each day, they touch up the markers to keep them fresh and visible.",

My PS says that rads will shrink your skin and tissues, so she wants to wait 6 months after rads are done to do the exchange because by then, the skin and tissues should have healed to a steady state condition. She expanded the TE on my radiation/cancer side a bit bigger than my other side, to account for the expected rads induced shrinking.",

I am so glad radiation is almost done. My poor skin hurts from the burns and I am looking forward to it healing back to normal. Those of you who didn't burn are SO LUCKY! It was during the fifth week that the skin burned and started peeling. After treatment #25 was when I noticed the areas that had peeled off had started to hurt. Fortunately, #28 was the last full breast radiation and I switched to local boosts, so much of my skin could start to heal. Now after boost #4, the areas that were burned and hurt are starting to feel better and turn back to \"normal\" skin color instead of bright red. Such a relief. I'm also looking forward to not having to slather Aquaphor on myself anymore! :)",

I was wondering about some things that I haven't seen anybody post about (or at least I couldn't find in my chemo fog mind), so I thought I'd ask. I had my first TC infusion on Wednesday 4/30/14 and have been just worn out since. I don't know how those of you who've returned to work are doing it. My SEs: 1. I've been running a fever of 99.x-100.0 the whole time 2. My vision was a bit foggy on day 2 (Th), 3 (Fr) and part of 4 (Sat). 3. My tissue expanders have not been comfortable at all since the infusion (I had a 100cc fill on the day before the infusion). Feels like they're poking me constantly. I also had some fluid buildup day of the infusion above my right TE & below my port, which I noticed when I got home. I had it checked out the next day and my surgeon said the port was ok. I'm still bruised yellow under the port area (port installed 4/23). 4. Achy neck and back muscles (probably due to #3). Anybody else have these issues? Or is it that everyone does and I'm just a big baby? :) Thanks!",

I'm a bit concerned about the long term effect to our hearts, but I guess there's nothing we can do about it if we want to kill those cancer cells.  And we do! :) mmtagirl: Hey, we did the ice cream run last night too! My husband and 10 year old picked it up and brought it back. It was good. We had turtle sundaes. Ice cream seems to be one of few things that still taste right to me with my chemo tongue, so I'm going to keep indulging in it!  Timbuk2: I don't like people seeing me bald either. I guess it just feels weird. At home, I don't cover up, but as soon as I need to leave the house, I cover up with something. Even to check the mail, I put on a hat! I guess I don't want the looks and don't want to have to explain to everyone what's going on. I like my wigs though. They look very realistic, so I wear those when I am going to be out in public for any length of time. I was fearful originally of them falling off, but have gotten more confident since I've been wearing them a couple weeks now, that they aren't going to fall off. I'm not normally a hat wearer either, so wigs are an adjustment. Best wishes and good vibes out your way for your CT scan. Swissmiss: Good luck with the new MO. I'm glad you're ditching the old one, who wasn't providing very good care. :) Brigadoonbenson: My port was installed under local anesthesia with sedation. I was freaked out about it before the surgery, too!  It took 45 minutes total. I remember nothing from the time the sedative went into my IV drip to the time I was in recovery. Immediately after the port install, I went to see my PS to get my mastectomy drains removed and my first TE fill.  I felt pretty normal...no nausea or sluggishness.  I had bruising in the area right under the port, which remained yellowish for about 4 weeks. The first few days after surgery, I had muscle pain in my neck due to the way they positioned me to get the catheter inserted into my vein. I took ibuprofen for it. Now and then, I get the neck pain again, but it's not as bad as the day after surgery. I don't feel the port now.  I'm glad to have it so they don't have to find a vein for each infusion. The needle stick into the port isn't as painful as the IV needle stick.  Plus, I was told the TC drugs really damage the veins in the arm and hand, so they didn't want to do that. Best wishes on your port surgery. Don't worry. It'll be fine. It's pretty minor as surgeries go. Well, it's my bedtime. Have a good night! I hope tomorrow's a better day for everyone!",

Here goes: Sitting in the chair right now for TC#3 of 6, sucking on ice and eating a Lorna Doone. MO said my white tongue sounds like it wasn't thrush, but instead just the chemo killing off the cells in my mouth, so she said to try to ice my mouth during the T&C drips, to reduce the amount of chemo that attacks my mouth cells. Hopefully it works. EverForward: I too look on the bright side with the good things you listed. Well, except for the no-period because I'm still getting mine (boo!). Jaimieh: Nice wig...looks like real hair! They've gotten so much better with the wigs these days, which is so nice. Timbuktu: If your wig feels too loose, try a smaller size. Wigs seem to come in 3 sizes: petite, average, and large. Mine all seem to stay pretty well, even when I drive with my convertible top down. :) Good job remembering a phone number on chemo. I couldn't even remember phone numbers even before chemo! MakeLemonade: Congrats on finishing A/C! Gotta celebrate each milestone. I too am exhausted right after my infusion, usually the first 11 days after chemo, but then I have 10 good days afterwards until my next infusiion. We gotta enjoy the good days and look forward to them on the bad days. SwissMiss: I only get blood work the day of my infusions (once every 3 weeks). But I think that's because I get the Neulasta shots. Once a week is a lot of vein sticks. Yuck. Sorry you have to go through that. DeeC: Wig looks great and just like real hair! Hang in there...only 3 more to go! You can do it! I'm looking forward to hearing how radiation goes for you since I will be doing the rads in September when I'm done with my chemo. And enjoy the good days! LongIsland: So sorry for your loss. I hope the drive goes well. Just plan a lot of rest stops and I think you'll be fine. Cold, clarrn, Blueberry, and jhodro: I like my Toyota RAV4. It's a good size for me (family of 4). Good space but not too big as to be hard to park. I have friends and family who like the Honda CRV, the Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot, Lexus RX350, and Acura MDX. The Subara Forrester (more of a tall wagon) is also a favorite of friends. I'm a car girl so ask me anything about cars. :) I love to talk cars. Mompv: Good luck with your first infusion. You can take Ibuprofen for the soreness..they let me take them for my port installation soreness, which helped. Start the Claritin right after your infusion and take for several days afterwards (I only take for about 3 days but I think others on this board take it for a week). mmtagirl: Congrats on finishing A/C! Whoo hoo! :) You're brave to have that many people over! I'd be afraid to do that even if I WASN'T on chemo! MikiShelly: Thanks for the postchemo report. Sorry to hear about the neuropathy. I hope it goes away for you soon. As far as hair regrowth, I'd gladly take that over chemo anyday! :) DId you know the Komen Race is this Saturday? I can't go because I will be exhausted and be spending my day in bed, so I signed up for \"Sleep in for the Cure,\" which I wasn't even aware of until this year. It lets me support the cause but not have to physically go downtown. I plan to go next year to walk for sure though!  Footballnut: Great pics! Linda505: Good luck with your CT scan. Hope it turns out well. Cold: I miss good food too! Only ice cream and cheese taste good for a week and a half after infusions.

Thanks for looking online for possible causes, but actually, the \"C\" in my \"TC\" treatment is Cytoxan, not Carboplatan. Sorry for the misunderstanding. I took a Claritin Thursday and Friday around 3pm to aid in minimizing muscle pain from my Thursday Neulasta shot. I think my problem was dehydration. Jen: Glad to hear you're feeling better post chemo. I was only in the hospital one night after my BMX. The hardest part for me was not being able to lift myself up from bed and lay myself down without help for the first 2 weeks afterwards. It was just painful. Also, the drains were uncomfortable. The surgery scars themselves surprisingly didn't bother me too much. Washing my hair was a pain too.  I had hair half way down my back. Trying to keep my chest area dry while washing that much hair was crazy. Plus, I couldn't raise my arms up that high so my husband or my daughter had to do it! So, take a really good shower/bath before you go in for surgery! :) ",

Yay, you're getting rid of your port! I haven't scheduled mine yet. My simulation is 9/3. I don't know if I should remove the port before rads or after. Are you just doing an in-office port removal or going into the hospital for surgery? Jen: If you are prone to nausea, let your BS know and he/she will set you up with anti-nausea meds during surgery and afterwards, to make sure you are ok. I did that and I don't remember really suffering from nausea. Best of luck tomorrow! EverForward: My SEs seem to be about the same for each chemo cycle. But maybe it's totally unrelated to chemo and you're just allergic to something in California that's making your nose and eyes water.  Hopefully it gets better. Enjoy your recoop time at the cabin!

Regarding pity looks, honestly, I don't really pay attention to whether people are looking at me or not. I guess ignorance is bliss??? :)  But that's horrible the stories here about being ignored or left out. Maybe people are scared and don't know what to say to us? Everforward-Nice picnic! Footballnut-Congrats on being BRCA negative! That's excellent news. I'll be in the chemo chair July 2 with you, also getting Taxotere, but I will also have Cytoxan. Side effects of Taxotere include the potential issues with nails and the tongue. Try to keep ice chips in your mouth during the infusion to minimize that. Some folks ice their hands and feet too, but I haven't and so far, I only have the dark rings from the Taxotere. Sorry to hear that your husband can't go with you anymore. That's awful of your husband's employer to deny his support of you. So wrong. Cold-I have the tight, sore leg muscles too! I thought it was only me. I can't reach my toes as easily anymore. SharonDe-congrats on your last infusion! Yay! Sunshine-sorry to hear about your mouth sores and swelling. I hope the doc can help you feel better. SwissMiss-That is pretty awful about the mom who routed her kids around the bushes. Rude. Some people are just ignorant. I have a new topic - PROTON THERAPY vs conventional photon Radiation Therapy. Anybody know much about it, or been through it, or is considering doing proton therapy? It sounds safer than the conventional radiation therapy, so I'm trying to learn more about it. I'm supposed to have radiation therapy after chemo is done.",

Went for my ultrasound for the lump under my armpit after lunch, and found out that it was just fluid...a seroma. Whew. It's small, so we're just going to leave it alone. It's right up next to my TE, so it'd be risky to try to take a needle to drain it. Went out for dinner with the hubby and kids at a great Vietnamese place and the Pho tasted great. That means my taste buds haven't gone all funky this time yet. My head is sweating and I'm alternating between being hot and cold. Hot flashes, I guess! LongIsland: Thanks for posting that article. I think it's great how celebrities are sharing their stories. It raises awareness for people to be more proactive in managing their health. I made the mistake of thinking I was too young to have cancer and ignored a small lump a year ago, which got bigger this year and well...here I am. Linda: Thanks for the compliment on my photo! I didn't know Joan Lunden has BC. Seems more and more celebrities are going public with their diagnoses. I guess it's become more publicly acceptable. Timbuktu: Good luck figuring out what to do. It's good you have the best docs helping you. Mompv: Drinking is important and I also find that it's hard to drink as much as the docs want you to! Have you tried Gatorade? That seems easiest for me to drink. Or lemonade or tea. I get so tired of plain water. Swissmiss: Sorry to hear of your air conditioning and cough woes. Glad your Taxol went well. Footballnut: Hope your nail thing is no big deal. After your post, I looked at my nails and I also have a vertical line on both thumbs and one index finger, although mine are fairly new since this last infusion, so they're probably chemo induced. I'm interested to hear what you find out. Lena-Lou: Welcome to the board! jbokland: Congrats on your wedding! Y'all look beautiful and happy! Well, it's late and I should get to sleep.

I think it's pretty cool that a bunch of you are done or almost done with chemo, and that time has flown since April when we all started. Before you know it, it'll be April 2015 and we'll all be looking back on this as just a small blip in our lives as we carry on and return to life as it was (or as close as possible) pre-chemo. It's a beautiful 75 degree day here in St. Louis, so I'm going to go take a short drive to the pet store with the convertible top down, to get some pinkie mice for my daughter's snake soon. I know they say we're supposed to avoid sun exposure, but I think we need some in order for our bodies to make Vitamin D, which is good for us. I drove about half hour in the sun last week and I think I tanned a little bit, but no burn. I want to thank those of you who recommended the Buff head coverings. It was a LONG time ago, so I don't remember who mentioned them...sorry!  I now have 2 and find myself wearing those a lot because they are easy to put on and take off, and easy to wash. Plus they're cooler for summer. Everforward: My good days aren't as good as they used to be either. Starting with treatment #4, I've felt like I get tired in general a lot easier & have been tired more days during this cycle.  And like you, my muscles are tired all the time. Just walking up the stairs makes my muscles feel like I've biked 30 miles. I can't wait to regain my energy when the chemo is done! Hang in there. Only 2 more to go! Holly: I'm the same way! Before chemo, I'd never be found sitting still. Now, I'm almost always on the couch! But I tell myself it's only temporary. And am enjoying reading, shopping on the Internet, and watching movies while I'm stuck on the couch. :) Lena-lou: 102? Hope your fever has continued to drop. If not, I hope you've called your doc. Next week, I get my TC #5 of 6. #5 & #6 are optional for me, but I think I'm going to do them anyway. The more the better, right? Have a good day!",

She figures that in case 6 is better than 4, she'd like me to get the 6. So, while I'd love to stop now with 4 done, I guess I should go ahead and do the 6. linda505 - LOVE that card, LOL.",

I'm just curious, since only certain nurses are allowed to access them. I just don't know how available these special nurses are for non-chemo related events. MomMom: I can't wait to get my port out either. I asked my MO about \"maintenance\" for a port left in after chemo. She said although the official guideline is flushing it once a month, it really only needs to be flushed about once every 3 months. She had one patient who went several years before getting it flushed and it was fine...although my MO wouldn't recommend that! :) For those who have finished chemo, CONGRATS!!!

Just enjoyed a beautiful top down ride to the hospital for my Neulasta shot. Now I'm just dreading the muscle aches that are sure to come! I'm starting to feel a little tired, so I'm trying to catch up on this board before I go into chemo-induced hibernation for the next 3 days! Lakegirl1: I too need lots of rest stops when walking, starting about 5 days after infusions, and they last about a week to a week and a half. I think it's anemia. I also had one day when I felt lightheaded. I was outside in the heat and humidity and drinking a hot Starbucks mocha. I went inside the air-conditioned Starbucks, took my pulse (120 bpm!), stopped drinking my mocha, and downed 16 ounces of water. I felt a bit better about 1/2 hour later. I've been minimizing caffeine since then and making sure keep hydrated & cool. Seems to help. Longislandl8y: Congrats on finishing chemo! Yay! You're so lucky you got to keep a lot of your hair! I'm completely bald from TC. Best of luck with rads. I will be joining you in that about a month later.  Swissmiss: Not the A/C again! Hope they fix that for your quickly.

It's so great that we can share our stories and help each out! HollyHope: That's reassuring to hear you're getting your hair and energy back, and Tamoxifen is going well! Woo hoo! Things will get better! MomMom: Congrats on finishing chemo! Woo hoo! That was so nice of your grandchild to make you that poster! clarrn & Everforward: Sounds like a lot of us are having the issue with the high pulse rates. I have it every cycle, from day 5-10. My MO said not to worry about it unless there's bloating in the legs/arms, chest pain, difficulty breathing, or lightheadedness. On the flip side, I noticed a super LOW pulse rate on the night of infusion #4 of 49 bpm! Freaked me out. I've never seen my pulse rate drop below 70. Ever. In my entire life. Last night, after infusion #5, I measured 55 bpm. Still low but not as frightening. It's working it's way back up today, around 80 already. Do you (or anyone else here) get the super low pulse rate on the night of chemo? Mscaruso: With a year of treatments remaining, I recommend you get the port, also. I didn't like it for the first 3 days because I had some muscle aches from the way the doc positioned my head during the surgery, but now, I'm glad to have it for my infusions. Much less painful that finding a vein in the arm! MakeLemonade: Congrats on coming up to the final Taxol! Sorry to hear about the cellulitis. Hope the meds start working soon or they get you something better. ColdInCanada: Congrats on kicking 6 rounds!  applepop: Early congrats on finishing!

This was about the same time the weather got nice and I started driving around in my convertible with the top open, for 15-30 minutes at a time, every couple of days. I wonder if that good ole Vitamin D-generating sunshine did the trick?

It's been a while since I've posted since I've gone back to work now, although I've still been reading the posts and trying to keep up. I've also been spending more time over on the Fall Rads Board since I'm doing rads now. At 6 weeks PFC, I have soft fuzzy hair about 1/4\" long, which is so thin that I still look bald from 2 feet away. It's black on top and white on the sides. I'm gonna be a skunk! Or a reversed skunk, I guess. :) My eyelashes continue to fall out and they're almost completely gone on the bottom and about half there on the top. Eyebrows are falling out AND growing in at the same time. Weird. I've mastered penciling in fake brows now, just in time for having to start plucking wayward brow hair that are growing in in the wrong places. And I shaved my legs about a week ago. It was the first time since about 3 weeks into chemo. It was soft, fuzzy, light colored hair, which is weird because it's normally black.  Does anyone still have their port in place, like me? I'm waiting until after rads are done to get it taken out. I figure I'd try to do only one thing at a time medically! I think my MO said that I'd have to get it flushed every 3 months if I kept it in.  By the time rads are done, I'll be just 2 weeks short of 3 months. :) mmtagirl - That's a perfect description of the TEs! You said that it felt like wearing an iron bra, and I thought, \"YES! Exactly!\" I've had mine in since April and will have them for about 6 months after completion of radiation in October before my PS will do the exchange surgery. So in total, I'll have them in about a year! EverForward - I too found the TEs got more comfortable after a fill or 2. I think when they were empty, they sat flat and had ridges that poked me in the ribs. Once they filled up a bit, the ridges went away. It's so nice that everyone is starting to feel better and recovering well from chemo. We had a rough summer, didn't we, but we made it to the other side just fine. ",

I dunno.   linda505: That's too funny that the LGFB teacher tried to rub off your real brows! All the ladies at my class still had their brows too, so we all just used the brow pencil to fill and shape.  I still have all of my eyebrows, although when I was plucking the straggler hairs last week, I noticed they pulled out with little force and didn't hurt at all! So, while it was nice to pluck with no pain, it was an indicator that the rest are probably going to fall out soon. :( Lakegirl1: My MO told me that my acne is due to the Dexamethasone, so if you're taking that, it might be the cause. I broke out all over my upper chest and my upper back a few days after taking it. It's about cleared up today, just in time for my next dose of Dexamethasone! Sheesh. Ddkath70: Yes, I had the bone and CT scans. The injection is for the bone scan and has to be injected 2.5 hours prior to the scan. For the CT scan, they'll have you drink the special smoothie 2 hours, 1 hour, and right at time of the CT scan, plus they'll inject you with the tracer (?) at the time of the scan.",

Hope all the Moms had a good Mother's Day! linda505: Thanks for the tip on drinking stuff other than water. I switched to apple juice, lemonade, and Vitamin water, and the variety and taste make is much easier to stay hydrated! ColdInCanada: Thanks for clarifying what you mean by exercise. I feel much better now. Oh, and the snails said \"Hi!.\" :D Oh, and I spoke too soon regarding the eye twitching. My left eye started twitching a bit about 3 days ago. Now my right eye just started today. DOH! LovebeingNana: Thanks for the tip on changing nausea meds to prevent headaches. I'll have to mention that to my MO next week at my next infusion. And hang in there. Chemo is tough but we're tougher and we'll get through it! One day at a time. Jaimieh: Hi! You said you lost my eyebrows on TC last time about 6 weeks after all your chemo was over. How many infusions of TC did you have? I'm just trying to prepare for when mine will fall out. I'm to have 4 to 6 infusions, depending on how my body handles them. Golfingirl: I too experienced dizziness everyday until about 8 days after my infusion. About 6 days after the infusion, I noticed that my heartbeat was rapid. I took my pulse and found that I had a resting heart rate between 100 - 120 bpm. I talked to my MO and she wasn't sure what the cause was, but we both agreed that maybe it was anemia causing it.  11 days after the infusion, it dropped just below 100 and it's been hovering there for the past 3 days. She told me to monitor it and go to the ER if it went above 120 AND I had any chest pain or shortness of breath. Timbuktu: Day 14 is the last day of nadir for the C part of your TC (Nadir is days 5-7 for T, days 10-14 for C), so that may be why you're tired. I think rest is probably better than pushing it if you feel tired. It's like your body is saying, \"Hey, take a rest and heal!\" mikishelly: Glad to hear you made it through your WBC scare! Whew! Ddkath70 & babygoose: Welcome. You've found a great group of ladies here that are all very supportive and helpful. Together, we will get through this.  Ddkath70: As far as level of sharing, it's a personal preference. I chose to share with family, closer friends, and co-workers, but not with my Facebook group. It's just what you're comfortable with. But all the people I've shared with have been greatly supportive, so it might help to share with some people. I understand why you don't want to share with your FB network...makes sense. Sorry to hear you just got laid-off. Hang in there. You'll get through this. BTW, I have the port, and had the CT and bone scan recently, so let me know if you have any questions about those. Also, I'm on TC. My MO said the A part of the A-CT is rougher on the heart so she didn't recommend it for me, since I'm young and my heart will have to keep me going for a long time. That's great your MIL will be flying in to help. My MIL also came in for 2 wks and it was great. She cooked and cleaned and got the kids to school, so my husband could continue to work. Regarding products, I had to buy unscented body butter (Body Shop Aloe) and soap (Dove) because any scents made me nauseated. Biotene mouthwash is nice because it's minty/refreshing for when your tongue feels and tastes weird. Baking soda/salt/water mix (1/2 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp salt, 4 oz water) seemed to keep the mouth sores from occurring. Flushable moist wipes help with any irritated skin after bowel movements. Footballnut & jhodro: Thanks for letting me know about the tipping not being required. I am just the worst at knowing when I'm supposed to tip or not! I think I'm going to go tomorrow to get fitted.  Have a good evening ladies! ",

But it's going to take a lot of educating to get the consumers to understand what's bad. I personally never looked at ingredients a couple of years ago...blissfully unaware of all the bad stuff.   And I also agree that you can't just take the fact that the label says \"Natural\" and buy it. We need to actually read the ingredients to see what's in the product, and understand what are good and bad ingredients. I'm learning a lot this year about what these are so I can hopefully make smarter decisions going forward. Ddkath70: I suppose it could be a combo of the chemo AND the fibromyalgia. Have you tried acupuncture? My sister-in-law has fibromyalgia and says it helps her a lot. 109 degrees is way too hot to go out! I know people say it's a \"dry heat\" but 109 is still HOT. :) You're lucky you're almost done with chemo. Yay! I have #5 tomorrow but I am doing a total of 6 so I finish mid August. I also can't wait until the treatments are complete! SharonDe: I can't stand up for very long either. I guess it's all related to this muscle weakness we're experiencing. It's good to hear you're working your way up to some exercises. I plan to do that too after I'm done in August. Well, on this day before the chair, I felt well enough to meet my coworkers for a fun lunch to catch up. Since my treatments are 3 weeks apart, I've been scheduling lunches every 3 weeks, right before each chemo. It's been a good way to keep in touch with everyone at work, since I'm on short term disability during chemo. Everyone is so supportive, it's nice to see them.",

A professional cosmetologist went over how to apply each makeup item in the bag as we each applied the makeup to ourselves, and then went over scarf tying and other options to wigs. Very organized and well executed. I attached a photo of the gift bag and the stuff in it. There was makeup from Lancome, Estee Lauder, Elizabeth Arden, Mary Kay, OPI, Smashbox, Kiehl, Cover Girl, Biore, Olay, it Cosmetics, and NYC.

Regarding the port, my MO told me that my chemo drugs (TC) are rough on veins and didn't want to have to do an IV for me 6 times for the infusions, due to the damage chemo would inflict. That's why she had me get the port.  I don't know which chemo drugs they are recommending for you, but like Linda505 said, you'll get the Herceptin since you're HER2 +, and you'll probably be glad to have the port instead of having a new IV done each time for a year.  It looks a bit weird but it's pretty easy to cover up and is only temporary. clarrn: I bet you're glad you're on the last AC infusion!

Usually, it's crazy hot & humid here in the summers (90s-100s), but it's been 70s-low 90s so far, so I've been walking my dog when I feel up to it (when I'm not out of breath taking only 3 steps). SwissMiss: I think it's gonna take several months before we can ditch our headcovers, unfortunately. :( I hear it takes a while for the hair to come back. Glad you're feeling better each day, though! MomMom: That's great that rads are going well for you and port removal was a piece of cake! I haven't decided whether to get mine out before rads or wait until after they're done. Timbuktu & Mscaruso: I'm always amazed when I find out about others who've beat BC. There are SO many of us out there. You can't tell by looking at them because they've resumed a normal life, and we will too. One day at a time. We'll get there. :)",

I was in a similar situation to you. My MO told me that my 2 choices of treatment were TC (Taxotere and Cytoxan) every 3 wks for 4-6 treatments or dose-dense AC (Adriamycin and Cytoxan) every 2 wks for 4 treatments followed by 4 treatments of Taxol every 2 wks.  I was also given the option of participating in the NSABP B-47 Herceptin study for HER2- patients.  My MO recommended the TC because like linda505 said, the Adriamycin is hard on your heart. My MO said if I were older, she might recommend the dose-dense AC+Taxol, but since I'm only 43, and will need my heart to be in good shape for many many more years to come, she recommended the TC. I also confirmed this recommendation via a 2nd opinion from another doctor, who told me that these 2 treatments are very similar in results with AC+Taxol being maybe 2-3% more effective (essentially the 3% improvement your MO quoted also) but with more heart risks.  Now that I've had 2 TC infusions, with my resting heart rate at 95-120 bpm for the full week after infusion, I'm personally glad I didn't choose the AC+Taxol to tax my heart even more. That's just my experience. Everyone is different. As far as the Herceptin study, I chose not to participate, due to my own selfishness in wanting to be just done with chemo after the 6 TC infusions. Participating in the study would have required me to come in every 3 weeks for the Herceptin until a whole year after my first infusion, AND I would have to come back regularly for years afterwards to submit blood samples for the study. It was hard enough dealing with having to do chemo for 4 months, after having a BMX, and knowing I had radiation, an implant exchange surgery, and 10 years of hormone therapy to follow. Just too much for me.",

It's so nice having a place like this for us to talk and share our experiences and share helpful advice! brigadoonbenson: Thanks for the welcome! You're so lucky to have little SEs! Good luck to you on Wednesday! linda505: Sounds like we both (and several others on this board) have similar discomfort with our TEs & slightly cloudy vision. I guess those SEs must be normal. On Sunday, I called my MO because I read 100.6 degrees when I woke from a nap. Turns out I was just overheated from blankets because it dropped to 99.8 by the time my MO called me back a few minutes later.  She asked if I had any signs of infection (redness/heat/swelling around TEs, pain urinating) and I told her no.  She told me that it was unusual to have a fever from infection until midcycle because that's when the blood counts are down, but to just keep monitoring my temperature and to NOT take any Advil or Tylenol, which would mask any fever I might have. Oh, and I DID have the Neulasta shot on Thursday, May 1, the day after my chemo. clarrn: I think you're right that chemo makes everything exacerbated! And yes, I did take the Dexamethasone on chemo day and the 2 days flanking it. Blueberry4: I've also been dizzy and feeling generally off balance since the infusion. I hope the dizziness and TE pains lessen before the next fill and chemo!  I hope your hair appointment went well. Spunky825: Welcome! I am also on TC (started 4/30), so we can share and compare war stories. :) ColdInCanada: I find that I also raise my temp if I do too much, but I've been laying around a lot! I increased my fluid intake yesterday to about 2.5 quarts of water and felt better. Maybe I was dehydrated too because I wasn't drinking enough. Hope that snow goes away soon for you!  chknfeet: Glad you didn't end up having to stay at the hospital and they got your temps back to normal. I tried drinking a lot of water yesterday and DID feel better, so hydration must be the trick! My TEs also poke my ribs and my armpits! I can't get comfortable for long in any position so sleeping has been in spurts of about 3 hours at a time. So, are the TEs feeling better since you skipped a fill? My PS wants to do a lot of fills early on because she said that it's easier to stretch everything within the first 6 weeks after the insertion. However, since I can't swap the TEs out for my gummy bear implants until after chemo and radiation are both done plus a 6 months wait (so we're looking at April 2015), I probably could slow it down a bit on fills. :)",

I put a call into my MO to ask but haven't heard back yet. How are y'all exercising so much? I can barely manage just the half mile walk to take my daughter to school! Brigadoonbenson: I don't take anything for pain since my MO said no Tylenol or Advil. My pain's not too bad. Just the muscle pains from the TEs. I just try to lie down & rest a bit when they bother me a lot. LoveBeingNana: I too have had a lingering headache ever since my infusion. I'm on day 8 today and it's not too bad today, but it keeps coming back every morning! If you figure out a way to get rid of them, please let me know. And good luck to you tomorrow for your next infusion. Spunky825: I think I need to dial down my fills like you. My first fill was 60cc and I didn't even feel it at all. The 100cc 2nd fill followed immediately by chemo did me in.  I also understand your tiredness making it hard to exercise.  Chknfeet: I'm curious to hear what your PS says about filling early.

So, today, when I noticed my tongue starting to turn white again, I called. They phoned in a prescription for Fluconazole, a one dose pill. FYI, in case it happens to you.

So, I look at body lotions & sunscreens mainly. As far as cosmetics, I figure they are applied to a much smaller skin surface area, so I'm not as concerned there. (Note: I only eyeliner and eyebrow pencil, so that's why I'm not as concerned regarding makeup). Many companies do offer good products without those pesky bad chemicals. I just bought a Burt's Bees lemon oil to use after showering because it's 100% natural and smells good without artificial perfumes. Everything Burt's Bees is 99% or 100% natural.  I also like their lip shimmer, which smells like peppermint and adds a bit of natural looking color, again with no synthetic perfumes.  I also use a Body Shop Aloe body butter, which doesn't have any of the bad ingredients and is fragrance free. I also started looking at sunscreens and trying to switch to physical blockers, meaning ones that use titanium oxide and/or zinc oxide, which don't get absorbed into the skin, instead of the bad bad oxybenzone, which is readily absorbed and is a hormone disruptor (BAD!). But I do allow myself to spritz on perfume here and there as a treat because I LOVE scents and can't give them up 100%. Moderation is key to everything, IMHO. jhodro: Congrats on your last chemo! Whoo hoo! Ddkath70: You're not alone. A bunch of folks on this board, myself included, are always out of breath even just walking a few steps. The fatigue IS cumulative, like they warned us. It just sux. I can't wait to get my energy back. I also started getting muscle aches after my TC#4. My leg and arm muscles all feel like I've done a crazy workout after doing such minor things.

Good distractions and reminders of our normal lives that we'll get back to soon! To prepare for the chair, I thought I'd go to Target & pick up some yogurt to eat this week (to hopefully help with chemo-induced-bad-tummy-week). So before going, I was thinking that while I'm there, I might as well pick up school supplies for my 8th grader. So, I go & arrive home from Target with the school supplies, but no yogurt. Chemo-brain attacks again.....argh!!!  Sigh. I even had a list. Oh well. I'll go out later after dinner & get my yogurt at the grocery store. I like their selection of flavors better anyway. :) Footballnut: I hope you have better luck with Taxol than Taxo-terrible. I'll be in the chair tomorrow 9:30am for Taxo-terrible.  Interesting what you said about different interpretations. My husband and I do the same thing too. We hear things totally differently and sometimes one of us hears something the other doesn't hear at all!  I think different people just have different expectations and that causes us to hear different things. That's why it was great to have a companion during all the initial diagnosis and planning of treatment appointments with all the doctors!  Re: bad ingredients, I see you like shea butter, too.  The Aloe body butter I use has shea butter as the #2 ingredient (after water) and seems to be free of the bad ingredients (as far as I know...please correct me if I'm wrong). If you're interested (and no I don't work for them and am not pushing their product!), here are links to both the Canadian and the US product pages for this item, which list the ingredients in one of the tabs on the page:  http://www.thebodyshop.ca/en/body-moisturisers/body-butter/regular-body-butter/aloe-body-butter.aspx http://www.thebodyshop-usa.com/shop-by-line/aloe-skin-care/aloe-body-butter.aspx",

I was doing low key stuff, but still...stuff! I was having problems being out of breath early last week, but it progressively got better by this past weekend, so I was able to get off the couch a bit more, and actually take the dog on short walks.  Gotta celebrate all the little things. SharonDe: You know what I mean. Like being able to walk up the stairs! :) We went to see Guardians of the Galaxy this weekend, and we all really enjoyed it. If you like any of the Marvel movies (Avengers, Thor, Iron Man), you'll like this one, too. I also watched the first three Bourne movies (borrowed them from the library) with my 13 year old daughter, and enjoyed those, too.  Trying to get #4 from Redbox but it hasn't been available the times I've checked. Went to my PT yesterday and she \"graduated\" me! Woo hoo! Done with PT visits. I still need to continue with my stretches and exercises to keep my body in good shape for my exchange surgery next Spring.  During this visit, my PT realized I had AWS (axillary web syndrome), or \"cording.\" That's why my arm hurts when I reach up high or forward. She said the chemo & rads make it worse, so it won't get better until after rads are done. Then yesterday, I booked a Mediterranean cruise for the hubby and I for next summer to celebrate our 20th anniversary (and finishing my treatments & surgery). Looking forward to that!  Neither of us have been to Europe before. I hope everyone is doing well. EverForward: Early congrats on finishing TCH Wednesday! Don't be scared...you can do it! You've been doing great all summer...it's just one more.  I hope your muscle fatigue has gotten better (same to you ColdInCanada). MakeLemonade: I hope you got good news yesterday from your BS and got all the RO & insurance stuff figured out. Insurance can be great and it can be a royal pain, as I think we've all experienced at one time or another. I remember disputing bill after bill after birthing my babies during my maternity leave! linda505: I had the same problem with my insurance (docs using labs unapproved by insurance, back when I was having babies). It's really not fair for us to be responsible for things out of our control. There's gotta be a better way. I hope they figure it out soon. clarrn: Congrats on your anniversary!  Timbuktu: It's understandable how you (or any of us) might feel depressed as a cancer patient. We have a lot to worry about, and chemo knocks us on our butts.  But, you can do it! Take it one day at a time & after chemo is done, I think it'll get much better.   Ddkath70: Glad you found a wig you like. I found it's nice to have a good wig, so I can at least look normal when I go out in public and not draw any looks. Have a good day everyone!",

Please let me know how simulation/set up go.  I meet my RO for my initial consultation tomorrow morning. I think we should join both the Summer and Fall Rads groups. Summer Rads folks can warn us about what to expect.  Fall Rads folks will be on our schedule, so we can discuss our day to day stuff as we go through it together.  Hope your hemoglobin levels are getting better. As far as your comment about being betrayed by your body, I don't know if that's how I feel. I think I'm more confused why I got breast cancer. I am not predispositioned by my genes to get it and only have one case of breast cancer in the family, which was one cousin. I just don't understand how I got it. Maybe it's my love of everything fragranced (perfume, soaps, lotions, etc), with all the parabens and styrenes that did it. ",

My T&C is 1.5 hours long, so I was able to manage keeping ice in my mouth.

I noticed that I had some prominent looking veins in my legs so MO wants me to get a doppler run on them to make sure I don't have some blood clotting going on in the area. CLOTTING? Scary to me.

SharonDe: Thanks! I'm happy to have finished all 6 chemos. Now I just have to get better from this round to close this chapter. SwissMiss: I think Tamoxifen can start either same time as or after rads are finished. I have a 3 week PFC followup scheduled with my MO for first week of September just to see how I'm doing. It's worth a call to see if you're supposed to have a follow up visit and also to go ahead and schedule your post-rads visit to get on hormone therapy. Your MO could have forgotten to schedule you when you were there for your last chemo.  Good luck with your port removal (let us know how it goes) and your mammogram tomorrow! ************ So, we had a bit of a fright yesterday. I had my 6th TC chemo on Wednesday. Yesterday, at lunchtime, I made a sandwich and got a drink. I felt lightheaded, was breathing in short shallow breaths, and was sweating profusely as I sat down to the kitchen table. Feeling weak, I put my head down on the table. My husband said I passed out for about 15 seconds. Freaked him out completely since he was holding me and said my eyes were open but I was unresponsive. He yelled to wake me and I finally did. He moved me to the couch where we took my pulse, and it was like 42! Scary!!! I guzzled some Gatorage and laid down on the couch to rest, where my pulse went back up to the 60s. I think I was dehydrated because I didn't drink anything all morning (I know, stupid me!).",

I watched a video on YouTube last night and was amazed how simple the port removal procedure is. ColdinCanada: Thanks! I'm hopeful for no more scares as I recover from this last chemo infusion! Sorry to hear about your surgeon forgetting to file papers to refer you to the PS. That IS annoying. You'd think they'd do that sort of stuff practically on autopilot. Is the one year wait due to healthcare rules? Or is there a way to shorten that wait time? Ddkath70: Yeah, that makes sense to keep the port in for the IV they'll run during the CT scan.  My RO said that he wouldn't be using contrast dye for my CT. I wonder why your RO is using it and mine isn't.  I think I'll just keep mine in just in case he changes his mind...at least until after rads are well underway. I'm impressed you've been working through chemo. I couldn't do it so I've been on short term disability. I got back on Sept 3 on a reduced 25 hour/week work schedule. I hope I can manage! Congrats on being completely done with chemo! That balloon wall was a cool idea. I bet it feels great to have all the balloons popped! Timbuktu: I agree it's so hard not being able to do things that we used to do without even a thought, but hang in there. Energy will come back! I went to Target yesterday to buy my daughter face cleanser. I was so tired just standing in the aisle, trying to read the labels, I had to squat on the ground, and I even struggled with that! I couldn't wait to get home so I could sit on the couch again! It's funny. Before BC, I almost NEVER sat down on the couch. I'm the type to always be doing something. Now I'm there everyday in the same spot. There's a dent the shape and size of my butt in that spot!  As far as being worried about recurrance, I think IF it does come back, we will be able to catch it very early and treat it, simply because we are so much more aware of watching for anything weird AND we're going to be at doctors' offices a lot from now on for follow ups, so they'll be another check point for early detection. Jamieh: You grew another hand! I thought that wasn't supposed to happen until radiation, LOL!  Good photos. :)  I like your cap, too. Hey, I'd ask your RO if he can do markers instead of a tattoo, if you don't like the idea of a tattoo. My RO actually prefers markers. Well, time to get off my butt and go take a shower before I take my daughter to get her braces off. Have a good day everyone!",

I'm now 2 weeks PFC and actually feel pretty good, although my head still gets sweaty several times a day (localized hot flashes???). I'm nowhere near my condition pre-chemo of course, but I don't expect that for many months yet. Two positives: my taste buds have returned (as have pounds I lost when everything tasted bad) and I have enough energy to walk the dog (albeit at a slower than normal pace, with stops to rest) for 1/2 mile. Yay! I return to work next Wednesday part time (25 hours/week), to allow me time for rads, travel for rads, and some down time for fatigue. We'll see how it goes. So, apparently, hair loss on the face continues PFC, as several of your posts indicate. I'm experiencing the same thing. 2 weeks ago, I had about 50% of my brows left. Today, I would say I have 30% left. As I apply brow pencil, I see brow hair falling out! My eyelashes have managed to mostly stay put. I think I have maybe 80% of my eyelashes and most of what fell out was on my lower lid. I gave up using mascara a few weeks after I started chemo because I was worried that the application and removal of mascara would make the lashes fall out.  Meanwhile, I have 1/8\" white fuzz on my head. It's ALL WHITE! I don't know what I'm going to do if the color doesn't return. I'm not ready for all white hair!  I was 30% grey before chemo and had my hair colored every 3 months. But I was recently reading about how bad hair dyes are so I don't know if I want to color it anymore. I suppose I could continue wearing wigs...bleck!",
