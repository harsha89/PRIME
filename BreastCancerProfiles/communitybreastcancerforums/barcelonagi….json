Smaller hospitals that fall under larger institutions usually follow the \"big boys\" decisions about who to use for testing. Hopefully you'll come back really low risk, and it will be a non issue!!",

I don't know when that data will be released, but I think it will be very interesting. Since I was a HiGH risk at 21 and my friend was a LOW risk at 25, my guess is it will show you can't draw conclusions when you're \"stuck in the middle!\" Kessa - Not sure I can help you with your specific result. The results report states that the low risk average recurrence without any treatment is 5% at 5 yrs and 10% at 10 yrs (Buyse M et al JNatl Cancer Inst 2006;98(17):1183-92. so I'm guessing that they do not have specific stats on each number.

If you had a LOW risk, it is likely that your tumor would not benefit significantly from chemo! CONGRATS!! Of course, data is always emerging to provide more insight. There are a number of MOs who are just more comfortable with the Oncotype test as it provides a score. MammaPrint has strong science behind it...and is in my opinion a more sophisticated test. While you can't look at an 18 and say it's closer to low risk, so you don't need chemo, you CAN feel confident that LOW risk MammaPrint is that! (Drukker CA et al Int J Cancer 2013; 133(4): 929-36) I'm a great example of 21 with a HIGH risk, and a friend had a 25 and came back LOW risk. MammaPrint was created by allowing the tumor samples to identify the 70 most significant genes predictive of recurrence risk, as opposed to a scientist selecting genes based on documented gene function! (it can get confusing.)  ",

My surgery was 3 1/2 years ago, and Feb 5 will mark 3 years since I finished chemo, and can say that I feel great, side effects are virtually non-existent! Believe it or not, you too will get to this point! Like Gemma12, my cancer was DX a few days before my 50th. I had 2 small tumors (the settings didn't allow for that on my specifics below) 1.4 and 1.5 cm. With all the other factors being \"good\" no nodes, ER+, HER2- they didn't think I'd need chemo. My Oncotype came back 21. After lots of other opinions which were all over the board, my MO ran a MammaPrint (FDA cleared, looks at 70 genes, results aren't based on taking Tamoxifen for 5 years, and gives you a HIGH or LOW risk of recurrence.) Mine came back HIGH risk...everyone was surprised. I did 8 rounds of chemo and am SO GLAD i had that test! So Kessa and grandma3x, can you ask for the MammaPrint test, so you don't have to deal with the intermediate results? While some insurance companies won't cover two tests, a lot will, esp if you have an intermediate result. Call customer service at the company, and they'll help you. 888.321.2732 (looked up the number for you). Also, Oncotype has an ongoing trial that has regrouped the ranges, and they classify low risk as 1-10, intermediate 11-25 (where 67% of patients now fall) and high <25. So who knows what the right ranges are now? I can find more statistics if you need them! Hope this helps!",

In answer to your question about the same level of risk based on such differing statistics, the MammaPrint high risk category reflects a population average for high risk patients based on an independent validation (same data used for their original FDA clearance). The range actually varies from 22-35% for untreated patients, so as a 0.0575 you're still high (as I mentioned, my report in 2012 didn't indicate a number). In a prospective outcome study based in a real-world community setting, 91% of high risk patients identified by MP (of which 81% received chemotherapy) remained disease free after 5 years. Does that make sense?",

I don't know if you were aware of the FDA's report in November that highlighted the ODX test and HER2 false negatives, but it may be of interest to you: www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms... pg 14. As a result of my ODX score of 21, I had a MammaPrint test run, learned that I was HIGH risk, and proceeded with 8 rounds of chemo. I'm such a fan of Agendia's tests, that I learned more about how they were created, how they differ from the others and now do advocacy work for them. MammaPrint is included in the NCCN guidelines, and is validated on up to 3 positive LN (while that doesn't affect you.). Reach out to Agendia and see what they say, knowing that you have already decided on your treatment. Hoping your chemo went smoothly today...one down!!",

Just stumbled across these posts and am interested in hearing if anyone had opted not to do chemo based on their Oncotype test, and had a recurrence? I was diagnosed 3 years ago and was ER+ barely PR-, HER2-., no nodes, no family history, tumors were 1,4 and 1.5 cm. My ODx score was a 21. Drs didn't recommend chemo. Then had a MammaPrint test which said I was HIGH risk for recurrence. So glad I had that test run and did the chemo. Worry about those individuals whose Drs say chemo isn't needed when they get an intermediate score, and then have a recurrence down the road.",
