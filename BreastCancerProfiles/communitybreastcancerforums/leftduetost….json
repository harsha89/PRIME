If the radiologist comes to talk to you, that means he found something suspicious and they will want to schedule a biopsy. You will not get the report right away because he has to actually write it. You can ask at the very start if you can get a CD with your images and a copy of the report mailed to you. I've never had issues obtaining that. So, in short, if they play the \"hurry up and wait\" game, as in \"we'll send your physician the report, call him in 2-3 days\" that means everything is ok.",

The old suspicious spot (that appeared a little over two years ago) on the first rib - actually sternomanubrial joint - is still there. Still with uptake but didn't grow. There is a second area of uptake that the scan has picked, on the cervical-thoracic junction in my spine. It is under 1 cm and the report says \"probably stable osteoblastic uptake\". The oncologist is a little worried because, even if I do have osteoarthritis in my cervical spine, that spot never showed it, not before and not in recent Xrays or CT scans (I had that in the past 6 months). So as much as normally when the report says \"stable\" then it's most probably arthritis, the fact that it has appeared in less than three months from my last CT scan is a concern for him. He said we will do a PET scan in three months to see if there is any growth and if it is, \"we'll go from there\", if it isn't, that means it's probably arthritis. Soooo... hurry up and wait.

I was actually \"upgraded\" to seeing the oncologist only once a year, and he said he would see me once a year until I will be 10 years because of positive sentinel node with 3 mm micro-metastasis. kayb, I also had the alkaline phosphatase shoot up a couple of years ago right before the PT scan, my endo also ordered a gall bladder and liver ultrasound but everything was ok (well except that uptake on my first rib).

The shape and firmness of implants will project more than a natural breast even in a bra. I was a large C small D prior to the mastectomy. Pathology showed 450 grams weight for my excised breast. Doing the calculations volume/weight for flesh vs silicone gel, it's roughly 500 cc. That was the size of the implants I got. But now I'm a DDD. So it's a bit wonky there when trying to figure out. It also depends a lot on the type of implants you're getting.",

Due to issues with my hands (because of the cervical spine issue my hands functions are all messed up, get numb, drop things, etc) I've always bought capsules. You can also buy empty gelcaps and fill them. I just don't trust my hands to do that so I pay a buck or two more and get them already done. One thing I have noticed, to date is that this things is as varied as they come, not just as strains but as origin (I think). A \"red vein indo\" from different providers will have different effects. Probably depending of the geographical area they are harvested, as in, the trees in this valley have more mytraginine and less of the other 25 alkaloid compounds than the trees of the valley across the river. Not sure if that makes sense. I've gone through a few providers myself, and found one that sells capsules, still trying to go through all the strains they have so I can figure out which of them works the best. I still have to try 3 of them but of the ones I've tried one definitely did wonders, a red vein indo (that supposedly is the best for pain but again, depends from person to person). PM me and I'll give you a link to their website, I wont' give it publicly because I don't want to be accused of advertising or something. ChiSandy, I know, right? Here is the same thing with the once a month dr visit. I see the deaths from opiate overdose actually skyrocketing in the future in the states that have no medical marijuana legalized. It's all about the prisons and the money. What boggles my mind is the \"stuck in my own ways\" of these rich people. Like, great Poobahs who have financial interests and monopoly on oil and do whatever they can to stop alternative energy. When if they would put 10% of their resources into ACQUIRING alternative energy technology in a decade or less they'd have monopoly on that and the same money if not more. Same with the prison owners - the trend will, eventually legalize cannabis all over. Instead of investing NOW in some legalizing the stuff and starting their own companies producing and selling it and soon be more stinking rich than they are now, they are stuck in their quicksand and pull everybody in with them. I just don't' find it right that I have to be in pain because other people are stupid. Seriously.",
