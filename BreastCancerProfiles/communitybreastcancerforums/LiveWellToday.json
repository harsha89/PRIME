Anything I eat give me a sour taste in my mouth. At night I have burning pain in my intestines. I found out today that my stomach was in the field (at least part of it). of course, I should have asked for the plan before. This is one of my many regrets about radiation. I wish I never did it. Has anything ever experienced this? Does it get better? I am not eating and getting proper nutrition because of the gross taste after I eat, food doesn't taste good either, and Because I fear the stomach ache. I have lost 10 or 15 pounds so far through radiation. I am taking an anti-acid now, anti-depressants, sleeping pills and Tamoxifen. And I used to be someone who hesitated to even take an Advil. This is where we are I guess. Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "LiveWellToday wrote: Hi all, I finished radiation last week. I had a mastectomy. Was stage 1B. Two small tumors in the left side and one micromets node. Some rad oncs suggested radiation other said don't need it. The ones that suggested radiation said recurrence rate could be reduced by 10% (recall for whole breast radiation recurrences rates are reduced by 30% after a lumpectomy and also recall that the dosage is much less--I got 50 grays and 5 grays to the heart since its the left side). I was so confused. I am PR and ER positive. Good margins. No extra nodal extension. My surgeon who I trust told me don't do radiation -- its over treatment for me she said. Even the rad onc said its over treatment. But I have kids and din't want to put my kids through this again. But now, I am in looping regret mode. I think about every way I should have said \"no.\" I can't focus on things without this coming into my head. I think about how I should have trusted my surgeon, how the RAD onc treated me like a number, how I never got personalized attention from the RAD ONC, how much anxiety I had during the first day that I almost walked away but went along with it because it was \"scheduled.\" I think about the you woman sitting next to me in the waiting room who had breast cancer 4 years ago and then developed cervival cancer. I think about my surgeon who said \"I would not do it if I were you.\" I think about the doctor who said that there are so many latent effects like heart problems and lung cancer that can come up 10 years from now. I think about how I have to delay my implant exchange surgery now for 6 months (I have tissue expanders). I think about how tight my skin is. My throat is sore from teh radiation and my taste has changed. I worry about losing my implants and other cosmetic effects. I am 46 and in very good shape. I take care of myself and eat well but now I am on anti-anxiety medication to get me to sleep at night. I feel I should have listened to my gut and not my mind and taken a \"wait and see approach\" given the conflicting opinions, the low upside, and the large side effects of doing post-mastecomy radiation --they radiated under my arm, superclaval nodes, and internal mammery nodes. It just feels like I was treated like a piece of meat and didn't want to stop after I started since I was worried what would happen. But every day I went in, I felt like I was being violated. My therapist says may be I am suffering from a reaction to trauma. I should try to distract myself and let these thoughts out of my mind. Has anyone experience this deep regret and anxiety over side effects. I am someone who thinks wifi can cause cancer so I don't know what I agreed to take 50 grays of radiation inside my body. I am having a hard time functioning but doing my best for the kids. Any advice on what do do? How can I make myself believe this was a good decision? I may have regretted if I didn't do it. My tumors also had low oncotye scores (4,6,8--I have bilateral cancer). The fact that I have 3 tumors and LVI scared me into doing it but now I feel I betrayed my body and should have trusted it to heal itself given all the good support I am now giving it (veggie juice, exercise, yoga, acupuncture, ..). Instead, I now I am mess and can't sleep. People tell me that you have to believe the radiation is good for you and not bad for you otherwise my body was treat it like it is bad for me. All the stress hormones I am causing as a result of my reaction worries me as it increases chance of distant spread. Would love to some support and advice. I have heard people say \"be positive,\" think you are cured, you can't change the past, you were destined to do the radiation, you are an aggressive person and your personality is to take control of situations so you had to do it, you made the right choice for your kids, you are overestimating the side effects of radiation (if it were so bad why would the drs recommend it?).

      "Content": "LiveWellToday wrote: Dear friends, I am so glad I have this community for help and guidance. I was diagnosed two months ago. Three tumors--bilateral and 2 on left. Onctoype scores of 6,8, and 10. Size 1.4, 1.4 and .9 and grade 1 to 2. Only one of 4 nodes micromets (.4m) on the left breast. Two areas of small LVI on the left breast. I have had a bilateral mastectomy. The radiation oncologist at the No 2 cancer center in the USA says my chance of recurrence is 10 to 15% LOCALLY and if I radiate the nodes and chest wall, it goes down to 5%. My local oncologist thinks only 10% chance of recurrence LOCALLY which decreases to 5% with radiation. He thinks toxicity of radiation not worth the benefits. My local oncologist thinks chances are lower and I should just not radiate and if it locally recurs, then just have the tumor surgical removed. I am only 46 and otherwise extremely healthy and so should be able to deal with the radiation impact on heart, lungs and thyroid (recall Left side). All radiation oncologists are making educated guesses since they have no studies that address micrometasis in the nodes & recurrence. If I radiate then risks of implant problems are also a consideration. My highest Oncotype score of 10 predicts 5 year distant recurrence rate is 4% and 10 year distant recurrence rate is 7%. There is some correlation between low Oncotype scores and local recurrence but that is not yet well-accepted in the medical community. How should I approach this? Log in to post a reply",
