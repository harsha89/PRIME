They never used my port for blood draws or MUGA or anything other than infusions.",

I've always been disturbed by anything that gets under my skin, like splinters, so this was nightmarish to me. I did my best to ignore it, but I never succeeded in getting comfortable with it. It didn't help that it was \"tilted\" and one of the raised bumps on the surface was practically poking through my skin. And it also upset me that when I had it removed, they only used a local anesthetic so I had to feel all the disturbing sensations of tugging, etc., while they were removing it. (I asked them for something like Valium to help me relax a little and not be so anxious, but they refused and told me, \"Oh, you'll be fine.\" I really, really hated the crew at that facility.) When I read about people who decide to just leave it in place when they're finished with chemo, I'm amazed. For your sake, I truly hope that you come to grips with your port more than I did with mine. But at least know that someone else out there feels your pain! Almost forgot to add, despite all this rant I am glad to have had a port versus the alternative. And if I had to do it again, I absolutely would. BTW, my husband thought that the entire process was very Matrix-like. To cheer me up, he would talk about my being \"uploaded\"!",

My worst--but kinda funny story--was that one day I thought nobody was around and went outside in all my bald glory to collect the mail. Just then my sweet neighbor came outside with her 4-year old daughter, who knows me quite well. But when she saw me without hair, she was afraid of me! Her eyes were just huge and she could not be persuaded to come anywhere near me, even with her mum holding her. I think it made my poor neighbor feelÂ worse than it did me! Thankfully, those days are past and I now have a solid inch, or maybe a little more, hair. Coming back pretty thick and the same color as before! I'm so, so grateful.",

In the long run, I decided that I wasn't ready to be \"outed\" just yet; I'll wait until I have enough hair that people might think it's that short by choice!",

Redheads are just a little physically different, I think, and the medical reports about redheads requiring more anesthesia (and responding differently to painkillers) just supports that theory. I did #12 this morning and have just a little pinkness to show for it. Keeping my fingers crossed! I see the rad doc on Monday and I'm going to ask about the Xclair.",

And especially not to have any kind of oil remaining on your skin when the actual rads are taking place, because the oil will intensify the radiation (ouch). But I have also heard about Emu Oil being recommended...so there must be exceptions. It seems like all of us have heard different advice! It would be nicer if the radiation docs and their support staff were all on the same page.",

My center recommended something called RadX, but I had to order it online because none of the pharmacies carry it. Anyway, here is my little list of all the things I've now heard of being recommended: 1. 98% (or more) pure aloe vera gel 2. Aquafor 3. Calendula lotion 4. Bag balm 5. Udderly Smooth Udder Cream 6. RadX Radiation Therapy cream 7. Miaderm Radiation Relief And the things I've heard to avoid? 1. Products with oil 2. Products with alcohol 3. Products with heavy fragrance 4. All deodorants except Tom's or Arm & Hammer natural (no aluminum) So far, I've been putting on pure aloe immediately after rads, then I wait a minute for it to dry. Then I put the Udderly Smooth on. At night I use some Aquafor, and in the morning--before rads--I shower everything off, gently of course. This has been working well for me and I'm a very, very pale redhead who burns and freckles at the slightest bit of sun!
