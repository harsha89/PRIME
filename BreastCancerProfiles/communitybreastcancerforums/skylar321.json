I've just always thought that the \"expanding\" process would take longer than that. I'm thinking that IF it turns out that I have cancer, and the dr can't do the skin sparing immediate implant for me than of course I'll have to go through the process you had. I'm currently a full B, but figure if I have to have mine removed and news ones put in I might as well go to a full C cup. Just wondering how long it really takes for the skin to grow/stretch/ expand. Thanks so much for sharing your story, sorry I can't give any answers about the nipple or tattoo question....although, I have gotten a handful or so of tattoos at different places on my body & have found the \"softer\" skin does fade a lot quicker than other parts.",

I know that in a massage your lymph fluid kinda releases. Maybe i'm just thinking crazy, but thought I'd put the question out there to see if anyone has been told that getting massages with BC is ok.

I've had a lot (a lot, a lot, a lot) of issues over the past year that has prevented me from seeing anyone yet, but in that amount of time I've done TONS of reseach and figure this is something the dr's will want to do because of the symptoms...even if they dont recommend it at first it's something that I'll ask them to do just to make sure. Funny thing is that I'm not afraid of needles, having procedures done...never have. But just the thought of having a needle stuck into my nipple like that freaks me out like nothing I could have imagined. Even \"funnier\", when I was younger I had my nipple pierced (not the one I'm currently having issues with however), lol:) I've ALWAYS been super picky about my nipples though, dont like them \"played\" with at all, so having a needle not only stuck in it, but also into my breast from it, is really throwing a curve ball at me. I'm sure when the day comes I'll have to ask the dr for a STRONG anti-anxity med, and have to bring in an eye mask just to make sure I wont actually see them putting it in....I just keep thinking \"ouch!!\". Thank you so much for telling your story and giving me the advice/heads up I needed:) I hope all is going well with you, sending hugs and well wishes:)",

I dont believe that would make it a \"moveable\" lump....those are like free moving lumps that can slide all over the breast and slide between your fingers when feeling it. Yours sounds more like it could be fixed. Either way, any new lump or changes should be checked out by a dr to know what it is for sure. Wishing you the best:)",

I know I need to get the money together to pay for insurance so that I can have the u/s done that he wants...money is tight for me right now as I'm sure it is for soooo many of us, but I'm saving and hopefully should be able to afford it very very soon. Here's my question...on top of the lumps in both breasts, I've been in constant pain from the left breast, NOW (well really last night) I'm starting to have a clear, kinda sticky, discharge come from my nipples:( I noticed it last night when i was checking my breasts to see if any lumps had changed, squeezed my right nipple and a small amount of liquid came out! I'm a bit freaked out over this because i've never ever ever had anything come out of my nipples before. When I squeezed the left nipple the same thing happened. It looks like it's only coming out of one duct and it is a very clear kinda sticky liquid. I've been doing some research on \"Dr. Google\", but I'm not finding anything thats good:( Any advice from you wonderful ladies would be extreemly welcomed:) Thank you so much in advance:) Much love and well wishes to everyone:) Log in to post a reply",

I dunno if thats just my mind making me feel things, or if something serious is really going on. I'm just so worried right now. Up until the nipple discharge last night i was able to take my thoughts away from cancer for the most part....but now I'm just sooo worried. Does anyone know what my future insurance would do if I went to the ER and they found something? would they say that this is a pre-exsisting condition?

I've heard about going to planed parenthood, but I believe they only offer mammograms, like so many other free/low cost services. Since I'm still pretty young (30), or at least like to think so, my breasts are still really dense and mammograms won't be all that effective for me. I have multiple palpable lumps in both breasts so I think the u/s will be able to give us clearer results to go off of, at least that's what I've learned from Dr. Google:) I'm going to try to make a couple calls tomorrow to the places I found thru the links you posted earlier, cycle-path.
