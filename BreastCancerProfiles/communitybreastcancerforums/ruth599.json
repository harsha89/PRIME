During the course of the treatment, I began to feel severe pain in the area that they inserted the port at (which was my right breast). The area of the insertion of the port became red and swollen. It hurts so badly still. The doctors soon stopped the chemo until further notice.I finished chemotherapy in July. But the pain still hurts now. I now have a very dark 3rd degree burn on my chest and part of my breast, and it is hard as rock. I still have the port in my chest since March.So my question to you is, have any one of you gone through this excruciating experience. Or do you have any suggestions for me to do? Thanks for the comments. Log in to post a reply",
