I also have a bit of neuropathy on the bottom of one foot but l-glutamine helps alot (over the counter). No nauseau either and I have mets to the stomach. And peritoneum and bones.

Lynn-swims, your dx sounds so similar to mine. I'm finding more and more that my stomach is so uncomfortable so often that I sit curled up in a ball. Hoping this Aromasin helps me to gain a little weight! I discovered my mets when I started having trouble eating a full meal and after a few months, had it checked out. Stupid ca in and around my stomach and the stomach cannot expand to accept food. Never never suspected the inability to eat much would be a symptom of mets. I'm starting now to realize that I'm losing strength and stamina and it saddens me to experience this gradual decline. :(",
