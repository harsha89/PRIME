I started in Operating Room and ended as a Risk Manager/Quality Manager with a lot of variety in between. I was DX'd from the get go with Stage IV Bilateral Breast Cancer (ILC, IDC) and Bone Mets in 7 locations. Went into remission after 7 months of chemo with AC, Abraxene, Avastin & Zometa. Switched to Xgeva a few months ago & feel pretty good for the most part. I'm 68 y.o. and have been married 35 years; we have 2 married daughters who are both teachers and married. We have a dog that we rescued from a Sanctuary. She had been abused and abandoned. She's come along way in 5 years and is the best companion I could ask for, esp. when I went through chemo. I fill my time largely writing or drawing or painting (I have a daughter who is an artist, we think it runs in the family). I wrote a book (\"Metastatic Madness\") that came out 3 months ago & hope that it helps people in the MBC community to cope with this diagnosis. We have decided to do some traveling & went to Italy last June to celebrate our anniversary. We also went to Hawaii the previous year for the week of Christmas. These are trips we might have put off otherwise.  Now, we really want to see things & travel. I've learned a lot since my diagnosis, but I wish I knew all that I know now before all this came along...I didn't know I had dense breast tissue that made my mammograms worthless as it hid the tumors. So many other things that I know now that I just didn't know before... I feel there is need to educate women a lot more so they can protect themselves better.  It seems we should be able to do that through our health system...prevention should always be the goal!",
