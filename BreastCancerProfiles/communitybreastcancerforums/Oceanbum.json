At my last appointment with him I questioned whether it was wise to cut the treatments back to 9 from the original 13. His reasoning was because the chemo totally resolved the tumor prior to surgery. It made sense but I was still fearful. He said with that concern he decided to take it back to the original 13 cycles. So now I have 4 to go. I should finish in early July.

We got to the point where they felt like IVF was our next step. We decided to stop all fertility treatments and pursue adoption at that point. My doctors had told me when I was a young teenager that I would have a very difficult time conceiving a child if I ever did at all. I had a surgery when I was 6 on one of my ureter tubes. It had veins growing through it pinching it shut. It had caused my left kidney to swell to 4 times it's normal size when they discovered it. When they did the surgery to correct it they did x-rays of that area while my abdomen was open. They said they covered my reproductive organs with a lead blanket. But I've always wondered if that caused my problems. Of course, this was in 1969. Things were done differently then. But once I started my periods when I was 14, I would have 1 a year. One horrendous period a year. I always missed a week of school with my periods. Once after I got married I ended up in the ER it was so bad. They first thought I was having a miscarriage or hemorrhaging. So needless to say when chemo forced me into menopause and my periods stopped I wasn't too upset!! Lol",

I've been on it for a little over a year. I see my oncologist Monday. I think there's a chance I will be switched to an aromatase inhibitor. My breast surgeon told me she suspected he would switch me after 2 years. I got my survivorship plan in the mail a few days ago and it had me being switched after a year. So I look for that to happen at this appointment. I was diagnosed pre-menopause. But chemo threw me into menopause. I haven't had a cycle since June of last year. So I will soon be 2 years without a period. I've been pretty lucky on Tamoxifen. I had some hot flashes in the beginning. But nothing too bad. Mostly just at night. The biggest issue I have with it is the weight gain in the in belly area!! I'm doing all the same things I have always done to keep weight off or take weight off to no avail. Nothing is working. I know that can be because of menopause. But it is SO frustrating.",

I talked to her yesterday morning and she said she had been having pains since 9:30 the night before. I asked her why she wasn't at the hospital!! She thought it was false labor because the pains weren't consistent. I told her to call the doctor and at least ask him. So she did and he had her come in to be checked. Well, he sent her straight to the hospital!! He said she had been in labor for 12 hours!! I got to witness his birth!! A first for me because my children were adopted!! Very special!! In the room with her was her husband, her sister, me and her birthmom. He weighed 8 lbs 5 oz and was 21 inches!! He's a big boy!!! Missed my birthday by 24 hours and 45 minutes!! I kept asking her if she could hold off!! Lol",

It's probably a question for my doctor. But what I just read said that invasive ductal carcinoma starts in the milk ducts and refers to cancer that has broken through the wall of the milk duct and begun to invade the tissues of the breast. My question is for my case specifically. I had an intraducal papilloma removed in 2000. In doing so they removed all of the milk ducts on the right side. I was diagnosed in 2017 with invasive ductal carcinoma on the right and then later the left side. I'm confused because I didn't have any milk ducts on the right side for 17 years when I was diagnosed. Is it possible to develop invasive ductal carcinoma without any milk ducts? Does anybody know? Any thoughts?",

But when I saw my oncologist today he had decided he wanted me to finish out the whole 13 treatment cycle. He had originally cut me back to 9. I questioned him last visit about it and told him I was concerned about recurrence. He said since I have that concern he felt more comfortable having me finish out the 13 cycles. Maybe I'm being overly cautious but better safe than sorry. I had 6 rounds of chemo with Herceptin, Perjeta, Carboplatin & Taxotere and now what will be 13 rounds of Herceptin.

Very good explanation. It makes sense: Hi Becky, this doesn't answer your question, but provides some background information you may find helpful. From komen.org's risk factor table that breaks down all available publish and peer-reviewed research: Fertility drugs stimulate the ovaries, causing estrogen levels in the body to increase. Because high estrogen levels are linked to breast cancer risk, it's been suggested the use of fertility drugs might also increase risk. Most studies, including a meta-analysis of 20 studies on the fertility drug clomiphene (Clomid) and 22 studies on other types of fertility drugs, have found no link to breast cancer. Some findings with 10 or more years of follow-up suggest fertility drug use may modestly increase breast cancer risk. One study with 11 years of follow-up found an increased risk only among women who had given birth and used the fertility drug clomiphene. However, another study with 21 years of follow-up found no increased breast cancer risk among women who fertility drugs. Although most studies show fertility drugs do not increase breast cancer risk, more studies with long-term data are needed to confirm these findings.",

When a 7.5 mm mass was discovered in my right breast my surgeon ordered an MRI to make sure we weren't missing anything. The MRI showed the 15 mm mass. They went back & looked at my last 3 years of mammograms to see if it had been missed.",

They said she is mild pre-eclampsia. But they were able to get her numbers under control before sending her home. She is 36 weeks pregnant. They want to get her to 37 weeks before delivering. She is monitoring her BP and is on bed rest. Her Father-in-law is a medic, her Mother-in-law is a nurse, and her husband is an EMT. So she is in good hands!!",

I am a beachbum once a year for a week on vacation. Would love to live there someday!! The reason for oceanbum instead of beachbum is because as far as user names go beachbum is always taken and oceanbum is usually available!! I've been using it for years for that reason!! Lol",

Just checking in. I had my last surgery (fat-grafting) April 20th. I finished up my 12 cycles of Herceptin May 25th. Life has returned to the new normal. I am back to work full-time. I still get very tired by the end of the day. And I found this weekend that I am not up to walking and climbing stairs at a football stadium like I used to be. By the time I got to my seat I felt like I was going to pass out!! I definitely need to do some training for next year!!",

I will be starting injections of Xgeva every 6 months as well. He is sending me for a baseline DEXA scan next Wednesday. I am also having a CT scan afterwards. I have a pain in between my shoulder blades that has been there for going on a month. It is a steady, sharp pain that has gotten progressively worse. It hurts the most when I go to bed and put pressure on my shoulder to lay down. I am hoping it is only a muscle strain due to everything my body has been through in the last 18 months. Please keep me in your prayers!",

Add me to the list. My 2 daughters were adopted. I had problems with my periods from the time they started at age 14. I took birth control pills trying to straighten out my periods when I was a young teenager. Then after I was married I took fertility drugs, Clomid specifically. In later years after we adopted our girls, I took hormones trying to straighten out my periods, Provera. Then more birth control, Ortho-Tricyclen, Ortho Evra & the Mirena IUD. I spoke to an attorney about all of the hormones that I had taken over the years and asked if they could have caused my BC. She said she knew of no successful case against a pharmaceutical company of fertility/birth control pills. I still believe that is what caused mine.",

But my question is there a connection between Comid and BC when a pregnancy was not achieved? I fall into that category as do you and Wised. I've read that women who haven't had a full-term pregnancy or have their first child after age 30 have a higher risk of breast cancer compared to women who gave birth before age 30 are at higher risk of breast cancer. So I wonder if Clomid adds fuel to that fire. It does make you wonder?!",
