She is being treated right now with no chemo.They told her that they can control it but not cure it. So when you say NED does that mean they are controlling it or are you in remission from it? So many questions run through my mind and then when we are actually at the Dr one seems more important than the other. Thank you!",

      "Content": "middlebuck3 wrote: My mom has metastic breast cancer. She has 1 spot on her liver and 2 on her lungs.It is hormone positive and they tried just herception but they grew slighty bigger. Now the DR wants to use Taxol as well.She will be treated 3 weeks on 1 off. I tried to look up some info on them together but didn't find much. How effctive is this combo together? Her spots are 3cm on the liver and 1cm each on her lungs.The DR said there is a 70% chance this will work. But what does that mean? Will she only get the 2 years they told her? I'm confused because I know there is no cure for this. Log in to post a reply",

She is in her late 50's. I know there is no time line but I guess it's becoming real now that it came back after such a long time.Thanks for the info.",
