I will definitely update tomorrow after I have my 2nd mammogram & ultrasound and let you guys know what they say. So nervous! I keep telling myself that it's not going to be anything but then I tell myself that if it ends up being something that i caught it early and that it's curable.. I think way too much! Which gets me very nervous! I have never had any surgeries or biopsy's so all that stuff scares me",

I have to go back tomorrow (Monday) morning to get another mammogram and a ultrasound done. I'm so nervous ðŸ˜©.. that it's making me sick to my stomach. My last mammogram was last sept and was clear. I hope it's not anything! My older sister had breast cancer a few years ago and got both breasts removed. She also had the test done to see if she is a carrier of the gene and she is not. My grandma had breast cancer and had one breast removed.. no one else in my family has had it. Does getting a biopsy hurt or no? I'm just so nervous about everything that it just paralyzes me.. but I've always been a very nervous person since I was a kid. Thanks and any info would be appreciated! Log in to post a reply",

So I need to have a stereotactic biopsy to be on the safe side. Since my sister had breast cancer and grandmother. I seen my mammogram and it's a small 3mm round spot. So it's not very big but it wasn't there 8 months ago on my last mammogram. Just waiting for a phone call from my doctor so I can set the biopsy appointment up. I hope it's not anything. How long does it take to get biopsy results back",
