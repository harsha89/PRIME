Half-way!! The symptoms do build up.  Does anyone get extremely emotional a day or two after treatment?  I hit quite an emotional low this week-end- felt yucky, low energy and depressed.  I could not stop crying.  I am better now- it has been 4 full days since treatment and I feel better. But the tiredness is getting worse.  If I remember to pace myself, I do okay. It's okay for us to rest now, to comtemplate and to delegate. My children are 18 and 20- I feel for you all with young cheldren, but I also see them assuch a life force for you- to keep you going.  My job keeps me going, my son's search for college and this crazy election- nice distraction. I feel for everyone out there so much- I wish I could hug you all and be together for a time.  Be strong- visualize good times to come, the spring, the future...time will pass for all of us, I know it will.
