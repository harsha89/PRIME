There seems to be a wide variety of cosmetic outcomes, is this due to the skill of the surgeon?? Does anyone request having a PS do the closure or is this something that can be adjusted by surgery at a later date. I have multifocal low grade DCIS and multiple papillomas diagnosed in a wide excision biopsy but my BS advises BMX because she foresees frequent checkups and probable biopsies otherwise. This has been going on for a long time and I am sick of the constant stress every time I have a mammo, ultrasound etc. I\u2019d be grateful for any info. Jude Log in to post a reply",

I am up around Livingston a lot during the summer...it is beautiful country. My MRI is a little more understandable now after looking up some of the terms but I am worried about the process covering such a large area. 2cm under my nipple and 8 mm above my pectoral muscle sounds deep and scary. There is no diagnosis of cancer...yet, but I know that there is no real cure for papillomatosis, it usually seems to end in mastectomy. I would be grateful for any insights, in the meantime I am trying not to worry but it is the waiting that is wearing me down. IMPRESSION: Right breast: No suspicious findings. Left breast: Diffuse upper inner quadrant papillomatosis with biopsy-proven 10:00 atypical papilloma detailed below. Recommend medical and/or surgical management as clinically warranted. FINDINGS: BREAST DENSITY:Cat B- The breast parenchyma demonstrates scattered fibroglandular densities. Background enhancement: Mild background physiologic enhancement. Lymphadenopathy: No lymphadenopathy by size criteria within the axilla or internal mammary lymph node chains. Left breast: There is a segmental distribution (9:00 to 11:00 regions) of multiple solid circumscribed enhancing nodules throughout the upper inner quadrant of the left breast compatible with biopsy-proven papillomatosis. This process extends from the anterior third of the breast (2 cm posterior to the nipple) as far posterior as 8 mm anterior to the pectoralis muscle (axial series 9 image 58). All of these demonstrate suspicious rapid washout kinetics. The 10:00 biopsy clip (corresponding to the biopsy-proven atypical papilloma site) within the posterior third of the breast obscures immediate surrounding structures, likely including the sampled nodule. 3 subcentimeter nodules (ranging from 5-7 mm mean axis diameter) are situated about the periphery of the focus of susceptibility artifact. The most superficial nodule is 8 mm deep to the overlying medial breast skin surface. The most posterior of these 3 nodules is 10.1 cm from the nipple. The 11:00 biopsy clip (corresponding to the papilloma without atypia) is situated between 2 adjacent subcentimeter solid enhancing nodules the larger of which measures 7 x 7 mm within the middle third of the breast situated approximately 7.6 cm from the nipple. The most superficial nodule is 1.6 cm deep to the overlying upper inner breast skin surface. I am so thankful for the ability of women to support each other in times like these....Jud",

I am very grateful that you are sharing your experiences as this is obviously life changing surgery. I don't plan on recon as my swimsuit modelling days are long gone lol!

I have also had a single papilloma which bled through my nipple and which was removed several years ago. I have read countless scholarly articles(with a dictionary handy) about papillomas and have gone through comments on many forums from people with similar cases. My take on this so far is that papillomas are supposed to be benign but are frequently removed because needle biopsies don't always show the true size of the papilloma and sometimes they can hide DCIS or Invasive carcinoma. Papillomatosis seems to be defined by a group of at least 5 papillomas and is a somewhat grey area with regard to treatment. It is classified as high risk and so bi annual check ups and MRI s with also an estrogen blocker like Tamoxifen seems to be what is often recommended. For myself as a 65 yr old I would rather have both breasts outta here without recon. It is a personal choice and if I were younger I might choose differently. I am a Brit living in The US and I have to say I do miss the NHS!  ",
