I seem to go from totally worried and convinced that I have cancer, to everything's going to be ok, 80% benign, etc... there is not between. I guess this is confusing to my husband who doesn't seem to know if he should be supportive or dismissive. I just got the call about scheduling the biopsy and when I hung up he acknowledged the appt and then told me about a fb post. Not sure how I feel about that. Anyway, biopsy is next week and consult is 2 weeks after that. Fingers crossed",

I'm trying not to worry because most things I read say most cysts are b9. Today I was able to pull up my radiology results and I am starting to worry again. ...revealing a dialated tortuous duct containing fluid and debris and internal septations that likely display the mammographic findings. On antiradial image with time stamp....color flow is seen within a portion of the duct. On this image also another dialated branch of the duct is seen medial to the main duct.... The color flow is worrying me. Please help me ease my mind. Thank you Log in to post a reply",

Although it seems that when the radiologist discovered the branching her tone and the feeling in the room changed. She said it was extending toward my rib cage. I've got a weird gut feeling about this and it makes me feel sick. The biopsy got moved up to next wed so hopefully not long after that I will have some answers. ",
