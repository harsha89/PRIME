I had a lumpectomy, sentinal node biopsy, radiation, a complete hysterectomy (to get rid of those estrogen ovaries), and hormone therapy (I tried all of them arimidex, femara, aromosin, tamoxifen) for 3.5 years before giving up from all the side effects. I opted out of chemo due to my 92% of the cancer not recurring in 10 years according to the Oncotype Dx test. The end of May 2012, my back started hurting. I gave it a few days, but couldn't take it anymore and went to see my primary dr. She put me on predisone and it didn't help, so she sent me for an xray. It showed T9 of my spine, had a compression fracture. She sent me for an MRI, and then they saw all the tumors along my spine and a density in my upper right chest (my breast involved was on the right). I was then sent for CT scans and a bone scan. I also had a tumor in my right lung and several nodes in the right a 1 on the left lung. I had the fracture repaired by kyphoplasty and had 2 weeks of radiation on the spine. I had a thorocentisis to get rid of the extra fluid in my right lung. About a month ago, I had kyphoplasties on T8 and T10 for the tumors in them (not fractured yet) and to help with the pain. I am currently on zometa and faslodex once a month. All the tumors in my lungs and lymph nodes have shrunk with it. I am having scans again this Thursday, hopefully, they will be as good as the last ones. I will be married 30 yrs in Oct, to my highschool sweetheart Bryan. He is my rock. We have 4 children. Bryan Jr (1986) who has a daughter Ryleigh (2009), Christiana (1987) who is getting married in August, Lindsay (1990) who is married (2012) and has 2 sons Matthew (2011) and Aiden (2012) (I got to see both of them born!), and Kevin (1995) who is graduating high school this year. They are all the joys of my life. My grandchildren can always make me smile, no matter how bad my day is! I've been working 12 years for a health insurance company. I work from home, which I've been doing about 3 years now. I love getting up, and walking down the hall to my office in my pjs. It's been helpful since I've been diagnosed, not having to get ready for work and drive back and forth. I'm trying to work for as long as I can, since our insurance deductible is 3000.00 a person. So many medical bills leftover from last year, and we're starting all over again. I picked up the insurance from my job too this year to see if double coverage is better, but mine also has a 1600.00 deductible. And then we still have the 20% out of pocket. Never mind all the copays for office visits and perscriptions. I just want to stop working and go on disability and watch my daughter's 6 week old son for her. If the pain gets any worse, it will probably happen sooner than later. My husband and I love traveling to the Carribean. We've been to St Thomas, St John, Aruba (twice), Bahamas (twice), and the Domincan Republic (leaving next Sat , for the 3rd visit, can't wait!). I hope to go back to St Thomas in the fall for our anniversary. We spent our honeymoon there, and haven't made it back yet. I try not to dwell on this disease and just live my life, but everyday, I'm in pain, and the pain killers just make me loopy, so I try taking ibuprofen during the day and the perscriptions at bedtime. Some days are better than others and I try to keep doing what I can around the house. It just gets discouraging. Thank God for the support from all you wonderful people on this site! You've been the only support group I've needed from the start of my journey 8 years ago! Good luck to all of you! : ) Lynne",

I have to switch treatments too, after a year on Taxotere (maybe I'll get my hair,eyebrows, and lashes back!). I have 2 new nodules in my lungs, and an old one grew 6 mm in 2 months (the liver and bone mets were ok). I was actually given the option of Ixempra or Gemzar for the next one. I'm getting a second opinion in Boston at Dana Farber on Thursday. The oncologist there specializes in breast oncology. My local one is a general oncologist. Whenever I have to change treatments, I always get a second opinion from Boston. Only once did they have a difference of opinions, the past 6 years. My local oncologist said the Ixempra had a lot of side effects (It sounds just awful!). I was looking at that one first, since it is only once a month, but it sounds awful. Gemzar is once a week for 3 weeks, then a week off. Of course in August, if I choose that, makes it hard, because we have something going on just about every weekend, and they set me up for Fridays (except for the wedding weekend away, when we are leaving on Fri). I just hope if I choose Gemzar there are little side effects. I don't want to feel bad at the wedding, or on our 10 days away at the lake, the end of the month.

Just take a deep breath, and one day at a time. I too wonder if this is my last Christmas. I pray it isn't, but I also pray to have less side effects from these treatments. Gracie-I was on Ibrance for 6 months (I'm currently on Taxotere, and was on Doxil before that, after Ibrance). The side effects I had were minimal compared to the chemos. I did have nausea, which I had compazine for. Never got sick. Also the usual fatigue. Don't be afraid of it. Mae-Enjoy your party! I put up a few Christmas things around the house. The tree will have to wait. My brother-in-law is going to paint the room it's going in, and I have to wait until after this weekend. I attempted to put up the outside decorations, but my son brought up the wrong decoration box. Oh well. I guess it will wait until the weekend. Stomach is feeling good so far, this morning. Hopefully, it's the end of it. Thrush is still there, but that too will disappear by the weekend (as it usually does). I hope you all have a wonderful day!! Lynne",

My husband is picking me up and will stay with me (as he always does). He brings his work laptop and just works while I'm there. I bring a book to read. We got out of there in 2 1/2 hours last time, much better than the 4 from the time before. The actually steroids and chemo only take 2 hours total. It's waiting for the Physician Assistant that takes so long. Grannax-I'm glad your daughter got good results. My best friend has had MS since she was 28, right after her second child. She was doing great on the meds up until last year. She not only can't waik anymore, she can't even get herself out of the wheelchair, and has a hard time talking and can't use her right (dominant) hand. It's so sad. I have a hard time understanding her, so I don't call her. We do get together every couple of months though. She's 54 now. Horrible disease! I hope everyone is having a good day! Lynne",

My husband sold his (1800) a couple of years ago, when he found he wasn't riding it much since I was no longer riding, and I was too uncomfortable on the back of his,even with a back rest. I had told him that the only way I'd go back on a bike was if it was a trike. Our friends had purchased a trike last year (she is in a wheelchair, because of her MS). We went and visited them this summer, and he suggested we try his trike (a Harley). We rode around. Next thing I know, is that there is a Harley trike in our driveway. I knew he was looking at them, but I didn't know he bought one! 2017, maroon. We were out every weekend (sometimes with our friends, my husband made a stand for her wheelchair, that fits on the trailer hitch, so she can get off the bike). Our friends always put the loud pipes on their Harleys. I was against getting a Harley, until I found out they are the only ones who factory make their trikes, as the others are all kits that they put on 2 wheel bikes. Ours is a little loud in first gear, but after that, it's quieter. I have a nice big seat, and a radio! I also love flowers. I still have them, almost a week later. Only lost a couple of roses! It was a nice centerpiece at Christmas! My daughter combined the two bouquets. Our granddaughter is definitely the boss! Matthew will listen to her, but Aiden (the red head) listens to nobody!

I'm hoping the lower dose helps with the se's. I was first diagnosed at 43, after my second routine mammogram. Neither I, nor my dr felt the lump. It was Stage 1 IDC, HR and PR + Her2-. It came back metastatic n 2005, right before my 50th birthday.I just turned 56 (Dec). You are not old! I always say that having another year is better than the alternative! ;) Minnie-Have a wonderful trip. I went to Ireland about 11 years ago with my Mom, and 3 younger sisters. We went with a bagpipe group that my father was in. He was suppose to go, but passed away the year before. We brought some of his ashes, and spread him around the 4 cities we stopped at and the sites. We started in Dublin and ended in Galway (on a bus, 2 days each of the 4 cities). Beautiful country. Amie-sorry to hear about your daughter, glad she is feeling better. Runor-I felt the same as you when I was first diagnosed. It lasted for years. Then I got diagnosed metastatic 7 years later, and thought I'd be gone in a couple of years. 5 1/2 years later I'm still here. I guess God is not done with me yet. I guess I've accepted my diagnosis and what the future will bring. People tell me I'm so positive. Maybe when I'm out and just forget I have cancer for a little bit (haven't really felt that way on the current chemo I've been on for 7 months now, sick the week after and bald now). These people don't see me in private. That's when the bad thoughts start. Big hugs to you! I won't say it gets better, but maybe a little easier to deal with as time goes on. Mel-My neighbor's cat always takes over the golden retriever's bed, just like that picture. The dog just looks at him, and lays on the floor next to his bed. My husband is making me a little nuts lately. Love him but him always asking how I'm doing (he just called) and checking up on me is getting me angry. I know I should be thankful he cares but it really just points out to me that I'm not feeling well. At chemo last Fri, he has his work computer with him, as always to work while he's there with me for 3+ hours. Instead of working, he was looking up vacations. We just got back from Jamaica in October and are going to do Disney in April with the whole family. He wanted to go the last week of January (when I'm due for chemo again). Granted it was an awesome deal, but I told him no. Where he wanted to go was the place we are suppose to go in October. I told him he didn't need a vacation every 3 months. I know he worries about me, and is trying to do stuff for me all the time, but I'm content at home for a few months. Have a wonderful weekend everyone! Lynne",

My in-laws left for the winter (they'll be back in May) last week, and their home is on a lake (they bought it when my husband was 10 as a second home, at 70, they decided to sell their home here and move up there permanently, after they put a foundation on and drilled a well, and added heat. It's at the end of a dirt road and off the beaten path. It's an hour away. Very quiet (they shut the cable off for the winter, fine with me!) and peaceful. I think we are both needing that about now! Best of all, it's free! We have friends that live not far from there that we may meet up with Sat night. Tonight we are going out with a couple to dinner ,that we haven't seen in a long time. We got 4 inches of snow (so far, still lightly coming down). The restaurant is about a mile downhill from our house. As long as we can make it up the hill, I'll be happy.

Also my fractured vertebra T4, is now 60% instead of 30% loss of height. We'll see what she says... We so far have 4 inches of snow, from the 6-10 they said we would get. In a lull right now. It's suppose to last until midnight, not sure if we will get anymore though. Hopefully, not. I'm good!

At least, he has someone he can talk too, as we do here. Mine does not talk about \"IT\" at all. I see the way he looks at me, and it's not the way he used to look at me. It looks like pity to me. I called him on it last week. I told him to stop looking at me like that, and look at me the way he used to. I asked if it was because of my bald head, should I cover it up in my own home as well as I do in public too? He said he wasn't looking at me any differently, but yes he was. It broke my heart. He too keeps everything inside. It makes me crazy! Crazy prices to rent linens! Maybe it would be cheaper if you bought some? Divine-I'm so sorry your sister is going through all that. She is lucky to have you. I have 3 younger sisters. The youngest one lives a block away, the only one who bothers with me at all, and even then, not too often. The next one up lives across town. I used to go out to lunch with her at least once a week, she never calls.. I haven't seen her since Christmas. The one closest in age to me (we are actually the same age for 4 days, seh was my first birthday present), lives a 1/2 hour away. She calls, once in a blue moon, and again, I haven't seen her since Christmas. It's sad when you think that family would be right by your side (my Mom calls, as I do her, but she's 80, we go to lunch and shop once a week, she also lives in the neighborhood), just abandon you. Leapfrog-I was wondering the same thing as Tanya. Can't you make a bedroom (or put a bed in a room) on the first floor of your home? I know when the time comes for me to move downstairs (all our bedrooms are upstairs), I will put a bed in either the family room, in the back of the house, or the living room in the front. Only problem is there is no shower on the first floor. My husband is a master plumber, so he will have to figure that out. I really don't want to have to sponge bathe every day. Tanya-Glad the lower dose of Ibrance is making you feel a little better. Keetmom-This winter has been a rough one. Not too much snow, but the cold and ice have been awful. It just brings you down when we are already pretty down. This weekend though, it rained and melted a lot of the snow and the ice in our driveway. It warmed up too (40's yesterday), and is suppose to be 50 on Thursday. I will definitely be outside on Thursday. I need the sunshine on my face (and I burn easily, but I don't care, LOL). I may even go without anything on my bald head (Taxotere, since last May), so I don't end up with a white head and a tan face, as I did last summer. I'm glad they found a new drug for you. Gracie-Big hugs! I hope things are getting better for you! Bighome-Thinking of you and your hubby. Big hugs. Lynne-Are you looking forward to the warmer weather this week? My scans, from last Mon, came back good. I'll be staying on Taxotere. She is going to lower the dose though because of the neuropathy in my hands and feet hurting at the end of the day. I've had it for a couple of months (I've been on Taxotere since last May) and in the morning, it's not too bad, by the end of the day it's awful. She also said I could take a break from it for a few weeks, since I've been stable for so long. I never got a break from Faslodex, which I was on for 1 1/2 years, nor Xeloda, which I was on for 2 1/2 years, of course these weren't I've chemos, but the Faslodex shots were awful, I could have used a break from them!. I'm saving my break for April, when we go to Disney with our kids and grandkids. If my schedule stays the same, I would be getting chemo the day before I leave, so I will postpone for two weeks, the Fri after I get back. Maybe with a long break, I won't feel like a walking zombie. My blood work showed my white cells were low (what else is new?). I asked her about the vertebra T4, that is 60% collapsed (it was 30% on the last scan). I asked if it could be repaired somehow. I knew that the radiologist could not do a kyphoplasty on that one (I've had 4 done), because it was too high up. I asked do they put a rod in or something. She said that no they just leave it. I asked what happens when it starts hurting me. She said she give me pain killers. I already have oxycodone which I don't like. It just spaces me out and doesn't help with the pain and also constipates me. I rarely take it. I do have medical cannabis (which is legal here). It's an oil I put under my tongue. I had never had marijuana before and it took me a couple of weeks to not be totally spaced out. I asked for something that does not give you a high, he said this one only gives a little. I'm glad I said something, I can't imagine more of a high. It does help with the pain, but there is still a little there. If I'm going to drive though, I don't take it. I usually, just have tylenol, which helps even less for the pain. When I go back this week for some more oil, I'm going to say less high more pain killer and try another. That night I had planned to go to the movies with my 2 daughters. We saw \"Fifty Shades Free\". We read all the books and saw the 2 previous movies. It was ok (movies are never as good as the books). I love the theater we go too (there are 4 different ones in our area). They have power recliners for seats. The first 2 movies I saw there, I fell asleep, LOL! I did stay awake for this one and the last one we saw together, \"Pitch Perfect 3\". We went to get pizza before the movie. The place was busy (It was a Fri), but we were seated right away. We got there an hour before the movie, plenty of time, right? Wrong! The waitress took our drink order, brought our drinks, and we ordered the pizza by 6pm. At 6:15, we asked her for a box, because we had to leave by 6:30 (the movie started at 6:45 and was 5 min down the road). She told us we should have said we were in a rush. Ok, a pizza takes max, 15 min to make and cook. Apparently, she never put our order in until then. She had run to the kitchen before we could say forget it! She left the check with us before she took off. My daughter used her debit card and paid for the bill, unfortunately. She came back saying it would be 10 min. We told her to box it up in the kitchen. I walked out at that point and waited in the car. 5 min later my older daughter came out. I asked where her sister was, she said at the counter waiting. I went in, and said grab our waitress and tell her to void your slip and just pay for the drinks. She asked, and they said they couldn't do it because they were too busy, and to come back after the movie and how they wanted us to keep coming there (NEVER again!), and then miracles of miracles the pizza came out. She grabbed it and threw it in the back. We got to the movie at 7, and the previews were still going, and there was a girl in one of our seats (you can pick your seats there), she moved. When we got home, they ate the pizza at 9, as we watched the opening for the Olympics. We've been DVRing and watching them every day! They've been great! I hope everyone is having a better day! Hugs!

I was going to have a mini version made to throw, but my mother talked me out of it, and said I would throw it. I didn't! That going to bed with your nails not dry, is something I would do. It made me laugh. I hope your sheets didn't get stained! Back to the drawing board for you! MJH- We ended up not going to Loon for the weekend. He couldn't find a place to stay. He did go skiing at Sugarbush in VT with his 2 brothers and a couple of other guys. One of his brother's friends has a condo there. He drove up there at 5:30am on Sat (he stayed home and watched our grandson, so my daughter's and I could go to the movies Fri night), skied all day, stayed the night, then came home by noon on Sun, because it was pouring. It's a 3 hr ride from our house each way. IHe has Monday off this weekend, I asked him if we could getaway and stay at his parent's house ()they are in FL until May, it's on a small lake, and is very quiet up there, only an hour away and it's free!) for the weekend. He didn't give me an answer yet. I just need a change of scenery! Lynne-I turned on the NBC to watch the Olympics yesterday afternoon, after I came home from lunch and shopping with Mom, and right away, Breaking News came on. I thought it would be the president, or his press secretary coming on. I was horrified when I saw kids running from their school yet again. All I could think of was Columbine and Sandy Hook again! When will this ever end? So senseless! I am praying for those poor families that lost a loved one, and the entire school and the community. It breaks my heart! Well, it's suppose to be near 50 here today! I suppose I should shower and get outside, maybe scrape the little bit of ice we have left in our driveway (the section that never sees the sun). If the sun comes out (it just came out! YAY), I'm going to sit outside, with no head covering so I can tan/burn the top of my bald head, to match my face color, and read a book. I've been coughing the past couple of days, I hope that won't delay my chemo tomorrow! I'm taking Mucinex twice a day, and last night I took some Nyquil. I actually got 4 hrs sleep last night, Tues night I didn't sleep all night, but got 3hrs from 6-9am. I hope I get more tonight, darn steroids!! Good luck everyone! Hugs and prayers! Lynne   ",

Yes, I live in New England, and they say, just wait 5 min, and the weather will change. I'll take today for sure! Perfect! My scans came back ok, so I am continuing on Taxotere. I've been on it since May, and am really sick of all these side effects, but I'm still here (as I always say!). She said I could take a short break, since I've been on it so long with good results. I am going to take a few weeks off, before our Disney trip the end of April. I am due for chemo the day before I leave, and will postpone it until the Fri after I come back. I can't wait to get a break. She did lower my dose again, due to the neuropathy in my hands and feet. They really hurt by the end of the day. It still takes an hour for the Taxotere infusion. I do miss my hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes though. I lost most of my hair 2 weeks after I started my chemo back in May, the rest later on. I have my nephew's wedding in August, and was hoping to have it back by then, but no! Micmel-I'm glad you were able to save money by buying the linens! i wasn't sure if it was cheaper, but the rental price seemed very high! I started medical marijuana in October. I take the tincture (drops of oil under your tongue). It helped with the pain (still had some though) and I asked for no high, and got a little one. I just changed the strain they gave me. The daytime one has no high, and the night time one does. I only took it on Sat, because this is my \"hell week\" (week after chemo) and I get dizzy enough on nothing. It did help, and I will start it up again Monday, when my dizziness should be gone. They sit down with you and try to find the perfect one for you. They are very helpful, and you can call them anytime. So many choices. Good luck! Tanya-I hope you get good results with your scan! Bighome-So glad to hear from you. I am so sorry you had to witness that awful accident, and I'm sorry your DH got rear ended. It's awful what his family is putting you through! Big hugs! Mag-I pray that you get the house! I'm so sorry your are missing your husband so badly. I hope something is working on those muscle spasms, those are the worst. Big hugs!  Lynne-Thanks for thinking of me when you saw the mini! I hope you have a wonderful trip in a couple of weeks. Here's a pic of my mini, wave if you see me! I hope everyone has a good day! Hugs and prayers for all! Lynne  ",

We go out from spring until fall (we did have the top down a month ago, for a short ride), every weekend. We do one day in the mini, and the other day on our Harley trike. We also go out on all day rides, with a bunch of other mini owners, about once a month (except from Jan to March). We love it! Tanya-Great news on your scans!

Loved the overalls, Mae! Here are pictures from my wedding in 1983. He had just turned 20 and I was almost 22. We will be married 35 years in October. The maid of honor and two of my bridesmaids are my 3 younger sisters, the other (the blonde) is my friend Brenda (I was her matron of honor a few years later), the flower girl is my husband's niece. She was 4, and is the oldest grandchild out of 13 on his side (my youngest is the youngest). The picture was taken at my parent's house before the wedding. The one of the two of us was at the reception at the Manchester Country Club. The one of us out of our fancy clothes, is when we left the reception. The first one was my senior prom in 1980 (he was a year behind me, I went to his senior prom too), we started dating the beginning of my senior/his junior year in high school. My parents also offered us the money instead of the wedding, but all 4 of us girls chose the wedding. What were we thinking?? Micmel, see what I meant about drop kicking my bouquet? LOL My older daughter tried on my dress one day. We could not zip it up to the waist. She's tiny! I guess we all forgot how small we were. I remember it was a size 8, and I was 120 lbs then. Boy how life changes you!    ",

Divine, my niece said she wants to wear my wedding dress because it looks like Princess Kate's. She's only 20 and doesn't have a serious boyfriend yet. I told her only if she can fit in it. It was an Alfred Angelo gown, and I only paid 350.00 for both the gown and the veil (boy have times changed!). Grannax and Minnie, loved your mother of the children pics. Our younger daughter Lindsay's 6th anniversary is tomorrow (well, not really, she doesn't get an anniversary this year, she got married on the 29th!). I'll have to post a pic or two.My husband, myself, Lindsay and Nick. Our family (minus our grandson Aiden, he was conceived on their honeymoon). Lindsay and Matthew, before the wedding. The snow started at the luncheon. This was a fun pic we did in the back yard. She just had a city hall wedding (the already had a 10 month old son, they now have 2), and a small luncheon at a restaurant. Our older daughter was engaged, and her fiance called off 4 months before the wedding. Our 2 sons aren't married yet either. Hopefully, I will get to go to go to their weddings too someday. Lynne-Have a wonderful vacation in FL! Enjoy you family! Bring back some sunshine! Had fun watching my grandsons, older daughter, and my youngest, playing in the pool with the kids yesterday. If I hadn't gone to the ER this weekend, I would've been in there too! The oncology office called while I was gone, and wanted me to come in today for blood work and see the PA. I got home too late to call them back. They called again today to have me come in today. I told them I don't have a ride and didn't feel comfortable driving there because I hadn't driven in a month. I told them I haven't had a fever since the hospital and was feeling fine. I will be there on Fri. She said so you want me to tell them that. I said yes. I'm already going to be there 3 days in the next week and enough is enough. If I wasn't feeling well, I would have had my husband come get me, which he would have today, but it's crazy to go 2 days before my oncology/blood work appointment. I'm on 2 antibiotics until next Wed, I really don't see the point! Enjoying all the pics! Have a great day tomorrow everyone! Lynne ",

I hope you got good results! I hope we don't get as much snow as they are saying (8-14\", hubby is happy, he plans on going skiing this weekend) tomorrow and Thursday. We lucked out the last storm, only rain and wind, hopefully we will have lesser than they are expecting (temps are suppose to stay low though). I know spring isn't until March 20th (and much later here), but I am so done with winter. Minnie-I'm glad you'll get to see your grandchild in May! I love seeing my 3, but boy am I exhausted afterwards. We kept them overnight. Our older daughter slept on the couch, and our granddaughter slept in her daybed and the 2 boys shared the trundle bed, feet to feet, in her room. They went to bed at 9, and the older grandson was asleep when I checked on them at 9:30, the other two were both awake, I told them to go to sleep. At 10 they were still up, again I told them the same. Finally, at 10:30 (waaay past their bedtimes, good thing it was Sat), Aiden (the 5 year old, youngest grandchild), says he has to go potty. Instead of going down the hall, he went down the stairs (where Auntie was). I got Pepere, and told him I wasn't chasing him. He said Christy is down there, she'll make him come back up. She did. He came to our room, and of course, softy Pepere, let him sleep between us (we have 2 x-long twin adjustable beds, so he got the crack). He fell asleep almost immediately, but only slept until 6am (the other 2 were up at 5:30). I went to bed very early on Sunday! Divine-Glad your appointment went well! Lynne-I hope you're enjoying FL. Snow on the way tomorrow, and lots of it (I hope they are wrong again like last week, and we only get rain, I doubt it though!). Cleaning at the dentist tomorrow and Chemo on Friday. Finishing off my antibiotics from my ER stay today and started my pre-steroids today. Hopefully, the diarrhea will end for a few days, before it starts all over again on Monday. My little sleep week starts today. I am so looking forward for my break in April. Hope everyone is having a good week so far! Hugs and prayers! Lynne",

For grocery shopping, I use Hannaford (a chain here) to go. You place your order online, pick your pick-up time, and they get everything ready for you. You go down to the store to pick it up, and don't have to get out of the car! Love it! We usually spend 200, so we only pay 2.00 for the service. The most people pay is 5.00, so worth it! My husband picks up milk in between. I can't believe how fast the food goes too. Of course there are 4 of us here, and my eldest and his daughter come here (for a free meal), when he has her (Mon, Wed, and every other weekend). I will have just bought a gallon a milk, and he'll come in and pour half of it for himself and daughter! Makes me nuts. Enjoy your break from Ibrance! I'm taking a break before FL. Last chemo before vacation will be the 30th, then I won't have another until the beginning of May, when I get back. I'd be due for chemo the day before I leave, and that's not happening! Keetmom-Glad you are doing well through rads. Hope the new treatment doesn't have lots of side effects! Hugs and prayers! Lynne-I can't believe the players that are leaving! So bummed! Hopefully, we get players that are just as great to replace them! Amendola really hurt! Grannax- We went to Pearl Harbor in 1987, with our 4 week old and 16 month old. Very moving. Lots of Japanese throwing flowers in for their soldiers too. We stayed 2 weeks with friends of ours, who were stationed at the Air Force base. We planned the trip before number 2 was in the picture. She was the easy one, our son cried on the plane, all the way there, and all the way home. His ears were bothering him. Nightmare flights. Hawaii was beautiful though. We also got to see my sister and her husband who were stationed in Okinawa Japan. Have a wonderful time. Disney always does it great! Great pics! My Dad was in between wars (Korea and Vietnam). The draft was out then, so no one would hire him after high school. He volunteered in the Army (shortly after he was dating my Mom) and was stationed in Germany for 2 years.They wrote letters, and sent pictures to each other. He sent her an engagement ring in the mail (she said she hugged the mailman!). He wanted an answer, and she told him she'd tell him when he came home. She wasn't sure if he'd be the same man when he came home. Needless to say, he was, and they married in 1961. DH went skiing yesterday, at Killington VT. He said that only half of the trails were groomed, and there was 3 feet of snow on the other trails. He's going to Sugarloaf VT for the weekend, to ski with his brothers again. I'm still feeling icky. Last night I had chills and ran a fever for a few hours. I took a shower and some tylenol, and it went from 100.6 to normal. I'm glad I waited to call the drs office. Saved me a trip to the ER. Today, I've had no fever. I hope it stays that way! I've decided not to go to the Mini dinner on Sat, and my cousin's 60th party tomorrow. They had to know if we were coming or not, so they could make reservations. I figured I'd watch the grandkids Sat night, and my kids could go out for St Pat's. We can watch movies in my bed! Hope everyone is having a good day! Lynne",

I miss both! I can always cover my nearly bald head, and draw in my eyebrows, but no eyelashes, I think I will have to get fake ones for my nephew's wedding in August (if I'm still on Taxotere, or if they haven't grown back on the next treatment). I've never used them before, always just used mascara. I'm glad the stuff you got is working for you! Minnie-Glad you celebrated with Karaoke too! The kids had a blast. Only our eldest sings. Usually with his cousin Patrick, who he shares a house with (and another single guy). They've been doing it for years! They all have great voices, but the other 3 chickened out. One of my friends follows Rugby. He used to play in his younger years. He had posted about Ireland's win. Congrats! Well, my husband said he was skiing until noon, then heading home. It's now noon, so I guess I should shower and dress. Have a wonderful day everyone! Hugs! Lynne ",

I will read them in the morning and reply then. Disney was great, but exhausting. The house rental was only a 15 min ride to most of the parks (the furthest was 20). Closest we ever been. The house had 7 bedrooms and 6 bathrooms. The beds were very low to the floors though (I think they were previously waterbed frames). Our bedroom was on the first floor with it's own bathroom . Our youngest took the other bedroom on the first floor, the only one withouth it's own bedroom and tv (he traded with my sister, who took our Mom's place, so she could have her own bathroom). I told him he could use our bathroom (he ended up going upstairs, and using one of his sibling's). We told him he could use the living room tv, as much as he wanted. There was also a 1/2 bath on the first floor. The kitchen, living room area was open. There was a kitchen table, and an large dining room table, as well as a table outside under the overhang roof lanai. They made the garage into a game room. Foosball, ping-pong, pool table. The rest of the bedrooms and baths were upstairs. The pool was concrete with a hot tub at one end, that has a small waterfall into the pool. There were no railings to hang onto to get into the pool or hot tub. A little tough for me, though I managed to do it. The grand kids would start in the hot tub, and go down the 1 foot waterfall into the pool. They went in every night we got back (between 5 and 7, 8-10 hr days in the parks, and I was being pushed by my husband or one of the 2 sons, all the time!). There lanai, pool area is all screened in (alligators), and there were lounge chairs, a gas grill, an outside shower, and a \"fence\" (that could be taken down, we left it up for the kids) in front of the pool. The house really worked for us, the only things I can complain about, are those beds, and the maintenance of the house and pool. Lightbulbs didn't work, house was dirty when we got there, the floors and walls mostly, and the pool was turning green on Wed, due to us having it heated. We ate our meals there every night ($400 grocery bill on Sat, when we arrived). The kids had a ball! Sunday, we went to Epcot that day. They were having there flower and garden festival. So it was very pretty. They had topiary characters and flowers everywhere (my son-in-law took pictures of them all, it was his first time going to Disney too!). We had brunch in Norway, with the princesses. They got to see Belle, Cinderella, Ariel, Sleeping Beauty (Aurora) and Snow White (I found it strange that Elsa and Anna weren't in their own castle, the did wait in a 45 min line to see them later though, and we did the Frozen ride in Norway, right after brunch). It downpoured on those of us that did not want to ride the Tower of Terror (those of us who had been on it before, and our granddaughter Ryleigh). Luckily, I had an umbrella and some cheap $1 ponchos. Then we did a Beauty and the Beast show, and it became a thunderstorm. We left after that. They kids and grandkids went back, and did the Test Track ride. I couldn't believe our grandsons went on all those crazy rides, and liked them and wanted to do them again (Matthew was the only one who didn't like the Tower of Terror). They also got to see the night show. My sister Colleen and I stayed home, and enjoyed the quiet! I think my husband would have liked to stay home too, but he was the driver for the 2nd mini van (they could not all fit in one). Monday, we did Hollywood Studios. We had lunch in the Drive-In Sci-Fi theater. We didn't get a care. They had no room for 11. We sat at 3 umbrella tables in the back and could still see the movies. Later, it downpoured (only day it rained all week!) on those of us that did not want to ride the Tower of Terror (those of us who had been on it before and didn't like it, and our granddaughter Ryleigh). Luckily, I had an umbrella and some cheap $1 ponchos. Then we did a Beauty and the Beast show, and it became a thunderstorm. We left after that. The kids and my husband again went back, for more rides and the night show. Tuesday, we went to Animal Kingdom. Ryleigh, Colleen, and I did not go on Everest (a roller coaster) , and waited for the rest (they had fast passes) and were done pretty quick. I did make the mistake of going on the Dinosaur ride. I had gone on that one and the one in Universal years ago, and I know I disliked one. It was the Disney one. You are in a car, and are bounced and jolted around. My husband and I think we got whiplash. Our neck muscles were sore for the rest of the week, and my ribs still hurt, and my right side started hurting worse Sat night. I have a sharp pain if I move certain ways. The last 2 days have killed me getting in and out of beds, and forget sleeping on my side (I sleep on my left) and I have a temperpedic adjustable bed (I call it my hospital bed). I started my steroids today, so that means no sleep until Sunday night (chemo on Thursday this week). I will see the PA on Thursday, and tell her about it. I put a Lidocaine patch on my right ribs, took my marijuana, tylenol, and even took an oxycodone (you know the pain is bad when I resort to that!). I probably broke a rib. Nothing they can do about it anyhow. Our final ride of that day was the river rapids ride. We all got soaked, and went home. Wednesday, we took the day off, while my sister and the rest went to Blizzard Beach (one of the Disney water parks). My in-laws had traded their timeshare for a condo in the same town as us (Kissimee), and they were 20 miles away! His father was having some hip issues (it look like sciatica) and we drove out to them. 4 tolls later, and we get to there condo. The condo is nice, but it is in an industrial area. They only restaurant they have is a Subway sub shop. We had them get in our car and we took them on the back roads, hoping to find someplace for lunch. We didn't find anything until we got to our area. We ate at an Outback, and then brought them to our house. My husband had dropped of half the kids to the water park (free parking there, instead of the $22 a day park parking), and about 15 min after we got there, they had called to pick them up. They all got to see their (great)grandparents, and of course the grandkids all hopped into the pool, after being wet all day! Then we drove them back to their condo and I gave him 6 of my Lidocaine patches to try on his back. We didn't get home until 7. Some day off! Thursday & Friday, we did the Magic Kingdom. We did Fantasyland and Tomorrowland on Thursday. They got fastpasses for Space Mountain. Ryleigh and I went on Dumbo. She pushed me around the park. Good thing she is big for her age! Then they all went on the teacups, and my husband ended up pushing us for our fast pass to see the princesses. Her favorite is Rapunzel. We went straight in and there was only one girl in front of us. There was actually 2 princesses. The one from the Princess and the Frog movie (her name begins with an N, I always forget it) was also there. She was thrilled (as any 8 1/2 year old girl would be). We did lots of other rides and shows too We didn't get home until after 7 that night, nobody went back.. On Friday, we did Frontierland and Adventureland. They got fastpasses for, Thundermountain (a rollercoaster) and Splash Mountain (a flume ride). The longest wait in line we had was Pirates of the Carribean, over and hour. It was awful. A lot of the rides they let me in a different way and the other 11 could come too, but not that one. We all had to wait. We went home for supper (as usual) and they were heading back for their Splash Mountain pass, and our daughter wanted to get silhouettes of the 3 grandkids (we had done it for our 4 kids). My husband did not feel like driving back again, so they would need to squeeze 8 in a 7 passenger minivan. We suggested one of the 2 smallest (our older daughter or our sil) sit on the floor, between the 2 seats in the middle. Well my sil (who was pouting and being an ASS all week, I knew I should have not had him come) just stayed in his bedroom, while the rest were waiting outside for him. Our younger daughter went upstairs, and slammed the door as she left. I don't blame her for being mad. Well they never got to Splash Mountain, but did get their pictures, and saw the night show. They didn't get back until midnight. We left the house by 9 the next morning (our flight wasn't until 12pm). The only night show they didn't see was the Animal Kingdom one. I watched it this morning, on you tube, and thought it was ok (compared to the others, maybe you have to be there). That was my week! Next vacation is local (at my favorite lake here, Newfound, it's an hour and half away) the last week of August, through Labor Day. Hopefully, Mom doesn't end up missing it (she ended up in the hospital for 2 nights while we were gone, they are now thinking it was her heart, not her COPD, she is seeing a cardiologist, even though her EKGS, and echo were normal). Hugs to all! Lynne ",

You guys had a lot going on while I was gone! Gracie-I hope you are feeling better now, after that fall. I'm glad you did not get injured badly. Lynnwood-I'm glad your scans came out well, and hopefully, the kidney problem isn't a problem. I too take meloxicam daily, and was told never to take NSAIDS with it. I could only take Tylenol for pain. I take it, and I agree ibuprofen works better, but I just do the Tylenol. I get scanxiety sometimes still. Even after 6 years. My next ones are in a couple of weeks. It stinks that your insurance is denying you your PET scan. It's ridiculous how they make us jump through hoops sometimes! You and your dr can appeal it. It works sometimes. Maybe they didn't explain the situation right. I always have CTs and a bone scan every three months. I have only had 2 PET scans. Once when I was first diagnosed, and once when they weren't sure of some lung nodules, if they were cancer or residual. They were residual. I hope you get approved. Bigbhome-I am glad your husband's surgery went well and that you are going back on the Ibrance! I know you are taking care of him, but you also need to take care of you too! I am the same way, and always put everyone else first. I am getting a little better at saying no. I found out I can't do it all. I'm sorry about his trip to the ER, I hope they figured it out! I am praying for both of you! Big Hugs! MJH-I may just take you up on the trip to your house. Of course I don't like lobster, blueberry pie, or gin and tonics,but my husband (my driver for long distances) loves all of it! I'll bring filet mignon, apple pie, and mudlsides though! LOL Magda-Wow! The treatments really did mess up your teeth. Ouch! Lynne-LOVE that hat on you! It looks great! Grannax-Have a wonderful time in Hawaii. Lynne went to the same resort, I believe. She could tell you all about it! Mae-Love the outfit and matching totes. Have fun! Tanya-I can feel and see the tube in my neck, as well as feel the port itself, under the skin. It's the first one I've had (and hopefully the last!). Good luck to your beautiful granddaughter on her exams. Micmel-Try walking around the house a little. Just moving sometimes helps with the fatigue. The Sun is shining today for the first time in a few days. Also, it's suppose to be in the high 60's! I'm getting out there for sure. Try to even off my tan face to my white head! LOL Hope everyone is having a good day! Hugs! Lynne ",

I'm also glad that you will be getting away for a week! Craziness! Micmel-Glad you got to spend time with your family this weekend! Beautiful day here yesterday. We took the trike out for a short ride in the evening. DH raked up some of the leaves (out of my rose garden anyhow), yesterday morning, and thankfully, the black flies weren't out yet (although friends of ours that live 20 min away, said they were out in full force there!). They are here for about a month, bites are worse than the mosquitoes. It's a northern New England thing. Lucky us! We went out to lunch with those friends (she and I were attendants in each other's weddings 33 and 35 years ago, we try to get together at least every few months). It's so sad for us to see how downhill she has come with her MS. She was diagnosed at 28 (right after she had her 2nd child), and has been doing well up until a couple of years ago (she's now 53). She went from walking with a little assistance, to being wheelchair bound, having a very hard time speaking, having to be fed by her husband, her muscles are so tight, he has to bend her, to get her from the car to the wheelchair. We had some laughs (which is what we all need!) She recently started the medical marijuana to relax her muscles. She said she hasn't noticed a difference, he said that her hands aren't shaking as much, and she can sometimes feed herself a little, and put her makeup on by herself. They increased the dose yesterday, I hope it helps her more. It's so sad to see my friend this way. I'm sure she thinks the same for me. Rainy day today (at least it's in the normal, 60-70s temps). My in-laws are back from FL. They want us to come up (an hour drive each way) today, to celebrate my fil birthday (it was the 30th). It's my first day off my steroids, which is usually when the nasty side effects from my chemo begin. I'm still debating. I told him to go up with our daughter. I;d rather be home. Enjoy your Sunday!

Gracie-Yes good scans. The rib pain was last around until the week after vacation (it lasted about a month). Once the ribs heal, I only have a little pain. Too many holes in my bones. This morning was sunny this morning (now thunderstorms watch for the next hour, we could use the rain, nothing yet, thunder in the distance), so I mowed the back yard in my nightgown, wearing my sneakers, and going bald. I got it done in 45 min. My husband of course did the front yard (very small) a couple of days ago. Next time he can give me the small yard! I figured why get my clothes all dirty, wear the nightgown, then take the shower! So that's what I did! LOL Thankfully, the black flies (a New England thing, blood suckers like the mosquitoes, only they bite harder and the spot is much itchier) weren't out this morning. I heard screeching in the back yard earlier. I saw 2 squirrels in my neighbor's tree, where there nest is, going nuts. A red-tailed hawk was in their nest. This is why my small cats aren't allowed outside. Those hawks are huge. I told him to come back and get the rest of the squirrels (I know I'm cruel). I'm sick of them cleaning out my \"squirrel proof\" bird feeders. I saw one of them also chewing the plastic seats on the kid's swing set. They were in our \"attic\" (we have a cape), until my husband put heavy duty screening on the peak vents. I don't mind the chipmunk and opposum, they stay on the deck and out of the feeders, but those darn squirrels! I'm always banging on my sliding door. Some run, some don't.

She mentioned Faslodex, I had to remind her that was my first treatment, and lasted a year and a half (6 years ago). Then she mentioned tamoxifen. I reminded her that I tried that after I went through all the aramotase inhibitors (when I was first diagnosed), and it caused my liver function tests to go way up. Not good when you have liver mets. So those 2 were knocked off the list. The two left are Ixabepilone, which is given every 3 weeks. It causes neuropathy and it frequently has allergic reactions. Since the 2 iv chemos I have had, both caused allergic reactions, this one is probably not a good one for me. The other is Gemcitabine, She is going to set up an appointment at Dana Farber. The doctor I see used to come to Londonderry once a month (20 min from me), now she just stays in Boston. So we'll have to deal with that lovely (NOT) ride, back and forth. So we are on hold before starting anything. I hope they can get an appointment with her sooner than later. I hate not doing anything, but I haven't seen her in a couple of years, and want her opinion, and to see if there is anything else out there. My local oncologist, set me up for the Gemcitabine chemo in a couple of weeks, in case I get the same choices from the Dana Farber breast oncologist. My white cells were low today, as were my red cells, and my Potassium was high (I said probably from my bananas from last week, so none this week). She was doing tumor markers this time. She said she didn't do them last time because I had them done from the chemo before. I said yes but the did the wrong tumor marker. She looked it up and said they did the ovarian cancer tumor markers. She said it was actually high, probably because of my liver tumors (I don't have any ovaries! LOL). At least it's getting done (the right one) this time! So nothing is starting until after we go to Boston, and decide what to do. I'm going to enjoy my little break from chemo!

She meets with a church group, and volunteers there all the time. She also has a group of women that have been meeting for over 50 years together. She also waits on her husband, hand and foot. He said that she can't leave him because he hasn't dressed himself in 65 years (that's how long they have been married). I said well it's about time you learned. He is doing the dishes now, and the laundry (because it is down cellar). She still does all the cooking still. They are going to the wedding too.

It came back in my spine, lung, and lymph nodes (now in my pelvis, hips, ribs, scapula, collar bone, chest bone, and skull). I was having back pain. After a week on predisone, from my primary, not working, she sent me for an x-ray. Then an MRI. I had a compression fracture in a thoracic vertebrae. I had it repaired. I also was getting short of breath, and had a thoracentisis in the right lung, to remove the fluid. Both specimens they took showed breast cancer cells. My first treatment was faslodex injections (OUCH) and monthly Zometa (bone builder, after 2 years, I now get it every 3 months) iv, both given the same day. I was on that one for a year and half. Next I was put on femara, at 3 month scans, it showed it did nothing. Next I went on Xeloda, it lasted 2 1/2 years. Next I was put on Ibrance, lasted 6 months. Next was Doxil, at 3 months scan, it hadn't worked. My current treatment is Taxotere (first one to make me lose my hair, although, the last 3 had thinned it quite a bit), I've been on this a year now. 6 years at metastatic Stage 4 now. She said gemzar would be next for me, when I asked her. I will go down to Dana Farber, and see the breast oncologist for a second opinion. Only once did they not agree on the same treatment (the femara was Boston's, the Xeloda was the local oncologist). Still driving, long walks and standing for long causes me lots of pain, so I got a wheelchair. I use it on vacations, or if we are doing a lot of walking (such as at bike week here on Sunday and the breast cancer walks, my husband built a trailer for the back of our trike, and straps it on there, works great). Just remember we are LIVING with cancer not dying from it!!",

Heading to Dana-Farber in Boston, this afternoon, for a second opinion, on which chemo to do next (number 7 treatment in 6 years!). Hopefully, she'll have a chemo that is not once a week for 3 weeks, then one week off (as my oncologist here suggested), or one that has less side effects (I had plenty with the last one, Taxotere, that I was on for a year, I need a break!).

I asked my oncologist the average lifespan, when I was first diagnosed. She told me 2 years for just bone mets, if organs were involved (as my lungs were, and now my liver too) was 1 1/2. In the next breath she told me she had 2 women 10 years out and one was still working. I recently asked if those 2 women were still around. She said one was, she is now at 16 yrs and she had another one at 14 yrs. I plan to last at least that long if not longer. I'm living with cancer not dying from it. Hugs!

Last time they started jumping on my last chemo, she did my scans a month early (at the 2 month mark). Yup, after over a year, Taxotere had stopped working for me. I know a friend of mine was having the same issue as you (she's on here, also named Lynne). Her scans were clear with her tms rising quickly.

I waited around for the onc office to call me back today (I haven't even showered yet!). No call at all. I had called them on our way to NY on Friday and left my DH's cell phone number for them to have my dr call me back to discuss what chemo I wanted to do. Waited all day. Nothing. We get to Rochester and DH is looking at his emails. Well, there are 2 from our voicemails and they are from my oncologist. She said she had talked to my Dana Farber onc, and that she would be on vacation this week, and we could talk about the chemos, when she got back. She had called my home phone! I called the oncology office today, and they finally just called back at 5pm. It was one of the PAs asking me what was going on. I explained the story and how I am scheduled for chemo on Friday for Gemzar (and next Thurs and the following Fri). I told her I wanted to do CMF, which is once every 3 weeks, unlike Gemzar which is once a week for 3 weeks, then a week off. She said she would speak my local oncologist when she got back on Monday, and cancel my chemo for Friday, and that I should also call her on Monday. GRRRR! This would be all set if my dr called the number I left on the machine. I haven't had chemo since 7/5, and I am starting to worry about stuff growing (even though I am enjoying the break). Has anyone had CMF (Cytoxin, Methotraxin, Flourourcil) for treatment?? Well, now that I got the call, I can finally take a shower! Maybe I'll wait and go in the pool instead! Lynne",

I've had sciatica since late July, and can not get the steroid shots for 2 more weeks. That was the earliest date they had. Back pain is awful. I also have a compression fracture that can not be repaired by kyphoplasty (I've had 4 repaired), because it is too high up, L2. I get pain occasionally from there, between my shoulder blades. Usually at bedtime. Big Hugs to you! Muddling-You are amazing! Micmel-All the iv chemos I've had, had a dexamethasone iv prior to the chemo. I had to also take pills for days before and after with the first 2, because of reactions. They make my face and neck flush ( I call it the Irish glow). Nice rosy cheeks. I also have trouble sleeping on it. I did not notice it making me eat anymore though. I'm actually losing weight (50 lbs since being rediagnosed 6 years ago), which I needed to do anyhow. I just don't have an appetite anymore. Lucky if I eat my cereal for breakfast, and either lunch or dinner, but not both. MJH-Yes, September sounds great (except the first week) for another ME/NH luncheon! Enjoy your company! Lynne-Sorry you had to deal with the evil Stephanie! I got the new girl last time! I have an appointment tomorrow with the dr and blood work (a week early, I'll be on vacation next week). I already have my next chemo appointment, so it's just my dr's appointment I'll have to make, hopefully not with the evil one. Hope all is well with you! I'm still in my nightgown from last night. I guess I'll shower, and put on a fresh one. My neighbor and I usually get together after she gets home, on Thursdays. I don't think we've seen each other in over a month. We've talked on the phone, but she doesn't get home until 7:30 (at the earliest) and they have a home in the mountains, and have been going up for the weekend on Thursday nights. If she calls this evening, and I'm up for it, I'll have her come here, instead of me going there. I have wine here too! Hugs to all! Lynne",

The PA said that I probably needed fluids and that's why my blood pressure dropped (and I should have gone to the ER right after it happened, so they could see how my blood pressure was and labs came out). He didn't think it was the metformin. He did give me a lower dose (1/2 of my \\normal dose) of my blood pressure meds to take the week after chemo. He thinks the chemo is causing the problems (no kidding! LOL). I started back on my meds and am feeling a little better. I see the oncologist on Friday, and will give her an earfull of what happened. Thanks for all of your concern. Like I said, I'm leaving on that plane Sat morning, and am not thinking about cancer the entire week I'm gone! ;) Mel-12 years ago, when I was originally diagnosed stage1, the hospital where I had my radiation done, offered to do our advanced directive and POA for free. We took them up on it. My DH and I both did it and have copies. These past few months I also have paid for my cremation, bought out plot (next to my parents, it was still available even though my father passed 12 years ago), and will be looking at headstones. I want all this done, so my DH and 4 children do not have to do a thing when the time comes. I'm even going to write my obit. He'll just have to notify the funeral home, and church (no wake just a funeral), paper and cemetery. I told him to have a huge party afterwards with all our friends and family. I may even do that party before I go. I will call it \"One Big Bash Before I Go\". I felt like a weight was lifted off me by getting it done. I know it's hard. Hugs! It was in the 30s here this morning, still no frost. We've had a warm fall so far. In the 60s today, 70s the rest of the week through the weekend and sunny everyday. Love it.

But at least I should feel better Christmas (I am having my husband's family Christmas Eve, and my family Christmas Day). We did have my Mom's 80th birthday party on Saturday. She was surprised, but had an inkling something was going on, thanks to my cousin's flowers that were sent to her (that my youngest sister brought over from her house), my cousin has never sent her even a birthday card before. Also I told her I made a reservation at her favorite restaurant for 2:30 on Sat, and she said they are only open on Sunday afternoon, I told her they must be open extra hours because of Christmastime. She told us later that that was the first birthday party she ever had! She always had a cake, but not any friends over growing up, and Dad never gave her a party (besides us immediate family), so I guess it was about time! My sister's small cape was packed, but everyone seemed to enjoy themselves (especially Mom). Today is her actual birthday. My husband and I took her out for dinner (since we didn't make it on Sat!), to another restaurant, with a promise to her favorite (it was closed today) soon. Tomorrow is another day my friends!

My husband skied the whole day, while I stayed in the lodge. I stopped skiing altogether about 10 years ago. My husband still skis, of course he started at 7, and I started at 17. Our kids all ski, and a couple snowboard too. Although, just the girls still do it now. The boys have no interest. We are up in Laconia at our timeshare. We got her on Fri, and have it until Fri. My husband is going to commute to work from here starting tomorrow. Of course, he has to be a mile from our house at 7am in the morning. I'll stay here and read, watch tv, or be on the computer (just like at home) but mostly, just enjoy the quiet. I have chemo again on Friday, so Bryan will be picking me up after work on Thursday night (so I don't have to get up at 4am to leave Fri morning). Our daughters, son-in-law, and grandsons came up on Sat. They all went in the indoor pools and went on the water slides while I watched through windows, from a sitting area, outside the pool. My white cell counts were down (my blood work/oncologist appointment was Fri), so I stayed away from all those kids in the pool. It was packed with people. I don't know what to do with my bald head either. I could where a bandana, I suppose. My husband says to go without anything. I really don't think I can do that. I do it at home all the time. As soon as I come in the door off it goes, my younger grandson wanted a \"haircut\" like Nana. It's short but not just a little fuzz like mine, thankfully! We watch the Patriots every game (I record them if I know we won't be home). That game looked very cold, but this weeks looked freezing. I don't know how the people in the stands could stand it! Good for your granddaughter for hanging in there! Yes, there has been way too many nail biters! Good luck on your scans! I'm do again in Feb. Mel, my son Bryan Jr is 31 (32 in April), my daughter Christiana is 30 (31 in August), my daughter Lindsay is 27 (28 in March), and my son Kevin is 22 (23 in July). Weather here is brutally cold right now. Single digits with wind chills in the negative numbers. It's supposed to be like this all week (aside from Thursday, when it will be a little warmer and will snow). Schools are all having 2 hour delays tomorrow, when the kids go back to school, because of the freezing temps. I hope all of you have a very Happy and Healthy New Year!! Lynne  ",

It was -6 here this morning (warmer than it's been in a week), and is now in the low 20's, snow here to-morrow 4-10 inches with hurricane winds in the afternoon. Back to the deep freeze again for the weekend though. Mel-I hope you feel better soon and can enjoy your son's ceremony. My older son made it through Cub Scouts with my husband pushing him, but he didn't want to do boy scouts with our neighbor across the street son (who became an eagle scout). Later after another of his childhood friends joined as a first time scout, he wanted to join. They had already been in scouts for 2 years. My husband said no, he had too much to make up. All of our kids were scouts. Our youngest only lasted a couple of years in cubs,but our girls were in through 7th and 10th grades. Now our grandkids are all scouts. Here is our family Christmas card that I don't think I posted. We've taken one every years since Bryan Jr was born (except on year, and boy did we hear from everyone!). It was taken on Thanksgiving day by our youngest's (Kevin) girlfriend who visits us every year. It was cold (but not this cold) that day and I remembered to take the pumpkins off the steps, but forgot to take the Indian corn off the door! LOL Starting from the top, Me (with my \"Dolly-Farrah\" wig on, my husband Bryan, 2nd row, Kevin and our 3 grandkids Aiden (5, Lindsay's), Ryleigh (8, Bryan Jr's), and Matthew (6 1/2, Lindsay's), 3rd row, Christiana, our son-in-law Nicholas (Lindsay's), Lindsay, and Bryan Jr (I hate that Nick and Bryan aren't smiling, they both have great smiles!). Hope those of you who aren't feeling well, feel better soon, and those of you coming up for scans and bloodwork, get great results! Chemo for me on Friday (if the white cells are up that is!).

I too thought our comments on here would not be shared. I hope you get something for relief tomorrow, and you can stay out of the ER tonight. Hugs! Mae-Scary looking car there. So glad you weren't hurt badly! Micmel-Glad you are starting to feel better. So happy that you will get to see your daughter walk down the aisle. Our younger daughter just had a city hall wedding (she did get a gown, that she cut short), and a small gathering (4 round tables) at restaurant (only cost us 1,000.00!). They got married on a Wednesday, Feb 29th, almost 6 years ago. It snowed, so his grandparents didn't come down from VT. They already had an almost 1 year old too, so they wanted a small thing. They always said they'd have a redo, where they invited our huge family and friends, but they never have. That's the only one I've had so far. Our older daughter was engaged and was suppose to be married 4 1/2 years ago. He wanted to postpone it 4 months before the wedding. She asked for a new date, he didn't have one. She said that she was done with him. We had a 50th birthday party for my husband at the venue (since we'd lose our 1,000.00 deposit). I hope I am able to see our 2 sons, and her get married. My goal when I was first diagnosed at 43, in 2005, was to see our younger 2 graduate high school (they were in 9th and 4th grade at the time). Luckily, I've been able to see them graduate high school and all attend college. I've also got to meet my 3 grandchildren (I'm sure some day there will be more). Enjoy the small moments! Tanya-Your husband's words are so touching. I'm sure he appreciated you looking nice for him. It is sad how little wipes us out. I know my husband would quit if he could. He's only 54 though, and we still have a mortgage. He tries to take me on trips all the time (even when I'm not up for it, traveling is great but tires me out!). I keep having to slow him down. Luckily, the owner of his company, lets them take off as much time as they want (only 2 weeks are paid, but he pays them, if they go on their work computer for a little while on vacation). Lynne-I totally agree with you on how you feel about having MBC. Unless you have it, they don't get it. People comment on what a good attitude I have being stage 4. If only they knew how I really felt inside about it. I put on a good front, and have no trouble talking about it with anyone, but that is only because I've been dealing with breast cancer for almost 13 years, and stage 4 for almost 6. It's just part of my life now. I've also laughed when others did not think it was funny, they just don't realize that we no longer sweat the small stuff. MJH-\"hell\" week is going like usual. I am dizzy a few times a day (I fell on my butt on Monday, after trying to walk to the fridge, 10 feet away, and back, it was a soft landing though, didn't hurt), I just have to take my time and sit back down if I have too. Lots of Immodium and Pepcid. I thought I might skip the thrush this time, since she cut my steroids in half, but no, I have that too. So barely able to eat much. I also started having neuropathy a couple of months ago. It gets worse as the day goes on. My typical post chemo week. I hope I'm feeling better by Friday, one of my friends husband passed away at 55 from pancreatic cancer (he lasted 2 years, and got to see his daughter graduate from law school), and his wake/service is Friday. I graduated from high school with both of them and they too have been together since high school (like us). They were married 34 years (they got married 2 weeks before us). Scans on Monday. I've been on Taxotere (every 3 weeks) since May, we'll see if it's still working. In a way I hope it isn't, I'm so sick of all these side effects, but I know I should hope it is (the longer it works, the longer I'm here!). Lynne",

I should be used to it after nearly 6 years, but it never gets easier. Hugs! My tumor markers were 145. Up a little from Nov, but not as high as 350 that it went up to in the past, yet not as low as 25 that it was at one point either. We'll see what Monday brings. I hope that everyone is feeling better and things get better for you. I'll be busy tomorrow cheering on the Patriots, I'll try to get on Monday after the morning of scans! Hugs! Lynne",

We plan on taking the grandkids skiing one day (I'll be the one in the lodge, LOL). I've been on Metformin for almost 6 years now, 1 pill twice a day. I was borderline diabetic for years before. It runs in my father's family. My grandmother, father, and 2 of his sisters had it. My father was on insulin though. I hope they can reschedule your PET scan soon. I had one, after my CT scan showed something, and I don't remember them asking me if I was diabetic, although, I'm sure it's in the chart. I didn't have to do anything different though. I'm glad you got to enjoy the aquarium (and the kids) in Boston. Love that place. Lynne-This is the end of \"hell week\". It was a little better this week. The dropped the dose of Taxotere, but it still takes an hour as before. Still dizzy, but less so, same with the stomach issues. The eating is the hardest. I'll be better by Monday, like usual. I'll enjoy next week, then have to start the steroids (barely sleep for 6 days I'm on it) the following Tues before chemo that Fri. I get about a week and a half, that I feel normal! We have 11 people going on the Disney trip. My husband, myself, our 4 adult kids and son-in-law, the 3 grandkids, and my Mom (who's 80). We rented a 7 bedroom 7 bath house, that's 4 miles from Disney. It has a pool and hot tub as well. We will be renting 2 mini vans as well. We just bought our plane tickets and park tickets on Monday (YIKES!). We also booked a princess lunch in Epcot and a lunch at Chef Mickey's at the Contemporary (all the main characters will be there), yesterday. We're paying the rest on the house this week as well. I am only making our kids pay for their Disney tickets. I took out my 401k this year, and after paying for my cremation, plot, and headstone, I still have money left, and decided to have one last big family vacation, while I can still enjoy it. My parents took all 10 of their grandchildren to Disney (my Dad was a Disney nut!), and I wanted to do the same for the ones I have (I'm sure they'll be more, 2 of my kids don't have any). It will be exhausting but fun. That's what will be great having the 2 mini vans. If some want to go back to the house because they are tired, we can take one of the mini vans and go back, while the others stay. I did try the new portal. I don't like it as well as the old one. It lists the blood work, but it doesn't say if it's high or low, and doesn't list the normal range like the old one. Some of mine was missing as well. I go again next Fri for blood work, we'll see if it's any better then. Mae-Good luck to your husband. I had an umbilical hernia repaired twice. I hope he heals quickly. My best friend always says she'll take me to my appointments, so my husband doesn't have to. I don't let her because I'm afraid that she'll have a meltdown too. I definitely would not allow her in the treatment area. She's a loud talker, and talks a lot. I don't want to disturb the others, plus I don't think she would do well back there. She has no idea what goes on back there. She's been with her mother to some appointments that they had to do stuff to her, and my friend did not handle it well. I'm so sorry your friend got upset. I'm glad you enjoyed her visit. Micmel-Yes we go for rides once a month (except Jan and Feb) with fellow mini drivers. We spend the whole day on the road and have lunch together. We go on the back windy roads. It's fun and gets us out of the house. We also take rides on our motorcycle. My husband came home with a Harley trike in July. So we usually spend Sat in the mini, and Sunday on the trike. Our friends have a trike too, so we go with them most of the time. It's wonderful to be in the fresh air. I can't wait for the weather to get better. We did take the bike out Tues night when he got home from work. It was a short ride, but nice! Tanya-My husband got the mini after I was rediagnosed and had sold my motorcycle. I told him now I need a red convertible. I was thinking maybe a volkswagon bug. He wanted a mini, so there you have it. He drives it like a race car though. It has a standard transmission (which I know how to drive, but he's the driver when we're together which is most of the time). It's a little hard for me to get in and out, because it's so low to the ground, but I love it! I suppose I should shower (it's 1pm!). I hope all of you have a nice day! Hugs! Lynne",

Grannax-My grandchildren exhaust me too, but I love being with them. Tonight, all 3 of them are staying over. It was our daughter's anniversary a couple of days ago, so we said we'd watch her boys. Then we also invited our granddaughter. They don't get to see each other as much as they use to, so we figured we'd take them all. I'll be exhausted tomorrow, but we'll have fun. Micmel-We used to watch Dirty Jobs too. The host always made me laugh. I guess they ran out of Dirty jobs for him to do. Last night I went out with my former co-workers. It's been about a year since we have got together. There were 8 out of us, 14 with spouses. We were at the restaurant for 3 hours. Lots of laughs. Then we went to one of my friend's house. We used to get together every Fri. I had a fire in my backyard, and we'd do that from spring to fall, then when it got too cold, we'd take turns hosting. We haven't gotten together in a year. I've seen them out and about, and spoken to a couple of them on the phone, but we haven't all got together. It was nice. I hope we can do it again. I've miss both my co-workers and my friends. Not sure if they are just shying away from me or what. I didn't ask, maybe I should have. Luckily, they picked the right week where I'm feeling ok. I just wish that my friend's had chosen a different night. Tough having to show up late. One friend was leaving as we came in. I was laughing so hard I was crying a few times. It felt good! Got to get the house ready for the grandkids! Have a great day! Hugs! Lynne  ",

I don't know where that burst of energy came from during my hell week, but I'll take it! Oh and I did all this in my nightgown! I knew I wasn't going anywhere, so I took a shower, and put another nightgown on. If the neighbors mind, they don't have to look. Today I will get dressed. I'm feeling not too bad this week actually. Still have the side effects, but they don't seem to be as bad this time around. I got a call from the hospital reminding me of my scans on Monday. Well they said I was going to their office in a town about a half hour from me, instead of the office a mile from me. I called them and apparently the had put my CT scans in the next town, and my bone scan at the closer one (where I have been going every 3 months for the past 6 years). She called radiology at the closer place, and they said I could go there like I always do. Otherwise, I would have my injection for the bone scan, drive a half hour for the CT scans, then go back to the closer one for the bone scan. At least it is still getting done on Monday, I just want to get it over with! Another beautiful day here. I'll be outside again for sure! Hoping everyone has a good day! Lynne",

The other daughter has a lazy eye and is the only one still wearing glasses. The son has Asperger's. He was 5th in his high school class, and is 6' 4\" tall! They all graduated on time. The girls are in college (her son chose not too, too bad, he's so smart). They all are doing well. I agree with Lynne, find some help. My older daughter was also in the NICU at Children's in Boston, 3 days after being born here (10 days overdue). She had a heart murmur and was not improving. I only held her once before she went to Boston. She ended up having her first heart surgery at 5 days old. I didn't get to hold her again for another week. So hard. I was the one that stayed with her in Boston. Her brother is only 16 months older than her, and luckily, I had 2 sister-in-laws, that were stay at home Moms who took care of him, every time she had to stay over. Our neighbor, also did too. So my husband could work. It's scary. I will be praying for you and your family! Big Hugs! Tanya-Congrats on your daughter's graduation! What an accomplishment! Elle-Beautiful garden! Lynne-I'll see you in a half hour to go to lunch! MJH-See you in about an hour! I'd better get off and draw in my eyebrows and find something for my bald head for Lynne, MJH, and my lunch date! Beautiful day here, in the 80s. Nice day to go to the seacoast! Have a wonderful day everyone! Hugs!! Lynne",

I've been getting them ever since. I like to be prepared at my appointment, to what the results are. I go over it at home (look up some medical words I don't know) and am able to ask her questions at my appointment. She's fine with it. She said one of her patients did not want to know what was on the reports, and just wanted to know if it was good or bad. To each their own, but if you want to know, it's your right! Lynne ",

My irises are the same as yours, I also have some other purple flowered plant that I transplanted from the woods. Probably a weed. LOL And my purples salvia is blooming now. Lots of purple. It will change once the day lilies start. Orange, yellow, and red then. Mae-Love that your bosses were both seeing you at HR! Jerks! To be told one thing and have a so much lower percentage is crap! I can't believe that the said they gave you a higher amount last year because they thought you were going to retire. After all you've done for them, again crap! I would be so out of there right then and there. I wouldn't need to give a two week notice since I wouldn't be working again! I left a year and a half after the cancer came back. I stopped working when my first treatment (faslodex) stopped working, in 2014. I've never looked back. I was on short-term disability for 6 months, and then went on long term and social security disability (the total comes to 60% of my last pay amount, long-term only pays 350.00). I get medicare part a (it's free) and have my husband's health insurance. I could get medicare part B for a price, after being on SS for two years. My husband's insurance would pay first though, so it wasn't worth paying the monthly fee. Good luck on your retirement You deserve it! Tanya-Sorry about your port problems! I hope it can be fixed without another surgery! Good luck on your PET scan! Micmel-At least she is talking to you now. I wouldn't know how I would feel about everything. You do what you have to. If that means not allowing her to have a reception, and not wearing your dress, so be it. I hope they find a place and move out soon, for your sanity! By the way, NH has medical marijuana. Move up here and you can hang with Lynne, MJ, and I! Hope everyone is enjoying this Tuesday! Hugs! Lynne  ",

I've got my rosy cheeck today again too. My oncologist wanted the MRI done before my chemo (on Thurs) because if there is anything, I will have to be off chemo for awhile for radiology to do treatment on the brain. I just don't know if the office is open tomorrow. I'm going to call them right after I get back from my appointment. My daughter had to bring her husband (and their 2 boys) to the ER early this morning. He fainted. He said his stomach was really bothering him in the middle of the night. They said his white cells were very high. He had a CT scan at 9. I'm waiting to hear. She went back home to check on the dog, and let the boys eat. They think it's his gall bladder. He is very thin, and they said it would be harder to do on thin people. I told her she could bring the boys here, once she gets word. My husband was suppose to take me to my appointment and will be here at 11. He can watch the boys and I can go alone. Yes Runor and Divine, my husband is one of those guys too. Everything for everyone else. He is learning to keep it just to family now. He does come to all my chemo and most of my other appointments, only since he left my first Doxil appointment and I had an allergic reaction to it, a couple minutes in (throat closed up, chest and back pain, headache, and turning bright red). Now he stays. He works on his work computer the entire time, so I read a book. At least he's there, I guess! Gracie-So glad your second treatment went well! Good luck with the last one! Lynne-I hope you go a long time with Tamoxifen! Mae-Glad your testing went well. Enjoy your cabin! Bigbhome-Hope you and your hubby are doing well! Micmel-I'm glad you got to see your daughter's new home. It's nice she'll be near your Mom. Well, time for a shower. It's going to be 95 and very humid today here! I haven't left the house in days. It;s been over 90 since last week. The heat wave is suppose to end on Fri. It will be 85 then. Can't wait, I hate heat and humidity! Hugs and prayers to all of you wonder people! Lynne ",

I've used those. Last time I did was for my nephew's wedding, 3 years ago. I ended up towards the end of the night, going in the bathroom and taking it off, so I could breathe again! I think I will skip it for our next nephew wedding, Aug 18th. I'm at the point that I choose comfort, and I don't give a hoot what other's think of me. They'll be looking at my wig/scarf that I will be wearing, instead of looking at my middle! I'm still getting the dizzies, not as bad though. I've been drinking four 20 oz gatorades a day! You would think that would keep me hydrated enough! I'm still only eating banana, yogurt, and instant breakfasts. My mouth is a mess. My stomach is a little better. It usually goes away by the weekend. Fingers crossed. Until then, I'm hanging in my nightgown. I'll take a shower this afternoon, and put on a clean nightgown. Why should I get dressed if I'm not going anywhere? I spoke with the oncology office yesterday, and they said I could come in and have another blood draw. I told them no. It's the one week out of 3 that I'm not there, plus it's my \"hell\" week. I'm seeing my oncologist next Fri (after early scans on Wed). They will be getting a piece of my mind then. Micmel-I does sound like you are not getting enough of something, by your sleeping all the time. I know you don't feel like eating, but you have to have something. What about one of those drinks with the protein? During hell week, I have an instant breakfast for a meal. There is also ensure, and others. They have different flavors. It helps. Maybe a little walk around the house will help you too. Lynne-Enjoy the white mountains! So nice up there this time of year. Another beauty of a day here. I may try to go outside. My in-laws stopped over last night. My husband ended up getting grinders (or subs as others call them) for them and himself. I had my instant breakfast. We sat outside (yes I was in my nightgown), it was lovely. A nice breeze, so no mosquitoes. They left at 8 pm, for their hour drive home. My father-in-law actually drove too! That's a good sign. He's going to have be driving,after her lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy on the 27th. Then she has 6 weeks of radiation. She's not sure if she will do it though. It's a half hour to the hospital she will going at. I can tell she's nervous. She's never even been put under before, and she will be 86 in Dec. Have a great day everyone! Hugs to all! Lynne  ",

We've been married 34, have 4 children 2 sons 31 and 22 ,and 2 daughters 30 and 27 We also have 3 grandchildren, 1 granddaughter almost 8, and 2 grandsons (brothers) 6 and 4 1/2. I was originally diagnosed at 43, in 2005, stage 1 (found on a routine mammogram). I took the Oncotype DX test on my tumor and it came back that I had only an 8% chance of recurrence in 10 years and chemo would drop it to 5%. Needless to say, I skipped chemo. I had a lumpectomy, sentinal node biopsy (no cancer in the nodes) and 6 weeks of radiation. Since the tumor was estrogen positive and I was premenopausal, I had a complete hysterectomy (everything is gone) to get rid of those estrogen ovaries. I was then put on aramotase inhibitors. I lasted 3 1/2 years on them. I couldn't take the awful side effects anymore. In 2012, I was having back pain. After an x-ray and MRI, they found I had a compression fracture in one of my vertabrae (I've since had 4 kyphoplasties to repair them), and many tumors in my spine and lungs. It's also now in ribs, pelvis, skull, other bones, as well as my liver. 5 years stage 4 and still kicking. My husband has been wonderful throughout it all. I too worry about him (his currently 54, I'm almost 56). I asked him to wait at least a year after I pass before seeing someone, and never remarry. I know it's a lot to ask, but I too get upset thinking of how his future will be, and I don't want someone else taking over my spot. I worry about the kids too even though they are all adults now. Our older daughter has a lot of health issues, and I think she will be with him forever unless she finds someone. Currently she lives at home as well as our younger son. Everyone tells me how lucky I am to have a husband like mine. He's a jack of all trades, and does most of the housework too. He'd be an awesome catch for anyone, and that's the problem I'm having. I also don't think he could be on his own. He could do it no problem, but mentally, I think he needs someone. I told him I'd haunt him if he remarried. I know I'm not being realistic, but that's just the way I feel. He's the love of my life. Thanks for listening! Lynne",

Of course I noticed a ring on my sister's finger that I gave Mom. She wanted to give it to me, I said no. I guess I should get what I want for my daughters and granddaughter before she gives it all away. I don't need anymore jewelry for myself. My husband has bought a lot over the years. She'll be 80 in Dec. I did get her to get her funeral arrangements done when I did mine. She also as her directives done to I recently got my medical marijuana card (I'm getting it for the pain. I hate the way the opiods make me feel). My husband got his caregiver card too. I've never tried marijuana. I've been to parties where there has been a lot of smoking, so technically, I've second hand smoked it. Today we go to the facility to get some. I'm going to get the tincture, oil, or edibles since I never have smoked (anything) and I have tumors in my lungs. I can't wait to see how much it costs. Insurance won't cover it.

I was only on it for 6 months, then the scans showed new stuff in my liver and I switched to Doxil. I did not lose my hair, but it had thinned more. I was only on it 3 months due to bad scans, now I'm on Taxotere. I've been on it 6 months, first treatment to make me lose my hair (I skipped chemo when I was originally diagnosed stage 1, 12 years ago) in the 5 years I've been stage 4. My hair was down to my waist. I cut it to my shoulders and dyed it for the first time in my life (at 55), blonde with pink highlights. Most of it came out one day in the shower 2 weeks later. It filled half the waste basket. I never lost it all (or cut it). I still have a few longer blonde strands on the top and sides, it has already started to grow back. I have gray and brown fuzz. I hate having to cover my head when I go places, and have only worn my wig 4 times (I usually wear scarves). At home I just walk around inside and out with nothing. The grandkids love rubbing my head. The almost 5 yr old red head told my daughter he wants a hair cut like Nana. He has beautiful curls, and she hasn't done it yet... I have my scans on the 13th. As much as I hate the side effects of this chemo, I hope it's still working. I figure the longer I'm on each treatment, the longer I'll be around. I know I'm on borrowed time as it is (my oncologist told me the average 5 years ago when I asked, she said 1 1/2-2yrs), I'm continuing my fight. I would like to see where my children lives lead, and hopefully see my grandkids grow up more. At least at this point, they are old enough to remember me. On my trip my husband pushed me around in a wheelchair, so he had to have a lot of energy! Lots of walking, I can't walk that far. It bothers my spine and pelvis, where a lot of the cancer is. So I had energy to go in the water. It was a wonderful vacation. Relaxing. Next trip in April, won't be. We are taking the family to Disney. 14 of us! I'll have lots of people to push me! LOL",

It lasts about a week. Thrush in my mouth, yeast infection, every 3 weeks from the steroids. So sick of it. Just hanging out today and watching shows I recorded. Tomorrow is suppose to be almost 70 degrees. I'm going to attempt to get out (at least in the back yard) tomorrow. Hope you are all having a great day! Lynne",

I try to explain there is no cure, but they are living in a fantasy world. They think there is a cure out there somewhere. I hope they are correct, but I'm being realistic. The only place I can talk about this cancer crap is on these boards. I've been doing that for 12 years now (since I was first diagnosed stage 1). Only support I have. Yes my family supports me, but this is the only place I'm \"allowed\" to talk about it! Today is voting day for Mayor, alderman, school board, etc. It's sunny but cold (40 right now).

Then it dawned on me, that it was Sun not Mon (do you think those scans are on my mind???). I put my nightgown back on, and am still in it! Yesterday we went for a daylong ride with 7 other mini coopers. We usually go once a month. It's great! We take back windy roads around our beautiful state. This one was around our largest lake Winnipesaukee. Beautiful clear sunny day, but a high of 32. Our's is a convertible, which, after we stopped for lunch, we put the top down (of course we had our windows up and the heat and heated seats on, and our winter coats and hats on). We know many of these people, since we have been doing these for over a year (we've had our mini for 5 years, wish we knew about the rides back then). 3 of our 4 kids also have minis, and our older daughter comes on these rides with us. This ride we brought our granddaughter too, since we were babysitting. We brought the grandsons once, we were babysitting them too. It was a great day. These rides make me feel alive again! Good luck everyone with scans this week! I'll be thinking of all of you as I'm getting mine! Lynne",

My younger daughter is the HR person at another grocery store, and she said they had all the registers open, with extra register people bagging. It was nuts there too. That same daughter said she would do all the cooking (minus the turkey, hubby is going to try deep frying it outside) and she was picking up all the food at her work. I told my older daughter (who is 30, and is currently living with us) that she can help her sister too. I'll make the boys clean up (my husband does that too, got to love him!) ,My husband wasn't up to cooking (he does most of the cooking, always has, I do occasionally), and suggest going out to eat (which we did the year my father died, the grandkids didn't like it then either, it wasn't the same they said). All four of our adult children said no. I will make a couple of pies. The hardest part is peeling the apples. I use the Pillsbury crusts. I used to hand make the crusts before those came out. What a job that was! Love the pic! Yesterday, I spent the afternoon with my 3 younger sisters. We were planning our mother's 80th birthday party, which is on Dec 2nd (her birthday is the 5th). It's at my youngest sister's house (which is 4 house away from mine, and our mother's is 3 away from her). We planned the food, where we were getting it from, and ordered it. Then we went out to lunch and went to the party store. We got plates and decorations. Her husband has a keg of beer in his bar, and she has lots of wine leftover from her last party. We just have to pick up the food and get water and soda and we'll be done. My husband and I are in charge of getting her there. The story we are giving her is that we are taking her to a nice restaurant (that way she'll dress up). Then we'll take the long way (around the block) to my sister's (we'll make up the excuse that we forgot something). There are about 50 people coming so far (mostly family!). Hopefully we can all fit! Very windy, but sunny, the past couple of days here. If the wind would stop, it would be perfect! Enjoy your day everyone! Lynne ",

My husband says that's why he needs to go on vacation, because that won't be a vacation! LOL I am seeing the oncologist and having my bloodwork done on Fri (the only day she is in the office, makes it hard to get an appointment scheduled). I am going to ask her to schedule the scans, in a month. That will at least give me an idea of when a good time to get away is. Well, I suppose I should take a shower (it's 11:30!). I should go out with my mother, I haven't in a couple of weeks, with the cold weather we've both been hibernating. It's sunny and in the 30s today (bring out the bikinis!).

I get long term disability from my work too. SS was easy, I did it over the phone, and I got my first check 4 weeks later. Long term had paperwork and was a pain, I did it with my primary dr, since she had to fill out paperwork too. That was 3 years ago when I stopped working. The long term people call me once a year and ask if I still needed disability, I said yes, since they hadn't found a cure for cancer yet. I get 60% of my pay, between the two. I had a lumpectomy at 43, when I was first diagnosed in 2005. The surgeon later noticed that that breast was a lot smaller than the other (it was the larger one before hand), and offered to even them off. I told him my husband nor I cared, and I could always put tissues on the smaller side, in my bra. I told him why would I want another surgery? I had a hysterectomy to remove everything, because of the ER and PR+ tumor, after my radiation. Enough with the surgeries. I always said, if it came back in my breast (which it did not), I would do a double mastectomy and just wear men's shirts. I'd get fake ones for the bathing suit and dresses too. Got to go! Have a great day everyone! Lynne",

It's worse at night, or when I stand or walk too long. I've just gotten used to being in pain I guess. We got about 5 inches here, then rain (that turned to ice, it's all sparkly here today) and another couple of inches on top of it. Hubby wants to go up to Loon this weekend, so he can ski, and I can just hang and read a book. He hasn't gone skiing yet this year, and bought new skis last fall. He usually skis with his brother, who is 4 years older than him (58), but his brother has been too busy. I wish I still skied, but I gave that up about 10 years ago. I stuck to the beginner trails anyhow (even though I started skiing at 16). I had 7 years in the middle where I was either preggo or had a baby at home, so I never got good at it. He started at 7, and goes on the expert trails. It will be nice to get away. Gracie-Big hugs! I know what you mean about feeling like a shut in. I too am home most of the time. I too am afraid of the grandkids giving me the flu or some sickness. I too wonder why I am fighting (I'm sure we all have our moments), but then I remember all of the people who would be missing me if I weren't here. I was hoping my scan showed new tumors or growth so I could get off this crappy chemo and move on to the next one. I'm sick of being out of commision for a week and a half (sometimes more). I get to feel good for a week and half (although I now have neuropathy in my fingers, toes, hands and feet all the time now). I'm going to keep chugging along, as long as I can tolerate it. If it gets to be too much with the se's, I'll just stop, even if it's the last treatment they have to offer. Quality over quantity! Maybe you can ask them to move on to the next treatment if you are feeling that bad. I'm so sorry! Micmel-Yes it is nice to hear all the news about the plans for the wedding! Such an exciting time for all of you! Something to take our minds off of our baloney! Bloodwork and the oncologist tomorrow.

They've been doing this for the past 5 years, instead of pub crawling on the main street. I'm sure it's mobbed since the day began, being on a Saturday. My husband is in VT skiing with his 2 older brothers again this weekend. He stayed home last night (even though I told him to head up instead of leaving first thing this morning. It's a 3 hour drive). I did run a fever on Tuesday and Wed evenings. It got to 100.6 at it's highest (I'm suppose to call at 100.5), I took a shower and tylenol, and the fever went down after a few hours. I was not in the mood to go to the ER again. I will tell the oncologist on Friday, what happened. My husband worried it might happen last night (it didn't), and he texted our daughter, to see what my temp was (it's been normal all day). He is becoming such a worry wart. The kids are here if anything happens. They are a 10 min ride away, while they are gone tonight. He wasn't happy that I'd be watching the kids alone.

I only take it on the bad days, even though they want me to take it everyday. So expensive! There are only 3 \"stores\" in NH. I don't know if it's cheaper in MA because it's available to everyone, not just medical. I should check it out. It's only a half hour away from me. Mae-I love your pics! You look great in that tutu! Good luck with the gamma knife on Thursday! Hugs! Divine-Love that pic of your bathroom. I love the picture above the table, beautiful! Keetmom-I'm so sorry. Hugs! MJH-I'm glad you got to get away to VT. We went on a Mini run (with 5 other Minis) yesterday, and 1/2 the ride was in VT. We ended up on dirt roads (it was a state route too!) for a half hour. All our cars looked like they went 4 wheeling! I was laughing the entire time. The dirt road was actually better than some of the paved roads we went on. Lots of frost heaves and pot holes! Good luck with your procedure! Hugs! Bighome-hope all is getting better. Magda-Hope you are enjoying the new home. Lynnwood-Sorry about your knee. Tanya-I know what you mean about the surgeon thinking putting in a port is nothing. Mine kept telling me it wasn't a surgery, it was a procedure. I said to him that he was cutting into me, so it;s a surgery. I'm glad you got put to sleep. Most horrible experience so far for me. I hope it's healed now. When will they be using it for your chemo. Mine was used 5 days after. Boy did that hurt putting the needle in and out. Once it totally healed though, it rarely hurts, I use the numbing cream before I go though. Good luck! The worst is over. Lynne-How are you loving this snow, sleet, rain mix, yesterday and today? I am so ready for Spring to come and stay!! I've got to get to my summer clothes, to see what fits. I've lost weight and my jeans are baggy (they still stay up though, thank God for elastic waists!). Hopefully, a few capris fit! Otherwise, I'll have to go shopping. Something I really hate to do! 5 days until FL! Hugs and prayers to all! Lynne",

I don't think you can bring canned sprays of any kind on the planes (I know you can not bring lighters, even in your checked luggage).

Too much stress all at one is not good for anyone! Keep on venting here, we don't mind one bit! Hugs! I am having my scans on the 14th. I get a little stressed, but after 6 years of having them every 3 months, it's doesn't bother me as much I guess. I finally got a decent night sleep last night (I've been on Dexamethasone since Monday, I'll take my last dose tomorrow). I actually feel like I can accomplish something around her today. Good thing, because nothing will get done next week (my post chemo week), with all the side effects I get from Taxotere. One year on it and I wish the side effects would get better, but nope! Have a wonderful day everyone! Lynne",

I can't imagine how it will be when I go. So I keep taking the treatments with the awful side effects for them. I hope you can find the strength too! Don't forget, you always have us! Micmel-The senior place looks lovely. It will be good to have your Mom closer by. You help out if you can, if you are not up to it, stay put. Someone else will be there.

I love watching the games as well. Enjoy going down to MA tomorrow. I hope it doesn't rain. That stinks about your tumor markers rising yet again! But no progression is the important thing!

The place I go to is only about a mile away, so I come home for the break in the middle. I'll get the results this afternoon or tomorrow. The receptionist, has all the paperwork ready for me before I even get there. I guess going every 3 months for the past 6 years has it's advantages. They all know my name, and I know their's. I'm kind of hoping for a little growth, just so I can get off of this chemo. A year of all these side effects stinks! I know I should want good results, and then stay on it as long as I can (then the longer I'll be around), but I've pretty much had it at this point! Every 3 weeks I get hardly any sleep for the 6 days I'm on steroids, and then the next week I have to stay home for fear of falling from the dizziness, and being near the bathroom for the other lovely side effect. Never mind the numb fingers and toes that started a few months ago. (Can you tell it's cloudy here today? That always brings me down! Plus it is Monday!). Oh I forgot to say I also got a bottle of wine, from my younger daughter! Yes they all know me so well! Flowers, chocolates, and wine! LOL Great picture, Divine! Nice of him to give you a surprise visit! Oh my gosh, Mae, you are so brave. I am afraid of heights (I used to close my eyes going up the chairlift skiing, and would tell me husband to let me know when we are at the top!), I could never do it. My husband has asked me to many times when we are on vacation. I'm too chicken. I also refused 2 helicopter rides (never been, never will). He's the daredevil not me! Love the Great Blue Heron! We have them here too. There is one on the lake my in-laws live on. They look like Pterodactyls when they fly. Enjoy the rest of your vacation! Glad you are having fun!

I've lived in the same neighborhood for almost my entire life (1st year married, we had an apartment 1 mile away). I've seen our city change so much over the years, some good some bad. There are memories everywhere for us. Good luck with your treatment this week. Lynne-Yes, I know that they have a new computer system, but the rudeness from Stephanie, is nothing new, and I usually seem to get her at check-out. I'm always walking on pins and needles when she's setting up my appointments. My niece's mother-in-law was the office manager there until recently, and she said that she is a problem. I guess we're stuck with her. I probably won't get an appointment now until the week before, and if they can't do it Thursday morning, then I'll tell them they can wait until the Monday after the Mini weekend. I'm done! I don't usually ask for certain days or times, and they give me a hard time. Good luck scheduling me the week before! I too believe people will leave and go somewhere else.

I have 4 adult children and they are great about everything. I just hate the pity looks I get from them and their father (we've been married almost 35 years, high school sweethearts). I also hate when my husband asks if I'm ok, when I've just gone to the bathroom! I too do not want to be treated any differently. I've been MBC for 6 years now, and about a year ago, I started on Taxotere, which made me lose my hair for the first time. Before, nobody knew by looking at me, that I had stage 4 cancer. When I'd tell people, they'd say I looked great (of course I didn't always feel great on the inside, but they couldn't SEE that!). Now, people look at me with my scarf or hat on (I have a wig, only worn it 4 times, hate it!), and they know. They quickly look the other way mostly, although some are rude and just stare. I've gotten used to it. I hate having to put on make-up every time I go somewhere though, since I lost my eyebrows (there wasn't much there to begin with) and eyelashes (I don't do anything with them). I never was a make-up person, just cover up (for spots) and on a special occasion, mascara. I've gotten used to it but still hate it. Next treatment for me (when this one stops working) doesn't make you lose your hair. I'm hoping it will return. Unfortunately, our nephew is getting married in August. I guess I'll wear that awful wig (and bring a scarf when I get too ho!). Yes, take those classes, get out, live life to the fullest! We are LIVING with cancer NOT dying from it!! Well I guess I was tired. I initially woke at 7 this morning. I watched tv for an hour, and felt sleepy, so I shut it off and went back to sleep. I slept until 12pm! I went to bed at 9:30! I hope that this is not a sign of what's to come. I don't want to spend the rest of my life sleeping most of the day! I've never slept past 9 in my life! I suppose that I should shower (it's after 3 pm) before my husband gets home! LOL I don't think he cares, but I do! Keep cool in this heat everyone! Hugs! Lynne ",

Micmel-I'm sorry you have to be stuck with them for 30 days. Hopefully, the attorney will tell you that you can get them out sooner. I would also cancel the reception and take a vacation (if you can get your deposit back). Our older daughter was engaged to be married a few years ago. He thought he'd be moving into our house once they got married (they both lived at home). I put my foot down and said that they'd have to get their own place (his family didn't volunteer her to move in with them). He said he wanted to postpone the wedding (4 months before the wedding). She asked until when. He didn't have an answer, so she said she was done. We were going to lose our $1000 deposit, so I had a big ($3000) 50th birthday party for my husband (his birthday was the week before the wedding, so I changed the date and had the party). The cake people were not going to give us back the $200 deposit, so he had a fancy birthday cake. The flower people were kind and gave her back her deposit. The dresses were all ordered and bought. She has a wedding dress that she'll never wear, in my closet. Her sister (matron of honor) bought her dress in yellow, and she bought one of her bridesmaid's dresses in mint green (and paid back the bridesmaid's deposits), and they wore them to their cousin's wedding 2 months later. Of course the groom and groomsmen were just renting tuxes, so they were out no money. I had bought my dress too, luckily, it wasn't that expensive and I've worn it a couple of times. I would not let him use your car, or anything else of your's, at all. He sounds controlling and has anger issues. I hope that they get out of your house soon! HUGS! Lynne-Your flowers are beautiful! I wish I could keep up my garden, but it's too much. Whatever comes up comes up. I do have a lot of buds on my rose bushes. I'll send a picture when they bloom. The irises are they only thing blooming in the grass filled garden right now. I have that last plant (salvia?) you posted, no blooms yet. Beautiful day here. Today, I'm going to sit outside for awhile. I need to get out of this house! Lynne",

Yesterday was even worse, but I'm staying inside (I did clean and fill the bird feeders yesterday though). Tanya-Hoping you had a good weekend camping! Our Minis On Top weekend was wonderful. We put 500 miles on the car. We did a run from home to Conway on Friday, and another run from Loon Mountain to Conway on Saturday. We decided not to go up Mt Washington this year. We went up with our daughter's automatic Mini last year. Our's is a standard with almost 90K on it (we've only put 20K on it in 6 years, it's 8 years old). I went up it in the early 80's, when I was in college, with my husband's Datsun hatchback, which was a standard. We had to keep stopping all the way down the mountain, to cool off the brakes. There are no guardrails at all (a couple spots have boulders on the sides), and we were both exhausted from all the fresh air (we had the top down all weekend, yes we got a little sunburned). The weather was beautiful! We stopped in Laconia (bike week) on the way home on Sunday, to return those scarves I hat bought the week before, that were too small. She gave us our money back (no bigger ones, they were nice too!), and we bought a few more shirts for ourselves and the kids. Being the last day, there were lots of bargains. We then drove to Northwood to see his father. They weren't there. My husband decides to power wash the carpet on his father's boat for an hour (he got half of it done, like night and day). Then his parents show up, so now we have to visit. We left at 3, and 5 minutes after getting home, our first child arrives with his daughter. Then the girls and their families came. No break for us. At least our eldest cooked. Our younger daughter helped me make the sides and bring stuff outside. The grandkids were in the pool for hours (even though it's only 70). The night ended with a fire and somores. I was so exhausted by the time they left (around 8). Here are some pics from Minis on Top. Us looking at the other Minis at the Loon Mt parking lot. This on Saturday's run. Our car is the red convertible in the front. This was in Stark NH. We have many covered bridges in the mountains. There were 8 cars zooming around those windy roads. This pic was taken by one of the other Mini people on top of Mt Washington. Sun setting. End of the day! Hugs and prayers for all of you!! Love Lynne  ",

Lots of short term forgetfulness (worse than normal) No blurred vision or headaches. I see the oncologist on Fri, and am going to ask her for a brain MRI. The neuropathy is getting worse in my hands(the feet are about the same). They hurt so much at the end of the day. They did tumor markers the last time I was there because they jumped up quite a bit the last two times. Well the did the wrong tumor marker test. They were told to retest it and they never did. They wanted me to come in last week (my one week off and my hell week). I told them no, they can wait until next Fri (this Fri), I'm not getting poked a third time in a week just for that. I'm getting sick and tired of that place. They made me appointments ahead of time for my next two visits, and didn't bother to call me to see if it was a good time and date ( they were ok, but still). Hugs and prayers to all! Lynne   ",

I am due for chemo, and if the MRI shows anything, she wants me to stop the chemo, and send me to radialogy since apparently, chemo does not work well on brain mets. Wish me luck! I'm just going to close my eyes, and sing songs in my head like I always do. The music they put on always stinks, no matter what I pick! Lynne-Hope they figured out the next step for you. Thinking of you today! Big hugs! Gracie-Thinking of you today as well. Good luck! micmel-Thank you for your comments. I just take everything one day at a time. My husband does 99% of the work for our family BBQs. We only had child number 3, her husband, and the 2 boys (and their border collie), and child number 2 and her boyfriend. Number 1 didn't show up and number 4 is in NY (the 2 boys). We had it later so the temp was down since the sun was going down. I think it got down to the 80s and there was a little breeze. Kids went in the pool. I'm not sure of the temp, but a few days ago it was only 72. They said it was warmer. It's still greenish, so I won't go in! I'll stay inside with the a/c! The daughter and boyfriend are doing laundry over here, and number one should be coming by with his daughter. Free meals for them tonight I guess. I think my husband took boneless chicken breasts out. We can do those on the grill too! Too hot to use the oven! Have a good night! I think of all of you often! Hugs! Lynne",

Mom drove, glad to get out of the house. First time all week. Our older grandson went to cub scout camp this week. He loved it. My father-in-law donated to granite benches to the camp (it's actually in the city we live in), about 10 years ago. He was very involved in scouting, and went to camp there in 1944 (my husband and sons also went there). Received many awards. Here are a couple of pics of the benches (one is in the name of my husband's grandfather, the other for the entire family. Matthew, the camper. He had a ball at his first camp experience. Matthew and his brother Aiden (I know, they don't look alike at all) on the other bench. Have a great weekend everyone! Lynne",

We are suppose to get some wild weather here, this afternoon. Major thunderstorms (strong winds and a chance of hail) and a chance of a tornado (I hope that doesn't happen, they are rare here). I think I will stay inside today. DH has a couple of jobs in the mountains and is staying over at the Mount Washington Hotel (where one job is) tonight. He asked me if I wanted to go. He forgot about my 8am appointment tomorrow. I would have gone otherwise. It's a couple of hours from here, but this way, he can check on the progress today, and can go to the meeting in the morning. He stays for free, as do his workers. It's one of those grand hotels that people would come up for the summer at, in the early 1900s. I've only been to have drinks and appetizers on the porch. One day I'll stay there. I got to see my grandson briefly, yesterday. Matthew told me about all his did at cub scout camp. He loved it and wants to go again next year. Aiden said it was his turn to talk after awhile. But it was time to leave. Their father (who is still out of work, from his appendix surgery) was just picking up a ramp for his 4 wheeler. He's going back to work tomorrow. On light duty for 4 more works (he had to stay out for 2). Unfortunately, their union does not pay for any days off. Luckily, our daughter works full time and he's watching the kids, so they don't have to pay the babysitter. Our granddaughter is at girl scout camp this week. It's only during the day, but she didn't come by yesterday (she's usually visiting us on Mondays and Wednesdays). We'll probably see her tomorrow (our son's overnight with her). Kids are so busy nowadays. Our summers were spent with friends. Swimming or riding our bikes everywhere. Camping with our pop-up. Carefree. I did go to girl scout camp once, in VT, for 2 weeks. Our granddaughter will be going to that same camp in two weeks (her first overnight camp). Both our daughters went there, and to another one in western NH (now closed). I suppose I should put some chlorine in the pool before the storm hits here (it's already hitting 1/2 hour north of here). Have a good day everyone! Lynne",

Hope all goes well, and you get the help you need! Big Hugs! Lynne-I agree, cancer is not the worst I have been through. There are many things I have been through that were worse. Very well said, as always! Lynnwood-I have been on Gabapentin for 12 years. I had a complete hysterectomy (ovaries, and everything else) iin Dec 2005 (I was first diagnosed Stage 1 IDC, Er and Pr+ at 43). Of course I went into instant menopause (I was still very regular). I was having 50 hot flashes a day. I was starting to wean myself off it, after 7 years of hot flashes, when I the cancer came back. I told the oncologist I was no longer having the hot flashes, so I was weaning myself off of it. She told me to stay on it, because it was probably helping with the pain. I take 3 in the morning and 3 at night. I too lost my father (4 months before I was first diagnosed on a routing mammogram). Mom found him in a chair in the kitchen gone (she was asleep on the couch in the next room). Very hard with him not being sick (although he didn't feel well that day, and said he'd go to the dr's the next day if he still was feeling lousy, after Mom pestered him to go that day). 13 years later, we still miss him everyday. My Mom is 80, and has COPD, I live in the same neighborhood as I grew up in, as does my youngest sister (she can see both our houses from her house). I talk to Mom just about everyday, and see her at least twice a week. She tells me that I can't go before her. I said it's not in my hands. That would be another hard loss when she goes. I get in tears when I think about missing my 3 children (who are not married, number 3 child is) weddings (when I was first diagnosed, I just wanted to make it to my 3 younger kids high school graduations, and I did, they are now 32, almost 31, 28, and 23), and future grandchildren, my 3 grandchildren growing up, my husband living without me. I try not to dwell on it, but it pops up at least once a day. Cancer stinks! Muddling-Congrats on the scan results! runor-I hope you enjoyed all the chocolate and coffee! Ok, for all you inquiring, my bone scan showed uptake in my ribs (just like the last scan) and again they said it was probably the chemo working and the ribs filling in, no new spots, the abdominal ct showed everything remaining the same (even my reproductive organs, which were taken out in 2005!) in size and no new ones, the chest ct showed 2 new nodules in the mm size, and an old nodule increasing in size, which they said may be the treatment no longer working. I see my oncologist tomorrow. I'm thinking she'll want to change my chemo. I had told her that if I need to change my treatment, I was going to get another second opinion for the breast cancer oncologist at Dana Farber, in Boston. Every time I've needed to change treatments, I got her input on it. Only once did the two of them have different opinions on what drug to do next. I haven't seen her in about 2 years, so it's time to see what else is out there. Our youngest keeps asking me when are we going to visit him in NY. I was waiting for the results of this, we may go the beginning of August, depending on appointments, and when I start the new chemo. We have a busy August coming up. Our nephew is getting married the 18th in VT (we are staying over Fri and Sat), and we are going on our summer vacation (that we usually do in July), the 25th (hubby's 55th birthday) through Labor Day. I hope nothing gets messed up because of this!! I'll let you guys know what she says tomorrow! Thanks for thinking of me!! Another thing going on. I think that my empty nest is already over after a month. Yup, my almost 31 year old daughter and her boyfriend, had a fight 2 nights ago. She packed up everything, but it is still in his apt. She slept here last night (Daddy is a softy, grrrrr!). She's not sure what she is going to do. I knew this was going to happen. Well at least I've got to have some quiet for a month. I have a feeling she'll be coming back home. Tonight is my husband's golf league night. While he's gone, I am going out to dinner with a friend. She always makes me laugh! She's been through quite a lot in her lifetime. If she is picking me up, I will have a big fruity alcoholic drink. Now where is that chocolate (not a fan of coffee, unless it's ice cream or Kahlua)!! Enjoy your Thursday everyone! Lynne ",

We then headed to VT for our nephew's wedding. I started sweating profusely (which is so unlike me). Yes, it was humid out, but the windows were up and the a/c was on. I took a cool shower at the hotel, and changed into my \"moisture wicking\" night gown. I was drenched again, all night. I didn't have that problem again. I looked up to see if this is a side effect of one of the 3 drugs, but did not see it. I've had diarrhea, starting 3 days after my treatment. I'm not sure if it's from the treatment, or something I picked up. Good thing I still had my prescription for it, from the last chemo (Taxotere). I hope it's not going to be like that again. I too am rinsing with bacon soda. I had the mouth sores for a few months, on Taxotore, and definitely do not want them again! I do not get the nuelasta shot. I was suppose to on Taxotere, but they never scheduled it at the beginning. At the 3rd treatment, all of the sudden, they call me and tell me I needed to schedule it. I said I've never been on it. I did end up in the hospital for 2 days, on iv antibiotics, a week after the first treatment (nuetropenic). She dropped the dose and hadn't realized she never put me on Nuelasta. Hopefully, I can stay out of the ER and hospital this time (I went to the ER 3 times, and was admitted once, on the year I was on Taxotere). I hope I get some hair back. I currently only have fuzz on the sides and back of my head, the top middle is down to the skin. It's like a reverse mohawk. It's been a year wearing scarves, hats, and the awful wig (I've worn it 6 times, for funerals and a wedding). I would really like my eyebrows and eyelashes back. I'm sick of drawing the eyebrows in, and even though my lashes were not long or thick, it's better than none! Lynne",

My oncotype score came back low (sorry, I can't remember the score number), only an 8% chance of recurrence in 10 years. I skipped the chemo, and had 6 weeks of radiation. I decided to have my ovaries (and everything else removed) because my tumor was ER and PR+ (Her 2-) IDC. I was 43, and still having regular periods. I went into instant menopause. 60 hot flashes a day. They put me on Effexor for the hot flashes. I took it for a year, and then changed to Gabapentin because I felt like a zombie on it. I was then put on the aromotase inhibitors (to stop the estrogen made in the adrenal glands). I went through all of them and tamoxifen too. I lasted 3 1/2 out of the 5 years they wanted me on them. The side effects were bad. Joint and feet pain was the worst. In 2012, my back was bothering me. I went to my primary dr, and she first put me on predisone, which didn't help. She sent me for an x-ray, then an MRI. I had a compression fracture in my thoracic region of my spine. I also had tumors in 3 other vertebrae as well. I also had a large tumor in my right lung, and my lymph nodes were involved as well. It came back, not in my breast (like I thought it would), but in my spine and lung (now also my liver, and lots of other bones. Now I'm Stage 4 metastatic breast cancer. I think back, what if I had a mastectomy instead of a lumpectomy. What if I had chemo in the beginning. Who knows? They said it got into my blood stream somehow, and settled in my spine. They think it had been there for a year. I noticed the back pain for awhile, but I always have back pain, though it's the lower back (this was in my upper) and I sat all day for work. I was short of breath and just thought it was my asthma. I had to have a thoracentisis to remove the extra fluid in my right lung. They got a liter. I've had 4 kyphoplasties, to repair compression fractures. I still have one high up my spine, that they can not do a kyphoplasty on. It bothers me every now and then. I don't know what to tell you. Radiation wasn't so bad. Just a pain going every day for 6 weeks M-F. I burned and peeled and had zinging pains off and on. This is my 4th chemo (7th treatment) in 6 years. I stay on each treatment until it stops working (I have new tumors, or the existing ones grow, or the lymph nodes grow). I will be on treatment the rest of my life (I've lived much longer than I thought I would). I still drive and do most of the things that I want to. Good luck in your decision! Hugs! Lynne",

Whenever I change treatments, I always go down to Dana Farber in Boston for a second opinion. I had trouble when I was on Ibrance. They would wait until the day before I was to start it again, before they shipped it to me. Many times, it would be a day or two late. My insurance would not let me get that through the local pharmacy (way too expensive). I was only on it 6 months. HLB-I too had no anesthesia for my sentinal node biospy, when I was first diagnosed, in 2005. They gave me 4 shots in the nipple (which hurt a lot). Then had me rub my tumor area. Then had put me on a table and took pics. It was 2 men, and I am very modest (yes, even after 4 children!). My husband was with me. I was a wreck, because this was done right before my lumpectomy (only my second surgery ever back then). I started crying quietly on the table. On of the men said they were almost through. The port was far worse than that though. YES! Jab a needle in them, see how they like it! After having my first CTs/bone scans on Monday, for this chemo, most of it was normal, except a lymph node near my left hip is bigger (only mm). So after seeing my oncologist yesterday, she is sending me for a PET scan on Wed. If it comes back as ok. I will have my chemo after seeing her on Fri. If not, back to the drawing board. I hope it comes back ok, this treatment, CMF, is so much milder on me. I was on Taxotere for over a year, and that one was just awful. So many bad side effects. This one hardly any at all.And it doesn't make you lose your hair as the last one did! My hair is finally coming back on top, I never lost the sides and back (about an inch long, and fuzz up top, still bald spots up top). Keep your fingers crossed for me! Have a great rest of the weekend everyone! Lynne ",

Again, got real shaky and legs buckled, I did not pass out. I refused to got to the ER (the dr's office was closed by then) and stopped taking my metformin and blood pressure pills (since my blood pressure was so low anyhow. I called my dr's office this morning, and am now waiting for the nurse to call me back. I haven't fallen since, and have been a lot less shaky, still a little weak, but not eating much last week because of thrush and mouth sores, didn't help. I just started eating somewhat regular this weekend. I went to a bbq Sat for a couple hours, and yesterday did the Making Strides walk. My husband pushed me in my wheelchair for most of it. I did get out and walk a little bit though. My foot hurt so that kept me down too. It was a beautiful weekend up here in the 70s with lots of sunshine. I even got a little burn on my face. I see my oncologist Fri to check my white cell counts (that's when they'll be at their lowest), and I fly out Sat morning for a week in Jamaica. It's our 34th anniversary on Sunday, and I am going no matter what. There are hospitals there too. Hopefully, they'll get this straightened out before I leave. Ok, they just called me back, now the nurse will give the info I gave to her again (after I gave the same info to the receptionist), to my doctor. I'm sure another hour will go by! Wish me luck!",

I'm only 10 min from the place, so I come home so I can deal with all the running to the bathroom, here rather than there. Those drinks do it to me every time. Thankfully, I get a break before I have to do the 1/2 hr bone scan, or I'd have to make them keep stopping it, so I could dash to the bathroom every 5 minutes. I too think that feeling from the contrast is strange the throat and wetting your pants feeling. It only lasts a minute though. It was also cold here (30s) and rainy then our first snow this season (about 1/4 inch) this afternoon. I felt cold all day! I guess it was a good day to have the scans done. Not like it was a good day to start raking. Our oaks still haven't let go of their leaves yet anyhow (although our neighbor's have in our yard!). Hope you get good results from your scans! NO1-I'm so sorry that you are going through this. I know my husband hated when I talked about it when it first came back Stage 4 five years ago. I just tried not to talk about it with him. My sisters, mother, and kids also don't like it. I have one friend who won't bring it up, but if I talk, she'll listen. I found talking to fellow people on this site has been the place where I don't have to worry what I say without upsetting people, so that's what I do. I have since been able to get my husband to finally tell me where he wants me to go after I'm cremated (he wants me in the cemetery not just kept at home. We bought the plot next to my parents'.), so I could get my funeral plans in order, so our adult kids, and him don't have to worry about that in the end. He has been to most of my appointments and supports me in so many ways. I tell them all they are in denial, but they keep hoping for a cure. I guess that's how they are dealing with my diagnosis. As I said before, I just come to this site and talk freely here. Thank God for this site. Hugs! Hope everyone gets good results from their scans! Lynne",

I get awful stomach cramps and diarrhea, thrush in the mouth (so I have trouble eating, the dizzy spells when I go to stand up, and just feeling lousy. I know by the end of the week, it will have passed, but I really am sick of feeling like this every three weeks. As a bonus this time, I am also having pain on my sides (my ribs) and right scapula (all have cancer in them). I sleep on my sides, which makes this impossible, and even sleeping on my back is awful. I've been sleeping on a heating pad, which helps a little. I mentioned this before my chemo last week (it started the week before) and the PA suggested a fentanyl patch. I told her that I wanted to not be spaced out and be able to drive and function, and that I'll save that drug for much later on! It's bad enough the opoid drugs space me out (so I rarely take them) and the medical marjuana they gave me does too (even though I told them I did NOT want the high), I'm not starting on another that just makes you loopy and does nothing for the pain!!

It didn't work last night, it does on the days I don't take the Decadron. I don't nap either, because I take it with breakfast and lunch, I'm wired for the day (and obviously the night).

It always starts the day after my last after steroids, which was yesterday. The new fridge is a beauty, just hate that they are so expensive. It's dark stainless (our other appliances are black, so it matches, we'll change them up as they die). It has the double doors on the top and on the bottom (where the freezer is), and their are shelves for the freezer. You can even make the right side of the freezer a refrigerator, which we probably do for Christmas, since we are hosting both Christmas eve and Christmas day this year.

I asked him what was in Jacksonville (never been)? I said I'd talk to him when he got home from work. My mother said just go. Of course having dr's appointments week 2 and 3 after chemo, and felling lousy week 1, it's hard to plan a trip without having to reschedule appointments. The long weekend in Feb he picked, I have my blood work/oncology appointment on Fri, and am probably having my scans done that week before my appointment. I asked him why he can't wait for our trip in April. He didn't give me an answer. It is nice of him to keep planning vacations, but it just messes up a lot. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate it, and he's wonderful, but everyday looking up vacations (when we already have one planned in a few months) is making me a little stressed. (runor, I don't mind the rotten tomatoes). Last night I was talking to my friend on the phone. She chopped all the ice off her walkway on Saturday and hurt her back. Of course everything melted with the 50 degree and rain the next day. She had to have someone come over and adjust her. She could at least walk a little. The way she described it, it sounded like sciatica. Of course when I went up to bed my left sciatica was so bad, I yelped getting in the bed. I blame her (LOL). It's been bothering me a little for a couple of weeks (and I didn't shovel!). I ended up taking a muscle relaxer and an oxycodone, and slept on the heating pad. I got up this morning and still in pain (great trying to sit on the toilet), and took another muscle relaxer and tylenol (I hate taking the oxycodone during the day) and am sitting on another heating pad. I hope it goes away soon. I really don't want to get a steroid shot. I guess I've been sitting too much! We are suppose to get 3-7 inches (maybe even more, per the weatherman) Tues night into Wed. We lost tons of snow with the rain we had this weekend, so I suppose we need to make up for it. Of course the southern part of the state is getting the most again, instead of the mountains up north. I always say it can snow boatloads up north for the skiers, snowboarders, and snowmobiles, and skip the south. We're back in the teens today, but it's suppose to warm up after the storm, into the 30s. I keep reminding myself that it is only January, and our winters last until March (and sometimes April, and May we get snow). I hope everyone has a great week! Hugs! Lynne ",

Yes, he does have a great sense of humor! I had a friend tell him I liked him in Sept 1979, and he asked me out. We've been together ever since (even when I went away to college for a couple of years). So Sat night I had a \"hot\" day with my husband. We spent from 5pm until 1am at the ER. I started having chills around 2pm, I took my temp and it was 96.8. I took it again an hour later it was still low. The chills stopped but I felt warm. I was 100. I took again at 4 it was 101. I jumped into a cool shower and took 2 tylenol. It was 99, but climbed to 101, 102, then 103 in an hour. I called the oncology office and the dr on call called me back. He said I should go to the ER, I said fine but I did not want to stay over like the last time (which was after my first treatment with this chemo), he said hopefully not but couldn't promise anything. Now it's only been a week since my chemo. I just finished \"hell\" week, and I was looking forward to school vacation week with my grandsons. We go to the ER and it's pretty quiet in the waiting room. They take blood, urine, do a chest x-ray, and all are fine except for my white cells being low but still 650 and they consider really low under 500. The do the flu test, which is negative. The said my heart rate was high, and I tell them that I'm always over a hundred, the dr says well 130 is high. I get an EKG, which is normal, and they hook me up to a monitor. I get a liter of iv fluid also. They have me in a freezing isolation room. My husband had his hood from his sweatshirt on, and I have 2 blankets (because I no longer had a temp). The dr called the oncolgist and he confirmed that I'm always over 100 for my heart rate (like I'd lie about that?). They decide I could go home after having two antibiotic infusions. That took two hours. Then they sent us to the 24 hour pharmacy for 2 antibiotics to take for the next 10 days. They never figured out what kind of infection I had (I think it's a sinus infection, he never looked in my nose). The next day I still felt icky but no fever still (they said if it came back, it wasn't an option to go home). Everything I ate on Sunday had an awful taste to it, so I didn't eat much (my husband was not too happy). Yesterday, everything tasted fine. I still have my annoying cough, especially when I lie down (that's why I think it's a sinus thing), but still no fever and none today! I see the oncologist and have blood work on Fri (previously scheduled to check my white cell counts when they are at their lowest) and have chemo next Fri. It's funny she lowered my dose of Taxotere last time, and this happens? Crazy. Today, I am going to our timeshare with my younger daughter and my two grandsons. They have a big pool, a kiddie pool (both with waterslides) and a big hot tub. They'll have a ball. I'm going to stay out of the water and watch. Between having no hair and all the stuff I could catch in the pool, I don't think it's a good idea. Hopefully, it won't be crowded in there, but it is school vacation week here. It will be nice to get out in the sunshine and warm (50's!) day. Have a great day everyone! Hugs! Lynne",

We weren't going on a Mini run (usually not before April), we are meeting for dinner on St Patrick's Day at the Bedford Village Inn (hopefully, I'm feeling up to it). We try to get together once a month in the winter. Many people store their minis for the winter (our's is in our driveway while the Harley Trike is in the garage), so we go out to eat until the weather is good. Minnie-What a soothing picture. So peaceful! Dizziness, is still there today. Not as bad as yesterday. Each day gets better. It stinks that my \"hell weeK\" is the same week our youngest's girlfriend is here on spring break, from Rochester NY. I told them, I'll just be hanging at home, and to go out and have fun. He keeps trying to include me though, maybe at the end of the week. He really is the most caring person. Hope everyone is having a good day! Hugs! Lynne  ",

I hope you had a wonderful vacation! I've been feeling ok. Of course Fri I have chemo, and it will be downhill from there again! I am taking a break for the month of April. I was going to be having chemo the day before I leave for FL, and I pushed it back 2 weeks, which will bring me to the first week in May. I also have my scans due the second week in May. I'm so look forward to this break from Taxotere! MJH-Xeloda was pretty easy on my with the side effects. I did get the hand and foot syndrome, but the Urea cream helped a lot. I hope the snow is melting up there as well as it is here. Every day there is less and less, still a lot on the ground. Spent the weekend at my in-law's (the go to FL for the winter). No tv and internet (and KIDS!). It really is a getaway. Just quiet. Had a fire in the fireplace the entire time we were there. Love watching it! We played games too. On Sat night, we met our younger daughter (she lives a 1/2 hour from our home and a half hour from the in-law's). We took her and her husband out for her birthday (she turner 28 on the 22nd). Just a nice weekend away. I hope all of you have a good week! Hugs! Lynne  ",

Minnie-Glad your hip is feeling a little better. I hope it gets even more better! Tanya-They made me get a port when I was put on Doxil, because apparently, if it gets on your skin at all, your skin comes off. It was done outpatient, but I was not put out. They gave me morphine (which just spaces me out, does nothing for pain). I was awake for the entire procedure. I could feel all the numbing shots (about 10) of the areas, and when they made the incision, I could feel the blood running down my neck towards my back. They also asked me in the beginning if I was claustrophobic, I said no. Well I know why now. The put a sheet over your face. It is only inches from it. That drove me a little crazy too, and the nurse kept asking me how I was doing, and I'm the type of person that looks at people when I talk, so I had to look toward the back where the sheet was open. They wheel me into the curtained room afterwards, and I'm noticing a wetness on my pillow. A large spot of blood, and it's all over the back of my head in my hair. I got it cleaned up the best I could (the nurse changed the pillow) and was told I couldn't shower for a couple of days. As soon as I got home, I had my daughter wash that hair (the facecloth at the hospital, just didn't do it). If you do get a port, make sure the put you out, one way or another. It was worse than any previous surgeries I have had. I was awake for one (they gave me something through the iv), but did not feel what I felt through the port surgery! Oh and they don't consider it a surgery, it's interventional procedure (just like my kyphoplasties were, done by a radiologist, I was put out for those). It told them they were cutting me open, so it's a surgery! It is easier having my infusions through the port at the oncology office. I did have them try to use it at the hospital one time I had a fever, and he tried twice to get the needle in. I had numbed it up with the numbing cream, and I told him no more, just put it in my arm. I rarely feel it being put in for my infusions, and the needle he was using was not the same as what they use at the oncology office. I do use my arm for the blood work I have the week before my chemo, that vein is still going strong! Mae-I hope you got good news today from your MRI! I got roped into having Easter, for my side of the family yesterday. I was going to have our immediate family and my mother (that 11), and then yesterday I went to lunch with Mom and one of my 3 sisters. She asked me what I was doing for Easter. I told her I had invited my kids and grandkids over. She says that she was talking to our youngest sister (I'm the eldest) and they didn't know what they were doing. Well, I felt like I was being pushed into a corner, and said she and her son, could come if they wanted too. He's gone to the Boston Comicon for the weekend, so not sure if he's coming. Now I feel obligated to ask my other 2 sisters and their families. I called them both last night. The youngest can see both my house and our Mom's from her house (we bought houses in our old neighborhood), and I call her first. She said sure. So her husband, 3 kids (maybe one boyfriend), and she asked if her husband's sister could come too, since she split from her husband and has been staying with them for a month now. I said what's one more. I then talk to my other sister, and she said she's working (she's an RN) but she'll let her 2 kids know (and daughter-in-law and their baby). I said don't the usually go to her Mom's for a brunch. She said yes, usually, but I'll let them know if they want to see their cousins. She does this all the time. She works or is on call for the holidays and sends her kids. My mother offered to have it at her house. She moved her bedroom to the first floor, so there went one room for seating, and she's 80 years old. I told her no! The last time she had something there, we didn't go. My sisters do not help out at all, and my husband and I stay until last and he does most of the clean up, my mother told me she really missed him that Thanksgiving. We had Christmas at our house this year, now Easter too?! Our family Easter went from 10 (yes, I have the largest family), to 26, if everyone shows! UGH! I am not doing either holiday next year! It's always my house or the youngest's house. The other 2 have apartments (although, one sister's son has a house!). I get it, but we shouldn't have to do both in a year!! UGH! Thanks for letting me vent! I guess I'm too much of softy (my husband is even worse!). Oh, and this is happening 2 days after my chemo treatment on top of that. At least I'll still be on the steroids, so no running to the bathroom until Monday, but my mouth starts to get Thrush usually on Sunday. Lovely! Hugs and prayers that everyone is having a good day!

I felt the same as you when I was first diagnosed stage 1, 13 years ago. I just wanted to see my younger 2 kids graduate (our youngest was 9) high school. Holidays (which I loved) just seemed like work to me. I did it for the kids. I just did not enjoy life anymore. I was waiting for the cancer to return. Which it did, 7 years later, in 2012. Right after I turned 50. My youngest's senior year in high school. I asked my oncologist what the average life span was for Stage 4. She told me a year and a half. I too started cleaning out my closets and drawers, and stopped buying clothes. Holidays still were no fun for me, but I tried a little harder to enjoy them, since I figured, they may be my last. It's now been 6 years Stage 4, and yes, the holidays are better. I now have 3 grandchildren who help make them great too! I take one day at a time. Some are good, some bad, but everyone is a gift. I hope to be around a long time, to meet any future grandkids, and see my 3 single kids (one is married) get married some day. Just remember, we are living with cancer, not dying from! Divine and Bighome-I love my mil! She's a sweetheart. 85 years old. It's my fil who is the pain (almost 86)! My husband is the youngest of 4 (he has 2 brothers and a sister), and he expects him to do everything for him, even though we live the furthest from him. He has to be the center of attention all the time! He's always complaining about all his health problems. I tell him that he's still here, and has almost 20 years more than my father had, or I tell him at least he doesn't have cancer! He drives me crazy! I used to bite my tongue, but I haven't since I became stage 4. He tells me that I'm mean to him. I tell him that I'm just telling it the way it is. He runs my mil ragged. She does everything for him. I pray that he passes away first, so she finally gets some time for herself! Micmel-I'm pming you! This is certainly not like you at all! It snowed here today. Just a dusting. I hope this is it. So done with winter. Hugs to all! Lynne ",

My tumor markers haven't be in the double digits since I was on Xeloda. I went up to the 300s on Doxil, and am currently 134.4. It went down this time from 148, but of course that number had gone up from the previous time. It seems to go up and down around 10 points each time.My oncologist told me to stop worrying about the tumor marker unless it goes up 50 points. She said as long as your scans (I have 2 CT scans and a bone scan every 3 months) are ok to not worry about it. She did have me do a PET scan once after the CT scans, because there showed some new tumors in my lung. The PET did not show it as being cancerous, so I am still on Taxotere. Hugs and prayers you get good results! Micmel-Love the cleavage story! I'm glad you enjoyed the moment! Bighome-I'm so sorry you are going through so much with you husband.

Only about an inch was what I heard. I still have a little patch in the front yard, from the crazy weather on Monday! I felt bad for the people running the Boston marathon. That's so cool your Dad did it 5 times! I'm going to be so ready to fly out of here. Even with it suppose to be raining about every day while we are there. At least it will be warm!

So glad you feel at home, finally! It looks like a beautiful home! Tanya-I too am allergic to adhesives, and make them use paper tape. I believe I only had to keep my gauze on for 3 days. They had put a coating over the incisions too though, that slowly wash/peeled off. It hurt for a few weeks too. Now it's ok. Well, my eldest and his daughter just arrived. Off to make dinner.

She told me 2 years for those with only bone mets, and 1 1/2 for those that also had organ involvement (I have both lung and liver, as well as lots of bone mets). She then said right afterward, that she had 2 women that were both 10 years out, and one was still working. Only God knows. I'm 6 years out right now, and have plenty of other treatments to try (so my oncologist tells me). I'm sorry to hear about the steroids. I hate them. I have to take them 3 days before chemo, during it, and 2 days after for side effects. I was taking 2 pills twice a day, she lowered to 1 pill twice a day, and luckily, I still don't have the awful side effect I had with the first dose, a year ago. I don't sleep with the steroids, and make my family miserable! I hide in my room a lot, during that week. And yes, as Lynne said, I'm very much alive! Hugs to you! Lynne-I leave at 9 am tomorrow, for Boston. My mother got sick this week (this happened in July too!). She has COPD and uses oxygen at night. This week she's been using 24 hrs a day, as well as using the nebulizer 4 times a day. She's been wheezy since Sunday. She saw her primary Mon and yesterday, I went with her to the pulmonary dr. Mom decided that she's not going. She didn't want to end up in the hospital in FL. My husband called Delta about her plane ticket. They said she could take the credit and would have to use it by September (we bought the tickets last Sept), or we could change the name on the ticket, and let someone else use it. I called my youngest sister (there are 4 of us, I'm number 1) to see if she wanted to go. She said she was broke, and couldn't come. I then call sister number 3. She said she was taking of Mon and Tues the following week for her birthday (on next Sat). I told her she could do it next week instead. She asked her boss and now she's coming with us! So glad we didn't lose the $550 we paid for the ticket. Mom has decided she's not traveling anymore. Only if we drive and we're not too far from home. We've already booked a week at Newfound Lake for August, and she's suppose to come. Hopefully this doesn't happen again. It happend in July too when we went to Winnipesaukee. My husband says we are not telling her we are going on vacation until the day before so she doesn't get sick the week before we leave. We'll see. My younger daughter, her husband, and the two boys are staying over at my house because we are leaving around 9. I guess they'll have to blow up the air mattress and sleep on the 2 couches. Someone can sleep on the trundle bed in our older daughter's room. Our eldest son is going to meet us here. We have flight line for the kids and grand kids. My husband, sister, and I will go in the limo. Thankfully, it's a direct flight (the only way I'll fly unless they don't have one!). It looks like we will be missing some warmer weather while we are gone (it will still be warmer down there). Hopefully, we aren't back in the lower temps when we get home! Mae-Happy that your procedure is over. Hope you are feeling good. Divine-That disability dr was a quack indeed! Arthritis?? Really?? Wow! Micmel-More surgery? I pray it all goes well. Hugs! Well I've got to pack for tomorrow (yes, I leave everything until the last minute!). I might get on here on vacation, but don't count on it. I will post pics when I can. Take care, all of you! Hugs!

She took his hand and had him stand right next to her. The had a parade with all the princesses and kids later, and she came right up to him and grabbed his hand and he stayed with her for the entire time. For the whole week, he said they were in love and were going to get married. LOL This is at the entrance to Epcot. It was the flower and garden festival. Topiary of all the characters throughout the park. They had all the main characters (Donald had his own with his nephews elsewhere), Mickey, Pluto, Minnie, and Goofy. The grands at the butterly garden enterance. They had netting over it all to keep them inside. This is where we ate in Hollywood Studios. The Sci-Fi Drive-in Theater. We couldn't get a car to sit in with 11 of us. So we sat in the 3 small umbrella tables in the back. This was our view. Aiden and Mom shared a shake. Matthew enjoying his he shared with Dad. Us and the three grands in Animal Kingdom. Aiden always had to have a map at each park, he showing the latest. I'm not sure what ride we are waiting on. They got their faces painted (for almost $20 a piece, but how could we say no!), later at Animal Kingdom. Sorry, this one is out of place. This was also in Epcot. 9 out of 11 again. Nick (the son-in-law) and Aiden are missing. Me and Bryan at Chef Mickey's at the Contemporary Resort in the Magic Kingdom (the monorail goes through it). Our last day at the parks.Goofy put out his hand, so I gave him five. He put it out again, so I placed my hand in his, then he kissed it. My sister Colleen blew a kiss to Mickey and he blew one back, so we are both feeling the love. The kids and Minnie. Pluto, Donald, and Daisy were also there. Us on the Carousel in the Magic Kingdom (I guess this was Thursday, different shirt LOL).Bryan asked if I wanted to ride the horse, I told him my horse riding days are done!

I inform her that the PA has been doing it for the past few months because if I wait for the dr, it would only be one week before my chemo, and it's impossible to find a chair for me. She checked and said there was nothing available,but there was plenty on Fri. I informed her we were going away for the weekend (our Mini Cooper trip) and were leaving in the morning. She starts looking on Wed. I said I was not doing it on Wed because then I would start getting sick on Sat instead of Sun (because I would finish the post steroids a day earlier). She said there was nothing available that day anyhow. She said they'd work on it. I also have my younger grandson's preschool graduation at 1pm on Thursday and asked if I could come in first thing in the morning. She said that they don't allow 1 hr infusions (well, the chemo is one hour, but with the steroid infusion before it it's over 2 hours, and I'm there at least 3 hrs!). I'm ready to say screw you I'll wait until Monday. Oh and my tumor markers went from 134 to 203. I had scans a couple of weeks ago, and they were fine, but it's the first time they've jumped that much in a long time. The PA said that we'd have to keep an eye on it. Even though next week will be my post chemo \"hell week (they have lowered my chemo dose again to try to stop all the diarrhea I have), at least it is the one week I don't have to go to that office! Can you tell I'm sleep deprived from the steroids (probably why I'm bitching right now too!). Thanks for letting me vent! Bigbhome-Glad your hubby is doing well, and the surgeries are going well too! Sorry he won't be able to go back to the job he loves. Grannax-Wonderful picture!! I hope everyone has a nice evening. Big Hugs! Lynne",

Yes, last week was my \"Hell\" week. I'm now in my good week. Next week is steroid/chemo week, then I start \"hell\" week again. You do have to post a pic of your \"fancy\" dress! Have a great time at the wedding and with your company coming up. I'm glad you are feeling great after you procedure! Micmel-Hang in there. I hope they find a place soon, for your sake! Had my every 3 week oncologist/blood work appointment today. I'm neutropenic (always am at this appointment, the white cells are always back up in time for chemo the following week), but my red cells and platelets look great. I have to see the PA next week on Wed instead of Thurs when I have my chemo, because there were no slots available on Thursday. The ding dong (who I had again today checking me out) said I scheduled your chemo for Fri next week. I said to her that nobody called me saying the scheduled me, and that I told her 2 weeks ago (when I tried to get it scheduled), I told her I was leaving for the weekend at 8am on Fri, and it had to be Thurs morning because my youngest grandson's pre-school graduation was at 1 pm on Thurs. I had told the oncologist what happened with Stephanie, and that it wasn't the first time. She said that I'm not the only one who has issues with her, and she wrote on my paperwork that Thurs morning was ok for me to get my chemo. So now I have to go to the office 2 days in a row next week. GRRR! I best not get her at checkout again next week, when I ask them to schedule my next chemo 3 weeks later again, so hopefully, I don't get stuck going 2 days in one week again! Next weekend we are going up north (to the mountains) with a bunch of fellow mini cooper owners (I think there were 100 of us last year). We are going up with 10 cars on Friday (taking all day to get there, stopping for lunch, usually it takes 2 hours), taking back roads through NH and ME. Then on Sat we line all the minis by model, in a ski area parking lot. Love looking at all the different Minis. Never see 2 exactly the same. Different stripes, different rims, something always different. At 10 am we take of on another run (I think we are up to 15 in our group, there are several different runs). Another all day affair, through VT and NH this time. Then we climb Mount Washington (the highest peak in the northeast) with just Minis. We go up 1/2 hour before sunset, and watch the sunset. We took our daughter's mini up last year, because her's is an automatic (our's is a standard). I was scared to death. I had been up twice before (I was in my teens both times), but had forgotten that there is nothing stopping you from going over the edge of the windy steep climb. I also do not like heights (how I skied for decades, I'll never know). Not sure if we will take the climb up the mountain this year (we went up when I was in college with his standard Datsun hatchback, we had to stop to cool off the brakes many times on the way down). It was beautiful last year, we were above the clouds! We'll see... Minis on Top here we come. Hugs and prayers to all! Lynne  ",

I'm glad you have started mending your relationship, and yes, I believe it will be easier without them in the house. I too find it strange that his family is all of the sudden taking interest in him now that he's moved out, after throwing them out of their house. I hope this doesn't mess up your relationship with them. A month to put the house up for sale? That's quick! When is your son graduating?? A lake house sounds wonderful! One of my sayings is, \"If we ever win the lottery, the first thing I'm doing is buying a house on Newfound Lake (my favorite lake in NH, an hour and a half away, it's big, but quiet, and crystal clear). Tanya-Hurray for good scans! I am the opposite of you. I'll take the cold above the heat and humidity any day. I had a cousin move down there from NH, and she says it's just the opposite there, they stay in the a/c all summer, like we do in the winter. Nope I enjoy the change of seasons too much, and my roots run deep here (I'm 4th generation on my Mom's side, and 5th generation on my Dad's, living in this city, my kids and grandkids are either in the city or one of the neighboring towns). We don't mind visiting FL, we just couldn't live there year round. You can always put more layers on in the winter, but can only take so many layers off, without being indecent in the summer. LOL Grannax-Love the picture of you and your granddaughter! Such fun doing plays all summer! Wish they had that for us growing up! MJH-Love your ride and all your beautiful flowers! Yes we need to get together again soon! Had a ball meeting your! I have chemo on Thurs, so next week (after the mini's on top weekend) is \"hell\" week. Lowering my dose though, has helped with the diarrhea. It's not lasting as long, and therefore the dizzies aren't as long either. Still sick of all though. Bigbhome-Glad to see you on here and that your hubby's surgeries are going well. Hope his PT goes well, as well as the other shoulder surgery. Poor guy. Hope your scans go well for you! Big hugs! Keetmom-I'm so sorry to hear of your gran mal seizure. They are so scary. My older daughter had 3 with her first stroke at 1 1/2. It happened again, a couple of years ago, when she got lidocaine (which she had many times) before a filling. Needless to say, she didn't get the filling that day and ended going to the ER. They said that some of the lidocaine had got in her blood stream and caused the seizure. She no longer has lidocaine. I hope you are doing better. Hugs! Minnie-Welcome back! I hope you had a great time in Ireland! Katyk-I have been with my husband since high school. 39 years ago. We will be married 35 years in October. We have 4 adult children and 3 grandchildren. I too get upset with me not being here and wondering if he will be with someone else. I told him I would haunt him too. If he does get together with someone, I said don't marry her, or let her move into our home (he'll probably sell it and get a condo, he'll be 55 in Aug, I'll be 57 in Dec). I think he will be too lonely living alone. We will finally (after 32 years of kids) be empty nesters next week. Our older daughter who's almost 31, moved out last week. We told her since she's come and gone about 5 times, this is the last time. She'll have to go live with one of her siblings if this relationship doesn't work out. Our youngest who's almost 23, is moving out next week, 6 hours away, to be with his girlfriend. He gets one come back, since he's never left. I don't mind him staying, he's the most helpful, cleanest and quietest of the bunch (the other 2 are out and will stay out unless there are extenuating circumstances, the each have children). Our younger daughter asked me what we are going to do once he moves out, I said change the locks and run around the house naked! Of course they all laughed (it was our Sunday dinner with all of them). It sure will be quiet, but less stressful. Our older son (and eldest) comes over her every day his has his daughter, so we see him at least twice a week, and every other weekend. He comes here to eat. We love seeing her, but she's 8 and just stays in the living room watching the shows she doesn't get at either parent's house. It's getting old. We really need that time to ourselves. I can't even listen to music anymore, because a sappy love song comes on and just get me going. This 13 year breast cancer (when I was first diagnosed stage 1, it came back in my spine, lung, and lymph nodes after 7 years, now 6 years stage 4 and also in my liver and many bones) business has brought me down! I do hear you though, and totally agree with what you are saying! Hugs! Gracie-Missing you on here! Hope all is well. Hugs and prayers! Here are my rose bushes, off of my big deck. They are pretty old, and I had to trim off a lot of dead branches this spring. Not as many blooms (still more buds coming in) this year. They are climbing roses, I sometimes get another burst of blooms in the fall too. Hugs and prayers to all!   ",

They only thing I do for them is cut off the dead stuff in the spring, and try to water them on the days it doesn't rain, which has I've needed to do daily, these past couple of weeks. Rain this afternoon, into tomorrow morning. Boy do we need it. We had a wooden stockade fence (we have about 20 sections of fencing, just for 2 sides of the back yard) for about 25 years. My husband took it all down, and put up the new fencing by himself (my older daughter, younger son and I would bring the pieces to him). Luckily, I married a handyman. Of course everyone has jobs for him to do in our families, so I always come last. This summer, he needs to fix the darn roof, that he's replaced twice already. It leaks in the kitchen and has ruined part of the ceiling again (by-passing our bedroom, and our daughter's bedroom somehow, going down the walls). He also needs to paint 2 1/2 sides of the house (he did the front and half of the driveway side, didn't do the trim around the windows and door though) and the garage (plus fix that roof too!). I think I'm ready for vinyl siding. We had it when we bought the house, but it was cheaper for him to put cedar on the entire house than to get it put on just the 2 story addition, he put on the back of the house (with a little help from his 82 year old grandfather). He said he wasn't putting up vinyl by himself (I don't blame him, his turning 55 in August), and it's so expensive to have it done. I'll paint as high as I can reach. I don't do ladders. I don't like heights. Of course, he painted the lower half of the driveway side. So that entire side will be his! Those are the outside ones. The inside painting of the hallway, bathroom, and our daughter's room will wait until fall/winter. Love him dearly, but get the butt in gear! LOL Lynne-Are you going on a cruise to the Bahamas? We took one (our first) on Carnival, a 4-day to the Bahamas (we sent the older kids home for school, it was Oct, and Mom, our youngest, in elementary school, and us, went to Disney the rest of the week). They stopped in Nassau for a day, we were stuck on the ship the rest of the cruise. Hated the cruise, we just shopped and 3 of the kids (my eldest son had that bowl/ skater cut at the time, so his sisters and him were the only ones that did it, the youngest wanted to do his too, but his hair was too short). I've always wanted to do it. When we went to Punta Cana, they were doing it at the pool,. It was the day before we were leaving, so I skipped it. I wish I had it done. Even my husband said it might be my last chance. My hair was to my waist then, it probably would have cost a fortune. If it every grows back, I'm definitely having it done! LOL The second time we went, we stayed on Paradise Island (right next to Nassau, horribly high bridge connecting the two). We didn't stay in the beautiful pink hotel, we stayed one that faced the harbor (it used to be a Holiday Inn), it was an all inclusive with 2 restaurants. It was cheap and we only stayed 4 nights there too with his brother and wife. The beach wasn't nice, but there was a pool. We took a small walk to the other side of the island to a beautiful beach. We also rented scooters, and let the guys drive (I should have rented my own, I have a motorcycle license, which you didn't need, but it helps). Yes we went over that steep bridge. I just buried my face in my husband's back going up, and coming back down the other side. Oh and it's a toll bridge on the way back, so you are waiting in line on the bridge. And yes, they drive on the other side of the road. We went to the aquarium at that pink hotel (I can't remember it's name, just looked it up, The Atlantis), at night it's free. They get all the cruise ship people over there during the day. We checked out all the yachts docked there too. One was a Hagen Das yacht, and it's name was Frozen Assets, with a double dot over the o. Yes we need to make a plan for our next get-together. Next week isn't good for me either, since I'm having chemo this week. Mae-You enjoy your trip to the Bahamas too. Which Island are you staying on? I've only been to Nassau/Paradise Island. My best friend went to Eleuithra for her honeymoon, over 30 years ago. They stayed at a Club Med (I don't think there are any of those left!). 2 more weeks and your are done! Enjoy your concert and those birthdays! Tanya-Enjoy your camping trip! Sounds fun! Sounds like you have a busy few weeks. Enjoy NY, DC, and Morocco. I hope your health hangs in there, as I do for all of us. We always get the insurance for our flights, just in case. Haven't had to use it yet for us, but we did for our Mom when she couldn't go to FL with us. Glad we did it. Well I have to shower and get ready for my PA/blood work appointment (that should have been done tomorrow with my chemo! Again, GRRRR!). Let's see if I can get the next chemo appointment in 3 weeks, today. I will try to avoid Stephanie. Last time she said Lynne, I can take you over here, so of course I had to go to her. All 3 were available. I pray she's on the phone today! I'm not in the mood for her crap! Have a wonderful day everyone! Hugs! Lynne ",

Come to find out, they had already set up my appointment for my next chemo (on the 5th) and my next oncology appointment 2 weeks after that. I wish they called me and let me know. I can do the times and dates they picked (I don't have much of a life), but occasionally, I actually do something! Today I had my chemo. I didn't have to wait for anything (because of having to do my PA stuff yesterday), and got plugged in right away. I was out of there after 2 hrs (since I did my other hour yesterday). I didn't have to check out (because I already had my appointments. I told them to have a nice weekend. They took tumor markers last week again, since they went up a lot from the previous 2 weeks, and they went up even more. They took them yesterday, but they didn't have the results back yet today. Not sure what she's planning on doing if they go up again. I guess I'll find out when I see her in two weeks. Maybe she'll have me do my scans sooner (I just had them done a month ago, and they were fine). Grannax-Sorry to hear about your DD. I'll say a prayer for her and your family. Today I met a fellow Stage 4 (lung cancer) woman who was sitting across from me. We got to chatting and ended up adding each other on facebook. She's raising her 3 grandkids because of a daughter with addiction issues. I know too many that are in the same boat (2 of my friends lost their kids in their late 20s and are raising their grandkids too). It's so sad. I just thank God my kids didn't get into that. They could have just as the others did. We are leaving tomorrow at 8:30 in morning (guess I should start packing!) for our Minis on Top weekend. We will take a drive with 8 other cars, to head up north (only 2 hrs away), but taking about 8 hrs to get there. We will go over the border into Maine, and stop for lunch on the way. Getting to the hotel around dinner time. Weather looks great (I just hope my steroids hold off the side effects until I get home on Sunday)! We'll have the top down for sure! Still not sure if I want to take the ride up the mountain again this year, on Sat at sunset. We'll play by ear! Last Sunday we went to Bike week in Laconia, with the trike. I bought some scarves from a vendor without trying them on. Well this big Irish head does not fit in them. Luckily, the vendor gave me a card, so I emailed him. We are going to stop there on the way home, on Sunday to see if he has bigger ones, can make them bigger, or he'll give us our money back. He said he'd still be there. I really don't want to stop, it's suppose to be 90 on Sunday, and it's Father's Day, and the family is coming over, but we're doing it. It's on the way home at least. I'll guess I'll have a lot reading to do when I get back on here (probably Monday). This page just seems to fly! Have a nice weekend everyone! Lynne",

It took us an hour and a half to get there. Luckily we were heading south, northbound traffice was back up for about 10 miles due to an accident. We took the mini down, and had the top down all the way there. Beautiful night. My husband insisted we leave at 4:30 (for an 8pm show!). He wanted a spot in the parking garage, under the the garden. We got one, then had to wait for my cousin and his wife for a couple of hours (they had the tickets). She works for a radio station, and got the tickets for free. We grabbed a piece of pizza for dinner. When they got there, we headed up in the elevator (I brought my wheelchair). The guy in the wheelchair told us how to get to the floor \"seats\" (no seats, just standing, well, except for me!). He told us one way, 5 other people told us 5 other ways. We were in one elevator 4 times! \"Luckily\" to concert was delayed, and didn't start until 8:45. They had a stage in the middle of the stadium, with a large screen in the middle, and stages at both ends. Well on of those ends was right in front of us (no I didn't go to the front of the stage, we stayed against the wall). I could see them pretty good, even though there were 6 people deep in front of us. I knew about half the songs. We got home at 12:15am (poor hubby had to work today, he got up at his usual 4am, early to bed tonight!). We had a good time. Here are a few pics my husband and my cousin took. The place was totally full. My friends told me Tom Brady was there last night too. We didn't see him though. LOL Bono's butt. Bono. Oh, and today, our youngest moved out. He is moving in with his girlfriend who lives and is going to school in Rochester NY (7 hours away). I am sad, he's the one that never caused me grief and is a wonderful kid. He'll be 23 on the 5th and she's 22. She has one more semester for her bachelor's (her grades have been all As except for 3 Bs!) in the fall. We are officially now EMPTY NESTERS! His sister (our number 2) moved out a couple of weeks ago. I informed him he is allowed to come back home (the other 3 have used their one comeback, some many) if he wants. Hopefully, we'll be able to enjoy the quiet. Of course tonight, our first night, we have our granddaughter. Our son has to work tomorrow. Oh well, maybe tomorrow night we can enjoy!

I said that she has 4 kds and 13 grandkids who could drive them. It's in August. She is scheduled for a lumpectomy and sentinal node biopsy (what I had) in 2 1/2 weeks. Her tumor is 1 cm. Mine was 1.5 cm. She is not sure what she is going to do. I'm going to tell her about this website. Please say a prayer for her. Her name is Elaine. Oncology appointment this afternoon.

We may go see him the weekend he moves to their new apartment, the first weekend in August. I do miss him. He is the sweetest, most caring adult kid I know. Our grands are just starting to get involved in activities. The older two are in scouts and went to camp this year. The youngest will be starting cub scouts next year. Our granddaughter did spring soccer this year, and all will be playing fall soccer. Luckily, our granddaughter is 15 min away, and our grandsons are 1/2 hr away. It's doable. I'm sure we won't make all games, but will make most. Hopefully, they don't have too many overlapping each other. Bigbhome-I hope all went well with your husband's surgery. I hope you have tons of help! Don't wear yourself out! Hugs! Micmel-I am going to get the second opinion first before starting chemo. My local oncologist put me in for that day, just to save a slot, in case the Boston dr has the same opinion on which chemo to do. They will be calling Dana Farber for the appointment tomorrow. Hopefully, they will be able to get me in quick (and hopefully, she's not on vacation, as she was the last time). Of course my left sided sciatica is bothering me (ever since I went on the motorcycle ride on Sunday). Shooting pain, all the way down to my ankle. I really do not want to go for a steroid shot. Hopefully, it will just go away! We have a charity ride on Saturday (it's only a a couple hours, but it's an hour to the start point), hopefully it will feel better by then! The muggies have moved in. It's suppose to be humid with a chance of thunderstorms through Friday. UGH! I guess I'll be hibernating in the a/c for the week. Hugs and prayers to all! Lynne ",

Same colors though. He has 2 thin black stripes on the sides of the hood, while we have 2 wider white stripes going down the middle. He said he wasn't sore this morning (lucky), he was sore this afternoon from squeezing under a house for his job though. The adjusters will be looking at his car on Fri. Right now he has a rental car (chevy Impala) until Fri, that the ins co is covering. He's checking out used Minis again (he's had 2 red ones, a cooper and a countryman, his car before that was red too, he's had that plate for a long time). He's not sure if he's going for a Clubman or a Countryman, but he wants the AWD. He didn't need snows, like his brother and sister did with their's. Our's only goes out once in awhile in the winter (we have an SUV), the roads have to be down to the tar. Tanya-Happy to hear good news about your biopsy results! Mae-Glad to hear about your good results too! runor-Hugs! For whatever you're going through! Went out to eat with some former co-workers tonight (half have left the company, most of the ones still there are working from home now). We had a great time! Lots of catching up. My sciatica is killing me. Ever since we went for the motorcycle ride a week and a half ago, it's been bothering me. I finally called Pain MGT today, and the earliest appointment they could give me was in September. I said that's not going to work. I informed the receptionist, that the PA said she would squeeze me in earlier, she transferred me to the nurse's line, and I left a message, saying I had stage 4 breast cancer, and I could not wait 2 months for an appointment. It hurts when I walk, sit. lie down, and that's taking muscle relaxers, cbd, usiing a heating pad, and I even broke down and took an oxycodone this afternoon (they expired a month ago, but I thought I'd try), nothing helps. I need a steroid shot! I went to dinner with my wheelchair tonight so I wouldn't have to walk. My oncology office finally got back to me after I called them yesterday, about my Dana-Farber appointment. My appointment is next Thurs at 5pm. Hopefully, all the traffic will be heading North as we travel South. After the appointment, it should be smooth sailing. They also gave me 3 chemo appointments (If I choose Gemzar), the following 3 weeks. We have the wedding the 18th (we are heading up there Thursday now) and the 25th we leave for vacation for 10 days. I hope I don't have side effects for whatever I choose (I have had SE's with the other 3 chemos I have had, and had to take steroids before and after chemo, YUCK!). I really don't want to be feeling crappy for either one! At least the week of vacation , I have off from the oncology office. Once a week for 3 weeks than one week off. Not happy about it. We'll see what the breast oncologist says Thursday! Off to take another muscle relaxer, cbd, and pain killer! Have a good night everyone! Hugs! Lynne",

Especially, the day after surgery! YIKES! Glad you are ok! I know about wanting to do things you have always done. My mother always wants to drive me everywhere! I told her I can drive myself to my appointments, just not the chemo appointments. She wanted to drive me the 2 1/2 mile ride to the pain management building this morning. She thought I was getting a shot. I said that no, this is just the consult. Well, my shots will not be happening until the day after Labor Day, that was the earliest with any of the drs they had. She gave me a prescription for predisone. 3 a day for 5 days (no tapering down), to try to help with the pain. Of course the pain in my left leg is almost gone, and is now starting in my right leg. I've got a very busy month and will just have to suck it up I guess. She did say to call if it gets really bad again. I thought why, if I can't get in until the beginning of Sept. There is no magic pill. I went through them all while I was there for a year, trying to kill the chronic pain. I did ask on the way out if I needed someone to drive me after the shots, and they said no. I only drive about once or twice a week, let me do it MOM (she's 80 1/2 by the way!). Of course some of the stuff I would like others to help me with, doesn't happen. I've mentioned multiple times, that my floors and one rug are filthy, and of course nothing happens. I can't tell you when the floors were last washed (even with the swiffer) and the rug on the stairs has be vacuumed (I'm ready to tear it out!). Both kill my back. I do sweep the floors, empty and fill the dishwasher, do the laundry, wash the toilets and sinks (I can't do the tub and the shower anymore). I can even mow the lawn (when I get sick of looking at it so long). But could you please just do what I ask, that I can not do??? Grrrrr! Too funny about the Kia! I always think the Fiat looks like a Mini from a distance. We wave at other Minis, and I have to ask my husband if it is a Mini or not, when it's a Fiat. LOL Off to Boston tomorrow afternoon. Hopefully, there is another chemo, or other treatment, that isn't once a week for 3 weeks, then one week off, and doesn't give you a lot of side effects. Have a good evening everyone! Lynne ",

I'm pretty sick of the rain right now, I need to see the sun, it keeps me in a better mood. Great pics! I love the new chair too! We do love our Minis (except, our younger daughter)! They are fun to drive! MJH-Thanks for the info on the Citoxin. I also have a wren, that comes to my feeders every day. They are cute! Enjoy your time with your sister! Grannax-My compression fracture is in T2. I've had 4 kyphoplasties already. 3 in the thoracic region, and one between L5 and S1. I had a MRI of my spine yesterday. The Boston oncologist wanted to make sure it's sciatica and not some of the mets in my bones, making the bones put pressure on those nerves. I got the report and CD, but I can't make heads or tales out of it. Sounds like the surgery you had was very complicated. Glad it went well for you. Daywalker-Wonderful news on your latest tests! It's always great to hear good news! Muddling-My DH does 99% of the cooking. It was that way long before I was diagnosed. I worked part-time evenings, for over 25 years, so he would have to feed, bathe, and put our 4 children to bed, Mon-Fri. I never enjoyed cooking. Once in a great while, I'll make dinner, but that is a rare day indeed. Glad you got to cook and enjoy the meal you made! Scwilly-Beautiful sign you made! Last Fri, I called my primary, to get 2 new prescriptions, because I was running out and there were no refills. I told them one was going to the local pharmacy, and the other was going to the mail order company. Well they sent both to the mail order (the mail order company sent me 2 emails, instead of one), and I was down to 2 pills of the prescription that should have went to the local pharmacy. I went down to the dr's office (1/2 a mile from home) and explained it to the receptionist. She said I was right, it said it on my chart. The person messed up. She sent a new prescription to the local pharmacy. Around 3 yesterday, I had not heard from the pharmacy, so I called them. They told me, that because the mail order company, already processed that prescription, they could not process one. I explained that I was down to 1 pill, so she said she could use their discount, and fill a 30 day bottle for me. I had to pay $10 for it. Works for me! Now I'll have muscle relaxers for my sciatica, for the weekend! I'm so sick of the dr's offices messing up. It's happened too often, for me anyway!!! GRRRRR! My son who totaled his Mini Countryman, bought a 2017 Mini Clubman, last week. It's not red though (as his last 3 cars have been). It's a flat light gray, with a black roof (no stripes, I love the stripes!). The Clubman has the barn doors on the back, instead of a hatch, like the others (well the convertibles, like ours, has a tiny trunk). It only has 9k miles on it. It was a salesman's car. His daughter loves it, and so does he. They loved the one that got totaled too. His first Mini, was an all red 2 door Cooper. That one was older, with lots of miles, and had lots of engine problems. I had a sister of a friend, on one of my other threads, message me on her account. There were only 3 of us on that thread (Taxotere), and we posted often. I had sent a message to the friend about a month ago, because we hadn't heard from her in awhile. The sister let me know that her sister had \"gone to the other side\", the end of June. This disease really sucks! It keeps taking away wonderful people. I was sorry to hear about Robin, and Patty's suffering. It's all so sad! Today, I am watching my grandsons again. I've watched them 3 times, and seen them 2 days, in the past week. I love them dearly, but they exhaust me, even if I'm just watching them in the pool! My daughter has a dr's appointment today. She's had pain in her back for 4 days now (she left work on Sat, and stayed home Sun, she's a workaholic, so you know she's hurting). She's had kidney stones and kidney infections twice, once while she was pregnant with number 2 son. She's going today, because it's her day off. She's been drinking lots of cranberry juice and water, hoping to \"clear\" it up. Enough is enough. go see someone! Hugs to all! Enjoy your Tuesday! Lynne ",

Two blue eyes and freckles like Dad, 2 olive complexions and browned eyes like Mom). I was born Dec 21st (I'm the eldest of us 4 sisters) then she was born the following Dec 17th. Same age for 4 days. She's older than my husband as well (I'm 1 yr 8 mos, she's 8 mos older, his sister is less than a month older than me). Number 3 sister in the picture, is 2 1/2 years younger than number 2, and number 4 is 5 years younger than number 3 (she's not in the picture, she was in 5th grade). It's funny, my 4 kids are roughly the same ages apart as my sisters and I are. Mae-Love that hat on your dog! My maiden name is McDonough, so the month of March was Dad's celebration month. He would have been 82 March 7th, and marched with the Ancient Order of Hibernians, pipes and drum group, at many St Patrick's Day parades. He loved it. We even got him a shamrock head stone (even though Mom is French, LOL). Lynne-I know where the \"Weathervane\" was, now \"Murphy's\". My son had a friend that lived on the road, behind it. We'll have to get together for lunch or something, when you get back! That would be great! Micmel-The snow is melting now. We never lost power, rarely do. Another Nor'easter coming in on Tuesday. So far, they said we should only get a few inches, unless it heads further north. I hope they are right! My DH is patiently waiting for me so we can go. I guess I should get off here!

Neither of them drink much at all, and she had a Mai Tai. She was falling asleep on the table, so they were home by 9. Next our younger daughter and husband came home at 10 (yup, the boys never slept) and brought the boys home, much to their dismay. I told them we could have a sleepover another time. The 2 eldest didn't come in until 1:30 am. Our granddaughter fell asleep around 11, on the couch. He was going to bring her home, but she wasn't cooperating. He slept on the floor, (I have no rugs) and she slept on the couch. They only one who sang was our oldest. He sang with his cousin (who he lives with) many times.

I'll stay out there for a half hour or an hour. It works for me. Sometimes you just have to say, \"it's out of my hands and all the worrying in the world is not going to change it\".

Today at chemo, the nurse asked me how I was doing a couple of times, I felt fine. She said my face was red. I told her that's my Irish glow from the Decadron (even the pills I take for 3 days before and 2 days after give me nice rosy cheeks , neck and chest, sometimes only on side), unfortunately not from alcohol. LOL Have a nice evening everyone! Lynne",

My mother gave me a blue hydrangea plant one for Easter. I hope it blooms again this summer. I have to wait to plant it outside. It's still cold at night here. Elle-Welcome! There is a great group of women on here! Congrats on your 1 year anniversary! I'll be 6 yrs soon, at stage 4 (it's been 13 years since I was diagnosed stage 1). Blueshine-I hope you get good results today on your scans. Lynne-I laughed when you said we could picnic in your car. Just pick a restaurant I don't mind. I noticed a couple that I gave you seem to only have street parking (Ri Ra and Surf, I looked at the pics they have on their websites), so I'd skip those. The two you listed look good. Minnie-Enjoy your trip! Micmel-I hope your scans go well! I saw my oncologist today and had blood work. She said my scans were good. I was wondering about the bone scan. I thought that more intake meant more tumors, but I guess the radiologist worded it wrong. She said that the more intake in my ribs, meant that the holes in them are filling in. The 2 CT scans (that I drink banana smoothies, one at home and one there, I use a straw and stick it way in the back of my mouth, so I taste as little as possible, LOL) showed the nodes in one lung were gone, and there was no change in the other ones in the other lung, the lesions in my liver showed no change either. So I'm still on Taxotere for another 3 months (until the next scans). The neuropathy in my hands and feet seems to be getting a little worse (especially my feet, my toes hurt a lot at the end of the day if I do a lot of walking), so she is lowering my dose of Taxotere again. I get my next dose on Thursday. My bloodwork shows I'm a little neutropenic and a little anemic (I have to wait until next week for the tumor markers). No wedding shower for me on Sunday for our nephew's ( my godchild) finacee. They are getting married 8/18/18, in VT. I could go, but I'd have to wear a mask. I'll sent my gifts with my daughter. Nice day today. Rain is coming in for the weekend. Of course we are watching our grandsons tomorrow. Our daughter and her husband are going to a wedding. I thought \"The Incredibles\" movie was out and we'd go to that, but they were just showing the pre-buy tickets. It's not out for a month. Maybe we will find a movie to rent. I shouldn't be in crowds anyhow. I pray everyone gets good results with their tests. Hugs! Lynne  ",

I've had 4 kyphoplasties (and one fracture too high to repair). Once your body heals from the surgery, your back will feel so much better. So sorry you have to to go through this. Hugs! Holmes-Yes it was a good exhaustion on Father's Day. I just think I did too much after having chemo on Thursday. I love everyday I see my kids and grandkids. Tomorrow, our youngest (almost 23) is moving to Rochester NY (6 hours away), and we will be empty nesters for the first time since our eldest was born 32 years ago. It will be different. Grannax-Sorry to hear about your DD. Hope the figure something out. Glad you are doing well on your treatment. When you are done your remodel, don't forget to post pics. Muddling-Wonderful news on your tumor markers! Gracie-So sorry about your progression and having to have surgeries. Glad you are back on here though. Hugs! keetmom-Good to hear no more seizures, sad to here you can't do everything you want. Hugs! Bigbhome-Good to see you on here. Glad you got to spend time with your friend. It's great to reminisce. It sounds like my neighborhood, except we were all girls (only 2 boys) and no horses. We played outside all the time. There are woods, and we played in there and road our bikes in there all the time. I still live in the same neighborhood (as does my Mom and youngest sister), and luckily our kids had the same experience as I did. The grandkids, I think will not have the same. Very sad. Hope you and your hubby are doing well. I hope you will be able to do your horse rides again soon. I love our motorcycle and mini rides. Yesterday, one of my cousins sent me a message on FB. He asked if I wanted to go to the U2 concert in Boston tonight. Floor seats. I told him I'd be in a wheelchair because I can't walk to far or stand too long. He called the Garden to see if I could bring it and they said yes. I said ok, and asked him how much I owed him for the 2 tickets. He said just have a good time. So we are leaving shortly for the 2 hour drive (because of rush hour) to Boston for an 8pm show. We are meeting him and his wife there. Should be fun! \"I still haven't found what I'm looking for\"! Hugs to all! Lynne",

We stopped to see our old state icon, The Old Man of the Mountain. He fell off the mountain about 10 years ago. They have a kind of memorial for him there. You could see him from the highway. There is still rock up there but the face is gone. We got lost for awhile going to our old workplace. We asked someone, and we were on the wrong side of the river. We found it, and it looked mostly like it did in 1977, where we lived and worked for July and August. Cabins were painted now, and there were two more. There was nobody there! We peeked in windows, and walked around. It brought back lots of good memories. Lots of laughs! It's now a 4H camp. On the way home, we missed the exit that would have made our trip 45 minutes shorter! I felt bad for my friend, who did all the driving, she still had to drive back home first to her parents (who are in the same city as me) then to her house in RI (another 2 hour drive). She just messaged me and said I forgot my jacket in the back of her car. She's coming back this weekend and will give it to me then. Here are a few pics she took on Tues. It was a beautiful day! This is what the Old Man looks like now. They have a neat line up of posts, by your height, and it puts the old man back on the mountain. There were two cabins on top of the hill (the girls) and two on the bottom (the boys) 24 high schoolers. There were also 5 adults. One head leader. The other 4 were in charge of 6 of us each while we worked. Lynne",

Looks like they had a great time together! I told my oncologist about the current things that were happening with my speech, memory, tiwtiching and memory. She is having me go for an MRI of my brain. She wants it done before Thurs when I am due for my chemo, because I will have to get off my chemo if they see something, and will be referred to radiology. Of course the hospital called while I was outside, around 4 and didn't see the message until 6. I'll be calling them first thing tomorrow. I guess I start my steroids tomorrow, just in case! So sorry to hear about your scans. Good luck tomorrow! Hugs! Grannax-Lovely makeover! Very nice! Micmel-I'm glad that your daughter seems to finally get it! It is sad when they do leave. I just had 2 leave in 2 weeks time. I'm now an empty nester. I said only my youngest can come back , since he is the only one that hasn't yet. My older daughter has come and gone about 5 or 6 times. I told her when she moved out this time, she can't come back (unless there is extenuating circumstances). The other 2 that are already out, the same thing (they both came back once). It's so quiet in my house now! Of course they come visit frequently! Mae-Happy Birthday to your doggie! That is old! We had 2 cats, that passed away, 2 years ago. The son went one month, he was 16, and the mother went the next month, she was 17. We went to visit my in-laws yesterday. She seems ok. Still in shock I think. Her tumor is .8 cm (mine was 1.5), ER and PR +, Her2-, IDC (just like mine). She is having a lumpectomy and sentinal node biospy, the end of the month (as I did, 13 years ago). They said she wouldn't need chemo (probably because she's 85 1/2!) and just radiation. Which she's not sure she will do. She's concerned about the 1/2 hour drive each way from the hospital, and it being 6 weeks long every day M-F. She's also worried about her grandson's wedding 8/18 in VT. It's 2 hrs away. She said she can't drive that far. I told her she has 4 kids, and 13 grandkids who can drive them. She says she's not sure what she is going to do for treatment. This disease SUCKS! Well, it's Sunday BBQ with the kids and grands, and one family is here. I guess I better make my salad! Lynne",

I hope he can take it over soon. Lynne-Chemo went fine today (the bathroom runs already have begun). I will be ok tomorrow through Sat, since I will still be on the steroids. We are suppose to go on a motorcycle ride with our friends, this weekend. Sat would be the better day for me, she has MS though and we never know how she will be. Of course my husband thinks I can go Sunday. I said yeah, when I had my chemo on Friday, not Thurs! I have my scans scheduled for 2 weeks on Wed, and will see my oncologist that Friday. They drew for tumor markers again today. I'll find out those on Monday. I saw Mary the PA, and she had a PA student with her. Mary broke her hand and is in a cast. I remember when I broke mine, 2 winters ago, mine was my right hand though. What a pain trying to do everything lefty. I didn't slip and fall outside, I tripped over one of the grandkids toys in the house! At least I got away with a lower arm splint. I didn't see Stephanie today (thank you God!). it was just the newer girl on the far right by herself. It was 11:30 when I left, so maybe the other 2 were at lunch. It was a pleasant check out for once. You're right, maybe they did tell her to be nicer to all Lynnes! LOL Wow, your numbers have really jumped! I hope the new treatment works for you! Mae-Love the pics of the wildlife! I hope you are doing a lot of relaxing! MJH-I agree with Lynne. Once I get through the next 2 weeks, we should plan another lunch date, if you're not too busy. Runor-I'm so sorry all the trouble you're going through. Hugs! Micmel-Glad your hubby is home! Hope you had a great 4th. Our 4th was quiet (and 95 degrees, and humid!). Well not quiet, but we stayed home. The day before, at 4 am, our daughter had to go to the ER with her husband. He ended up needing an emergency appendectomy. Our other daughter picked up their 2 boys, and brought them to our house. They went swimming ate and then went to the fireworks. At 10pm my younger daughter and hubby, who just got checked out of the hospital, show up to pick up the boys. We said they were at the fireworks. She said it was his idea. I said well he still has the anesthesia in him, and you listened? LOL After my husband telling them to go home and have a good night's sleep, they finally left. Good thing, the others didn't get home until 11. Her boyfriend and her carried the 2 boys up to bed. They were sound asleep. Of course at 6am, the younger one, comes in my room \"Good Morning, Nana.\" I had him climb into bed. I then looked on the otherside, and my husband is already up. I told him to go downstairs with Pepere, and noticed his brother was already downstairs. Of course now I can't get back to sleep. I take my shower and eat. Then they want to go in the pool. So at 8am, I'm already in the pool (the temp was 88). I told my husband to get in, he doesn't go in unless its above 85! He came in. They ate lunch, and my Mom and my cousin who took her out for lunch came over to see the boys. We went back in the water after they left. At 3 their parents showed up (our daughter went into work for a few hours. luckily the day before was one of her days off, our son-in-law will be out of work for 6 weeks, since he has to lift stuff over 10 lbs as a plumber). They left after an hour. Finally put up our feet, and I said to my husband, \"It's Wed Bryan (our son) and Ryleigh (his daughter) should be coming any minute. A half hour later, they come in. We went int the pool once again (except my husband). They left around 7. We were in bed at 8:30! For a quiet day, it sure was exhausting! One more day of the extreme temps, then showers tomorrow with a high of 85 and less humidity! Get my winter jacket!LOL Have a wonderful evening everyone! Lynne  ",

They kept giving me morphine, so I was awake, and felt them giving me the numbing shots (about 10 of them), they hurt a lot, and I'm screaming \"Ow\" over and over again. I had a blanket over my face, 2 inches above it. I felt the blood running down my neck, as they opened me up. Later, when I got back to the room, I told the nurse that I was in a puddle of blood. The pillow and the back and side of my head were covered in it. Worst hospital experience ever. That's coming from someone who had 4 children without any meds, as well as having other surgeries. I too laughed, at Lynne's picturing you stuck in the chair. My Mom broke her humerus bone, and she had surgery to repair it. When she got home, they did not want her going upstairs (where he bedroom was). So we went to the furniture store, and tried a few chairs (they do come in all sizes). She isn't even 5ft tall, and we found one for her. We brought it home, and showed her how to work the remote. She slept in it, and had to get up in the middle of the night. You got it, it wouldn't work. She had to climb out of it, with it being reclined, and only able to use one hand. She was 78 at the time, and lives alone. We figured out that she had locked the remote. Then we made her sleep with the phone. She somehow did it again, and called my youngest sister (who's 3 houses away, and we are 3 houses away from my sister, all in the same neighborhood). My sister came to her rescue. She slept in her canadian rocking chair for the rest of the week. She still is always in the rocker, instead of the recliner. My grandkids love playing with it when they visit her. I'll sit in it when I visit. So make sure you have everything (especially that phone) when you get in it. Good luck with your new treatment. I also hope they give you numbing cream to put on the port and hour or two, before you have your chemo. It helps. Tanya-It looks like you had a wonderful trip with your beautiful family! Great pictures! I love DC too. I've only been there a couple of times, but there is so much to see. Heat here has finally gone down, after a week in the 90s. No humidity! I can finally breathe when I go outside now. Not a cloud in the sky! This is the weather I like. We may head out on the bike today by ourselves. Our friends have plans today, we may go with them tomorrow, but we'll have to see how she feels (she has MS and is wheelchair bound) and I feel. Last day on post steroids is today, and the past 2 days I felt lousy. Today, so far I'm ok, but I think tomorrow will be a no go. Once I'm off the steroids, that's when the side effects hit me head on. I hope everyone has a wonderful weekend!! Hugs! Lynne",

My port is on my right side, luckily. Although, I had a hard time sleeping even on the left for a few days, and I am like you, I can't sleep on my back. Also that first access for my port was painful, even with the numbing cream. It rarely hurts now (usually when they take it out), after over a year. I'm hoping your experience is much better than mine. We took a short bike ride yesterday. It was great to be in the sun. I felt shaky though, so we had to come home. He wants to go on another ride today with our friends. Last steroids were yesterday, waiting for the side effects to kick in, and I really don't want to be on the back of a motorcycle, miles from home, even on this beautiful day. He mentioned we could take the convertible out, and go to our friends house (they live a half hour from us). I'm not really sure what we'll do. I told him to call them and see how she's feeling today. Oh, and he took out a prime rib roast for tonight and I'm sure is inviting our kids over. Of course my mouth has sores and thrush from the steroids now. Sometimes, he just doesn't get it. Lynne",

Just a short ride though, because I was getting dizzy. Sunday, we were suppose to ride our bikes with friends. I wasn't up for it. We took the convertible to our friends' house instead.

I hope you find a condo you like, before you have to move out of the house. The market is crazy here too. There is not much for sale here, so when something goes up, they bid higher than the asking price in order to get it. It took my sister 3 overbids on condos, before she finally got one. Good luck! holmes-You're right. I know that they are just trying to make us feel better, but sometimes, they have to realize that we are just not up for it. I've lived more of my life in these past 6 years at stage 4, than I'vew had my other 50 years. He's always booking vacations, and short trips. I've enjoyed them all. Minnie-I do the same thing. Look back on what I did wrong, and how I would do it differently. Then I realize, I would not be the same person I am today. My life would be different. I think there is a reason my life turned out the way it has. I get down when I'm alone (which is daily now that the kids moved out). This week will be hard, since it's my post chemo (hell) week. I stay home the entire week, because of all my running to the bathroom. Tonight though, we are having a family dinner with the 3 kids and 2 grandkids (one is at cub scout camp), so that will be good. The grands always cheer me up. Another beautiful day here. I'm going to try to get outside, once the dizziness goes away. Have a wonderful day, all of you! Lynne ",

I was orginally taking it for hot flashes (due to instant menopause, when I had a complete hysterectomy, ovaries too, at 43). I started weaning myself off of them, and the oncologist said that it was probably helping with pain, so I still take 3 in the morning and 3 at night. Gracie-glad your first treatment went well. I hope the side effects stop quickly. Lynne-I eat only a little during \"hell week\". For example, today so far, I've had water, gatorade, a banana, and a yogurt, and it's 1pm. I probably will have an instant breakfast for dinner. I usually lose at least 5 lbs this week. My mouth has thrush (from the 6 days of steroids) and sores, so I have to avoid lots of foods. By the end of the week I will be able to eat again, but won't taste much until next week. I am dizzier than normal this time around. I'm really hoping that gets better quick. I'm home alone now, since the kids moved out. My mother (who's 80) said I should get one of those panic buttons (I've fallen and can't get up). I said I'm not there yet! runor-Wow! You've got a lot of energy! I wish I had half that much! Congrats to your daughter and her new home! Ok, I'm really ticked off. Last Thurs I had chemo, and I asked the nurse if they were doing tumor markers, and she said yes. I called the office for the results, today, and they said they were not drawn. Last time, the drew the wrong one! My tumor markers have been climbing quickly, and the last one was done a month ago?! The girl said that she would let my oncologist know, and maybe I could come in this week. I said that I would not be coming in this week for a blood draw. I can't even stand up for too long, and I'm running the bathroom all week. This is my only week off from that place. I told her they could draw them next Fri, when I see the oncologist. I am having my scans next Wed (a month early), and we'll know if I need to change treatments, but it would have been nice to know if they were still going up!! I'm am so mad! Another hot day here!

Glad you are taking a break to heal. holmes-Your family has been through a lot. I'm sure that what your daughter has seen what the two of you are going through, has made her stronger too. Tanya-Enjoy your time with the grandchildren and the rest of your trip. mae-Love the pics. You are a lucky girl, going to that concert! Minnie-Enjoy your visit with your grandchildren and family. Gracie-My hair fell out 2 weeks after I started Taxotere (still mostly bald, with a little fuzz, after a year on it). I usually wear scarves and bandanas. I have a wig, that I have worn 5 times in the year I have had it. It doesn't look like me. I had waist long hair that I pulled back in a ponytail or braid, so it was hard to match that. This wig is a shade lighter than my hair color, but has bangs (I've only had bangs once, and immediately grew them back out), it's layered and curly (my hair was curly). I feel like Dolly Parton in it. I tried on over 20 wigs, and finally decided on the last one, just to get out of there. I had it thinned out, but it's still puffy. I'll be wearing it to our nephew's wedding next month, but I'm bringing a scarf to the reception, when I can't stand wearing it anymore. It's very hot to wear too. I wish I had more hair, then I'd go without anything. I do wear nothing on my head when I'm at home. Inside or outside, my head is naked. I hope you find a wig that looks like you. Good luck. Glad you are feeling better. Micmel-Glad you had a nice weekend with you DH. Another beauty of a day here, although close to 90. Saturday night we went to a neighbor's. There were 3 couples there. All neighbors. We chatted, drank, and played darts outside, until midnight. We had fun, although my husband was tired (he got up at 4am to go to a golf tournament). We all agreed to go to breakfast the next morning. We met at 9, and went out to eat. The food wad delicious! (Lynne, it was the Black Forest Cafe, yum!). We then went on a trike ride with our friends. We took the trikes to the seacoast. Beautiful day for a ride. We stopped for lobster rolls (well, the other 3 did, I had ice cream, not a fan of seafood). (Lynne, it was the Beach Plum). On the way back from the ocean, it started to sprinkle. That lasted about half an hour, then it downpoured. Yes we got soaked, but the ride was so worth getting wet for. By the time we got home from our friends house (a half hour from us), the sun had mostly dried our clothes. My husband made scallops (the only seafood I eat) for dinner, and they were delicious. A wonder weekend. Wednesday, I have my scans, and Fri, I see the oncologist. I am going to make sure she does the tumor markers this time, whether I changing treatment or staying on this one. They still don't have my labs up on the online chart, from 7/5. I sent a message, and one of the nurses said my oncologist hadn't sign off of them yet. This place is really ticking me off big time! Between the tumor markers screw ups, scheduling messes, and waiting almost 2 weeks for results, I'm really fed up. Well, I suppose I should accomplish something today (laundry mostly). This week is my good week, so off I go! Have a wonderful day everyone! Hugs! Lynne",

Pots-We've been in our house 34 of our 35 years we've been married. Talk about clutter! We have 4 adult children that still have a lot of stuff here as well. The cellar is not finished, so it's packed to the ceiling in places. We also have a two story garage, that we have never put our car in. The bikes, toys, tools, and more crap (besides the motorcycle) reside there. He bought a plastic shed, to put more stuff in too! I don't seem to want to do it. I did go through my clothes once, I need to do it again! Get rid of those Making Strides and Relay for Life shirts (all 26 of them). I may wear one once in awhile, but they are all long sleeve crew necks (I prefer v necks, I feel like I'm suffocating otherwise). I really need to go through the 35 years of photos too. Seperate them for our 4 kids and send the relatives their pics. I don't want to leave it all for him. I know the kids won't help in that. Tanya-So sorry there is new cancer in the bone marrow. Good luck with the Fasolodex (I so hated those shots!) and Zometa today! Mae-Love your green eyes. Our son-in-law has light green eyes. Unfortunately, the two boys didn't get his eyes. Matthew (the 7 year old) has our daughter's dark blue eyes (he looks just like her with the blonde hair too), and Aiden (the 5 1/2 year old) has our son-in-law's father's eyes (he passed shortly after he was born), which are a light blue (with his red hair!). I have blue, as do our 2 daughters. My husband has brown, as do our 2 sons. Muddling-Sorry to hear about your right hand (I hope that you are not right-handed!). I too have neuropathy in my hands and feet. They too hurt at the end of the day. I asked my oncologist how long it takes to go away after stopping Taxotere (it started about 4 months ago), she said she had one woman, who was a bank teller, that it took 2 years, but she was on her feet all day. I hope it goes much sooner than that! I hope your's gets better soon too! It's good to vent, and we don't mind you doing it here! Hugs! Thinking of the rest of you too! Last night, I was going to go in the pool, after dinner. Our son and granddaughter went it and I hung out on the pool deck. We had pizza on the regular deck, and when we finished, all the sudden we could smell a skunk. Needless to say, I didn't get in that 80 degree water. I should have went in earlier with them! I'm talking my husband into going in with me today! Humidity is coming back tonight! BOOOO! It's sunny though. Off to my pain management dr tomorrow. Of course the sciatic is just about gone! Seems like a waste of a co-pay to me! Then off to Dana-Farber in Boston on Thurs. 5pm appointment. Traffic shouldn't be bad either way. We'll miss the workers going home. Enjoy your Tuesday! Hugs!

We had the top down on this 90 degree day,which was fine when we were moving on the highway, when the traffic got bumper to bumper though, way to hot, and put the top up. He put it down as we were leaving, and we got about an hour from home, and saw the lightning, black clouds, and then it started downpouring. He waited until the traffic slowed down to 20 mph (the only time we can put the top up while driving), and finally put it up. We were both soaked. We hit the NH border, a half hour later, and it's sunny. We did see a rainbow when the rain stopped though. Ok, now back to the second opinion. The breast oncologist from Dana-Farber, gave me 3 different chemos that my local oncologist gave me. She thought it was too soon for Gemzar, and the other chemo my local oncologist gave me, they don't even use for breast cancer anymore down there. The first one she suggested was navolbine (I'm sure I'm spelling them wrong, I was just writing them all down as she spoke, haven't looked them up yet!). Only downside, is it's once a week, so all my weeks will be spent there. Second one is CMF, a mixture of 3 drugs, which is once a week for 3 weeks, so I am leaning towards that. There is also a pill Abamcyclile. Of course my local oncologist is only in the office on Fridays. I guess I will have to try to get a hold of her, in the morning. Tomorrow, we are heading out by 10am (or so my husband says), for a 6+ hour car ride to visit our youngest, who moved out 2 months ago, to Rochester NY. His girlfriend is finishing her last semester in college, and is also from there. They are moving into a new apartment this weekend. No furniture moving (it came furnished, and includes everything but cable), just their clothes and stuff. We will be staying at her parent's lake house on one of the finger lakes (about 40 minutes from their apartment). I wouldn't mind so much, but the sciatica has moved to my right leg now. It's not as bad (yet) as the left leg was (that's a lot better), but I don't want this ride to make it that way either. I told my husband that I was putting the seat down, and turning on the heated seat for the ride. They scheduled me for steroid injections the day after Labor DAy (oh yeah, a month away). She did give me a prescription of predisone for 3 a day for 5 days. We'll see if that helps. I'm starting it tomorrow. Hopefully, I can sleep on them. Keetmom-I would get thrush every 3 weeks from the steroids I had to take before and after my last chemo. No fun! I rinsed with bacon soda a lot, and took the prescription liquid (the bacon soda worked better for me). I hope it goes away soon! Lynnwood-I've been seeing my local oncologist for 13 years. I still find it hard to talk to her. She's probably 10-15 years younger than me. If I don't ask her questions, she doesn't offer anything. I think you are looking more into it than you should. She would tell you if there is something wrong. Micmel-Good luck with the shower! Have a great weekend everyone! Lynne  ",

How wonderful to find out you have a \"new\" grandson! So glad you got to meet him. I hope your cold is going away. Mae-You looked perfect in your Halloween costume and make-up! I loved Mimi on the Drew Carey show! Grannax-My mother, sister, and I said we should celebrate our birthdays on our half birthdays. We are all in Dec (and both my grandfathers, a grandmother, aunts, my sister's triplets, and one of my grandsons, as well as friends too). Mom is the 5th, my sister is the 17th (we are the same age for 4 days), and I'm the 21st. June would be nicer and we'd get more than one gift, as kids, from relatives. Not here's your birthday/Christmas present (my husband pulls this all the time!). It really bothered me to have my birthday present wrapped in Christmas paper (my Mom did this until I did it to her, one birthday), and have santa birthday cakes! I may be having a 57 1/2 birthday next June! LOL Lynnwood-I'm glad you got the couple moved in. Sorry you overdid it! Yes times have changed. I didn't move in with my husband until we were married. We both left our parents' homes to our apartment. I moved into it a month before the wedding, he didn't. Of course my 3 younger sisters all moved in with their husbands' before they married. I was the first to marry and am still married to him, and the 3 of them have been married and divorced twice, once, and they youngest is on her 3rd husband. Our only married one (our younger daughter), had her first son before they married. He wanted to marry her before she had him, and she said no, she didn't want him marrying her just because she was pregnant. They got married when he was almost 11 months old. They are still married and have another son too. Our eldest, was with his girlfriend for years when she got pregnant. They did get engaged after their daughter was born, but broke up when she was one. Our older daughter just moved in with live in boyfriend number 5. She was engaged 5 years ago, and he called it off 4 months before the wedding. He thought that they'd be moving into my home together, and not getting their own place. Our youngest moved in with his girlfriend a couple months ago, in NY. First time in 32 years (our eldest's age) we have an empty nest. Of course the 3 older kids and grandkids are here often, but I do have lots of quiet moments. Love it! My first chemo on Thurs, went well. I was there 1/2 hour longer than the past chemo. They gave me iv steroids and an anti-nausea med before hand. It's a combo of 3 drugs. One is an iv, the other 2 are injections through the iv. Headed up to VT, shortly after, and I'm feeling very sweaty. Soaked through my clothes, even though the a/c is on. I never get like that. I took a cool shower once we got there, and changed into my \"moisture wicking\" nightgown. I sweated all night too. Friday I was fine. My appetite has been next to nothing. I have been having diarrhea, once or twice a day. I take my prescription and it stops it though. We had severe thunderstorms on Friday, for the rehearsal for the wedding. We had the BBQ inside, and it worked well. It rained early in the afternoon on Sat, and we were worried we'd have to have the wedding in the tent. It remained cloudy, but the rain cleared, and they were able to have the wedding outside. My nephew had his brother (that lives with our eldest) as his JP. His brother runs a lot of Comicons, and introduced the groom to the \"Rock's\" WWE song. The groom comes running down in his sunglasses, and then the 8 groomsmen lined up next to him (he took of the sunglasses). The bridesmaids came down in the traditional way. The JP had us laughing over antics they got into when they were young (the groom and bride are both the youngest of 5). The couple wrote their own vows (which were comical too). At the reception, the parents and grandparents were introduced in the normal way, then Patrick (JP) once again introduced each of the attendents, comically too. I had bought fake eyelashes (since I have none), my younger daughter (who also styled my wig the week before), did my make-up. Well she went to put the glue on the eyelash, and the glue was all dried up. Instead she put tons of eyeliner and eye shadow on me. I normally only use some mascara and cover-up. She wanted to put foundation, and make my eyebrows dark. I put on the rest of my make up myself. I know one of my friends took my husband and I picture together. I haven't seen it online yet. Here is a picture of our nephew James (and my godson) and his wife Stacy on their wedding day on Saturday though.  ",

I was told to skip my nightly metformin, which I've been doing the week following chemo, due to not being able to eat much from the thrush and mouth sores I get from the steroids they put me on for 7+ days, to prevent another bad reaction that I had with the first treatment. Well yesterday, I got up to get something to eat, and my knees buckled in the kitchen. I landed on my butt and was fine (nobody was home though, I sat therre for awhile), but this is getting old! Even now, I had an instant breakfast, and I'm still a little shaky. So sick of these side effects! It only happens the week after, and I try to eat something. Usually, its yogurt, ice cream, and instant breakfasts though. Anything mushy and not acidic. I should be able to start eating again by the end of the week.

After speaking with the a radiologist (not the one that read the CT scans, he wasn't there), my oncologist decided that I would be staying on Taxotere for another 3 months (then I'll have scans again). I was supposed to have chemo on Tues, and I said to my oncologist, \"I guess there goes my Thanksgiving\" (due to the Thrush and mouth sores I get every time), she said they could change it. I said the check-out person said I had to have it on Tuesday, since I had it on Tues the last time.She said that wasn't true, and I ended up getting it changed to the day after Thanksgiving! Yay!

We went up and down the streets in there and took some pictures. We were gone about an hour. I wore winter gloves and my helmet and still froze. We went in the hot tub, when we got back, and I wore my winter hat, so my bald head didn't freeze (it's outside). I finally warmed up. Hope everyone enjoys the rest of their weekend! Lynne",

Only 3 hours, waited around for lab results this time. We then stopped for a bite on the way home, and when I got home around 2:30, I opened the fridge to get an ice pack. There was a major meltdown happening in there. You guessed it, we went right back out to look for a new fridge. After going to 3 stores, we are getting one delivered tomorrow. All of the food is in coolers on the back deck. We will be bringing the refridgerator stuff back in and leaving it in th cooler so it does freeze out there in the teens tonight. Merry Christmas to us! Not the kind of present I like to get, but it's needed. Exhausted from this long day. Sleep well everyone! Lynne",

It will all begin again when I start my steroids on Tues, and have chemo next Fri. I'm heading north to our timeshare in Laconia this Fri (after my bloodwork/oncologist appointment), for a week. Just to enjoy the quiet. Our grandsons will be up on Sat to use the pools and go down the waterslides. Then we'll ring in the New Year and get to just relax. My husband will commute to work from there (it's about an hour from home). Great pictures Lynnwood and Claudia. I'll try to post a couple of mine. I didn't take any pics, but my older daughter did, and my husband took some. Grannax2-cute kittie. I too have 2 sister cats (almost identical, mostly charcoal grey with some white). We adopted them 2 years ago when they were 1, from the animal shelter, after our last cat passed (she was 17). I was all set with pets, but our youngest (who's 22) was so upset from losing our last cat (he grew up with her), that I caved. Guess who takes care of the cats 99% of the time?? Yup, me! Hope everyone has a great day! Lynne",

He's like you, it's just a hole in the ground, but I still want to see it in person. mel-Beautiful pic of your daughter and her boyfriend! I hope you are feeling better!h Grannx- I get the birthday thing. Mine was the 21st. My sister came home for the hospital on my 1st birthday, she's the 17th. We're Irish twins, same age for 4 days! Always got jipped. \"Here's your birthday/Christmas present\". Happy Belated birthday to you! Lynne-We get up to the lakes region at least once during the summer. We rent a place for a week (it was Newfound for 10 years, my favorite lake. Last year we tried Winni, the place was nice, but the beach wasn't as nice), and bring the 40 yr old boat up. I can still pull tubers. It's not pretty to look at though! Our timeshare is only good for one week (we can even split the week) before Memorial day and after Labor Day (we couldn't afford the year round one 20 years ago). We used to bank it, and go elsewhere, but it still costs us $300 to exchange it, so now we try to go Christmas week, so the grandkids can come up and stay. We can use the pools (and the water slides) anytime though. Another deep freeze day. I'm enjoying my time alone today. My husband will return this evening (commuting to work from here, of course this morning started a mile from home). It's supposed warm up tomorrow, in the 20's. Thursday, depending on the storm track, we will either get a trace or get swamped with snow! I hope it's the latter! If not, I'll be coming home Wed night instead of Thurs night! Stay warm everyone!

Even of 2 of my sisters, I rarely hear from. I stopped complaining to my mother about it, because she will call them up and make them call me. My youngest sister lives in the same neighborhood (not that that matters, my mother lives in the neighborhood too, she calls almost daily), so she'll call me. I know the phone works both ways, but I really don't have anything new to say to anyone, so I usually only call Mom or my kids. We have a couple we've been friends with before we got married that we see every other month, and I have a friend (a neighbor) that I see once a week. She's the only friend that hasn't left (one calls about once a month, and I tell her to come over anytime, she still hasn't, I haven't seen her in about a year). My husband doesn't have many friends (none that currently support him), and I hope that his siblings (he works with one brother, who he's close to, and has a sister and another brother) and my sisters, will give him support after I'm gone. I know our adult kids will be there. We've been together since high school, and have been married 34 years. I'm still in my nightgown, and stayed in bed the past 3 afternoons (dizziness from chemo). Today, I feel a little better. My youngest grandchild and my younger daughter just got here. I hope everyone has a great Thursday! Lynne",

Lynne-Those Pats are giving us a heart attack, most games! Always getting it done in the 4th quarter. My husband goes to bed early, most nights (he's up at 4am), so if it is one of those 8.30 games, he usually only lasts the first quarter, and my daughter and I are yelling in the room below our bedroom. LOL I'm surprised that not all of the New England states are not routing for the home team. All of my friends in different states (some that are originally from NH) are all routing for them. Gronk is my favorite! I hope he's ok for the Super Bowl, at least he gets an extra week to get better. Sounds like you're oncologist is doing the right thing. Mine did the same when I had a cough and the nodules showed up on my scans. Who do you see there? I see Gina Divenuti. I was on Faslodex for 1 1/2 years. Hated those shots. I'm a side sleeper and would be bruised in my hips for weeks. Ibrance I did separately, and it lasted 6 months. I was on Xeloda for 2 and 1/2 years, and the side effects were minimal. Just fatigue (like all of them LOL) and the hand and foot peeling. It's a pill besides, and I would only have to go in once a month for blood work. I know, what happened to our 50 degree day, it only got up to 35! No melting. Today though, the wind is blowing the ice off the trees, maybe there will be some melting. Both of my cars are still encased in ice. They are in the shade all day. Good thing I don't have to go anywhere! MJH-I worked at the Fish Hatchery (and the surrounding area), and stayed in the cabins there. It was the summer between my freshman and sophomore year (1977). It was called the YCC (Youth Conservation Corps). We cleared and maintained hiking trails, feed the fish, painted the state buildings, cooked for the 40 people, it changed weekly what our group (there were 4 of them) would be doing. There were 2 girl cabins, 2 boy cabins, and an adult cabin, as well as the cafeteria/shower/laundry/bathroom building. All the kids were from NH. I lost 10 lbs that summer, and I was only 130 then! I hated football growing up because my father always had it on our only tv. He had every sport on, changing with the seasons. I think I was 12 when they finally got another tv, of course he got the big tv! I started watching after he passed away 13 years ago (I was diagnosed for the first time 4 months after he passed) at 68. I was in the color guard in high school, and marched in all the football games. I loved going to the games, but had no clue on all the calls. I tape all the Pats games, just in case we are not home, but try to catch them all. I've been to 2 preseason games (nice and warm in August) and 2 regular season games, thanks to the free tickets my hubby gets from the plumbing supply people he orders from. You can see much better on tv, but the buzz in the stadium is awesome. Go Pats! Grannax-Sorry about your accident. I hope you are feeling better today. I hope your scans come out great! Leapfrog-Sending prayers your scans came out good! Micmel-Glad you are feeling better. My granddaughter and her father (our eldest) both have the flu. They were both over my house on Sunday for a family dinner (we do it every other week). Ryleigh has these big brown eyes, and boy were they sick looking. We took her temp, and she was 102. We had some children's tylenol, and gave her some. It went down. The only time I was near her was when she hugged me around my waist with her face the opposite direction. Her mother brought her to to dr's the next day, and she has type A (the mildest). My son had gone to urgent care last week and they gave him antibiotics for a sinus infection. Yesterday and today he stayed home from work, and missed his class yesterday. My daughter bought and brought him a thermometer, tylenol, and day and night flu medicine. Typical guy only has kid's medicine. My daughter didn't go in (he took my advice and was taking a cold shower to bring his temp down, he said his head was on fire), and left the bag between the storm and back door. They usually visit on Mon and Wed (when he has her, and also every other weekend, free supper!), but not this week. I just hope nobody in my house gets it. My white cells were down (as they have been the past few times, but come back up a week later for chemo), I certainly don't need it. Of course my husband, my son, and my son-in-law, never get the flu shot. They say it just gives you the flu, or doesn't work. MEN! Gracie-As a kid, I had a bloody nose every in the fall and winter. Finally, when I was 12, I had it cautherized. I never had another one until I got pregnant with number one. I rarely have one now. I can't remember when. Do you have a humidifier going? Have you tried petroleum jelly or neosporin put in your nose with a q-tip (especially at night). I know that helped my boys that got them every day too.What a pain! Hugs and prayers for everyone! It sounds like most of us need them! Lynne",

The other one was navabline (I haven't looked up how to correctly spell them yet, I just wrote down everything while she talked.) That one is once a week, every week. There was also a pill Abamcyclide. She said I'd probably be on all of them eventually. There is a clinical trial, that she says sounds promising, that will come out in a few months, so when this one stops working, she wants me to come back down. I guess I'll be looking up these chemos.

He said he didn't want to catch cancer. I had no idea that this is what he thought. I told him he couldn't catch cancer. Then he gave me the biggest hug. His anxiety got worse. I did send him to a therapist. later on when he was in middle school. It made him worse. When it came back in 2012, again we sat them all down. He again took it the hardest. He was 17, and just laid down on his stomach, on the deck, and wouldn't move for a long time. He cried. They were all shook up because now I was stage 4. I know a lot of people go to a therapist, and send there kids there when they are diagnosed. I think that you just have to be open with them, and let them know what is going on with you. If you notice they are having a hard time, and you can't help them, then yes, I would get them some help. Hugs! funthing, I am 6 years out stage 4.

I have my first scans with it on Monday. I think I will be changing once again. It's too bad because the side effects were very mild. Taxotere was just awful.

Lots of lefts and rights, and then you'r there. Plus we have to find the parking garage.This will be mapping my tumor out to see it's changed and for any trials. I am starting Gemzar next Fri and will be on it until it stops working., then do the HER3 trial, then do Navelbine. Hopefully, something works. I've been feeling pretty lousy for a month. Constant diarrhea (which I have a prescription for), sternum and upper chest pain, coughing quite a bit and hard time sleeping, and I fell on my but (a graceful one). Now my lower back is also hurting. Hubby is back at work tomorrow and Fri. He was at work yesterday too, and after I got myself off the floor by grabbing the frame of my bed and my daughter's walker (she got last year after wiping out and spraining both knees). At first they gave her crutches. She had 3 strokes between 1 1/2 and 2 (found out it was caused by Moya Moya), one stroke left her with a left sided weakness but you can't hold her back , never could, she's now 31. So sick of this disease. 2 months and 2 weeks without chemo. All I can think of is the tumors getting bigger and getting new ones. This is the longest I have gone. It was waiting for all the appointments in Boston. I'm holding out until Thursday, to see if they see anything while they are in there. Happy, Healthy, and Prosperous New Year! Lynne ",

The radiologist called her right after he read the MRI and told him I had tumors on most of my Thoracic vertabraes and there was also a density in my right chest. Yes this is how I found out my breast cancer had returned after 7 yrs. It's also both lungs, mostly my right, only 1 small nodule in the left. I had the kyphoplasty done mid June. It was done outpatient with Ketamine. My right lung had fluid (which I had drained a month ago, and is starting to fill again, UGH!) and they didn't want to use general anesthesia. They told me to turn my head back face down to the table at one point (I turned it to the left), but I didn't have any pain during the surgery. Afterward I did. It lasted a couple of days, but the back pain was better than before the surgery after that. It got a lot better after I had the thoracentisis (lung drain) done. I just finished 2 weeks of radiation a week ago, and my back pain is almost gone. The radiation oncologist said it would get even better after 2 weeks. I hope yours turned out well!",

The side effects on this chemo are so much easier with this one than Taxotere (by far the worst of my 7 different treatments). I'd prefer not to get the Neulasta.

If the Aromosin works, it will shrink the tumors in her lungs, and she will breathe better. The tumors in my lungs shrunk each time, and I now have only scarring where the tumors were. Right now I have a horrible cold (thanks to my son, he's still sick after 2 weeks!) and am having a hard time breathing. I will be calling the doctors tomorrow.

My local oncologist checked with my Boston oncologist, and was told that the measurements are within the margin for error and were ok. It also showed I have a new compression fracture in L5 (the lowest one). I also had an MRI that showed it and am having another kyphoplasty (cement injection) this Friday, wish me luck. At least I know why my back has been killing me for so long. They will also biopsy it to see if it's the cancer or the bones being thinned by the treatment (although, they give me Zometa once a month with the Faslodex). They couldn't tell by the CT or MRI if it was the cancer. If it's the cancer causing it again, I will be switching to a new treatment most likely, aromosin and everolimus (maybe xoleda). Both are pills, so it would be wonderful not to have those awful shots anymore. I'm glad that they have worked for the past year and a half though. Hopefully, it's not the cancer, I would like to stay on each treatment for a long time. That means a longer life. : ) I hope your Mom is doing better. Lynne",

I started on Arimidex afterward, and later tried Aromosin, Femara, and Tamoxifen and had to stopped taking them all together due to the side effects (joint and bone pain, etc), after 3 years. June 2011, I was having severe back pain. I saw my primary, and she did an x-ray. It showed I had a compression fracture to T9. I was sent for an MRI. It showed tumors in my spine and lungs. I had kyphoplasties to repair the fracture and help the compressed vertabrae above and below T9. I had a thoracentisis (drain my lung) because I was having difficulty breathing (so much better afterwards). I was then put on a monthly treatment of 2 shots of Faslodex (an anti-estrogen drug) and a 1/2 hr infusion of Zometa (a bone builder). I have CT/Bone scans every 3 months, and each scan showed more shrinkage of my lung tumors and lymph nodes that were enlarged. The last 2 showed only scarring where my lung tumors were. Last week I went for my latest scans. I get the report/CD sent to me, so I can see how they came out before my appointment. Well it shows that some of the lymph nodes that shrunk have enlarged and also shows new lymph nodes enlarged. I don't know if this means I'll have to change treatment or if they wait till there are actual new tumors first. My appointment is tomorrow morning. The next treatment will be a chemo pill called Xoleda. It doesn't cause hair loss or nausea. It sometimes causes peeling of the fingers and toes though. We'll see what she says in the morning.  I'm sorry that your Mom has to go through this again. The people on here are wonderful though and will give you lots of support.  Saying prayers for you and your family. Lynne",
