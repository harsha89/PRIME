You had asked what I do I work at a local College, in one of the offices.  I really like it there.  It's nice being around so many young people (keep you up with the times)  My son told me that I should go for a blue Mohawk ...Not..I have no ear plugs to go with it (that's a big thing on campus) but I might go with his suggestion of drawing eyes on the back of my head.

If not the American Cancer Society has some wigs that might get you through.  I was surprised at  how I ended up looking after the buzz cut. My hair dresser could be my son,(don't we look so much alike). He was a real sport about everything. He even took the pictures.  MY only advice is put make-up on eye make-up, makes your eyes stand out,  lipstick and blush is a must too.(I never really put make up on before, I went to the look good feel better from the ACS with Geri--Great fun and lots of information...free makeup too!). The other thing is Big earrings.   I did my 2nd  TC today. So I am a little tired.  Good luck! kathy ",

I try and think of the things I am thankful for. It helps some. I have been trying to get rest so I won't be exhausted going into chemo. I also think that some of what we feel is the fear of the unknown. Because we haven't been there yet our minds can make it a lot worse than it might be. Maybe your Drs could give you something to settle you down. Get some rest it really helps. You really want to be in the best shape you can be on Wed.  What part of the country/world are you from.

I finish rads next week, and am so happy about that.  I am 55 years old with 2 children or should I say adults, my youngest just went back to college last week. I miss her. My son works in Ct. Have to get ready for work not that I really want to! So I will check in later. kat ",

Unfortunately the effects of chemo are long lasting, and chemo brain is just one of them. I don't think anyone would wish cancer on themselves or pretend they have it (at least I hope not). Your co-worker may just think that chemo is now called rads. Or she may be misremembering.",
