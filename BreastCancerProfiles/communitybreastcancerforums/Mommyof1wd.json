Recently I have had a light grey to black discharge from my left Brest and I feel as if it is bruised in one spot I cant feel any obvious changes but I also never checked regualarly. Both mother and grandmother had the cancer under the muscle wall that was unable to detect with self examination ( grandmother had double mastectomy) should I be worried about the black discharge? I k ow its strange and not \"normal\" and if the pain continues I will get checked due to history but my husband is in Afghanistan and I have a 2 year old with the closest family member being 10 hours away so it's a tough spot for me right now. My son was breast fed for 13 months exclusively so I have a good idea what should be coming out this is new. Plus he will be three in a few weeks and so I have been \"dried up\" for quite some time now any thoughts would be greatly appreciated its scary and I'm not sure what to think about it. Thank you and sorry for the grammar I am doing this from my phone :) Log in to post a reply",
