He filled 400 on one side, 300 on the rads side.   Used alloderm (he says that allows more to be filled during the initial surgery).  Also, my foob doesn't look good.   I know it's a process, but were you displeased at first and then it got better?   I'm feeling very despondent and wondering if I made a big mistake.    lump/chemo/rads/hyster-ooph/mastectomy/implants Log in to post a reply",
