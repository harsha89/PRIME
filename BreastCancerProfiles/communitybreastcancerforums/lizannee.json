I haven't lost all my hair but it thinned an I shaved it. I have had to take my nausea meds longer this time but I am making it. I am constipated which is painful for me but this is resolving with meds now too. It is 97-100 degrees in Memphis right now and that is really hard with chemo. I have worked from home for two days but I seem to do better if I am around people and not stuck at home alone worrying. I drink 100 ounces of water a day and eat something small and as healthy as I can every two hours. I try not to eat empty calories but a popsicle has hit the spot a couple of times. We can do this ladies! ",
