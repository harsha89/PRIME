I have collected some of the clinical trails which are specific to HER2+ ER-/PR- condition as listed below. My confusion is how to select the better suited one among these. Will genetic profiling of the tissue help in selecting a suitable trail. And is there a way to consult experts in HER2+ breast cancer who can guide me make that decision before coming to US .

      "Content": "fight2s wrote: Hi, My mom was diagnosed with mets to bone, liver and lungs in June 2015 (Initial diagnosis was in June 2012, HER2+ve ER-/PR-, detailed history in signature). She started with docetaxel+Perjeta+Herceptin for six cycles and then moved to Perjeta+Herceptin and then to Kadcyla(TDM1). Genetic testing of the bone mets tissue showed PIK3CA and TP53 mutations. As shown in the studies, HER2 targeted therapies did not work well (probably due to PIK3CA and TP53 mutations) and she was progression free on Perjeta+Herceptin just for 7 months and on Kadcyla for 4 months. Now she switched to Carboplatin (Paraplatin)+ Navelbine (vinorelbine). I'm here requesting help and suggestions on the next course of action. I'm mainly looking for information on what clinical trails are apt for my mom's condition. And by the way, I'm from India and my mom is taking treatment in India where clinical trails are not available. So our oncologist does not have much information on that front. I'm planning to take my mom to US for clinical trails.
