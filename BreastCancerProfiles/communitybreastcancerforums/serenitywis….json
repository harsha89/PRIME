I so far have declined radiation as I am in grey area for needing radiation and did not like idea that radiation increases risk of lympadema  10-15% above the other risk factors I already have.  Hope this info is helpful. ",

By the way I learned the hard way about being very careful with insect bites . Last Thursday night,  I got a tick bite near where the axillary node dissection was done,   My upper  arm swelled up hugely within 2 hours after the tick was removed.  Got very red, hot, bullseye, looked like classic lyme disease.  When I saw the internist day after the tick bit me, he asked me where my surgery was.  Reaction was so bad he said I  would have to get admitted to hospital if I got any worse.  Happily the antibiotics are working and it has now been been 6 days and arm is slowly returning to normal.  I am sure this is because of the axillary nodes being removed.  We think of lymphadema being caused by blood draws, blood pressure, etc  but injuries including insect bites can do  it too. ",
