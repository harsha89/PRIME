Hubby can't be there because he just started a new job. I'm ok with it though. The last one he went to with me, he wasn't allowed in the room with me, the tech and the radiologist. He had to wait it out alone in the waiting room. At that time, I wasn't having any symptoms. They were just looking at the abnormal stuff that we were doing the watch and wait on. This time I really think it would be much too hard for him to sit there and do nothing. I have to say that I think watch and wait is just stupid. Wish I had known then what I have learned to this point. I just really didn't know that I had the option to say NO. Do something with this now. But that's not productive now. Regret is a useless emotion. It gets me no where but mad.",

Actually, now that I've been on this site for a couple weeks, I realize that the Mammo/Us won't necessarily give me much in the way of answers. But, I'm praying that what is there can be seen clear enough to have an accurate idea. Well, we know that neither are necessarily accurate but here's to holding on to hope. I'm praying that the VA makes this process easy and not more difficult than it already is or than they already have. What I have learned from all of you wonderful people and especially my new friend, Cindy, has been a gift from God. I can't thank you all enough for the education and inspiration I have received. I have so many things running through my mind that I want to get out but everything seems to be a garbled mess inside my head. Well, it's the afternoon before and I really can't believe that I've made it this far without completely losing my mind. I thank God for that sense of peace and for directing me to this website, you wonderful people and again, my new friend Cindy. Last night, I tried to help my hubby clean up the kitchen after dinner. But, when I went to put something in the frig the pain shot through my armpit to my breast so bad that I just leaned on the door and cried. I just couldn't hold it in anymore. It's the first time I have cried about this in front of my hubby. I've been trying not to be too emotional about it because he seems to think that our predicament is some how his fault. But, of course, it's not. I have to say, he really handled me well. Just took me in his arms and hugged me softly telling me how sorry he was that I hurt so bad. That was nice. I'm going to be praying for more of God's peace to get me through tonight and the appointment tomorrow and the days to come. Log in to post a reply",

People cope differently, some are frozen in their shoes and some stick their head in the sand. My mother has BC but sticks her head in the sand. She chooses to not know ANYTHING about her own treatment or progress. Right now, I need her to talk to me about all of it but no, nada, nothing. My husband doesn't say much but he is a doer and a fixer. His way is to take care of me and let me rest. As for me, I'm a researcher by nature. I need to know everything.

      "Content": "Aug 1, 2012 09:44AM MILCHICK wrote: I hope that you are not going to a military medical facility for your mammo. My experience with them has been worse than horrible - down right unforgivable. But, hopefully your experience will be much different - better. I will be praying for you. If I were you... I would try to get a sooner appt for the mammo. I would demand to have a biopsy done regardless of the mammo findings because that is the only way to know FOR SURE. My story: In 2010, I was transferred to Norfolk (I was in the Navy then). I was scheduled for my annual mammo and went to my appt as normal. A week or two later, my husband found a letter to me in our mailbox stating that there were suspicious areas on my left breast and that I should call and make an appt for a diagnostic mammo and ultrasound. This letter was from a private company that did the mammogram reading, kind of like what you get after you have your annual pap smear. My husband called me immediately and read me the letter. He was still at the old place preparing for the mil movers to come pack up and move our stuff. I got off the phone with him and t just went over there because I tried to call the mammo place but only got voicemail (it was a mil facility so i just went over there because it was close by). The lady who had done the first mammo looked me up in the system and said that I had apparently already called and made my appt because I had an appt schedule for that afternoon. I told her I had done no such thing and had no idea about the appt. so she gave me all the info(when, where, doctors name, etc). Then she verified my contact info, ALL OF IT WAS WRONG! In fact, it had all been changed to my commands address as my home address. My home and cell numbers were changed to the commands duty phone as well as listing a work number for me at the command (I did not have a work number in reality). So, apparently, the command made the appointment and did not tell me. I had and still have some serious medical problems which required that I be transferred to Norfolk for treatment. I was promised quality medical care in Norfolk. IMy husband and I were promised that they would take good care of me since my husband was not allowed to transfer with me. (he was active duty then). BUT, when I got to Norfolk, they started trying to convince me that it was in my best interest that I sign a form that \"against medical advice, I would like to get out of my contract.\" I refused to sign it because I would be out of work and injured/I'll with no way to earn a living. And, in reality, they were supposed to take good care of me - they had promised they would. Then their head games began in full force. So, it is most likely that the command had seen on medical record (electronic) that my mammo was bad. I had been warned that missing any medical appointment for any reason would Result in my being admin sep'd without any benefits. I assured them that I would never miss an appointment. So, it is my belief that they changed my personal contact info so that I would not be notified and would therefore miss the mammo appt resulting in discharge. They did not think far enough ahead because at the first mammo I had to fill out a separate form for the diagnostic company to send me results directly, like I said before, just like with a pap. Anyway, I made it to the 2nd mammo/ultrasound appt on time. But was treated with utter disregard. The tech took several view on mammo. Then left. Came back and did several more. Left again. Came back and said a few more and then to ultrasound. She did the additional views and then came back and told me to get dressed and leave. That was it. I was confused. I asked about the ultrasound and she said that they decided not to do it. They decided that the problem area was just a swollen lymph node near my nipple. No reason given for why it would be swollen. No reason for the fact that that breast was almost twice the size as the other. I never received any additional reports about anything. Nothing. Nada. Zip. Zilch. I was mortified and very scared. BTW: I never did receive any medical treatment in Norfolk. I was medically dischaRged15 months later. I was told that I would not receive anymore medical care as long as I was on active duty even though I was supposed to have a hip replacement amoung other things. It's all very sad. Knowing what I know now and currently at 6.5 months post-op, I wish I had stood up for myself and demanded the medical care that I was promised and that I deserved. However, I was too scared to fight them alone and I was very alone. God bless you. I will be praying that you receive that quality care you have earned and deserve.",

Getting conflicting news just leaves us in more of a hurricane of emotions than we even had to begin with because in one aspect you feel like you have an answer and yet at the same time, you don't. I hope that you can find a way to sleep and find some comfort. I know that is difficult if not impossible. I would think that tomorrow, they will be able to shed a little more light on the confusing info. Just keep reminding yourself that there is a plan and the next step is to take it out. There is some relief in that. Certainly not what you were expecting or hoping but you do what you can with what you have. I am so sorry. This is all the most difficult and impossible feeling of situations. I am and will continue to pray for you.  God Bless you. As for me, it was a fruitless day. The general surgeon I saw today was pretty much useless. He gave me a breast exam. He couldn't feel the lumps nor the swollen lymph nodes that he knows are there as they showed up on ultrasound. He said that since it hurts, its not cancer. (How many times have we seen that situation on this site). He then told me to take Motrin. He offered to use ultrasound to find the lump and try to drain it but then said that he would not send it for pathology because most of the time it comes back b9 anyway so it would be a waste of money. So, he would just throw it away. I opted not to do that because I would want to know the pathology of whatever the thing is. I don't want to assume and play guessing games. He wants me to wait 6 more months and then look at it again. He said that it would be fine to wait since cancer grows slow anyway but he didnt think it was cancer. I asked to be referred to the VA breast clinic in Tampa. He said he didn't even know that there was such a place (he is a surgeon who works for the VA and has seen many patients with breast cancer and yet has never heard of the breast clinic). He then told me that he could not refer me there because he didn't know how to do it. He said that I could call back every Friday to see if they had figured out how to make that referral. I ask for a breast MRI because I have 75% density in my breasts. He said no because the VA doesn't consider breast density a valid reason to spend so much money on an MRI and that they follow the ACS guidelines for use of MRI and besides, MRIs always pick up a lot of things and they end up doing biopsies needlessly.  Thankfully, I met a lady on this site who was a patient at the breast clinic in Tampa. She has been a huge help - probably, my saving grace. She has given me the names and numbers of who to talk to there to ensure that I receive proper care and treatment in the future. I am calling them first thing in the morning. Thank you to all of you wonderfully supportive women who have helped and encouraged me, who have listened to me vent my anger and frustration without a single word of criticism. I care about you all deeply.  Praying for all of you nightly. May God bless you and keep you in His loving arms.",

I love it. You can adjust volume, combine different sounds like rain, ocean, babbling brook, crickets, wind, as well as different music, with all items individual volume adjustments. I find it very soothing. Just do your best to cope. I will continue to pray for you. Love and hugs,",

After the reread, I realize that the reason I didn't notice is because, I feel very much like she does (as far as I can tell by her post), the universal healthcare may be very much like military healthcare which is HORRIBLE at best and incompetent and inept at worst. Hmmm, well, she really didn't say all that, I just inferred it and then embellished with my own slanted/tainted view. I feel just horrible for anyone without insurance and for those who may have to use the coming universal plan - just too many unknowns about it. But if it's anything like military healthcare, no one is going to like it. Imagine, with every illness, you are told too suck it up and take 800 mg motrin - that's the military solution for all ailments. So much so, that it's become a common joke. But, it's far from funny. In my personal opinion, the best thing for veterans would be to cover us on Tricare insurance which would allow us to go to the doctors of our choosing. Instead of being stuck with VA doctors which at this point I am very displeased with. Just my opinion. PS I like your Dad already. Thank you to him and your family for their service because if the member serves the family serves by default.",

So, my boobs are 26 years old (so to speak) but the rest of me is about 190 in military years (calculated similar to dog years). Kayb, that's great about the proposed legislation. I hope that works out. However, about that wink...and political reference... I do not find it to be a winking, smiling, laughing matter. When I signed up for the military, I was told that I would have free healthcare for life. It's a contract - a promise that our government made to us, if only we would lay down our life and health to protect our citizens. You are one of those people that I, like many others, have/had been protecting without regard or allowance for our own health and safety. I kept my promise. They need to keep theirs. So many physical things wrong with me now due to military service that it's incomprehensible. And now, they are finding that many women who served in OEF/OIF (Iraq/Afghanistan) AOR are being diagnosed with breast cancer - much more than the civilian population. This finding has prompted investigation and study. So, to me this is very personal.",

In my opinion, which means nothing to anyone but me, the advances in medical technology and medicine in general as well as the fact that more women are getting involved in their healthcare and knowing what is going on with their bodies is what is bringing this information to the forefront. In my mother's generation, you just didn't question doctors. AND your medical records were the doctors property and they did not have to share their notes with their patients. Very few states require the radiologists to inform their patients as to their breast density percentage but, that is changing! I personally don't believe that breast density has anything to do with food. I lean more to believing that it is genetic.",

I received a BIRADS - 0, indicating needs further eval/testing. I've been on the \"6 month watch and wait cycle\" for a couple years for some suspicious areas. But this last mammo came back clear. The ultrasound could not find the areas they had been watching before but picked up another area of concern as well as a swollen lymph node in my armpit where I was having pain. I spoke with my doctor this past Friday afternoon/evening. He said he would refer me to a general surgeon. Well, this morning I got the call from the surgeon's office. They are working me in tomorrow morning at 10:30 and will do a biopsy in the office if they can feel the lump and lymph node. If not, then it will be scheduled at a local hospital. WOW! I have to say that I am blown away by how quickly they are getting me in. I was prepared to argue and fight for an appointment but I didn't have to. Kind of takes my breath away. Don't know what to do with myself now. I'm just in shock. I will keep you posted if I can remember to do so. My memory has been crappy for a while now. I'm only 46 but feel like I'm about 190. I always say that it feels like early altzheimers but maybe it's just stress. I will continue to pray for you. Love and hugs,",

I'm praying for you that it's nothing serious. I've been having a lot of breast issues lately and yesterday, my nipple discharge changed from clear to bloody from one duct and another duct has a dark blue green discharge. Of course, I've been goggling like a mad woman since. What I have found is that a papiloma can cause a bloody discharge. I haven't had a biopsy so I can't comment on that. I have several new friends on here who are also having biopsies this week so I will add you to my list for prayers and check in on you to see how things went. I am glad you've gotten the ball rolling and will know very soon what you are dealing with. Love and hugs,",

I'm actually mad that they told you that an MRI would be pointless. From what I've read, an MRI seems to be the next step for women whose breasts are so dense. If you are allowed the PBMX, the MRI really does become a moot point. However, if things go the other way, please push for an MRI rather than just watch and wait some more. I will be praying for you.
