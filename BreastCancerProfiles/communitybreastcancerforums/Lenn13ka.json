My PCP hooked me up with a great LE therapist. It took 3 months of treatment plus lots of compression garments. Assets or underarmor- wore them for work. It started with tingling and pain on my side and back. Keep going until someone helps you. Most PT's don't know anything about this (and neither did my radiologist and Oncologist!)",

I also keep a local MGH MO that works with my DF MO.  I feel like I have the best of both worlds.  I think having Dana Farber read you pathology is key. It was SO different from my local hospital and it really ended up determining my treatment course, saving me from chemo.  Definitely having a breast surgeon specialist is a must but you may find one in one of the satellites and not have to go into town. I think it all depends on what type of surgery you end up having as well. Take your time and get a team that works for you. ( maybe you won't need one) Good luck I ",

I got one opinion outside of my facility (I am MGH so I got one at Dana Farber). I had a split decision at MGH and the no vote from Dana was the deciding factor. They are one of the tops in the country and I saw one of their best Dr.s for my second opinion. Get as many opinions as you need to feel comfortable with your decision. Are you satisfied with your Doctors? Do you trust them? Are all your opinions from the same hospital? You are right. This is a discussion that many 1-3 positive node patients with low oncotypes are having as new research is showing that there is not much difference between node negative  and node positive  as far as benefit from chemo. Mine was 1-2%. You can find graphs on the internet if you punch in postive node/low oncotype. Usually something from Genomic Health will come up ( or it may be on your Oncotype dx report -did your Dr. go over it with you?) You are not alone. A lot of us have to make this decision. Take all the time you need.",
