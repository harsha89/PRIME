I kept calling the radiological facility over and over for two days stating my breast is swollen, black and blue and in great pain but they brushed me off stating it's common to bruise. They never put on ice, they never wrapped me for compression and treated me for pain or infection. I went into emergency at the hospital unable to feel my left arm and could not breath without chest pain two days later. I'm still in extreme chest pain , out if work on disability and my life is changed completely almost three months after. I returned to that radiological office and the head surgeon stated there's no connection between their biopsy and my condition or hospitalization...Really ??? I never had a health problem in my life but preventative medicine to ensure I'm healthy ironically was done with incompetence and today I do have health problems and daily pain with no signs of improving. How did this happen to me? I was the healthiest most active athletic person any of my friends ever met. I started a new job, new insurance, new doctor. This doctor read my family history with member who had cancer she rushed me based on their conditions and not my own. Lesson learned, only allow treatment for your existing conditons and not relatives health conditions.",
