Are there tests for the doctors to do that insure that the port has been placed correctly before use?  We are so confused at this point. ",

There are cases of the cath going through the vein and perhaps nicking the artery.  We are still gathering information and mothers  port-a cath will be removed sometime this coming week.  She is on blood thinners so must wait until they have been stopped and cleared of her system. Thank You for you input.  What a lovely group of caring people.",
