Some of the others girls said to bring jolly ranchers ...something for dry mouth and sore throat. I just kept drinking water and ginger ale. Do you have anyone else at home that is helping you?

But other than that all is well. Still haven't made the app.with the oncologist either..just can't for some reason.  Swimmom2..I have the same..was pretty worried too because its a sign of ibc...but the doctor wasn't concerned. On my left side the scar is black with a dime size brown discolored part..dr. said it was from lack of oxygen during surgery. Have you heard of this?

Mine are black and I had a ton of brusing, the doctor won't take sutures or give me a fill. He said I was healing fine.  I also had a fill of 250 cc at surgery. Is that a lot? Not going to see my onco till jan 20. Everyone seems to know their stage and grade and cell... none of my doctors have told me. I feel stupid. I had 2 carsonomas both about 1.9 cm in my cancer side and 4 adenomas all over 2cm on my noncancer side. Nodes and margins were clear. I definitly have the iron bra feeling and my ribs are super sore. Can't look over shoulder either for driving cause my sternum hurts to the point of tears . My arm pits feel like I am holding tennis balls in them, can't tell if I am swollen because in the past 6 months I have put on 30lbs and look like a cow with no boobs.

You must feel a little relief!  So many of you are returning to work and I am shocked, tomorrow will be week 4 since my bmx w/ tes and I am positive I would not be able to perform even light duty. My driving isn't even up to par yet, lol . I am having extreme tightness in my chest , just above my insisions , especially in the evening. And to complicate , I have started my daily sneezing! OMG!   There is no coming back from the sneeze. If I was normal and would only sneeze 1 or 2 times I would be ok...but around the 5th or 6th time in a row , I am crying.  Was thinking I might do some bra shopping at the walmart tomorrow, was online today looking and they are in store so might as well get out while the roads are plowed! My ps is sending me to a cancer bra place next week, for a rx bra...I will let y'all know about it when I get the info. Bless y'all ! Love and prayers   jeni",
