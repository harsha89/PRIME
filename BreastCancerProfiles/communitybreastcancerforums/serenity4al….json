Secondly, there does not seem to be anything typical, when it comes to differentiating between cancer and benign tumors, based on external characteristics. However, if the lump is really in your armpit, and not your breast, chances are, it is either a lymph node ( adenopathy), a cyst, or a lipoma. The last two are benign, but a possible enlarged lymph node deserves investigation. If you cannot speed up your appointment with the breast center, maybe you can see a regular, general physician in the mean time, so a likely diagnosis could be made, based at least on physical exam. Make sure to follow any changes ( in size, mobility, sensitivity, etc) in the lump by regularly inspecting it, so you can report to your doctors, since this may be helpful clues for diagnosis. It sounds you have been followed quite adequately , so far, preventively, by the breast center. That's reassuring in itself. Let's take one day at a time for now. I wish you the best.",
