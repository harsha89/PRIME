Has anyone else had 2 planning sessions?  I'm working myself into a panic, thinking that they saw something on the CAT scan they did at the first session......Thanks.",

It would have been nice if my doc had told me about the 2 sessions in advance.   I've  gotten almost no information from the radiation team I'm using.....seems to be very rushed & disorganized.....so I'm feeling my way through as I go.  I had chemo at the same hospital and had a great experience with that group.....go figure.  So thanks for the reassurance....I feel much better now.  I hope the rest of your treatments go well.",

I was so wrong! I am doing OK with the \"normal\" side effects....skin is holding up and fatigue is manageable. My problem is that I have been an emotional wreck since about half way through rads.  I feel emotionally unstable & cry alot.  On antidepressents and seeing a counsellor but it hasn't helped much yet.  Also I generally feel like my brain has turned to mush.....I don't remember anything and can't deal well with details.  I went back to work this week after 6 months off and spent a lot of time crying in the ladies room....my job is very detail oriented and I don't think I can handle it. Also, about 3 hours after my tx, I feel zonked, like someone has hit my brain with a stun gun and I can't think at all.  And even though I am tired, I am not really sleeping well at night.  Has anyone else had these problems and how long do they last?  It would be helpful to know I'm not alone.

It really helps a lot to know that I'm not alone in what I'm feeling.  Thanks also for the good suggestions.  I will talk to my doc this week about upping or switching the meds. Can't do much about work, although I'm trying to work out a reduced schedule for the next few weeks with my boss.  Looking forward to getting this whole thing over with and starting to feel like myself again.  Thanks again!!!

I have been an emotional wreck since I started radiation, and I thought there was something wrong with me. I sailed through surgery and DD ACT chemo....figured I was on the home stretch when rads started, but I was so wrong.  Emotionally , this has been the most challenging time for me so far.   I think there are a few reasons.  Mainly, I was so terrified of chemo, I really geared myself up for it, and was able to power through.  By the time I got to rads, I thought it would be a breeze in comparison, so I let my defenses down in a way.  Mistake!  Also, I loved my BS and medical onc....the chemo treatment center was wonderful and the whole staff made the experience easier.  For rads I'm going to the hospital every day -- hate it -- my RO has zero bedside manner and its hard to connect with the techs.  I feel like a piece of meat being radiated. Last but not least, my disability ran out & I had to return to work this week, even though I'm feeling lousy.  And here's the real kicker.....I will finish rads on Monday, can chill out on Tuesday, and then I need to have a biopsy of my thyroid gland on Wednesday.  So after all this, I possibly have more cancer treatment ahead of me.  Where does it end?  Sorry about the rant and thanks for listening.  Your posts were all so helpful to me.
