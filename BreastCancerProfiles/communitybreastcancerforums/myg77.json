So my doc told me to have an diagnostic mammo because I already had abnormal mammo last year then biopsied(it was multiple papilloma), also my mom had a breast cancer when she was 40, then I have aunt and uncle died from pancreatic and gastric cancer(inheritable cancer gene). My doc told me that I'm at high risk even thou I haven't had a genetic testing. So I had diagnostic mammo then ultrasound, then radiologist wasn't comfortable with both results due to my very dense breast and also another abnormal findings(doc said it'd probably another papilloma and also some oval tissue that she's not sure about), so she suggested me to have a breast MRI to see if the area is active or not. If it's active, then have a biopsy and so on. Then the day of my MRI appointment, I was still waiting for pre-authorization from my ins. Then while I was waiting for a certainly approval of pre-authorization MRI from my ins, my doc called to say that she had talked to my ins company and agreed that I don't need to have a MRI because I'm not at a high risk. Hmmm..... I thought you're the one told me that I needed to have a genetic testing and you told me that I'm at a high risk? Why you changed your mind of me.... or have you ever really read a report from my radiologist saying that this is my second time having an abnormal findings? I'm 34, getting close to my mom's age when she had a breast cancer, and all my doc I have seen agree that I should start screening for breast cancer much before 40 so that's why I have been doing... then denial happen. I don't know what should I do for next.... If anyone has any advice or opinion, it's great help if you can tell me. I am not too anxious, but I am certainly concerned of my situation and condition.

Seems like they are trying to talk to my insurance company to review my medical history and hopefully get my MRI done. Yet like many women going thru with this situation, it can take a long time to get pre-authorization. Anyway, I found out that medical reviewer from insurance company was actually a hematologist, not sure if he knows well in breast cancer or related field. Nowadays I feel some pains from my right breast(which has ongoing multiple papilloma) and I feel very sick of waiting.... waiting for their answer...",
