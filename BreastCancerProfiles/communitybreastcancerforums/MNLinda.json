Also worth checking out is a book by Samantha King called \"Pink Ribbons Inc.: Breast Cancer and the Politics of Philanthropy,\" which examines corporate motives for branding their products with pink.  More info at http://www.upress.umn.edu/Books/K/king_pink.html. I tend to find the pink ribbons sort of ominous and distressing.  And I also don't particularly like being given credit for courage in getting through treatment.  My own take is that cancer treatment doesn't take any courage - all it takes is not having any choice.",

The pain has subsided considerably now, but I still have some redness and a thickening of the tissue over my collarbone, where the catheter entered the vein.  Now it feels a little itchy from time to time.  My oncologist didn't really know why it became painful, but thought it was just an irritation of the tube against the bone.  If you can convince them to go under the clavicle instead of over, I'd go that way.  In spite of a less-than-ideal experience, I still think a port is the way to go.  As others have reported, it's less painful than having the chemo nurse search for a vein, leaves less room for error with an improperly placed IV, and allows you full use of your hands during the treatment.  Mine was very visible, as I'm not very fleshy.  It protruded maybe 3/4 of an inch, and looked like a gigantic mosquito bite.  I found the initial surgery a bit painful, but not awful.  I would liken it to having a sliver in your finger - the pain is out of proportion to the size of the break in the skin, because your body doesn't like having something foreign inserted under the skin.  That sensation lasts a few days to a week, then your body adjusts and the pain goes away.  I never had any problem with brastrap irritation. Good luck, I hope it goes well for you.",

If you can't find 100% gel, look for one that has no alcohol or menthol.  Both those ingredients make your skin feel cool, which seems like a plus when you first put it on, but they ultimately dry your skin and make it worse.  Target has a store brand (Up & Up) with no alcohol or menthol, and I think Banana Boat makes one that most drug stores should have.",

In early stage cancers, though, it\u2019s harder to tell \u2013 if your value is around 200 or under, it may not move a lot, and even people who don\u2019t have cancer may have a similar number. It would be so nice if the blood test really told the whole story. Redbarb, for me the hair loss started on day 15 after the first chemo, and by day 18 it was no longer presentable, had to start in on the scarves and hats. It goes pretty quick once it starts to fall. There is a web site called France Luxe that has some great scarves, and they have a program called Good Wishes that provides a free scarf to anyone suffering hair loss for medical reasons. Look up www.franceluxe.com and look for the Good Wishes logo in the upper right hand corner. The owner\u2019s name is Laurie Erickson, and if you call you\u2019ll probably talk to her personally. She is such a lovely person for doing this. I love my France Luxe scarf, and it came with a card signed by all the staff members. Can\u2019t tell you how touched I was. Paxton, I ate a lot of high-iron cereal when I became anemic. Grape Nuts and Total are good. Iron pills can cause constipation, which is also a problem with the anti-nausea meds, but I didn't have constipation from the cereal. If you do go with pills, ferrous fumarate is supposed to be easier to digest. Don't worry too much about the weight - I finished the chemo in January, and I'm now down around 17 pounds from peak weight, without any particular effort. I dropped about eight pounds in the first three weeks after getting off the steroids. That much was probably just water weight.",

I had my first treatment on a Monday, and had a lot of dizziness the following Saturday, Sunday and Monday.  On Sunday I really thought I was going to faint, so I went to urgent care and found out my blood pressure had dropped to something like 92/58.  My onc told me it was due to the abrupt withdrawal from the Decadron.  It may be possible to taper off  more gradually next time if you are not having problems with nausea. I read a little about the Taxotere causing permanent hair loss - I had Taxotere, so I was a little worried about that - but it seemed to me from what I read that those affected often had recurrent or metastatic cancers, and the dose can be higher for these patients.  My understanding is that early stage breast cancer is usually 75 mg per treatment, but it can be up to 100mg for recurrent or metastatic.  (Disclaimer - I have no statistical evidence to support this theory!  It's just a theory.)  The number that seems to be quoted a lot is as many as six percent may have a permanent hair loss problem, but patient groups are not broken out by what dosage they received. I really feel for the women who have been affected.  It seems to me we all think, when we are first diagnosed, that anything is acceptable as long as we don't die.  But then if we are fortunate and the danger of dying recedes, we realize that BC leaves us all with losses, and some are harder to take than others. It's certainly legitimate to ask your onc about the issue, and find out what your dosage is. I finished chemo in January, and my hair is about an inch and half now.  It doesn't seem to be growing very fast, but it's thick.",

I had periods after the first and second treatments, nothing since.  Most chemo drugs are pretty effective at shutting your ovaries down completely within a few treatments.",
