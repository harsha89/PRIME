Like Mindy, I am mutilated to the point that it is hard to cover up the area.  My mass was large and at \"eleven o'clock\".  When my TE was removed, I had not only a concave breast but five large cuts under my left armpit and one very large cut very high that is hard to hide since it is higher than my armpit across my chest.   Thanks for the suggestion on massage, it hurts to do it but as they say \"no pain no gain\". Any suggestions of additinal remedies for scarring would be appreciated. Love to all of my fellow survivors...keep on fightin the good fight. xoxo",

She indeed risked her job to save YOUR life.  My primary care doc found my lump.  I also had very dense breasts and thought for a moment that my doc was being a pervert when doing my breast exam and had his tongue hanging out when he felt the large mass which I thought was a muscle.  Today at a visit, I told him that he saved my life and thanked him. I look back now and realize that he was in deep concentration when he felt the mass under his fingers.  He had given me a referral in Feb to have my mamm but I proscratinated until he told me to get it done. I actually cancelled one appt to go to the beach and rescheduled one day later.  When I had the mamm, they immediately sent me to a dark room with a doc to review the xray and the doc very frankly told me it did not look good and sent me for an immediate biopsy. I read your post about the funky sensations you are having and I agree with my surviving sisters that it is all normal.  As I was told when i posted a similar question, your nerves and muscles were cut off and your body is responding with many different uncomfortable and painful sensations.  I am approx 10 weeks post surgery and have stabbing, stangling and fiery sensations often.  Today my smoke detector went off when I turned on the heat for the first time this season and I stretched far while standing on a chair to remove the battery.  At that time, I had the feeling that my armpit was on fire and it still hurts.  It does get better in time but I find that I go backwards now and then but that is normal.  New pain occurs as the nerves are regaining feeling.   And you talked about patience in another post, I can talk about that (or lack thereof).  I had to have my left TE removed on 9/9 due to a bacterial infection. I switched PS's as mine told me that I had to wait three months to get it replaced.  He was on his way to getting \"fired\" anyway for lack of compassion and other reasons but that was icing on the cake.  Well my new doc, whom I just love, told me the same thing, three months.  So I have to wait and it is not easy.  I did not realize how much I loved both TE's until I lost one.. It was as if he took away one of my babies!! LOL.  Keep us posted! This IS indeed a great outlet and source of info for us.  I wish I had found this site before my BMX.  Take care everyone! xoxo",

And never think we will tire of you. Your timeline is quite fast as compared to mine.  I would say it is a good thing that you have an \"in\". Like you, I want to move super fast. My main issue is insurance, mine is changing on 1/1/11 and in a very bad way.   Be careful how much info you read on the net.  I had a fright with my bonescan.  I read it myself, then googled the dark spot near my pelvis and was sure that I had bone cancer (so wrong I was, for a day).  I will be celebrating my 50th bday.  I go back to surgery on 11/5 to get my left t/e back in and also having lat flap. Long story, infections hit me. Anyway, I am sorry you are at this stage for your birthday but you will get through this, I can tell that you are a strong woman (as most of us are).  And from my point of view, having breast cancer has changed my life, in a good way and it will also change yours, you will see if you have not already.  Keep us posted.  Big cyber hug to ya!! Peace and love to you and all my friends here ♥",

I have Elita's now but they do not have the inside padding which I need to stuff them.  I have used forms, foam and pantyhose, yes panty hose.  I find that I am able to use a full leg of the hose on my concave side (had expander removed due to infection) and a smaller piece for the side I have the unfilled expander.  With the padding, they look very nice and I find them more comfortable that the alternatives.  Peace and love to all of you!!
