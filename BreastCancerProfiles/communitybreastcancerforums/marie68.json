I took my 2nd steroid (dexamethasone) with food the day before at 4 pm and then didn't eat after that until late the morning of the day after chemo. I have heard some nurses say first session indicates future side effects but others, including onco doc, say there is no guarantee and that you could get new side effects at any time. I hope it works out to be the case for your wife that the side effects are minimal throughout chemo!",

I'm also a mom (3 boys 10, 14 & 14). I hope you can get lots of help from your community. I also had \"burn\" marks (red streaks) at iv sites the first 2 times which appeared a week after the infusion and for the 3rd time my nurse tried diluting the taxotere and using a vein in the bottom of my arm (which are thicker veins). So far so good. An onco nurse also recommended udderly smooth cream for taxotere related rashes/burns and it does seem to help (plus tons of other moisturizer). I assume you're taking clariton for the bone pain from the neulasta shot? I needed it much longer than the nurse originally suggested and have just started taking it the whole time I'm on chemo. What kind of chemo are you doing? ",

I opted to skip Neulasta for round #2 because my neutrophils & WBC were so high the day ahead (>10 for both) from the first shot and onco supported that choice.

I've read that it's definitely recommended for those over 65 or anyone w/ additional major health issues. More hair loss - yes and I do worry my eye brows & lashes are going to go :( It's definitely a drag to have weepy eyes all day and I worry about damage to the duct and skin around eyes. Sounds like the effect can be dry or water eyes with both related to a duct impact. Apparently there are some drops you can use -- I will let you know if I get some & they help!",

By the way, I did take my steroid (dexamethasone) with food (4 pm the day before and noon the day after) since I've been told it is hard on the stomach. I'm interested in the fasting as a way to make chemo more effective (see Valter Longo's research) as well as to minimize side effects; however, if I were convinced it helped kill more cancer cells & protected healthy cells, I'd do it even if it made side effects worse!",

It's hard to be out and about when your head is screaming \"I have cancer!\" all the time. My kids have gotten used to seeing me bald once in a while and it doesn't seem to bother them, in fact they like touching my head, which makes me feel better. I don't like feeling like I'm hiding from the world, but I kind of am laying low during treatment. I totally get what you mean that hair loss means you can't hide from or deny the fact you have cancer any longer. I like what someone above said about giving yourself permission to grieve and also looking at it as one more step on the journey. Neuropathy anyone? Glutamine supplement takers? I just started feeling some numbness in my feet and have started taking glutamine as directed by my naturopath. I think I'm also seeing signs of the cuticles being affected :( I finished my 3rd (of 4) rounds of CT last Tuesday and had hoped to avoid this side effect since it hadn't happened the first 2 times.",

Maggie2 - just want to weigh in on nausea & bone pain prevention protocols. My nurse recommended keeping ahead of it w/ scheduled taking of odansetron (zofran) during the day and promethazine (phenergan) at night (since it has a slight sedative) and I followed that and did well w/ limiting nausea 1st & 2nd rounds. 3rd round I fasted ahead of treatment (~18 hrs) and after (~24 hrs) and needed much less nausea meds (but of course fasting isn't recommended for everyone and some docs don't support it at all -- my onco supports a 12 hr fast ahead of treatment to limit inflammation; others claim it helps with nausea and this was my experience). Like you I requested pain meds (and they gave me oxycodone) expecting more of the terrible bone pain associated w/ neulasta the 1st round but I didn't need it at all and this could be because I just started taking Claritan everyday and will continue through my last round. It will be good to have it on hand for the headaches and bone pain. As I mentioned in a previous post, I didn't need neulasta for my 2nd round since my WBC and neutrophils were super high from the 1st round shot. I'm hoping the same will be try for 4th round but we'll see... Rwns - glad to hear your eye issues went away! Really hope that's the case for me too because they are constantly tearing now.

My cancer naturopath recommends 30 g/day of the glutamine powder at the first sign of neuropathy. I dissolve 10 g (about a tablespoon) in water and drink it 3x/day. She referenced a study I can send you if you're interested. My nails are already short and the pain that I experienced a week ago has subsided. I'm also planning to do icing today for my last taxotere. Yes - very stressful and so much info to process and make decisions about. Hang in there -- this board has lots of good advice and support. Does your care center offer support groups? Mine pairs us with mentors who are at least a year out of treatment and that has made me feel less alone. ",

So, I had my 3rd last Tuesday and hope to finish on May 22. And then onto 4 weeks of radiation... I had a lumpectomy on Jan 31. My oncotype score was intermediate (22) and I was debating chemo and then did the mammaprint and it came back high risk for recurrence so I feel good about my decision, although what a rollercoaster! The neulasta was really tough the first round, especially since I was told to take claritan for just 3 days after and really needed it much longer to mute the bone pain. Luckily, I didn't have to have neulasta the 2nd round since my white blood cells were so high (>10). I did have it this last time and am wondering if it will hit as hard with my now steady dose of claritan. I tried fasting ahead of my 3rd round of chemo. My oncologist supports a 12 hour fast ahead of chemo to reduce swelling which should minimize side effects. My naturopath says 500 calories vegan diet for 2 days ahead and a day after. A researcher at USC (Valter Longo) has shown fasting during chemo makes it more effective in mice. I did maybe 18 hours ahead and 24 after. Supposedly fasting makes the healthy cells shut down while the dumb cancer cells don't and so less healthy cells are killed by chemo. I think my side effects have been a little less with fasting and I've needed less anti-nausea meds so that's good. Who knows about the rest of it... Overall, I've been able to do lots of hiking and walking even on those days when I feel like a zombie. Hiding from the sun is a drag as is not being able to taste food but I realize these are minor complaints and I should be grateful it's not worse. This is my weekend to lay low but I'm hoping I will feel better than expected. Hope the same is true for all of you!",

I had itchy rashes on my iv hand the first time which were mostly just an annoyance and may have been triggered by sun/dirt exposure (spaced out and took my gloves off while gardening - oops, won't do that again!). The second infusion I got a very red rash on my cheeks which spread to my nose and chin when I had been careful to avoid the sun. It didn't itch but it did damage my skin a bit (not to mention my mood) and I wanted to avoid it if possible. I'm wary of too much steroids but I did do a 2 mg dexamethasone mid-cycle course (2 tabs for 2 days then 1 tab for 2 days) and I extended the steroid for 2 days on this round. We'll see what happens w/ the rashes. I've been putting tons of udderly smooth (recommended by an onco nurse) and aquaphor on any potential rash flare ups and the iv streaks and it seems to help them fade a bit. Good luck!",

The doc said on the one hand maybe it's not necessary since I'm not trying to stay on schedule any more, but on the other hand she doesn't think it's a good idea to be immune suppressed for longer than necessary after this last round. Any thoughts? Decisions, decisions. I'm fasting (well, tea and some miso soup) for 24 hours ahead and hopefully 24 hours after.
