    "Content": "Aumgirl wrote: Hello everyone! I was recently diagnosed with DCIS low grade in my left breast. Detected really early and the size is small at 5mm x 6mm. I decided to move forward with Lumpectomy and IORT. My surgey date is on 12/22. Wanted to check in with some people who had the same procedure on how your recovery was. I have made travel plans prior to my diagnosis and scheduled to leave 12/31. How long did it take for you to do daya to day activities? How did you feel a week or so post procedure? Thanks in advance. Any thoughts, comments will truly help. Namaste ~ AumGir Log in to post a reply",
