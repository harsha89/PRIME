As the others have said, the fisrt place to start is to find a breast surgeon (if you haven't already done so) to get a biopsy scheduled. As the others have also said, 80% of biopsies turn out to be benign. Just take one day at a time and remember that we are here for you!  You are in my thoughts and prayers.",
