I'm going through a stage where I only want to surround myself with people who have had medical hardships. I almost feel like I speak a different language now, understood only by other survivors. I imagine now that some don't believe me, or they feel sorry for me, or don't want to be caught in that \"what should I say\" situation. I imagine a lot of things, and as my shrink says maybe they are instead thinking \"what a strong woman.\" My book IS a best seller, but I'm doing everything I can to keep it out of the Tragedy/Horror section ;) Yes, I'm moving along at what seems like a snail's pace. The earliest they could get for my biopsy appt. is Halloween; then results three days later. I'm trying to simply be grateful that this technology exists. Now that I've become an expert in handling all that has come my way I can feel myself transition from first denial, to abject fear, to sadness & depression and now to planning the next fight. The juicer just came out again ;) The thing is, I haven't even had the biopsy but I cannot do nothing right now. Thanks for your support.",

My stats should still be below; despite needing two lumpectomies before my mastectomy I always considered myself pretty lucky overall, although I still suffer with health anxiety that has (until now) been greatly improved by my change of diet (no sugar and no carbs for 5 months now). I should add that just 7 months after my mastectomy my appendix burst and I needed an emergency open appendectomy with a colon resection due to endometriosis sticking my inside organs together like glue. Before the endometriosis verdict cancer was suspected as a likely culprit. Let's just say I'm no stranger to the idea that anything that doesn't seem right in my body seems to point to possible cancer, triggering these pretty bad bouts of anxiety bordering on depression as I imagine my luck will someday run out, a situation I'm back in now unfortunately. I recently scheduled a gyno exam because I had some atypical cervical cells in my last pap. It wasn't alarming but they wanted to see me in a year. This time the gyno explained that because of the non HPV status that a pap smear was not needed in my age group, just a pelvic exam, which a new intern performed (rather awkwardly/suddenly I might add). There was bleeding (I've been post menopausal for almost two years and taking tamoxifen for 1-1/3 years) during the exam that made them concerned enough to do the pap afterall. I got the results on the phone, good news delivered first (cervix is ok), sandwiched in with the \"I don't want you to worry\" news- some glandular cells in (I'm presuming the blood) look unusual, which warrants now a endo biopsy, on Tuesday. When I asked about whether she was checking for uterine cancer, she replied \"yes\". I feel like I'm just bracing for the next battle with this series of health issues all lined up/packed in within two years time, and sometimes I wonder if I'm up for another one. I'm angry that tamoxifen comes with the increased risk of uterine cancer (I recall a former onco saying nonchalantly \" Well, if you do get uterine cancer, at least that is another primary cancer and usually easily treated with a hysterectomy\". Apparently this is lightyears better than getting a secondary or metastasized breast cancer? These are our choices :/ Anyway, I will have to wait two weeks total for a verdict if my life will be turned upside down yet again. I'm in the middle of changing oncologists as my old one was spending all of two minutes with me in the fastest physical exams known to man, forgetting my bloodwork, not giving me the time I deserve. I will now drive 2 hours to see a better oncologist if I need one. Sorry so long, I'm just so sad, can't help but think my luck is running out. Wondering if my strength is running out, too thinking things like where I want my ashes to be spread. I'm taking ativan which only helps a little. My imagination is my worst enemy.  Any support/input is much appreciated. I'm just so tired of this roller coaster.  ",

What is not listed below is what has happened since this first mastectomy two years ago: an appendectomy with necessary colon resection in summer of 2016 (endometriosis stuck my appendix to my intestine but it was another cancer scare until I found this out), and another primary cancer, uterine cancer with total hysterectomy (stage 1A again) in May 2017, just 5 months ago. Fast forward to today and I've been called back from my 2 yr anniversary mammogram for a diagnostic, re. \"more views\" mammogram on my remaining breast, and THIS is where I seem to be losing \"it\". By it I mean, my reserve, hope, any optimism, and ability to cope with the latest, I don't know if I can take it any more. I want a mastectomy on the remaining breast TODAY. Then I feel bad because there are women in much more difficult circumstances than myself. I see a shrink but the positive reinforcement that worked on cancers one and two are now calling my bluff. I have PTSD and am crying all the time. My luck has to run out and I'm so scared. I'm taking Arimidex now that I'm menopausal, was taking Tamoxifen. If this is cancer isn't it more likely that it's not my ER+ kind? And how likely is it that this is another primary? Should demand genetic testing this time?(My onc thought it didn't warrant this after the uterine cancer since the only cancer in my family was my brother's recent brain cancer). I have since learned that I had an aunt on my Dad's side who had breast cancer. My first diagnosis was at age 56. Dx 10/21/2015, IDC, Right, 1cm, Stage IA, Grade 2, 0/1 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Surgery 11/14/2015 Lumpectomy: Right Surgery 11/30/2015 Lumpectomy: Right Surgery 12/30/2015 Mastectomy Hormonal Therapy Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Oct 18, 2017 11:07PM - edited Oct 19, 2017 11:58AM by PhoebeLee Thank you for your kind response GreenEyes. Yesterday I saw my MO and she is onboard with genetic testing once we figure out what's up with the \"micro calcifications\" in this remaining breast. There may be all kinds of genetic mutations as of yet undiscovered- I know my case doesn't seem typical. With this frequency of occurences I would at least like some more intensive monitoring, that is my hope- my luck may not hold much longer it feels like. Then, today was the diagnostic mammogram with extra views and a talk with the doctor who looks at the images. I finally mustered the strength to look at the images (it's been a bad week) and there was my boob, three times the size in real life, and there were about 4-5 teeny tiny white specks together in an area no bigger than half my pinky nail. Those calcifications could be nothing, or they might be DCIS and now I have to get a stereotactic biopsy in 1-2 weeks of course :/. Even though DCIS is still cancer (stage 0) I'll take it over the scenarios I had playing in my mind. I still want a mastectomy on the remaining breast, whether it is called for or prophylactic. And I want genetic testing. It just doesn't make sense in my case, with only one case of breast cancer in my family tree (one aunt) going back generations. Green Eyes, have you had cancer more than one time?",
