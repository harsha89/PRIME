I go to the doctor tomorrow to start my journey concerning this new and foreign object in my body. I am 49 years old and I am not in the best of health already, but willing to make changes to beat this thing. I know one thing for sure, I will come away with a diagnosis of some type. It will either be a mild or more severe diagnosis. I just cant get this thing off my mind. I know that there are so many treatment options for whatever it is I am dealing with, but I cannot begin any of them until I get my diagnosis. I thank you for reading this and hope that you are doing well on your journey. smiles Log in to post a reply",
