Thank You that You are more powerful than any cancer or risks they face. Thank You that You go before them whenever they go through difficult sitations.  Thank You that You are always with them and never leave or forsake them, so they dont need to be afraid of tough times.  Dear Father, please give them courage and faith to meet the most difficult situation they face in fighting and beating cancer.  In Jesus name I pray, Amen.  i love you my beautiful sisters in christ and I thank you.  I will keep you all updated on my mom after the tests have been given. xoxoxoxox ",
