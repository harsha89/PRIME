The surgeon agreed and sent me for a mammo and sono. Both showed nothing. My insurance wouldn't pay for an MRI so I paid out of pocket ($1200). The MRI didn't show anything. Since that time I have had another mammo and sono and both show nothing. My insurance does not feel it is medically necessary to have an MRI and won't pay - I can't afford to pay out of pocket again. My surgeon is insisting on a biopsy, he would make an incision and remove the suspicious area.  My question is - Is the biopsy really necessary. If something was wrong wouldn't the MRI have seen it? Has anyone had an experience where the MRI missed a cancer?  I really don't want a biopsy. I'm already missing half my breast and the suspiscious area is fairly large.  I know it probably seems vain but I REALLY don't won't to have a biopsy and start down this road again.  Any comments would be appreciated.

I know that the only way to know for sure is to take it out but .... I don't want more surgery. I haven't talked to anyone about this so just typing it out is helpful. If I bring this up with friends or family they will flip out. Thanks for listening - it helps to hear another opinion.",
