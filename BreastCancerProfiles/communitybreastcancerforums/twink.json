First of all, I think neoadjuvant chemo is a well accepted practice in treating BC in some cases -- primarily if the tumor is in a difficult location, if the tumor is large and margins are in question or, if the patient wants a lumpetomy option.  I fell into the last category.  I don't know that it's accepted practice to choose neoadjuvant chemotherapy to 'test' the efficacy of the selected chemo as a primary consideration but that may be the case in some areas of the country/world.  The upside is that when it works, it's evident and, in my case, the lumpectomy option was viable (I decided to go with a bilateral/right prophylactic mastectomy).  The downside from my perspective is that it may not work (as in the AC for me) thereby extending the period of time that the cancer is in your body.  My nodes were clinically not involved at Dx -- by palpitation and PET/CT.  By the time I had surgery, I had three involved nodes (micromets).  I assume they were there at Dx but can never be certain that they didn't become involved during the neoadjuvant treatment period.   The biggest challenge I had with neoadjuvant chemo is simply the absence of good data and consistent treatment practices.  For example, the timing of the SNB is a controversial subject -- at Dx or after chemo?  Then, what does it mean from a treatment protocol point of view....  Likewise, the addition of adjuvant chemo in this setting... another area with no data.  It gets a little tough making decisions in the absence of studies.  Anyway, I'm rambling on... sorry.  Just wanted to put my two cents worth in.",

SNB came back negative intraoperatively but showed micromets on the path report.  I agreed to a full ALND on the left side.  My BS felt very strongly that 'sampling' nodes didn't provide sufficient information and still left a strong possibility that missed nodes contained cancer.  I opted to have all potential cancerous nodes removed.  As it turned out, the other 14 removed with the full dissection came back negative.  I'm now going through radiation (which I also didn't plan for) but despite the increased risk of lymphedema, I'd rather throw everything possible at this now than regret not having done everything I could.  The surgeries established a level of risk for lymphedema; the radiation increases the risk but as the onc pointed out... better lymphedema than a more dire alternative. Marian, I'm sorry to hear of your path report.  You must be very tired of all this and very scared of the outcome.  I too had positive nodes after neoadjuvant chemo so understand the dissapointment in the outcome.  As for 'volunteered' nodes I think that's typical since the nodes are throughout the breast tissue.  My SNB also produced an extra, unplanned node (which was positive too).  I've heard good things about Xeloda...I hope it kicks the crap right out of any remaining cancer.  I'll PM you separately as I am thinking about you... t",

Hugs Annie. t",

I suppose that's a matter of perspective too.  What a waste of a perfectly healthy breast.  (sigh)  Actually, I'd do it exactly the same, if I had to do it all over again.  No regrets here (besides being diagnosed in the first place).

Frankly if I'd had to rely on any of my doctors for info I suspect I'd feel much as you describe. This site has a wealth of info but so does the Internet in general.... so many good sites to provide you with info on BC, treatment, side effects, and so on. The American Cancer Society, Susan G. Komen, Pink Link, and so many more WWW resources. Dr. Susan Love's book is probably the most comprehensive BC resource but there are many many more. I'd find that out what the receptor status of your cancer is too because that will help you with your research. Good luck to you.",

Several girls in our group had nail problems which started with aching nail beds.  Some lost a few nails or their nails lifted away from the finger.  In some cases, the nails became discolored.  This happened to one woman while on AC but for most of us, the taxane was the problem (Taxol or Taxotere).  One woman found that taping her nails down helped retain the nail.  In my case, one month following the completion of Taxotere, I lost a few toenails, other toenails became very brittle and several finger nails became discolored.  The discoloration ranged from a yechy brownish orange to a black smudge buried in the cente of my nail.   Skin can also peel from the hands and feet (foot hand syndrome) due to the taxane.  I don't know if any of this can be prevented but thought I'd mention it as it seems to be a fairly common experience. Eyes, noses, mouths... mucuous membrane can be affected as you've probably figured out.  Thrush (a white coating on the tongue and throat) can also come up.  My eyes were sooo watery for much of the chemo time.  I had thrush twice.  Magic mouthwash is a prescription that helps with mouth care (but it doesn't cure thrush) and is a little more effective than the biotene (which I also used).  Biotene makes a gentle toothpaste too which seemed to be easier on my sore mouth and gums.  Skin care was important to me as I found my skin became very very dry during chemo.  Lindi Skin makes a line of skin care products especially for chemo and rads patients that I really liked (www.lindiskin.com).  The moisturizer was great as was the balm.  I liked to soak in a tub when I was feeling achey and used an organic coconut oil (Spectrum brand) in the water.  I took Ativan to help me sleep and for a brief period, tried an antidepressant.  Many women in our group found either or both of these types of drugs helped them cope.  It's hard to put up a good fight if you're too tired. Hmmmm... I think I got a little carried away.  You guys sound like you're doing just fine and supporting each other as much as you can.  I hope you develop friendships as strong as our group has.  We had our first little get-together last week in Florida.  Stop by our thread to see what fun we had.  All this just one year later.... hang in there ladies.  We've got your backs.",

Laurel, I too had mouth problems, especially when I was on Taxotere.  I used the Biotene regularly but eventually had to ask for more help... the Magic Mouthwash did help the general rawness by numbing my tongue, throat and gums.  It didn't help with Thrush though and it sounds like you might be suffering from that.  The most obvious sign is a white coating over your entire tongue.  In any case, that required a different prescription to clear up.  Fluconazole is what my onc had me take and it cleared up my mouth problems within a day or two.",
