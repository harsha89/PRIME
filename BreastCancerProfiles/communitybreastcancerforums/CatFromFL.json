Or as I am calling it these days \"NewNasty\" He said that they have had reports \" here and there\" of tinnitus, but that its not listed as a \"side effect\" in their literature. I put in an official \" report of adverse drug reaction\" but I was wondering how prevalent it is with so many cancer patients getting it. That is breast cancer plus most other cancers too.",

I have used a calendula cream made by California Baby with fabulous results after a severe Taxotere dermatitis. It worked fast, smelled good and was very comforting. Miaderm has 4% calendula plus other things that have been proven to do well but I am wondering if anyone has experience. I know many have used Aquafor and aloe and other creams......I used these when I had rads in 2006. I would like to try this new cream and since its 100% guaranteed (according to their website www.miaderm.com) I am willing to give it a try. So please don't post your own \"other \" creams experince. I am only interested in Miaderm.

As I had Rads in 2006 when I had BC of the right breast, I guess I am the ole pro ! My name is Cat. I am 60 now and had BC in 2006 and again in the other breast in April 2012. Both were IDC Stage 2A, ER+PR+ Her2 neg. I opted for lumpectomies after 2 consults and no difference in the long term surrival stats and mets stats. I also didn't want to lose the sensation and experience the long recovery after reconstruction. This time I did opt to get chemo, which ended yesterday ! My chemo saga is quite long. I failed Taxotere due to many side effects after 1 dose, and even after them chenging me to Adriamycin I still had problems. Some were from Neulasta and some were from secondary infections with low WBCs ( despite the Neulasta). But no Neulasta this last round and maybe I will have less pain. I will see the Radiation Oncologist again on Friday. I met her already (preop) and was very pleased. The Radiation Center ( a Moffitt Center) is merely 8-10 miles away and will be easy to manage. In 2006 I drove 130 miles round trip everyday and that was tiring. On Friday I expect that they will tentatively schedule my Rad Tx and schedule my simulation and tattoos. I still have 3 tattoos from 2006. My MO told me that this Radiation equiptment is less than 6 months old and state of the art so that allayed some anxiety for me. I will be using Miaderm cream ( check out www.misderm.com) its had clinical trials to back up its effectiveness. I tried Aquafor and Aloe in 2006 and found neither really helped. I also know that California Baby brand (all natural) calendula cream is extremely good for Rad changes to skin from a Nurse Practioner friend who worked with head and neck cancer patients who were prone to the skin damage radiaiton can cause. It is NOT burnt, but the cells are damaged. So I will be back as soon as my WBCs are normal I can start my Rads....I expect 2-3 weeks from now- so Beginning of August. I believe I will have 25 normal and 8 boosts or something similar. I sure hope the next 2-3 weeks are easy recovering from yesterdays Chemo dose. Then I will be home free.........Rads are cake! At least for me they were in 2006....can't imagine it being any different. Be back soon.",

I am sure it's bone mets due to the severe pain and CT. Believe me I know. They will probably do a biopsy too. I am on an emotional roller coaster, can't tolerate sitting at all and extremely sad. The pain has me very irritable and I am on Zohydro ( time release hydrocodone), Tramadol and ibuprofen with marginal results. My husband is retired and very attentive so I am not alone, but I sure feel alone. Does anyone have suggestions for good pain control ( mine is in sacral area and constant)  ",
