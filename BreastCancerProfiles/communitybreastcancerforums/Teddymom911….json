In terms of cycle I hardly get Periods anymore but I had some spotting so that is when I called and got the appt for the right time. However, I was still spotting a week later which is weird in and of itself. About a month ago I had a week of hot flashes, insomnia and headaches and was certain I was going through the start of menopause (I'm 47). Can dcis stay in the duct if it's measured this big? Could this have been missed? I live in Washington DC and am supposed to have terrific care here but I'm worried it was missed.",

Reading the success stories on this website helps a lot. Doc - I am having a MRI guided biopsy - thanks for the info on calcifications. None were noted in the report, so I assume they saw none. Thanks again!",
