My Bi-Rads 5 lesion has come back with a benign pathology report. I had an US guided core needle biopsy on the 1.4 cm lesion. 6 samples were taken, plus some additional smaller ones. The diagnoses: Benign hypoglandular fibrous breast tissue with focal usual ductal hyperplasia and rare intraluminal calcifications, otherwise unremarkable. No atypical epithelial hyperplasia, in situ or invasive carcinoma. My GP has said this is encouraging new, but there are still some red flags considering the feel of the lump during physical examination and because the initial US images showed \"shadowing\" (mammogram showed nothing). There is also a note at the very bottom of the report that reads: There is no histologic evidence of a mass-forming lesion from the multiple levels examined. Thus, this sample may not be representative of the targeted lesion. Correlation with radiographic findings is required. My GP has recommended excisional biopsy and I have been referred to a surgeon. Despite my case being marked as urgent, the consultation is still 3 weeks away. I'm not sure how long it will then be before I have a surgery date. I've been told that the only way to know for sure whether a tumor is benign or malignant, is to \"stick a needle in it.\" Well, we've done that and the results were favorable. I guess what I am wanting to know is can I still hold out hope? Is there still a possibility for the lump to truly be benign? Or should I just prepare myself again for a cancer diagnoses?

Not sure if that makes a difference. I think what I should have asked is there actual potential for \u201chypoglandular fibrous tissue and rare intraluminal calcifcations\" to cause benignmasses to develop the breast?",

      "Content": "Island_gal wrote: I am 35 yo. In the last month or so, I began feeling tenderness in my left breast. I wasn't overly concerned as I assumed the pain was related to my cycle but did a couple BSEs. After a couple tries, I felt a small lump so went to a walk-in clinic for an exam. The Dr. did an exam, felt the lump, and said he wasn't overly worried either (could be a cyst) but referred me for an ultrasound anyways. 9 days later, I had both an ultrasound and mammogram. During the scan, the tech scanned my underarm and mentioned that the nodes looked nice & normal (which was reassuring), but I was called in to see my GP just a couple days later. She told me I ended up with a BI-RADS 5 and that there are 2 lesions, but one is an obvious cyst. The concerning lesion which needed biopsy is 1cm x 1cm x 1cm (sounds small?) with irregular borders. She mentioned again that the report noted my nodes looked clear on scan, which is a good indicator nothing has spread, though any microscopic traces of cancer wouldn't be picked up on US. She also did a physical exam of my underarm and couldn't feel anything swollen. I had the tumor biopsied this past Friday, and again, the tech scanned my underarm node and said if there were abnormalities they would have biopsied the node then & there. I asked the Radiologist if she was confident that the samples from the tumor were cancerous and she said the samples \"didn't look good\". I know I have to wait for the results to know for certain, and I am prepared for the diagnoses of cancer in my breast. What I am much more concerned about is the pain I developed over the last week through the left side of my neck, shoulder, arm and hand (tumor side) being an indication of bone mets. Has anyone here had similar pain while going through the diagnostic process? Given small size of my tumor, and that the 2 scans and 1 physical exam of my nodes appeared normal, can I feel somewhat reassured that the pain I'm experiencing may be unrelated to the tumor in my breast? Wouldn't these nodes shows obvious abnormalities if I had bone mets? Thanks for listening. Log in to post a reply",

I'm not sure if you or any others are following my story, but here is an update: I have now received an addendum to my biopsy report, stating the pathology is discordant with imaging (which I understand is standard practice in this type of circumstance) and that an additional ultrasound guided core biopsy is recommended. Strangely, the addendum includes an adjusted Bi-Rads from 5 to 4C \u2013 I wonder if the initial benign biopsy result has influenced this change? I won't be moving forward with another core biopsy, as my GP had already referred me to a surgeon for excision biopsy. She believes the lump to be malignant, although she did say that the initial benign findings were 'encouraging.' Unfortunately, I still have another week to go before they are able to fit me in for consultation. In addition to this, around the same time I discovered the lump, I began experiencing pain on the same side in my shoulder, neck, upper back, down the arm and into my hands. My hands are achey and my fingers tingle from time to time. The pain worsened over the past weeks, and just as I thought I was finally beginning to feel some improvement, I fell asleep on the couch for several hours, and then woke up in pain. I'm hoping I simply tweaked my neck at some point, and sleeping on the couch re-aggravated it \u2013 and really, really hope that it's not related to the lump. I've addressed it with my GP 3 x times now, but her focus has been on the lump and she mentioned during my last appointment to bring it to the attention of the surgeon, in case there is some connection. On top of this, I am only several weeks into a brand new job and still in my probationary period. I've been extremely distracted and have had to miss days / leave early, etc. multiple times already. I have been very open with my line manager about what's been going on, and she seems to be supportive but I can't stop myself from thinking that I will soon find myself unemployed with a cancer diagnoses. I live in an extremely HCOL city so this has added to my distress. ",
