Was feeling sorry for myself, planning my own funeral - cried last night when my, husband started innocently talking about beefing up the retirement accounts. Sometimes, I feel like cancer has taken over the world - or at least my world. It's like a perverse take on the Brady Bunch (Jan crying, \"It's always Marcia, Marcia, Marcia!\" cancer cancer cancer) Anyway, my dear friend's 13yo niece died this afternoon. She was born with a cardiac defect -reversal of ventricles-- and it was known from the start she would need this (supposedly) life saving operation. 20 hours last week in a Boston hospital, top surgeon..and then, started declining over the last few days. One of the worst parts? my dear friend, her husband, and 12 yo daughter (who spent 3 weeks at sailing camp with this 13yo girl, her cousin) are in Ireland and no one has been able to reach them. I'm sorry to ramble, but I just wanted to share my wake up call. I mean, cancer is still crazy, unjust, and scary. I definitely want to live to see my children grow up - and I plan to. But today reminded me there are other tragedies in the world. and while I'm at it: if you're the praying kind, or karma kind, or energy kind - this girl's family needs it all by the truckload. xo J Dx 9/24/2009, ILC, 2cm, Stage IIIC, Grade 3, 15/19 nodes, ER+/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

Thinking back to when my children were babies and I didn't have cancer. I don't even like looking at pictures of myself before my diagnosis, because all I can think is, \"I didn't have cancer then\". And I wish like hell I could go back in time. That being said, most days I feel positive, healthy, and happy. I have an amazing husband, circle of girlfriends, and wonderful co-workers. My doctors are a wonderful bunch, too. I think PTSD is part of the territory. I wish there was more talk about it, however. Much is written about cancer and depression, but honestly, I think I've had PTSD symptoms as strongly as I've had depressive. Anyway, my long way of saying: you're not alone. I'll say a special prayer for you today. hugs janyce",

Sherri, you never fail to get me motivated and upbeat - I can't thank you enough! Clariceak, thanks for the reassurance around tx. At the time, you feel overwhelmed, but once it's over, you think, hmm, did I REALLY finish the laundry list?! It's a victory, and I intend to celebrate every one, because as we all know, it's precious. love, Janyce",

The surgery itself was a snap: in at 10;30a, out at 5pm. It was a laparoscopic procedure: three small slits, very little discomfort - I was doing yoga again in 4 days. kept my uterus since there was no need to take it. The worst side effect is the vaginal dryness  - I mean, whew! Vitamin E suppositories are helping, however, and  the phrase \"use it or lose it\" is a good one to remember. Like most husbands, mine is happy to \"help practice\" to keep things up to date - lol. anyway, hope it helps if you decide to do the oophorectomy, although as other women have posted, it doesn't seem like an automatic \"yes\" in your case. Good luck.  ",

There is great support here, lots of prayers and thoughts for you! I did dose dense AC. Sloan Memorial, Dana Farber, and MD Anderson all recommend it - and my onc did as well. Everyone is different, but here are a few of my tips: 1) Drink, drink, drink some more! I became dehydrated between the 2nd and 3rd tx and it really shot me down. Even hot water with lemon and some honey; popsicles; Italian ices; Gatorade; iced tea. find what works and buy it by the CASE.As both oncology nurses kept saying: Worry more about your liquids and less about food.   2) Take Sudafed in regular doses. The sinus congestion/pain definitely responds to it.  3) Exercise. yes, exercise - I ran/walked on most days, except the horrible ones, and on those, I would just walk slowly around the block for about 20 minutes. The fresh air helped my spirits immensely and the body too. 4) Enlist a loved one to keep an objective \"eye\" on your spirits. I felt like a wounded animal at times, wanting to isolate. It's okay to need the quiet time, and this is the time to say no to WHATEVER and WHOMEVER you want!If the depression or other mood sx become crippling, talk to the onc about possible medication and therapy referrals.  Good luck. You can do this. We're here for you. xo",

I know, I know: it's easier said than done. Cry in the shower - I took LOTS of unncessary showers in the beginning -- go for a walk/run whatever. Find your best girlfriend and let it out. It really feels easier when you share the worry and fear. Take it 5 minutes at a time, if you have to.Some days, that's all we can do!  If the insomnia gets very bad, ask the doc for a small prescription of Ativan or Klonopin - sedatives that are habit forming over long periods, but in small amounts, are appropriate for just this situation. prayers for you. let us know. janyce",
