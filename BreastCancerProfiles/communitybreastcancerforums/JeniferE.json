Will let you know how it goes! I lost about 50% of my hair during chemo, all over, not just at the edges. It is interesting to feel my hair getting fuller all over my head as hair grows. Ponytail is thicker at the base, but sad and thin at the end. The ends of course remain thin. Will trim another inch when I do the color. Love that I can focus on hair and the wedding rather thank chemo and Cancer recurrence",

Placement under the machine is done by measurement only, all that is done to avoid my heart is breath holding. My nurse showed me a diagram that showed that only a small amount of rad is reaching the heart and lung. Will ask for detailed explanation when I next see the RO. My breast felt hot all night, hard to get comfy and sleep. Probably because of my anxious thoughts. Coyote, I am very interested in the idea of a survey, radiation treatments seem to vary SO MUCH! Thank you for your efforts for us all. I also and a lumpectomy with fat placement, no drains. Not sure if the hard spots I feel are fluid or not. I will ask RO.

My schedule is earlier in the afternoon than last wek, but glad to see three of the four techs were repeats. All nice, down to business, professional. Missed my favorite tech, though. No form, both hands grabbing something over head, adjusted by scoots and pulls as they align my 4 tattoos, calling out numbers to each other as they adjust. WonderWoman, I LOVE hearing the word 'perfect\" too. Told them the same thing today when that description was used. My breath holding seems a little subjective. Today they took time and did sims again to get the breath right. I plan to discuss this with the RO this week. I hope she can show me on the ct scan where the rads are hitting my heart. Unfortunately some rads do reach it and the lungs. My breast surgery was a partial mastectomy with fat replacement. Doc did a flap and saved skin and nipple. Breast is still hard and painful where fat was placed. Wondering if rads add to this? Could also just be the process as I heal. Using aloe, have lidocaine cream on hand, assume my fair skin will eventually have some side effects. Keep posting comments and questions. I love learning from you all.
