She said it is normal breast tissue, and that's why it blends in on the ultrasound. They reviewed my imaging from the other hospital, and said that everything looks fine. She said that small town hospital sends an MRI recommendation with every report. She said if she was concerned at all, she'd send me for one. I was told to come back in 6 months for a repeat mammogram. I feel some relief, but I'm still a bit worried. I suppose that will never go away, like I opened a Pandora's Box by finding a lump and researching.",
