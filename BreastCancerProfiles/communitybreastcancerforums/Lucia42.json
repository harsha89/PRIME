They had an extremely rare, aggressive and fatal form of ovarian cancer. There was no standard treatment. The women, strangers to one another living in different countries, asked their doctors to try new immunotherapy drugs that had revolutionized treatment of cancer. At first, they were told the drugs were out of the question \u2014 they would not work against ovarian cancer. Now it looks as if the doctors were wrong. The women managed to get immunotherapy, and their cancers went into remission. They returned to work; their lives returned to normalcy. The tale has befuddled scientists, who are struggling to understand why the drugs worked when they should not have. If researchers can figure out what happened here, they may open the door to new treatments for a wide variety of other cancers thought not to respond to immunotherapy. \"What we are seeing here is that we have not yet learned the whole story of what it takes for tumors to be recognized by the immune system,\" said Dr. Jedd Wolchok, chief of the melanoma and immunotherapeutics service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. \"We need to study the people who have a biology that goes against the conventional generalizations.\" Four women hardly constitutes a clinical trial. Still, \"it is the exceptions that give you the best insights,\" said Dr. Drew Pardoll, who directs the Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore. The cancer that struck the young women was hypercalcemic small cell ovarian cancer, which typically occurs in a woman's teens or 20s. It is so rare that most oncologists never see a single patient with it. But Dr. Douglas Levine, director of gynecologic oncology at New York University Langone Medical Center, specialized in this disease. A few years ago, he discovered that the cancer was driven by a single gene mutation. The finding was of little use to patients \u2014 there was no drug on the horizon that could help. Women with this form of ovarian cancer were sharing news and tips online in a closed Yahoo group. Dr. Levine asked to become part of the group and began joining the discussions. There he discovered patients who had persuaded doctors to give them an immunotherapy drug, even though there was no reason to think it would work. The women reported that their tumors shrank immediately. The idea behind immunotherapy is to dismantle a molecular shield that some tumors use to avoid an attack by the body's white blood cells. The immune system sees these tumors as foreign \u2014 they are fueled by hundreds of genetic mutations, which drive their growth and are recognized by the body. But when white blood cells swarm in to attack the cancer cells, they bounce back, rebuffed. Immunotherapy drugs pierce that protective shield, allowing the immune system to recognize and demolish tumor cells. But the new drugs do not work against many common cancers. Those cancers are supported by fewer genetic mutations, and experts believe that the tumor cells just do not look threatening enough to the body to spur a response. So the immune system leaves them alone. Lung cancer, a genetic type of colorectal cancer and melanoma have huge numbers of mutations, and immunotherapy drugs often are successful in treating them. Cancers of the prostate, pancreas, breast, ovaries \u2014 and most other tumors \u2014 carry few mutations. \"These are the cancers that rarely respond,\" Dr. Pardoll said. The idea that the drugs might work against something like hypercalcemic ovarian cancer, which is fueled by just one genetic mutation, just made no sense. \"For the vast majority of cancers, there is an amazingly clean correlation between response to therapy and mean mutational load,\" Dr. Pardoll said.  But there were a few oddball exceptions. An unusual skin cancer called Merkel cell carcinoma responded to immunotherapy, scientists found. It is caused by a virus, and researchers suggested the infection itself draws the attention of the immune system. Mesothelioma also responded, perhaps because the asbestos that caused it also inflames the immune system. And some kidney cancers responded to immunotherapy treatment; no one knows why. And then came a handful of women with a rare ovarian cancer. Oriana Sousa, 28, a psychologist in Marinha Grande, Portugal, was one of them. She found out she had cancer in December 2011. She knew something was wrong \u2014 for several months she had been feeling tired, constipated and endlessly thirsty. She began vomiting and had abdominal cramps. But her doctors told her she was fine and not to worry. Finally, her aunt, a nurse, suggested she see a different doctor, who performed a CT scan of her abdomen. It revealed a huge mass. The doctor operated to find out what it was. Two days later, he gave her the bad news: Cancer, and a really terrible form of it. For the next four years, Ms. Sousa's doctors tried to control the cancer, giving her rounds of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery. But every time, new tumors emerged. \"I suffered a lot, and I felt I had no life,\" she said. Things are different now. In 2015, she finally persuaded a doctor to give her an immunotherapy drug, nivolumab. Immediately, her tumors shrank and continued shrinking as she continued with the drug \u2014 so much that her doctors now say she has no evidence of disease. Life has returned to normal. \"Generally after work, I go to the gym and do classes and work out,\" she said. \"People who don't know what I have been through, they can't imagine I am an oncology patient.\" What saved her? Dr. Eliezer M. Van Allen, a cancer researcher at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, has come across one clue. He found that a gene mutated in kidney cancer was sort of a master regulator of other genes, controlling which were turned on and when. But the regulated genes were normal and did not produce proteins that the immune system might recognize as abnormal. Nonetheless, patients responding to immunotherapy were the ones with the master gene mutation. \"We saw this result and weren't sure what to make of it,\" he said. Dr. Levine and his colleagues found the same phenomenon in patients with hypercalcemic ovarian cancers. One explanation, he and Dr. Van Allen said, is that the immune system may recognize that cells in which genes are erratically turning on and off are dangerous and should be destroyed. \"That is strictly hypothesis,\" Dr. Levine cautioned. One thing is clear, though: When pathologists examine these tumors, they find white blood cells in them \u2014 as if the immune system were trying to attack. And that finding has led both Dr. Pardoll and Dr. Padmanee Sharma of M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston to plan new clinical trials. They know that immunotherapy fails most patients, even those with cancers that are most likely to respond. So they have set out to create a test to determine who might respond to immunotherapy and then treat those patients \u2014 regardless of their cancer type. Dr. Sharma's study, funded by the Parker Institute, is getting ready to enroll patients. The researchers will look at pathology slides of patients' tumors to see if white blood cells are worming their way into the cancers. If so, the patients will get an immunotherapy drug to help activate their white blood cells to attack the tumor. If there are few white blood cells in the tumor tissue, patients will get a combination of two immunotherapy drugs to help move more white blood cells into the tumor and help them attack. \"The trial is written for all comers,\" Dr. Sharma said. \"If we have learned anything, it is that it is not the tumor type we are treating \u2014 it is the immune system.\" At Johns Hopkins, Dr. Pardoll and his colleagues are planning a similar trial. They will be looking for tumors \u2014 it does not matter what type \u2014 that have a protein, PD-L1, on the surface that repels the immune system. Any patient whose tumor fits that description will get an immunotherapy drug. It's a shot in the dark. But sometimes such a shot finds the mark, as Ms. Sousa will tell you. \"Incredible things happen, and against all the odds,\" she said.

(TSX: ONC) (OTCQX: ONCYF) (Oncolytics or the Company), a biotech company developing REOLYSIN®, also known as pelareorep, an intravenously delivered immuno-oncolytic virus that activates the innate and adaptive immune systems to turn 'cold' tumors 'hot', today announced that the company has received a favorable Final Advice Letter from the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The Letter refers to the proposed use of pelareorep in combination with paclitaxel, for the treatment of hormone receptor positive, HER2 receptor negative (HR+/HER2-) metastatic breast cancer patients in a pivotal phase 3 registration study and suggests that a single 400-patient study may be acceptable to form the basis of a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) in Europe. \"The EMA's feedback and Final Advice Letter are very much inline with the feedback and advice we received from the FDA in September and adds to the support we have for our proposed target patient population of HR positive/HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer patients for the registration study,\" said Dr. Matt Coffey, President and CEO of Oncolytics Biotech. \"Our statistically significant and clinically compelling overall survival data, Fast Track designation and clear guidance from the FDA and EMA allow us to focus on the completion of the adaptive study design that will include approximately four hundred patients with a pre-determined interim analysis at two hundred patients. Furthermore, the EMA provided guidance that if the study achieves its primary endpoint, it may form the basis of a Marketing Authorization Application for commercialization in Europe. The design of the study, feedback from both the FDA and EMA and our recently announced partnership with Adlai Nortye will also drive our ongoing partnering process.\" Oncolytics' proposed target population for its phase 3 study of pelareorep is patients with HR+/HER2- mBC, which represents approximately 73 percent of metastatic breast cancer cases that have limited treatment options that offer survival benefit. Details of the pivotal phase 3 registration study will be made available following evaluation and completion of discussions with clinical advisors and potentially partners. About Metastatic Breast Cancer Metastatic breast cancer, also known as advanced or Stage 4 breast cancer, has spread to other parts of the body. Most commonly the lungs, liver, bones or brain. The disease affects over 154,000 women in the United States and according to the American Cancer Society, has a five-year survival rate of just 22 percent. Significantly lower than stage 3, with a five-year relative survival rate of 72 percent and stage 2, with a five-year survival rate over 90 percent. About REOLYSIN/Pelareorep REOLYSIN, also known as pelareorep, is a non-pathogenic, proprietary isolate of the unmodified reovirus: a first-in-class intravenously delivered immuno-oncolytic virus for the treatment of solid tumors and hematological malignancies.

CBC News Posted: Jun 04, 2017 5:00 PM ET Last Updated: Jun 04, 2017 5:00 PM ET Cancer patients in Montreal could be the cusp of being treated with nanorobots thanks to revolutionary technology being developed at the Jewish General Hospital. The experimental treatment sees scientists create bacteria that behaves like a tiny robot carrying chemotherapy drugs to cancerous tumors in the body These bacteria-based nanorobots can be guided with magnets \u2014 they have microscopic metallic crystals \u2014 but also zero-in on tumours autonomously by being drawn to low-oxygen areas. This form of treatment means patients would be spared more invasive and aggressive cancer treatments such as radiation therapy. The team's efforts were presented in Montreal on Saturday during a scientific forum organized by Quebec's Breast Cancer Foundation. While Vuong's team has had success in their trials with rats and mice, they are waiting for approval from Health Canada and the funding they need to move forward. Vuong hopes they could begin clinical trials on humans in the next 18 months.",

Lymphoma patients are being recruited to test the technique in a clinical trial. JAN 312018  Ronald Levy (left) and Idit Sagiv-Barfi led the work on a possible cancer treatment that involves injecting two immune-stimulating agents directly into solid tumors. Steve Fisch Injecting minute amounts of two immune-stimulating agents directly into solid tumors in mice can eliminate all traces of cancer in the animals, including distant, untreated metastases, according to a study by researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine. The approach works for many different types of cancers, including those that arise spontaneously, the study found. The researchers believe the local application of very small amounts of the agents could serve as a rapid and relatively inexpensive cancer therapy that is unlikely to cause the adverse side effects often seen with bodywide immune stimulation. \"When we use these two agents together, we see the elimination of tumors all over the body,\" said Ronald Levy, MD, professor of oncology. \"This approach bypasses the need to identify tumor-specific immune targets and doesn't require wholesale activation of the immune system or customization of a patient's immune cells.\" One agent is currently already approved for use in humans; the other has been tested for human use in several unrelated clinical trials. A clinical trial was launched in January to test the effect of the treatment in patients with lymphoma. Levy, who holds the Robert K. and Helen K. Summy Professorship in the School of Medicine, is the senior author of the study, which was published Jan. 31 in Science Translational Medicine. Instructor of medicine Idit Sagiv-Barfi, PhD, is the lead author. Levy is a pioneer in the field of cancer immunotherapy, in which researchers try to harness the immune system to combat cancer. Research in his laboratory led to the development of rituximab, one of the first monoclonal antibodies approved for use as an anticancer treatment in humans. Some immunotherapy approaches rely on stimulating the immune system throughout the body. Others target naturally occurring checkpoints that limit the anti-cancer activity of immune cells. Still others, like the CAR T-cell therapy recently approved to treat some types of leukemia and lymphomas, require a patient's immune cells to be removed from the body and genetically engineered to attack the tumor cells. Many of these approaches have been successful, but they each have downsides \u2014 from difficult-to-handle side effects to high-cost and lengthy preparation or treatment times. \"All of these immunotherapy advances are changing medical practice,\" Levy said. \"Our approach uses a one-time application of very small amounts of two agents to stimulate the immune cells only within the tumor itself. In the mice, we saw amazing, bodywide effects, including the elimination of tumors all over the animal.\" Cancers often exist in a strange kind of limbo with regard to the immune system. Immune cells like T cells recognize the abnormal proteins often present on cancer cells and infiltrate to attack the tumor. However, as the tumor grows, it often devises ways to suppress the activity of the T cells. Levy's method works to reactivate the cancer-specific T cells by injecting microgram amounts of two agents directly into the tumor site. (A microgram is one-millionth of a gram). One, a short stretch of DNA called a CpG oligonucleotide, works with other nearby immune cells to amplify the expression of an activating receptor called OX40 on the surface of the T cells. The other, an antibody that binds to OX40, activates the T cells to lead the charge against the cancer cells. Because the two agents are injected directly into the tumor, only T cells that have infiltrated it are activated. In effect, these T cells are \"prescreened\" by the body to recognize only cancer-specific proteins. Some of these tumor-specific, activated T cells then leave the original tumor to find and destroy other identical tumors throughout the body. The approach worked startlingly well in laboratory mice with transplanted mouse lymphoma tumors in two sites on their bodies. Injecting one tumor site with the two agents caused the regression not just of the treated tumor, but also of the second, untreated tumor. In this way, 87 of 90 mice were cured of the cancer. Although the cancer recurred in three of the mice, the tumors again regressed after a second treatment. The researchers saw similar results in mice bearing breast, colon and melanoma tumors. Mice genetically engineered to spontaneously develop breast cancers in all 10 of their mammary pads also responded to the treatment. Treating the first tumor that arose often prevented the occurrence of future tumors and significantly increased the animals' life span, the researchers found. Finally, Sagiv-Barfi explored the specificity of the T cells by transplanting two types of tumors into the mice. She transplanted the same lymphoma cancer cells in two locations, and she transplanted a colon cancer cell line in a third location. Treatment of one of the lymphoma sites caused the regression of both lymphoma tumors but did not affect the growth of the colon cancer cells. \"This is a very targeted approach,\" Levy said. \"Only the tumor that shares the protein targets displayed by the treated site is affected. We're attacking specific targets without having to identify exactly what proteins the T cells are recognizing.\" The current clinical trial is expected to recruit about 15 patients with low-grade lymphoma. If successful, Levy believes the treatment could be useful for many tumor types. He envisions a future in which clinicians inject the two agents into solid tumors in humans prior to surgical removal of the cancer as a way to prevent recurrence due to unidentified metastases or lingering cancer cells, or even to head off the development of future tumors that arise due to genetic mutations like BRCA1 and 2. \"I don't think there's a limit to the type of tumor we could potentially treat, as long as it has been infiltrated by the immune system,\" Levy said. The work is an example of Stanford Medicine's focus on precision health, the goal of which is to anticipate and prevent disease in the healthy and precisely diagnose and treat disease in the ill.

      "Content": "Sep 19, 2018 12:25AM Lucia42 wrote: Thought this sounded interesting  Canada's particle physics laboratory TRIUMF is making a push to be a future world leader in the production of a special radioactive isotope nicknamed the \"rarest drug on Earth,\" which can deliver devastating amounts of energy to single cancer cells, without harming nearby tissue. Most nuclear isotopes in medicine are used for diagnosis, by allowing scanning technology to see certain aspects of organs, bones, blood flow, and tumours. But Actinium-225 has shown promise in experimental uses on late stage cancer patients as an actual radioactive medicine that can kill cancer cells \u2014 and only cancer cells \u2014 by delivering an intense but hyper-local blast of energy. The problem, as researchers at Vancouver-based TRIUMF put it, is that Actinium-225 is the \"rarest drug on earth,\" produced only as a by-product of nuclear weapons production, or in tiny amounts in TRIUMF's own laboratory. Each year, the entire world only makes an amount equal to the weight of a few grains of sand. To illustrate its promise, they point to the successful treatment of a German man in his 70s identified only as Peter, whose metastatic prostate cancer appears to have been sent into complete remission after being treated. The idea is that a particle of Actinium-225 can be bound to a particle of a drug that selectively attaches only to cancer cells. When that happens, a sort of trigger prompts the Actinium-225 particle to decay in a cascade of \"daughter\" and \"grand-daughter\" isotopes. As it does, it releases a burst of energy that Paul Schaffer, TRIUMF's associate lab director for life sciences, compared to firing a cannonball into a pool. \"Basically you're taking a heavy particle from radioactive decay and shooting it into the cell,\" he said. That puts a lot of energy into a very small space. A particle passes through the cell, doing damage as it does so, but because its energy is expended so quickly, it only gets through one, two, maybe four cells before it dissipates. DNA and other critical parts of the cell are destroyed. The strategy is unproven and largely untested, and it has only been used as a last-ditch effort in places such as Germany, where experimental treatments like this are allowed. But slowly, medicine is building up anecdotal evidence from Actinium's use against leukemia and prostate cancer, with likely similar applications for pancreatic, colorectal and breast cancer. \"I can't overstate how much I get excited when I talk about it. It sends a chill down my spine, to be honest with you,\" said Schaffer. The problem is the production process and its reliance on nuclear weapons waste. Schaffer's project is to find another way to make it. The solution has been to use the element thorium, make it into a disk, then put it at the end of a high energy particle beam, and then slam protons into it. That causes a cascading shower of smaller elements, one of which is Actinium-225. Schaffer is a chemist, and therefore accustomed to taking stable compounds out of fridges and combining them in glassware. Now, in the nuclear world, by \"moving beyond the bottles\" to proton accelerators, he is \"transmuting\" one element into another by smashing particles together. He calls this nuclear chemistry a kind of modern \"alchemy,\" and though he means it as a metaphor, he works with equipment that literally can turn lead into gold (though not in economically viable quantities). For Actinium, the plan and hope is to partner with the reactor at Chalk River, Ont., with the goal of building a production line that could contribute perhaps a couple of kilograms of Actinium-225 per day, enough to make a serious play at the potential global market. \"We wouldn't need a new accelerator. That's the beautiful part of all this,\" Schaffer said.   ",
