I just couldn't be comfortable in a wig and I preferred to go topless, but was a bit shy about it. It was SO wonderful to decorate my head and have people stop me to chat instead of give me that sympathetic half-smile and a nod. I could not get through a shopping area or public place without being stopped or complimented . More importantly, I was having wonderful conversations with people about their stories, their cancer experience. It made me proud and confident. Anyway, through lots of encouragement, I launched my own product and I call it Sassy Head. I only have one design now, but I REALLY need some people to give it a test spin for me. It works wonderfully on my skin ( I could sleep in mine and get 2-3 days use) but everyone is different. I have a very simple website (not pretty, but it works) if you would like to try one out. I am selling these for $8.00, but if you use the dropdown next to word Standard and select BCO, it will give you a price of just $2.00 (plus 3.00 for shipping). Below are some pics. The first group was my head when I was bedazzling, and the second is my available design. I plan to do additional designs, including a pink ribbon and designs for children. Your suggestions are welcome! www.sassyhead.com  ",

Your friends and family are so gracious with their love and kindness; they will literally carry you through each step. Keep you sense of humor. When the ONC tell you to loose a few pounds before you start this....DO IT! Walk and exercise, even when you think you are too tired. Take extraordinary good care of your skin...invest in those good facial products. There is no shame in napping. Be diligent about working on your range of motion after surgery. Don't freak out over every bout of gas, headache or other issue...not everything is the cancer. Document your journey through journaling and photos, it will remind you of how far you have come! Come to the realization that you will not be the same person in one year, stop being disappointed that your hair is not the same, your clothes hang different, you make those little groaning noised when you flop in a chair. YOU ARE ALIVE and need to look forward to meeting the new you. Don't waste a minute on worrying about tomorrow...it will rob you of your joy today and prevent you from being engaged with every precious moment of your life. PS. You will receive all kinds of articles and pieces of advice on home remedies and alternative methods. Sift through them , but icing your fingers and toes through Taxol will really help minimize the damage to your nails and hand and foot syndrome!",

My hair started to grow about 4 weeks ago and it's good to have the chemo behind me. I am here to give you encouragement and to let you know you WILL get through this!  I also want to share that when  I was bald, I started 'bedazzling' my head. I just couldn't be comfortable in a wig and I preferred to go topless, but was a bit shy about it. It was SO wonderful to decorate my head and have people stop me to chat instead of give me that sympathetic half-smile and a nod. I could not get through a shopping area or public place without being stopped or complimented . More importantly, I was having wonderful conversations with people about their stories, their cancer experience. It made me proud and confident. Anyway, through lots of encouragement, I launched my own product and I call it Sassy Head. I only have one design now, but I REALLY need some people to give it a test spin for me. It works wonderfully on my skin ( I could sleep in mine and get 2-3 days use) but everyone is different. I have a very simple website (not pretty, but it works) if you would like to try one out. I am selling these for $8.00, but if you use the dropdown next to word Standard and select BCO, it will give you a price of just $2.00 (plus 3.00 for shipping). Below are some pics. The first group was my head when I was bedazzling, and the second is my available design. I plan to do additional designs, including a pink ribbon and designs for children. Your suggestions are welcome! www.sassyhead.com  ",
