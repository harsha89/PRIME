      "Content": "Jul 25, 2012 06:52AM - edited Jul 25, 2012 06:56AM by mobay1020 Hi Abby, This is the first time that I have been to this site in almost 2 years!  Which means that I don't think about my diagnosis and what I went through every day! However, I know EXACTLY what you are going through.  I was diagnosed with Stage 2 BC, ER/PR positive and Her2 Positive with one positive node in May of 2008.  I was also 36 years old and NEVER thought I would be going through what I went through. I wasn't planning on getting a mammogram until I was 40 so I am extremely grateful that I found the lump myself.  I have 2 boys who were 1 1/2 years and 4 1/2 at the time of my diagnosis.  I had a bilateral mastectomy, 3 1/2 months of chemo, 1 year of herceptin and 6 weeks of radiation. I'm not gonna lie....  it definitely wasn't fun BUT it was doable.  Fortunately, I didn't have too many side effects from anything.  About 3 days after I would do the chemo I would just really have no appetite,be lethargic and have the worst metallic taste in my mouth whenever I ate anything....  I am just telling you this so you are prepared for what lies ahead..... PLEASE try not to do too much research online. There is WAY too much information out there that will only confuse you.  Just remember that a bc diagnosis is NOT a death sentence.  There are wonderful treatments available and like everyone else said HER2 responds very well to Herceptin!!  This forum was truly a life saver for me!  I was on here every day during my treatment and it was SO helpful to talk to women that were going through the exact same thing as me.  Once you found out your exact treatment plan do a search on here and find a group that is going through the same treament. Sorry for the long post!  I promise you that once you have completed all your treatment your anxiety will gradually go away and you will not think about it every day!  For now, ask your doc for an anti-anxiety pill such as ativan or xanax and do not feel bad about taking it! I never had anxiety before diagnosis but for the first few months I had to take an ativan just to get out of bed in the morning. Also, if you are having trouble sleeping ask for sleeping pills.  I'm not sure if you are married or have a partner but if you do make sure that they can take care of the baby at night since he is so young. (congrats on him by the way)  Please know that you are not alone.  If you have any questions please private message me at any time!  And like I said before PLEASE stay on this forum.  I promise you that it will help you alot. Sending hugs and prayers from Atlanta, GA...",
