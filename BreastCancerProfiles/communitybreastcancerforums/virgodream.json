    "Content": "Mar 22, 2010 12:35AM - edited Mar 22, 2010 12:37AM by virgodream I have had three mamograms since my masectomy, and only this last one reported a surgical clip in breast.  I was confused, knowing surgical markers (from previous lumpectomy) were removed with breast tissue during masectomy, which removed all tissue down to chest wall.  Finding this blog has been illuminating, to say the least!!  I will get these recent films and take to my reconstructive surgeon.  I have only recently regained feeling under my arm, as extensive work done here to attach free tram/vein and artery.  I am now experiencing a nagging sort of pain and soreness, perhaps caused by this surgical clip??  Bra irritates also.  Nothing showed in previous mamograms.  Why?? ",
