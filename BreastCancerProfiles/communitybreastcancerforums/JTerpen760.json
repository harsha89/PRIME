No pain for all those years. Now I am having the most screaming pain in my arm pit and shoulder blade. Had every test you can imagine...all clear. Now going for theraphy. It did help for a few months but the horrible pain came back last week.  Nothing to do but scream.. Tylenol has helped some. Was told this is from a nerve under scar tissue.",
