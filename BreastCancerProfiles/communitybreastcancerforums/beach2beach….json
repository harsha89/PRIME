They will give you a list of what meds and otc that you have to stop taking before surgery, but I would ask your surgeon if something to relax you, like Ativan, the night before would help you to at least get some sleep.

I didnt know about chemo until after surgery and had the Oncotype Dx test done and of course the sentinel node biopsy. If you care to tell anyone, just say you will be doing whatever is necessary for you to do and that you are waiting for all the information. You appreciate their concern but you'd like to continue working and not think about it all day. (hard not to anyway but no one should add to it) Glad you are going away. Do it. Staying home won't make you feel any better so better off trying to keep your mind off of it. Even a few minutes of every half hour of not thinking about it, is a relief. You will be ok.",

Hopefully when you call a surgeon they can get you in this week since you already have your reports and hormonal receptors. When I first made a call to 2 surgeons, this was back in early July, to have an opinion on surgery. one could see me in Sept? really? The other in 2 days. Guess who I took. Had my surgery. I get a call at end of August from the the Dr who had appt in Sept. They had a cancellation, did I want to come in. Ummmm, too late. ",

I always thought since then that if it happened to me I would do a mastectomy, but you never know until you face it. Im 51, When my dr told me, she said I could do a lumpectomy with rads. I told her flat out, I wanted a bilateral. I have dense breasts and have numerous biopsies which until now were always benign. I also knew I would be riddled with more anxiety having to be monitored every 6mths alternating between MRI and Mammo/Sono. My left had always been the troublesome one with biopsies, yet the right popped up with cancer out of the blue. I had enough anxiety once a year. Funny thing is after my sister was dx I was told I was higher risk so i was approved for MRI's which i did and alternated every 6mths. After 3 years my ins said I was no longer high risk, go figure. 2yrs later I was dx. Perhaps had they let me continue I could have been dx\"d earlier. Anyway, it is a very personal decision. It may sound strange but I had no attachment to my boobs. I went into survival mode and felt I was doing the most I could do to make me feel better mentally.. Due to lack of fat to use and tight skin I could not do expanders or Diep. My ps used the smallest implant he had(similar to my former size anyway) and had it done at time of surgery. I have no regrets, it is what worked for me mentally. You will figure out what works for you.",

In the first few weeks I had a little discharge, that cleared up. Bit of a headache which I noted occurred when the med would peak at about 5hours, that went away also. I moved around when I take the pill so that if any affect would happen, it would occur while I slept. Has it changed my quality of life? The answer is no for me. Whatever I feel from it, I refuse to let it get the better of me, so far so good with keeping it like that. I walk a lot of miles, and try to keep thinking I am doing the most I can in keeping this from recurring. You are still dealing with the news. I did not know definitively the status of my nodes until after surgery/pathology. They did not expect to find anything, and I was fortunate enough that it did turn out clean. I opted for a mastectomy so I did not have any radiation. The Oncotype DX test, which most do now, will also give your team the information needed if chemo would benefit you or not. It is hard not to worry about recurrence, but I've heard from so many that as time goes by and you are back to living life again, that you will spend less time worrying.",

There is a forum/thread on here about LCIS. in my own pathology in the same specimen I had ILC, LCIS and DCIS. So invasive and in situ. Perhaps he is just being cautious since she did have an aggressive cancer prior and he wants to have a second set of eyes review and give an opinion. I would also suggest the Johns Hopkins ask an expert site. There is a breast issue site with different forums. You can ask a question and get a response from an expert within a day or two.

Great that the nodes were clear, though I'm unsure on what they mean when they say they are doing further testing. They actually took a piece of the node out or did they do a needle biopsy on it? Depending on what the factors come back at they will suggest what options you have Whether lumpectomy, chemo etc. Wish you had someone to go with you...to take notes. I know we hear what they say but we don't always process it because we are in shock..then it helps that notes were taken. I'd ask when they expect to have the type and hormonal factors back on the tumor. What's the size, grade? What do my options at this point look like? Will genetic testing be advised? What are you looking for in the nodes if the initial biopsy came back clear? Once you have more information, you will have a plan formulated and feel like you can take control again.

Friends sometimes fade away also. Even if there is only one person who is there, that's worth more than 10 \"meh\" people in your life. Don't bank on chemo just yet. Wait until all the stats come back. I had no idea if it was on the table or not until after surgery and the OncotypeDx test. We all may not be able to physically help but I will say mentally I have gotten a lot from being on here, even if no one personally directed a response to me. Take that shovel with you everywhere you go, sling *hit around and plow through best you can right now. I say go with the pissed off feeling,,that's what worked for me too.

I felt that with my luck I would eventually have to do a mastectomy anyway so I opted for it from the get go. No regrets. Many women choose lump and rads. I'm sure you will find much info there. I personally had no problems with recovery. I was up and out next day. No pain killers were given and I was back at work in 3 weeks. I would look and post in the lumpectomy forum. Threads on lump vs mastectomy. Rads, etc. You will find many differing opinions, some that can sound scary but it doesnt mean your choice will turn out the same. Everyone is different.

If you know they will give you pain meds, would be helpful to have the script filled before. Otherwise the hospital pharmacy should be able to fill it for you and have it ready when you leave.",

Married 26years He's a good father, I could never complain about that. Around 8 years ago , after my trying therapy etc, to find what was the problem with me, I found out it was not just me, but him also. He's never taken part of the blame. He blames me totally for my lack of not \"being in love\" with him anymore. Anyway, he has pretty much told me the same, he is angry that i would get half of what we have. I have worked f/t then to p/t during our marriage and raising 3 kids. Still work p/t. My biggest concern is healthcare. I don't get it working p/t. I've been looking for f/t. When I expressed to him about my concern over losing healthcare, his reply was that i should not have thrown all my cards out on the table in regards to going out separate ways. I guess I just never thought how bad it was until I found out I had BC. When I told him, he replied, that sucks. I went through biopsy alone. Dr. visits alone. When it came back positive still the same unresponsive person. Not even a how are you handling this question. I had decided to do a double mastectomy. I made the mistake of trying to pull some compassion out of him and said do you think I will be ok, his reply, of course, you know how you over exaggerate things. I scheduled suregy. Asked if he was coming. He said did I want him to. Did not think I would ever hear that reply to a surgery when i am the mother of your 3 kids who are worried. Forbid something happend during surgery. They should hear any information from him, not from one of my girlfriends who insisted on being there for me. He Never, Ever asked me how I felt. How I was doing. Never went to a dr. appt, not onco appt. never asked how results came out. Still almost a year out, never a word about it. I could not belive that regardless of our situation that he could not even muster up enough compassion for me to ask. A roommate I believe would get more. Maybe it's me, but it really put things even in clearer perspective that I would not be able to rely on him. My youngest will be starting his last year of H.S. in the fall. That's what I was waiting for. I honestly feel I would rather be alone and lonely than sharing a home with someone and still feeling alone and lonely. Yeah, so I get where you are coming from. I hope you have support from family and friends. You will get through this either way. You will find the strength. Whatever crisis someone goes through can be such a defining moment on relationships with family, friends etc. You learn a lot. I wish you benign results.",

It will be a year for me this August(surgery) but I was diagnosed in July. I opted for direct implants at the time of surgery. luckily for me I did not have a rough time with surgery or recovery. Everyone is so different. I have 3kids. 23,21 and 17. I didn't tell them until I knew everything I possibly could about my status and then told them I was doing what I felt was the most I could do for myself and planned on being around here for a while. I tried to make them feel the least stressed as I possibly could. My daughter took it harder than my sons. Did they tell you the size of the area? I had the OncotypeDx test done after surgery and it came back as a 9. So no chemo for me. Depending on all the factors in your case, you may indeed have surgery and then wait until that test comes back. Ask the surgeon if he/she does that. And you are correct, YOU WILL GET THROUGH THIS!",

Good with the initial going in,,,handled the pulling sensation, the punch biopsy..but when they stopped, they couldnt get the bleeding to stop. Tiny little nurse was practically putting all her weight down on the area to stop the bleeding and to hopefully prevent a hematoma(luckily it did). Took over 30 min before they would let me go and bound me up pretty tight with an ace bandage. Once the lidocaine wore off,,that sucker hurt and hurt for days. *edited to add....*I think it may well have to do with how deep they have to go to where the area is. Keep icing! ",

They did not offer pain killers and I was ok with that. They used Ketoralac which is like heavy duty tylenol before and after and it must have done the trick.

Why wouldn't you be able to do everything that you did before? You'll work your way back up to punching the bag at full force in no time I'm sure. As for boating, that sounds super relaxing, what better way to relax and recoup. You'll be around for those kiddos. You're taking control and moving forward the best way you can for you. I bet the hardest part will be not being able to squeeze those kids super tight for a while, but that will pass also. I didn't know what to expect either , and still am in shock I think but I stand by my decision for doing the bmx because mentally I just couldn't do it the other way. I did an implant right at surgery, I was too small boobed with not enough tissue to stretch for anything bigger than what I had to begin with. I told the PS if at surgery time, you can't make anything work, just sew me up. I'm in it to survive, for my kids and me. I'd get over it. You'll do great and be back in no time.",

In my case my Breast surgeon sent it out after we went over my pathology report at my post-op visit. It takes about 7-10days and it looks over a small amount of your tumor tissue. It goes over a number of cancer genes in the tissue and gives information regarding the chances of your breast cancer returning and the likelihood that you may or may not benefit from chemo. Ask your surgeon if he/she will be sending your sample out. You are going to do great with surgery...no doubt. :)",

When I go back for 3mth check I'm going to ask pro's/cons of leaving them in, take out or do the shots and switch. Not sure if age has anything to do with it either.",

Now if he can get a job and start paying for himself!!! House seemed big enough when they were small with all their toys now they are adults and have as many sneakers/shoes as toys and house is too small! My right armpit seems to be the slowest in healing. Still feel the nerve pain. Only had sentinel node taken out on both sides but this side taking longer. Tamoxifen is killing my sinuses and any other tissues with moisture! I use chapstick constantly. Tamoxifen dries me out. Also makes me a cheap date. Seems now if I have a drink, one feels like two and so on. I can get tipsy cheaply. lol Would love to hear from you all!",

I am more like your DD in that I kept it primarily to myself. I told my sis.

Did not tell my parents until 2 days before, and my friends until day of. Call me strange but I did not want anyone giving me the \"oh you poor thing\". I think it is great you opened up here for yourself and to better help you understand and maybe even your daughter. Everyone processes differently. Would be helpful if she does have someone with her when she meets with the surgeon, someone who can take notes and even ask questions. I know it helped me.

I also have the ridges from the implant that you can see...now that's a turn on..lol. Oh and they have dropped..My scar is no longer under my boob it has risen! I give up. I still look in the mirror and would have liked to have seen a little bigger boobage just to say I had it but it was not meant to be. They don't look bad in a bikini top...better than what I had. Now if the scars would just go....... I'm with someone now, but I wonder if I wasn't if anyone would be completely turned off by what they say. I know we should say, then they are not genuine, or worth the trouble if they can't accept, but society has made it such front page stuff in magazines etc, that it's hard to not think about it.

Just like Peace said, If it winds up being positive, it does not mean it has spread any further. The lymph system is designed to catch things like this to contain it. Even with negative nodes there's always the fear that some renegade sneaky cells have spread.

Yeah, I knew that wasn't for me. I had so much anxiety as it was just getting mammo/sono every year. My sister had BC at 48, she is 9 years NED, that played in my decision too as well as that I was small boobed to begin with and taking a chunk out of it would leave me looking like a shark bite. I also knew I'd be constantly worrying that sooner or later I would have to do it anyway. That's just me. i had no regrets doing a double mx. Because I'm thin and my skin is tight according to the PS, I could not do a DIEP or expanders, so I went straight with implants, also had nipple sparing. It was a year ago yesterday I had surgery. Doing well. Scars fading. Am I 100% in love with the look of my new foobs? To be honest, I'm ok with them.

I was in such a daze when I got the call, and mys surgeon told me the options I had, lumpectomy w/radiation then 6mth follow ups, I stopped her right there and said I knew I would have a dbl mx. I personally couldn't think about doing 6mth to 6mth. I already had previous biopsies, dense breasts, my sister had bc (braca negative) , and mentally i knew a dble mx was right for me. She asked if I would consider reconstructive, I said maybe. She told me to go, and just hear him out. I went that Mon. Luckily I took a friend because I heard very little of what he said. All I knew is I wanted the bc out and figure out what was next. Before I left, he spoke with my breast surgeon and said they would try to book me for the following Tues. When I got the call on Weds. that I was ER+/PR+ and Her2-, It all moved so fast. I couldnt even process it all never mind me telling the kids. By the time I told them, like I said previously I knew the most I would know until after final pathology. Then its nodes you wait for info on and final pathology which for me was when I went for follow up 6days later. For me that changed from IDC, to ILC,DCIS and LCIS. woohoo. All still in a 7mm area. Who called you? Gyn? Radiologist? Breast Surgeon? Maybe some of them lose a bit of their bedside manners when it comes to dealing with giving patients the news. Almost matter of fact like manner. I know , sorry I am blathering on, but go with your gut and get a second opinion.(id say withing a reasonable timeframe though) Ask all your questions, get all your info and then decide what to do and when the right time is.

If so, then yes it means because you are hormone receptor positive you are a candidate for Tamoxifen or one of the AI's at the point in time of your treatment they say. Being Her2- is also favorable. Her2+ is an over expression of the gene that tells cells to divide more rapidly. Said to be more aggressive. So being negative is favorable. Though if one is HER2+ they now have Herceptin which they can use. BCO has information on it all also for a more detailed explanation. Hope this helps.",

I cried my eyes out for 3 days off and on every time I thought about telling them, not being here for them etc. It's so much to think about when you first find out so give yourself some time to think it through. I personally waited until I had all my information, my hormone status etc, and knew what the plan was, then I told my kids. Its a very personal choice. My boys took it ok, my daughter broke down, and I was expecting that with her. I really just tried to reassure them that I was doing what I thought was best for me, and I plan on being here for a long time and that I wanted the older two to go back to college and know I would be ok here. I didn't want my dx to consume them like it did to me. I told them how important it was for them to keep moving forward. My youngest is in H.S. Hugs... ",

Throwing everything at certain types of BC's that are looked as having a low occurrence is why the OncotypeDx comes in handy. To show that benefits may not outweigh the risks. Even if we could choose what types of treatment, if any, that we would want there is no guarantee that throwing everything at it or nothing at all would be the right choice. Everyone is different.

I'd say that is with prep and putting you under and recovery so I'd think you shave off quite a bit of time because you don't have recovery as long. You have to wait prob long enough to make sure bleeding is controlled etc. Ive had several biopsies and I'd say they equaled the same in pain for me as actual surgery. I remember the feeling of pulling sensations afterwards. I iced it. Never took more than advil or tylenol. Even for mastectomy they didn't use pain killers...just heavy duty tylenol and recovery wasn't too bad. I'd see if you can bring in headphones to listen music through.

You may not even need chemo as what has already been stated, depending on all your factors which hopefully you will find out soon what your ER/PR and HER 2 status are, the size and grade. You'll get more information on Monday and quite possibly once you know what you are dealing with and have plan in place, you might just be able to relax a bit and enjoy some of that vacation.",

July 5th mammo/Sono, biopsy on left following week. 2days later find benign changes and radial scar. Super stressed and freaking! Meet with bs surgeon. Set up to do excisional biopsy to remove it. Meanwhile 2days before going in for a savi scout(a metal implant so they can find where the biopsy is during surgery) find out medical team that works at hospital reviews my records and see a mass not noted on my mammo report that was seen on ultrasound. (By another imaging facility) Have another biopsy and find out IDC. By Sono 8mm. Finding out that as i was driving up headed up for a concert weekend with my soulmate(corny I know). Surgeon gave me options. I decided a BMX, my sis had bc at 48(9 years ago) and I can't go through 6 months of living to 6 months with MRI/Sono. Within 10min I had a call from a plastic surgeon. Set appt for This past Monday. Took a friend for notes. I'm still in shock. Been crying ever since. I have 3kids 22,20 and 16. Can't imagine not being here for them. Feel like I was was just getting my life on track. Surreal. I'm a high strung person to begin with. I've lost about 9lbs since this all started. Get a call this morning from the bs surgeon, pathology on idc is er+,pr+,her neg. said will do Oncotype and SNB at surgery. Have surgery next Tues Aug 8th.(1 week to the day my youngest turns 16) So scared it's unbelievable. Scared of surgery, pathology on what else might be found, nodes, chemo, whatever may lie ahead. And of course of the unknown future. You all seem terrific and I know this a club we didn't want to belong in. I'd have taken the 🍷 and 🍺 club myself. Still have to tell my kids. Until I knew exactly I didn't want to tell them. Worried most for my daughter who is 20. We are very close. I want them to stay focused when they go back up to school. After multiple knee surgeries this is the first semester she will finally be able to play soccer at college. I don't want to be the cause of any disruption for them and for them to give up anything. Her and one of my sons had to go to wakes this week for two women who died iof bc And I have to tell them about me ? THis going to be hard.   ",

Guess it was almost always given of Chemo years ago, and now they know it does not always offer additional benefits in some cases.

It's hard to keep positive, think for most our mind goes to dark places naturally. We fear the worst. Until you get it checked, keep trying to keep yourself distracted. There are other things it could be. Getting it checked out is the best thing you can do, and hey, if someone says..you came to me for this little thing? Well that would be a good sign wouldn't it. :) Many women post they found lumps themselves or by mammo/sono and need biopsies and they turn out benign. Let's keep looking that way for you.

I know the difference in what youre saying is that yours was a distortion seen on MRI and was labeled either one or the other so why wouldn't they just surgically remove it. Whereas mine they did not know. She thought it may have been a return of sclerosing adenosis. Either way she said a biopsy had to be done.Yes the phone call from my radiologist was the same it's all benign BUT....with a radial scar they would want that removed yadda. (Boy did I dissect every benign medical term on my pathology report,, must have had 5 in addition to the radial scar. )So off to the breast surgeon I went. One would think that something that is 4mm, and is vacuum biopsied it would have all come out and then some. There was no lesion left but the concern is that in a small percentage of cases there can be cancer hiding close by. The reason to have an excisional biopsy is to get a larger area around the area of concern and if it comes back positive that there are large enough clear margins. At least that is how I remember it being explained to me even though I was, of course, freaking out \"benign\" findings and \"most unlikely to be cancer\". Frightening unless its just plain and simple benign without buts. I'd like to add, as you know already, my breast cancer had nothing to do with the radial scar. Opposite breasts. Had the team of my breast surgeon not looked thoroughly over my sono, noted that the initial radiologist made no mention of the distortion in my right and thought it was a good idea to biopsy it the day I went in for preop for the to be surgery for the radial scar in the left, i would not be on here answering this now. I would not have known I had breast cancer. That core biopsy saved my life. You could say the one on the left did also. Had it not been something they were suspicious of, I would not have had anything done.",

The test also gives values of ER/PR and HER2, but states it uses a different system to measure it. Again, my Onco and breast surgeon just told me..score of 9 no chemo, just tamoxifen.

I'm a fairly private person, mainly I hear everyone else's troubles etc, so I don't even bother with mine. I told only my very closest friends,(and that wasn't until a day before surgery) I don't know, I just did not think I could handle all the sad faces and the keep positive comments that I would get. I know people mean well, but i had to deal with this the way I felt I best could. Months later, I have co-workers who do not know. Many friends I know they know from my other friends, but most have kept it to themselves. My lovely college-aged daughter had posted an instagram pic of me from surgery day(after surgery) with a loving post of being a strong warrior. This was in October. Love her to pieces but could have strangled her lol. I started to get calls from acquaintances because their son/daughter is friends with mine and saw the pic and told them. Last thing did I want to do but field calls or have people come up to me on Halloween as their younger kids trick-or-treated at my house and bringing it up that they saw it and how sorry they are etc. Guess I'm saying tell who you want, don't feel bad if you feel keeping it limited. If and when you are ready to tell others, you will, if not, not. Everyone deals in a different way. ",

When I was dx'd I had been seeing my breast surgeon for over 10yrs for yearly check up due to family history of bc and my having previous benign lumps. I decided on a bmx rather than a lumpectomy. She recommended a PS who i saw within a few days after being dx'd. I was also small breasted. The PS had told me since I did not have much fat, my skin was also too tight that I was not a candidate for DIEP and he did not think expanders would be the right way to go. He was afraid with my skin. I went nipple sparing and direct to implant. So I'm not much bigger than I was before, I'm probably a low end B right now but when I last saw him he said I could swap them out for a little larger one,,my skin has some room. I doubt I will do that. My dr's were both located on Long Island. You have a history with your dr, that's certainly something to consider, but ultimately you have to go with your gut and consider what you would want the end result to look like. Sometimes many years of experience isn't everything if they are not progressive with what is going on now with options.",
