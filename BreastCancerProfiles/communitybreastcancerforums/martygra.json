I have had some problems sleeping so I will take 2 tylenol pm's before bed and sometime I take a Lorazepam.  My hair started to go on day 14, be prepared for that.  I had a wig lined up and went and got my hair cut short and directly started wearing the wig. My head was sore and itchy for about a week but now it is ok.  I have had a tender mouth, no actual sores but difficulty eating anything cruncy.  Taste buds not what they should be.  I rinse my mouth with the salt/soda/water mixture.  I use a super soft toothbrush and biotine toothpaste and mouth rinse.  My feet were sore on the bottoms for about 4 of 5 days after the third session but it went away and has not came back.  The tips of my fingers have been sore for a couple of weeks,  I would say about a 4 on a scale of 1-10 pain scale, helps to cut your finger nails short.  That is all the problems I have had.  I will be having my first session of taxol on 11/23 and am hoping it will go so well. I have not had any bone pain from the nuelesta shot that I have gotten the day after each chemo session. I did take claritin as I had read that it helped. I asked the chemo nurse about that and she said she had heard that also, she said it could not hurt. I do not know if that is why I have no bone pain or not.  I have not had to miss any work due to not feeling well from chemo I work Mon - Friday through Thursay 10 hour days 6:00 am to 4:30 pm. I am wishing you the best and I am sure you will find out that it is not as bad as your mind has been imaging it will be. Take care.",
