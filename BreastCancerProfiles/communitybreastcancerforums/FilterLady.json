I was prepared for pain but the radiologist said I'm going to rub some numbing stuff (I'm calling it stuff since I can't remember exactly how she put it, lol), then I'll use a needle about the size of what is used for a TB test (very short) and inject some medicine that will numb deeper.  Then she said she would use a bigger needle to do the deepest numbing. She asked me to tell her when I was ready, I said go ahead.  After the first step, she told me she was getting ready to use the little needle and I might feel a sting for a second.  I felt nothing.  Then she said she was going to use the big one and that I might feel a bigger sting.  I then said go ahead and she said \"I'm done\".  I truly felt nothing. The worst part of it all was having to lay on my right side on that table and keep my arms above my head, lol.  My foot actually went to sleep! When the wires were inserted, I had to go to the mammo room to verify the placement, I actually saw on the monitor the wires.  The tech was so apologetic but I told her I wanted to see it! The excisional biopsy was a walk in the park!  I was home by 1pm and never even needed any pain medication! You'll do fine....waiting is truly the hardest part. Take care! LaDonna",

Truebff....those tornadoes are scary.  I live in east central Mississippi and we got a storm shelter installed on our property after Hurrican Katrina.  We've only had to go in it once, thank goodness.  At least with hurricanes you get a good advance warning.  I was raised in Pascagoula on the coast and my parents live about 5 miles from the beach and got over 3 ft of water in their home.  Some people don't realize the power of that water.  There is not much warning for those tornadoes! I just celebrated 9 years of not smoking.  It was easy for me to quit when I thought I had lung cancer due to a bad report from pre-op xrays.  Turned out I was on the verge of having emphysema.  That's all I had to hear, I put them down that day and have not smoked since then.  I try not to say never but I will say I hope I won't ever smoke again.  I don't intend to! I too, am trying to lose some weight, exercise more, etc. to try to be healthier and am looking forward to the day that I don't have to worry about my granddaughters being diagnosed with breast cancer.",

My DH went with me to see the breast surgeon to set up an excisional biopsy.  The morning of the biopsy, I went to my radiologist to get the wire localization done then to surgery.  My DH was there holding my hand and supporting me.  He's a great note taker and he loved having a \"job\" since he felt so helpless. I told the surgeon I wanted my results over the phone and then would come in for a regular post surgery appt.  I got my results 2 days later and found out that it was in fact bc.  My DH was outside trying to stay busy and when we got the results, he was much more upset than I.  I got the results on a Friday so we had a few days for it to soak in and start preparing our questions.  I called my family and my DH called some of our friends and that helped too. He has been there for my appts, tests, surgery since and he can think up some good questions.  He went with me for several radiation appts and really understood how things work when the techs let him come back while I was getting \"zapped\" so that he could see and ask questions about them. He continues to go to follow up appts even though I tell him it's okay.  Maybe he'll be better with time.  He tries not to let me know he's worried but I know.  I let him do the worrying, lol. We attend our local breast cancer support group as do several other husbands.  My DH wants to know everything and it helps me to know if I forget to ask something, he's there with notes in hand to do so. The most important thing is to get him involved (if he wants to)so that he understands every phase of your tests, treatments (if any).  Also, get all copies of your test results and surgery since you can both refer back to those results when you see other doctors like your family doctor. Take care and let us know how you are doing. God bless you, LaDonna",

He told me if I had not heard from his office by that Friday (2 days post surgery) to call and he would see if the results were in.  I called and had to leave a message.  His nurse called back about 2 hours later and said he needed to speak to me.  I knew then it was bc.  He told me and answered all my questions.  Hubby was out working in the yard and I called him after the surgeon told me. It really devastated him and my sons.  My mind was already in \" okay what am I going to do to fix this\" mode. We met with the surgeon the next week and got everything scheduled for October 5.  Preop testing on October 3 revealed suspicious mass in my left lung.  My Momma died of lung cancer so this really threw me for a loop, hubby was out of town working and I didn't tell him since he could not do anything.  I was already scheduled to get sential node injection on October 4 so a CT was scheduled before the sn injection.  I was so upset but didn't want to tell anyone and have them panic...I was doing enough of that.  But my dear daughter-in-law is going to college to be a nurse and I called her to let her know what was going on.  My son is a OTR truck driver and out of town so I did not want to tell him much.  My daughter-in-law left class to be with me during CT and sn injection.  Results of CT, indeterminate but suspect granuloma.  I had surgery on October 5, then PET Scan on October 24, granuloma diagnosis.  I have a follow up CT in March but both RO and MO are not concerned, they said it's common and we'll just watch it. I'll have my last radiation treatment (#35) this Thursday and I'm ready to ring that bell!  I have family and friends coming to celebrate the day with me!  Thanks to places like this and the breast cancer support group my hubby and I attend, we did it!  What a journey this continues to be!  There are lots of strong women on these boards!",

Then I had to get taken to the surgery center (1 block away) by ambulance (due to liability issues) and I had to wait about 20 minutes before I was taken to surgery.   I'm not a scardy cat but it really was the most pain free procedure I've ever had.  Heck a pap smear hurt worse than that wire localization.  I have a great doctor and the fact that the patient before me was in her 70's and came out smiling didn't hurt either!

Everyday that she does not smoke is a reason to celebrate.....I pray she quits for good. Wren, I take an antidepressant too.  My problems were not being able to go back to sleep thinking about my breast cancer, and the million other things going on....so my MO prescribed one and it's been wonderful to be able to get a full nights sleep again.  Congrats on not smoking!

I was diagnosed at 55 on a screening mammogram.  I had an excisional biopsy to make the diagnosis then had a left lumpectomy and sentiel lymph node biopsy.  My cancer was caught very early and I had 35 radiation treatments and remain NED since! I have to tell you that your life will never be the same.....but for me it meant a good thing.  I really realized what was and was not important to me.  I also quit letting things I cannot control stress me out.  The best gift you can give yourself is to focus on YOU!  You will have important decisions to make and you need to gather all the info you can (this includes getting copies of EVERYTHING) from your doctors, ie test results, pathology to be able to make a decision that is right for YOU!  If possible it would help you to have someone accompany you to any appointments so they can take notes since it's very easy to forget some details. Start tonight writing down any and all questions you can think of to ask your medical team.  If you don't have someone you think can accompany you to appointments, please ask your doctor if there is a patient advocate that you can speak to or call your local American Cancer Society.  There is a lot of help available but you cannot get it if you don't know to ask. The last thing I want to say is please, please, please continue to read these boards and ask any questions you think of since the women on the boards have certainly had experience is most anything you ask about.  I never thought I would be in my new \"happy place\" when I was first diagnosed but the not knowing all the info and the waiting is the worst! God bless you, LaDonna",

My surgeon said he would perform as masectomy if that's what I chose but he recommended the lumpectomy and radiation since the 5 year survival rate was the same for both.  My thinking was, I could do the \"little surgery\" now and IF I ever needed to, I could do the \"big surgery\" in the future. It is a decision that you have to make and you have to do what's best for you.  My surgeon wanted my husband to come with me to get all the facts then said \"y'all talk it over but it is her decision in the end\".  My husband said he would support whatever decision I thought was best. I finished radiation on January 19th and started taking letrozole the next day.  I feel better each day and am looking forward to having my whole family here for Easter.  I go to our local breast cancer support group meeting each month and continue to be inspired by the people there.  My husband goes as well as a few other husbands.   Everyone on these boards are wonderful and I continue to learn from them every day.  There is nothing you can't ask so don't be afraid or embarrased to ask, as someone here has no doubt experienced it.

I and my DH both have become very involved with raising funds for research, we go to a breast cancer support group (they've been my rock too) and try to raise awareness of the importance of regular health screenings for everyone. I was diagnosed on 9/16/11 and my DH and I decided that we needed to do whatever we could to make this journey as easy as possible for us both.  Our town has a great day of celebration, fund raising, etc every October for breast cancer awareness month. My DH ran in a high heel race for men and I entered the decorate an umbrella contest for survivors.  He looked so funny running in those heels.  There was even 1 man that dressed up as well.  I won second place in the umbrella contest.  It was a great day and I really didn't realize how many people come out to support the cause. We made it a family affair at our Relay for Life.  Me, my DH, our younges son, my brother from out of town, his daughter and her son really had a great time.  My nieces Momma lost her battle with brain cancer in January.  I got to walk my first survivors lap and this year the survivors walked a half lap and then their caregivers walked the last half lap with them.  The survivors wore purple shirts and the caregivers had a purple sash....which I hope my DH will wear when he runs in those high heels this year!

I see my MO and RO every 4 months and my GP every 6 months. Some may think that's a lot but it sure gives me that \"warm fuzzy\" when I continue to get a NED report! God bless y'all, LaDonna",

My regular mammo followed by ultrasound that \"found\" my bc was 1 year ago tomorrow.  I can't believe how far I've traveled and in 2 weeks I'll have my first post diagnosis mammo on 9/12. Time drags while you are awaiting a diagnosis but after that time flies as you take the steps needed to a better, stronger self. Come here anytime to vent, ask questions, cry, and most of all learn from many other women who have \"been there, done that\". (((((((((((((hugs)))))))))) to you. LaDonna",

I've been doing spring cleaning (yikes, 65 degrees here today and 75 tomorrow)early so I have been getting some exercise.  Our 4 grandchildren were here last Sunday and we spent the day playing outside then too.  But I really need to get in a routine of using the treadmill again.  I've also been watching what I eat especially portion sizes.  I love veggies and like most except beets, spinach, radishes and maybe a few more.  Never tried Kale but the chips sound like something I'd like to try.  My DH loves almost all foods so that's not an issue.

Do you have a friend or relative that can go with you?  Asking for Xanax is not a bad idea either.  The scans need to be done so you can get a firm diagnosis and you don't need to have a lot of stress and high blood pressure before it.  I'm praying for good reports and that you can get something to help you with the anxiety before the tests.
