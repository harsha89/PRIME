I developed lymphoedema in right (affected) breast straight away during radiotherapy, but in November last year my left armpit started hurting, I have been to GP (primary care in UK) twice, she referred me back to the breast surgeon who said there is no sign of recurrence - but gave me no explanation of why the pain was there. Does anybody have any experience of this or any ideas what it could be?  I am back to GP tomorrow to see what next. Thank you all who reply.
