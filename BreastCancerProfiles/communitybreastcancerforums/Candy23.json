My dad thought it was a waste of money because they got me nowhere. My mom told me to just wait and see if it would go away but it never did and the pain just kept on coming. It even hurts to wear a bra at times i have to wear a strapless one because the ones with straps bother the lump. All I really want is for this lump to go away soon. If possible I want it removed :(",

It gets huge when I'm in my period and then goes small again when it's over. This one time though I got in a fight with someone and I was really upset and the lump started hurting really bad I felt like someone was squishing it almost trying to pop it. Also my arm started to hurt and it just went numb (my arm). The pain is unbearable at times. And I just have no idea what I might have I went to the doctors but they don't tell me much. I am only 17 about to be 18 in couple months. Does anyone know what it might be? Log in to post a reply",

They told me they need a tissue sample of it but that that's a risky thingy to do. They said I could just let it go away by itself but like I said its almost been a year with it now. And well thank you for trying to help.",

I think I am going to do the biopsy just to get the worry out the way and see if they can remove it because the pain really bothers me. I will let you know how things go with that.",
