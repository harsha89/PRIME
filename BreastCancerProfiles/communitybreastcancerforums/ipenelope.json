I had prepec tissue expanders (TE) placed at time of mastectomies. I wasn't taking any narcotics and have a huge issue with passenger anxiety so I drove part way home from the hospital. It was challenging due to difficulty turning head because my chemo port was placed and hurt if I turned my head to much, I was also limited on range of motion in my arms obviously. I was off work for a month due to wt restrictions. Everyone and every doctor is different on restrictions. Do what you can in the limitations you are given. If you feel up to going and doing things do it, just remember the surgery is a major surgery and your body will need time to recover, physically and mentally!! Best of luck!!üòä ~Katieüíó",

I tell people chemo didn't take my hair, I did and chemo is just making it come back alot slower than I'd like. Im with you with the eye brows and lashes and looking sick, that was my biggest worry with those going, I never wanted to look sick and be pitied. I call my head my que ball with peach fuzz, because I'm really pale, and I go without a covering 95%of the time. Partially because the hot flashes and the warm weather are too much and the other reason is because I'm proud, kinda, of the peach fuzz look because it shows I have fought a hard battle and at this point I'm beating cancer and it's not beating me. All you'll ladies are so strong!! The hair is a hard issue to handle but just remember it will come back and it will be a sign that this seriously crappy card we've all been dealt didn't beat us, we beat it!! ~Katie üíó",

Right now your body needs rest to heal but maybe try to go for a small walk daily to see if that helps. Do you do any crafts that can keep your mind busy without being too taxing on your body?? Reading?? Crocheting?? Knitting?? Puzzles?? Bev- I'm sorry you have so much on your plate right now between trying to recover abs help your husband. I like dogrunners suggestion in seeing what services are available to you to help you abs your husband out. I had bmx and thankfully did not have the depression issues you ladies are going through but I had so much going on that i did not have time to sit and think about what happened to me. Women tie their femininity with their breasts so having then removed, with or without temporary or permanent ones is not the same, it is a loss and has to be mourned as one. You both are very strong and will get through this!! Thoughts, prayers, and long distance hugs ü§óü§ó to both of you ladies during this challenging time!!

I chose BMX when received the dx as my aunt did the unilateral mastectomy and chemo and sadly got it in the other breast worse only 5 years after the first and sadly lost her battle. Bottom line you have to do what you feel is right and what you feel you can mentally and physically handle!! So many thoughts and prayers going your way for the mental strength to research and make the best decision for you!! Countca- many of us recently done wth the liquid hell are feeling our SEs more as wre get farther out, possibly related to no longer having the premeds hiding our SEs?!? Keep an eye in your symptoms and make sure your not getting sick!! Good luck! This topic is being discussed in the weekly taxol group to. ~Katie üíó",

You wouldn't want one that you would have to pull the arm or any button for as stretching and engaging your chest area can ne painful, and the electric ones that recline enough to be comfortable to sleep in are really expensive. I went to Sam's club and bought 3 body pillows and 2 packs of 2 pillows and i literally cocooned myself and it actually worked really well.
