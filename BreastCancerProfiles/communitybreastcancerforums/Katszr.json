I have been lucky and it is not that sore and they only ever neede to deal with one air pocket. Not showering, sleeping in a recliner, having to have the device in there have been irritating but livable. Best advice I can give is keep a soft small pillow under your arm as much as possible. One of those soft beenie neck pillows would work great. My hole was never sore due to the use of the pillow. My worst pain has been the incision from the removal of two lymph nodes. Today the skin is a little tender and pink but tomorrow is my last day. I would totally do this over full breast radiation. Not fun, not as easy as SAvi sister site has you believe. But doable.",

Would have preferred to not have the 26 th off cuz I'd be done today.   Did you feel the radiation on the last few treatments? I did some and had a nerve that \"screams\" out every now and then. Doc confirmed it could be a nerve affected. Still not unbearable.  Today after the CT they had to deal with an \"air pocket \" but it didn't hurt too much.   I found out though yesterday that one of my Aunts was BRCA2 positive so now I need gene testing. If I am positive I will have them remove my ovaries. Already had the other stuff out during a partial hysterectomy.  Bummer, huh? It is kinda a game changer. ",

Yes...the gene testing is looming over my head like a very dark cloud and hard to feel good till I know one way or the other on that. I really lost it after todays appointment. The PA for the surgeon is also the same person that was the one to tell me the \"first\" bad news after the biopsy. She is not \"mean\" but not diplomatic or empathetic at all in how she delivers information. When I told her that I might be BRCA2 and that I know it is a \"game changer\" I asked her what they feel about it and she looked me straight in the eye and said. \"We recommend double mastectomy and removal of your ovaries\". Said in the same way as \"we recommend you wear a coat when it is cold outside\". I just stared at hera minute...then imagined how good it would feel to punch her in the face...(I did not of course) and then told her, well... I will wait to talk to the genetic counselors and that I hope just keeping an eye on my breasts and the ovaries out would be enough. I truly pictured punching her. I think it was the \"fright or flight\" instinct.",

The device doesn't feel comfortable, but it isn't too bad. Worth it! I even drove myself in today! I am ok on just tylenol now. I will be glad when it is removed and I can just heal back up though. Tired of being careful of it and making sure it doesn't get bumped. It all kinda rubs stuff that is already sore. It feels good when the dressings are changed. They gave me stuff to change it over the break. Where mine is located I will need help but my mom used to be a nurse so she can help me out. So far I have not been \"draining\" much at all and no pocket of fluid that needs to be delt with. If one more person says \" God only gives things to the ones that can handle it\" I might punch someone though! LMAO! Seriously!?? Like God looked down at me and said wow, she's strong lets give her cancer! I guess they mean well...but still!",

I can feel the stretching pain but it's not too bad. Mine goes in from the armpit area towards my chin I guess. So that area is just 12 o'clock and two centimeters above my nipple. The doctor was afraid since I didn't have much drainage on the Band-Aids that I would need him to drain it with a needle but I did not have any fluid buildup. They told me that I did not have to change any thing over the days I would be away unless it had fluid on it. I can have my mom help me if I need to though because she will be around. As far as pillows go they made me something they call a cradle that was formed in the position that they want me to be in and is now where my body will go back in during the radiation. Kind of like a padded mold. I also find it all fascinating and have done a lot of research on it. It's not fun but it's definitely much better than the alternative. I think that the binder would bother my armpits. They're so sore as is. What they have me wear a sports bra with zippers in the front. They also gave me after surgery a surgery bra. I didn't like it as much as my Danskin's sports bras. I had a friend come over today and she help you wrap every single Christmas present I bought for my family and friends! It took about three hours and during that time I'll she would let me do is write the tags. So despite all of this I am still enjoying my Christmas holiday in fact maybe more than any other year, because everyone has been so kind to me. So by the 29th I will be done all of this and back to normal life, well other than constantly getting checked and making sure things haven't come back. Thank you Ceanna for all the help you have given me. It really helped to talk to you since the Savi sister site",
