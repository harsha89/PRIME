    "Content": "Jan 28, 2013 01:24PM - edited Jan 28, 2013 01:25PM by Krackr26 I was diagnosed 11/2012 and had lumpectomy in Nov. and contura balloon radiation in Dec. So far I am very happy with my decision. Balloon insertion was done a couple of weeks after surgery in the surgeon's office. Other than the needle pricks to numb the area, it was painless and I did not need pain medication afterward. Went to the radiation site the next day (Friday) for a cat scan to make sure everything was in place, which it was. Radiation was Monday through Friday the next week at 8:00 am and 2:00 pm. Quick cat scan each morning - visits were short and was never there more than an hour. There was no pain - I would say the balloon was uncomfortable, and not being able to shower for nine days wasn't great, but completing radiation so quickly was wonderful. The radiation oncologist did a great job removing the balloon, which was done after the final treatment. He just massaged and played with it a bit and pulled it right out - it was over in no time. From my experience I would recommend this type of radiation as long as your doctors are very experienced. /p>",
