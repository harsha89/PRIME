BTW-I have the same convo you do...My hip hurts, my back hurts, what is this I am feeling, etc.  the list goes on.  Same response-if it gets worse or continues give me a call and I will send you for a scan.  Again, I am ok with that. I happen to love my oncologists-I mean, I really love them so I would not change but if YOU are uncomfortable you should look into it.  Also, I know that if I insisted on bloodwork or a scan I could get them. ",

I hope I did not ramble too much and maybe there is something in my response that will help you. Also, I know earlier in the week you were worried about delivering early.  My now 12 year old was born at 33 weeks and was over 5 lbs, breathing on her own with good lung development, and is incredibly smart.  She was also a great baby who slept through the night at about 1 month.",

Most of the time I check in here is because I feel I have something to offer others who are not as far out as I am.  When I was diagnosed in 2006 I was terrified and desperate to read or hear about women who were ok many years out.  I continue to appreciate the women who are long term survivors-it is what helps me when I have an upcoming appt. or test. Opting out of recon has been one of the best decisions I made.  But, many women choose to do recon and feel the way I do about opting out.  A personal decision for each woman that only she can make.",

Don't think that just because you are done or near the end of treatment that things will go back to the way they were before.  You have been through a life altering event.   That doesn't mean you will be feeling how you are now, all the time.  It just takes some time to adjust and get back on course.  I never thought I would live without constant fear but here I am, doing just that.  You will too.",

I remember people telling me about others with cancer who had died.  I think it is a way that they are trying to connect with you and give you the feeling that they understand.  I'm not saying that it's right but I think that's what goes on in some people's minds. If you are asking for advice I will say what others have said.  1.  Make sure you establish clear boundries. 2. When people start telling you a story, clearly tell them that you only want to hear it if it is a good ending.  If they hesitate it means it is not a good ending and you should walk away or change the subject. 3. Screen your calls or texts or emails.  I actually stopped having communications with some friends because they would unintentionally freak me out.  I didn't make a big deal about it.  I just stopped returning calls.  Sometimes my husband would answer and say I was sleeping.  Once treatment was over I picked back up with those friends. I hope this helps!!",

All that being said, early on I pushed for a stat.  My docs refused to give me one.  At first that annoyed me but now I am grateful for that.  They just kept telling me that the treatments that I was having were very strong and they were pleased with how I reacted to them.  Yes, I did my own research so I know it is probably about a 30% chance of recurrence but that means that I have a 70% chance of NOT having a recurrence.  I figure there are lots of people in the world who have worse types of illnesses who would love to be me and at least have a chance. Anyway, I posted this link recently on another thread.  It is a research study of people who have more than 10 postitive lymph nodes and how long term survival is so much better than it was when the study was orginally done years before.  According to the study it looks like about a 72% chance of NOT having a recurrence. http://www.pslgroup.com/dg/25a522.htm",

One good thing about stage III is that we have the most aggressive treatment. ",

Yes, people will expect you to be fine.  It's not their fault, they just want it to be over so they feel like things are back to normal.  But, to you it is a new type of normal.  Cancer just changes us-some for better, some for worse and some of us feel like it changes us for both.  I can tell you that after treatment ended for me it was the most difficult.  In fact, about a year after was the hardest.  I finally gave in and saw a counselor and it was THE BEST thing I have ever done!! I also got had a hysterectomy (reluctantly) but now I am glad I did.  I am also a runner so don't be too hard on yourself getting back to the running.  Now I am running a 5K several times a week.  I think of it all as a process. Lastly, yes, those moments of thinking of cancer do spread out a little more.  I know you cannot imagine that happening but it does.  It sounds like you have children (me too- now ages 11, 9 and 7) and before you know it you will be involved in what is going on in their lives compared to the scary stuff in your life that you just went through. I am not sure if any of this helps but just know that many of us know exactly what you are talking about.",

Stage III is super scary.  I had just turned 40 when I was diagnosed.  I had a bunch of positive lymph nodes and had 2 lymph nodes with extra capsular extension (cancer coming out of the nodes!).  I was certain I would not still be around for my then 4, 6 and 8 year old daughters.  Guess what? That was over TEN years ago!!! My oldest is 19 and a Sophomore in college, my middle daughter is 17 and a senior in hs and sitting next to me looking online at colleges and my youngest is 15 and a sophomore in high school. There is hope!!!  Hold onto that hope and if the fear takes over seek counseling.  Counseling was the BEST thing I did for myself.  It took only a few sessions to help me reframe the cancer experience and got me out of the cycle of scary thinking.",

My oncologists do not do scans unless symptoms present.  Also, no bloodwork-they feel the tumor markers are not reliable.  I also felt nervous about this at first but now I am glad.  I have enough trouble with stress leading up to the office visit.  Now, that being said, there have been a few times when I felt some kind of pain and I mentioned it to them.  They both said they thought it was nothing but if I wanted them to send me for a scan they would write it up.  Same as mmarenberg said, too many false positives leading to more tests and anxiety.  As far as the AI- I started Tamoxifen about the time that rads began.  They said it did not matter and I just wanted as many safety nets then as I could have.  But...I think most start after rads is over.   Then I had a hysterectomy and they wanted me to stop Tamoxifen for 2 weeks before beginning the Femara.  I guess they saw the look of panic on my face because they told me I could just start that night. ",

I wear the Amoena Tresia 653 and love it!  I mean, I REALLY love it!  It just moves with me and feels like a part of me.  It works better also when I bend down since it is stuck onto me it does not come away from my chest.  Not that tons of people are trying to look but with the contact form I feel more secure.  I am a size 34A in mast. bras and wear a size 3 contact form.  I originally used a size 2 but the 3 seems to match my existing size better. Not sure what it costs but I think around $300.  Online you may be able to get it closer to $265.  Also, my fitter recommended buying the stick on nipples also and they really make the form look like a real boob. The contact forms stay in the same place incredibly well.  I am not sure about return policy on those since it may be difficult to return something that attaches to your body.  Maybe someone else will know and chime in.",

I feel as though with her dying (which I am of course devastated about) it has leveled the playing field.  In other words, I always looked at her and thought that she would be fine and I would be the person to have the recurrence-you know, since my stage is IIb/IIIa.  I guess it solidifies what we all know...you are either 0% or 100%. For some reason it has actually made me feel like I may be ok, you know, until I live to be 85 and die of something else.  For the last 2 years I have been giving my stage way too much power.  And when I think about it, stage is just ONE prognostic factor along with many others.  I feel like I have exhaled for the first time in 2 years!  I am so sad that she is not here but I think in some way she has given me a gift.  I don't even know if that makes sense but that is what it feels like. Anyway, I have not really explained this to people since unless you live with the big cancer cloud over your head, well, I don't think people would really understand but I figured that some of you would.

And, that is NOT because of the mast. I always dread bathing suit season. Anyway, the suit that I just described is so cute on me! I wear a size 2 pros. and the size 6 fits fits well. Although it is a tiny bit tighter than the other styles of Land End suits I have. Oh, and if you are ordering one of their suits, make sure you order one of the cute skirts/cover-up to go with them.

Maidenform-40877-I have this one in black, white and also beige.  I would love to get other colors but they did not have any other in stock.  Silky feel material with rushing that is between the cups (in the cleavage area).  Bought this one at Kohls DKNY- I have several of these but they pull over the head.  Skinny straps.  Cotton material.  I think I have black, red, blue and tan.  Bought these in Macy's (I think) Maidenform- style 1403-Wider straps than the others.  Silky on the outside but cotton on the inside.  Doesn't look great on the hanger but looks very cute on.  When I originally tried it I did not really think I would like it but was surprised that it fit so well when I put it on.  bought this one at Kohl's.  I have it in pink. My most recent purchase that I love is Simply Vera-sold in Kohls.  It is pretty thin with skinny straps.  I have it in black, white and pale blue (my personal favorite).  Stretchy material so it works well with a contact form.  They had cute matching panties and thongs with these bras so for me totally worth it.  With this bra if you still have a remaining boob like I do, you really need to use a stick on nipple on the form because otherwise you will not look even-a function of the material being so thin.  But, this bra is really comfortable. One thing I have noticed is that any bra with padded cups does not work for me.  Also, any type of underwire or push up type bra does not seem to work.  Well, at least for me it does not maybe others have had better luck than I have.",

My fitter is also great at knowing what I like.  Some women also buy regular bras and then sew in a pocket but I am sewing challenged so I just stick to mast. bras.",

All that being said, I think there are partial prosthetics that can be added into a bra.  Maybe someone else knows for sure....Barbara, perhaps?  Or others on this site?  You could also go to a mastectomy fitter-they have lots of solutions for things that we have never thought of.
