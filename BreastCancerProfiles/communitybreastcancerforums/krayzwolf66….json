Im so far away from SEX that i wonder at times if it too is another long term or permanent SE. I couldnt even hv it if i wanted it due to the damage potential in doing so. Literally,my body cannot handle the act w/o some bleeding or pain occuring,no matter what. I only can pray its cuz of chemos effects on our body. You are not crazy tho. Remain strong and good luck n prayers to us all.",
