Other than feeling reflux, and indigestion, I had no awful side effects after the infusion BUT both times my WBC'S bottomed out to zero. At that point I have to stay indoors for 24-48 hours until they bounce back. I've been struggling with going back to work. Maybe I'm a wimp, but I can't get myself in to work due to one SE or another. Also, I work in a hospital so very high risk for infections. So using FMLA. I asked if they would reduce the dose and got a \"no\" for the answer. I don't know if I can survive the last 2 AC's! Then 12 weeks of Taxol which I'm told won't be \"as bad\". I'm frustrated and depressed and scared to death. It doesn't help that I'm a nurse and know too much. Any advice, kind words would be appreciated",
