II was just diagnosed with liver mets one thats  about 1cm and 2 small lesions . I knew about the one before starting Chemo and  that they were keeping  a watch on it to see if the chemo would shrink it.  Onco  did'nt act to  concerned or sure if it was cancerous or not. Onco said if it shrunk then we would know it most likely was and the chemo was doing its job on it. So after getting through chemo and  having a pet scan I now have 2 more???  I am a bit confused thought if chemo had not shrunk it most likely thought to be B9 so now that there are more lesions it thought to be MET I have only talked with the surgeon about the pet scan results. Onco appt will be Tuesday so I guess I will know then her treatment plan. I have read a lot of your post seems everyone has had different treatments. Did most of  you start with Hormonal treatments for a while? then some chemo again? I had a tough time on AC but Taxol was easier to tolerate than the AC . I do not know anything about treatments for liver mets so I am on here reading away. Feel free to email me privately. I look forward to hearing from you.",

Things went well until I got home and I had an allergic reaction to one of the nausea meds so had a long night got to sleep by 2:00am   I just dont seem to get a handle on the gas on my stomach and GI Track. I am taking Pepcid, Maylanta extra strength last night. called in to the dr. office they said to get some Gax relief so I have started that seems to help.  still on my nausea and steroid meds doing ok with them.  But its my Stomach if I drink water it starts the gas all up again. So have a call in to the Dr. office to see what they think. Does  not matter if I drink some juice or water it makes my stomach just bubble. Not to mention the loose stools started this morning (guess green is the new color??) not to gross anyone out (sorry if I did) feels better when it moves so I don't want to take any immodium just yet want to see how this goes.  If anyone has any suggestions what to drink besides water or gatoraide (its to sweet).love pineapple juice but thought might be to citius (but I love it) that seems to settle on your stomach through this let me know.
