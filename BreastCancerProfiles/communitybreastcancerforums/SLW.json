I'm waiting to get the results of a stereotactic biopsy taken yesterday, and it's driving me CRAZY!  I know my husband means well, and he is such a sweetheart and goes with me to all my appointments/procedures.  But I'm so sick of him telling me to \"relax.\"  Really?  How do I do that?  My sister died from breast cancer four years ago.  She was only 46.  So I MAY be a little paranoid.  But for the past three years, I've gone through every type of biopsy there is, being called back every six months for more follow-up.  What an emotional rollercoaster!  My most recent mammo showed calcifications that the radiologist said \"most likely\" would be found to be \"precancerous\" or \"atypical.\"  From the research I've done today on the Internet, I'm more confused than ever and more scared.  The waiting is killing me.  And if my husband tells me to \"try to relax\" again, I'm going to scream!  Any tips for \"dealing\" with husbands would be most appreciated!  Log in to post a reply",
