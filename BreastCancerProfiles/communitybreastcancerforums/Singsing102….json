My skin turned a bit pink, but it was not painful. It did not hurt. I was a bit tired. But not that bad at all. I still walked an hour every day, cooked and cleaned and went skiing! I did have dry mouth, but it just made me drink more water. Water is good for the body. So now it is all done. No more running to the hospital after work and fighting in the traffic in the dark winter hours. No more worries about irritating my skin. I am so happy! My advice is 1. apply something immediately after the radiation each time when you change back into your own clothes. 2. Ask the nurse for some soft pads to put inside the bra to make it comfortable. 3. Drink a lot of water. 4. Just follow the signals of your body. If you are tired, then rest. If not, then try to get some workout like walking or yogo! Good luck to all of you!",
