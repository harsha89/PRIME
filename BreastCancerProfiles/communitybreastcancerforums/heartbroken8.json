I am Stage 3 breast cancer( it has been 4 yrs now)- my Dr. says that they are thinking  of giving this prophylactically- I haven't had a metasis to my bone( although in these 4 yrs they haven't given me a Pet Scan. The Dr, said that their is evidence that a low score might show indication of a possible link to metasis to the bone.  I say- how about having had a hysterectomy at 38 and being on Arimidex for 4 yrs - doesn't that lower bone density. I am going to another Dr. for another opinion. I also am Brac 2 so I am looking at this drug that has long term effects- Who can help me/????? Anyone else on this drug.
