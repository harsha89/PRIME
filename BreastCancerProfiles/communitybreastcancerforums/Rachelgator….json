Things have been going okay. My hair started coming out in handfuls last Monday, so I had it shaved on Wednesday of last week (see my pic). I went to the ACS Look Good...Feel Better class today and had fun. I have been pretty fatigued this time around and now that I am off steroids my stomach is a little upset, but I am doing okay. I look forward to meeting all of you. Rachel",

I like it, but it's so much unlike my real hair that it's a little uncomfortable. I have a ton of cool hats. I don't work in an office, so it wouldn't matter if I went around all day without anything on my bald head! The weather has been about 80 degrees here anyway, so a wig is a little hot. Tomorrow we are going to be in the 60s, though. Tonight at Shabbat services my rabbi gave me a hat from a company called Hats of Hope. It has the healing prayer on the inside of the hat and the word \"hope\" on the inside brim (so I can look up and see the word while I am wearing it). I was very touched, actually. I have been feeling very bloated. I get full so fast and then I never feel like I have an appetite again. I have the dry mouth and heartburn too. My period did not come yet, and I have the feeling that it won't. That's just going to make me feel more bloated, I know it. Chris:Â  I am 39. I work at home as a medical transcriptionist, although I have not worked since my mastectomy in December. My kids are 14, 10, and 6. I have great support from my husband and friends. This whole experience has showed me how lucky I really am. Welcome to the group. Rachel",

It was fun and they gave out tons of good makeup and cleansers, etc. I got a few fun colors and learned a lot about head wraps and coloring in eyebrows, etc. I also found out you can get a free wig from the Amercian Cancer Society. I might get a red one. I have always wanted red hair. My appetite is not the best either, but my DH and I went to Chili's today and I had a good potato soup. Still getting used to having people try not to look at me weird with my head wrap on. I wouldn't mind going out without it, but the temp here is 82 degrees and I am actually afraid of burning my scalp. I went to try to find some new shorts today. Shopping has been my release. Not good for the wallet! The problem is that I am short and a plus size. Finding pants/shorts is impossible. I think I am going to rest for a bit before attempting to attend a PTA meeting at my kids' school tonight. Rachel",

Bridget, my weakness since I started chemo has been shopping! I have spent a decent amount of money on hats and scarves. I have a wig, but I don't really like the way it feels. I have mostly worn the scarves at, often with a hat. I think being in Florida makes the wig uncomfortable too. It's too hot. I also feel kind of like it is a badge of courage that people can see that I have no hair; like, I am proud that I am strong enough to go through this and still live as normal a life as possible.

You shouldn't have to wear a wig to make others feel comfortable. I have found that most people don't even seem to notice. I do get some looks but not really too many. Chemo #3 is tomorrow. Decadron already making me have hot flashes! Hopefully I will sleep okay tomorrow. My parents are meeting me at the chemo room, as always. My husband also comes with me. He usually goes out and gets lunch and brings it back in and then he leaves to make sure he's home when the kids get home from school. My treatment last time lasted past the time they get out of school. Luckily, my parents can drive me home. I go back for hydration on Friday. Rachel",
