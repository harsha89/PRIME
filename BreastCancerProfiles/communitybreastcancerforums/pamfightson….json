I took one a day for a week or so but then my pain went mostly away. Every few days (usually after I overdo things) I have to take a Norco. Otherwise I take Tylenol and/or Ativan. I was still dealing with a neck/shoulder strain on the same side of my UMX when I had the surgery, otherwise I don't think I would be taking anything.",

I only had one drain that I got pulled on 12/8. I was allowed to drive at 3 weeks and am allowed to wear a bra with a fiberfill poof. I do have a large hematoma above and below my incision that is hard and very slowly going away. It extends into what used to be my armpit and is really uncomfortable. It's making wearing a bra/poof really suck so I'm back to either going without anything at home or lightly wrapping myself in the ace bandage. It's times like this I wish I had bilateral. While I'm glad that the cancer is gone, I'm missing being even on both sides more than I admit. I think both sides gone would be easier to practically deal with. Plus I'm having phantom boob feelings so it's sometimes a surprise to look down and not see anything. I'm doing the exercises given and am getting my range of motion back. My elbow won't go back super far but I can reach over my head to my right ear. I still get flat out exhausted and I have to watch that my blood sugars don't tank. No reconstruction as I also have type 2 diabetes and aplastic anemia. Hope everyone is doing well! ",
