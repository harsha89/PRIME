My doctor has given me a reference letter and this is what it says Mammogram showed multiple clusters of microcalcification in the right breast while ultrasound showed several ill defined solid lesions from 2 oclock to 10 oclock in the right breast. Clinically there was a diffuse lump in the upper half of the right breast. No axillary lymph nodes were felt. A diagnosis of multifocal breast cancer was made, and this was confirmed by an ultrasound guided core needle biopsy of 2 of the lumps at 10 oclock and 2 oclock, which showed a high grade infiltrating ductal carcinoma Not sure what stage and how bad it is....

She said it looks like early stage but she has asked for a few tests to be done before deciding on what to do. Hv been asked to do ct scan, ultrasound, biopsy, whole body bone scan, and MRI tmrow. The previous biopsy results did not Hv full details . I m still very sore with the last biopsy which was done abt 10 days ago but I m very happy with the breast surgeon n glad she's doing all this tests too. The doctor checked. Under my arms n felt some thickening but said it could be from the impact of the biopsy. I m just praying for a miracle. Ashley",
