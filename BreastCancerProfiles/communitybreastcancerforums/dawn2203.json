When I was diagnosed my hair was long, when the onc said I had to have chemo I had it cut to my shoulders to try and make the impact less traumatic. When most of my hair had fallen out I got my dh to shave the remains off. Although its not the same has having your own hair I had quite alot of fun wearing different wigs, various colours and styles. Cancer sucks and chemo was horrible but with the treatment it gives us a fighting chance. Good luck. Dawn.x     ",
