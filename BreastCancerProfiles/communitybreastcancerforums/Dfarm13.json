When I met with the surgeon we discussed doing that. However I was a bit overwhelmed and I have no idea how soon after the surgery the treatment begins. Thanks for your feedback on the device.",

However, I am still waiting for the results on the BRCA test. They did a blood test on Dec. 15 and something was messed up and they did it again on Dec. 21. If it comes back positive I'm having a mastectomy not a lumpectomy. The plastic surgeon is not available on Friday so we would have to move the surgery date. The waiting is horrible. Are there any teachers out there? My boss has been great but, when you are out, you are responsible to write lesson plans. I think that is stressing me out too. Not knowing when I'll be out and for how long. So happy I found all of you. The poop stories made me laugh:)",
