OK, thanks.  I feel better now....",

I was diagnosed on April 8, 2008, after having my annual mammogram on March 6, 2008.  It was the longest month I have ever lived through.  After the mammogram, I had a second mammogram, then an ultrasound, then an MRI, then meeting with the surgeon.  Along the way, I was told that they weren's sure whether the tumor had pierced my chest wall, which was doubly scarey.  I thought it would never end.  It was the agony of waiting one week at a time and then only getting one more piece of the puzzel.  I actually took my mammogram films and compared them to a film I found on the Mayo Clinic website.  When I saw the similarities between the two, I was sure it was cancer.  The waiting was the hardest part.  Once I knew I had cancer, I knew immediately that I would have a bilateral mastectomy, as I did not want to find myself in the same place again.  Also, my mother died of breast cancer 12 years ago after a 6 year battle.  She was diagnosed at 52, me at 50.  I will agree that staying busy helps and looking forward to the next test, rather than the final diagnosis also helped me.  Also, I made the decision NOW to fight and win, against whatever came my way.  That gave me some peace. I wish I could offer you more comfort.  For now, I will pray for your peace.",

I hope you end up with a B9 problem without the worries of BC, but know that life goes on after the diagnosis.  Good luck, God speed and stay in touch.",
