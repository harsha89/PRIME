I don't even want to show up on Tuesday for my final round.  Chemo has been a difficult journey for me.  My poor boys, ages 4, 6 & 12, want their happy mom back.  The physical SE's of chemo are bad enough but I seem to have lost all my patience & I'm super irritable.  I'm looking forward to this surgery...just take it all & get it all :)  It's such a relief to hear that the hardest part is almost over.  I don't know how anyone does chemo for more than 6 months.  Good luck to all you ladies!!  xoxo",

      "Content": "1awesomemom wrote: Hello everyone!  I had my bilateral mastectomy without reconstruction last week.  Things are going swimmingly but these darn drains are driving me nuts!  My questions is...how long do most women have the drains in?  I'm on day 8...seems like forever.  Also, the entry site for the drains are very painful.  They are not infected just painful.  They're more painful than my surgery incisions. I'm also terrified to get them removed.  Is it true that the skin can heal around the drains & make it difficult to remove?  Does it hurt when they're removed?  Thanks for your input!! xoxoxo Dx 9/19/2010, IDC, 5cm, Stage IIA, Grade 3, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
