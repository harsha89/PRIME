Day 5 is when I started to feel a bit more normal... now I am good (day 14!!) and thinking whoa boy... heading back into the cycle in a week. Hang in there... drink... swish your mouth often and get good rest! Today was my wig day. I had a friend here. I hope I bought the right one. I sort of feel like I will just wear hats but I think my husband and kids need to see me with hair sometimes. A little too much reality for everyone I think. We'll see. I am not a fussy girl so I hope I did not waste $$$. This cancer trip is turning out to be a little expensive huh! Glad to see the Nov 17th chemo girls up and typing. I agree with Erica, it is much better to get the first infusion over with! No more wondering. Are you guys keeping journals? I started one but I am horrible about keeping up with it... especially on days that I am feeling good. Too many other things to fit in! Thanks for the recipes Bonnied! I have the marrow soup on the boil now in prep for next week. Thinking of you all...Wendy",

Gotta laugh at my SIL though. She sent me a text all about her new job/life and hopes that when I am done with chemo we can get together. That did make me giggle.",

Tomorrow is a big DAY 1 for many! Good luck girls!! Just like Silverbell I read everything so here goes my responses... Vintagegal! Is your second dose early? I was thinking we were on the same schedule/drugs. I am so sorry about your hair! I just got mine cut short and it is \"traumatized\" thats what hair dresser said! We had to stop and wash it with warm water in the middle of the cut. The back of my head still feels \"weird\" and COLD!! I haven't had my hair short in 35 years! I love the cut! Praying that your lung clears!! Karen, I hope your Dad is peaceful in his new home. My Dad is in the last stages of ALZ and in a home. He LOVES all the nurses and treats them like his girl friends. Its precious. Hi Nitengirl! I have the numbing crème and it works great! Someone here mentioned putting a clear bandage over it (you apply 45 min prior to appointment) and I will do that next time as I just slapped it on and took off! I hope your port is less tender now. Mine was a little sore but not too bad. If you have trouble swallowing you should tell someone. Glad you are here good luck on the 18th. CC3373 you are cracking me up with the \"one night stand\" SO TRUE\u2026 funny story\u2026 I had one \u2013 one night stand and I married him!! LOL I remember the walk of shame the next am UGH. I was mentally kicking myself as I do not \"do that!\" \u2026 He called me that afternoon and asked me out. 22 years married last week! BONNIED \u2013 please stay! Love your smile and comments! Trees!! I love trees! Your job sounds fantastic. Sounds like you have plans for the next chapter in the work career! Very interesting with the culinary twist! Erica hang in there. There are definitely good days to counter the bad. My advice \u2013 take the anxiety meds!! Not all the time\u2026 just when you need them. Day 5 my hubby came home to me circling the kitchen mumbling to myself \"I can't do this, I won't do this, no more.\" I was a mental mess. All he did was hug me and say \"call the doctor\" The on call asked me what meds I had and suggested I take the pill. Why not?! Well it was a life saver. I don't like taking the extra stuff but it is there for a reason\u2026 sometimes this is all a little too much to deal with. Since then I am good! Praying for you!! TallyL - you and I are on the same routine! I started on Nov 4th\u2026 so I am ramping up to round 2 just before Thanksgiving. Have you tried the anti nausea bands? They are working wonders for me. I wear them 24/7. When I forget to put them on after the shower I know it soon after! Bonnied brings up a great point\u2026 have you guys noted that food does not have a taste (Im at day 12 after first round) So sad. Can't wait for those cook books to come and try out making some yummies. KnittingPT I love your Disney hat idea for the kiddos! I purchased some great hats from a cancer survivor in etsy that are awesome but I was thinking the same thing\u2026 would love to knit something fun for myself. Your job sounds very rewarding! It will be a good distraction I am sure. HI KIWI!!! I love that you shaved your head! I think I will do the same after my college age daughter comes home. She has not seen me since the diagnosis and took it rather hard. SO sorry to hear about your infection! Does not sound like fun at all!! Love my sea bands too!! There\u2026 all caught up. I feel so blessed to have found this group. You guys are so bright and insightful. Love the love that is pouring out for each other! I am a full time Mom since 2002. Prior to stepping away from the work madness I was a globalization consultant. Fancy title for making sure that sw programmers built products that could be easily localized around the world. Prior to that I studied how people worked and designed applications/interfaces that made work \"more easy\" lol. Automation. Got to love it. I did. It was hard to leave work at first but then I fell into Mommy mode and never looked back. I have three beautiful daughters \u2013 20, 16 and 14. I thank God my genetic testing came back all clear. This may sound weird \u2013 or maybe not. Life has become so simple with the big C and I have never been happier. I feel like I am living everyday\u2026 simply just living. Nothing matters but those I love and doing this so I can be with them. Thinking of you all! Much love and hugs to those starting on the 17th/18th. Wendy",

First chemo trip (vacation!!) is a good idea to have someone there with you in case you have an allergic reaction and need some extras pumped in.

All went well\u2026 I had another allergic reaction (they think it may be the Herceptin but I am thinking the taxotere!) Since I had the same thing happen with the first infusion they gave me benedryl at first (25 ml) and then ran the Herceptin slooooooooow. Well that worked well until the very end\u2026 I had about 10 more min of the tax and I was starting to show signs. You know the drill if you have responded to the chemo in this way\u2026 so stopped everything. Shut the line down. 25 ml more of benedryl (that sent me to woosy land quick!)\u2026 more waiting then ran the last of the tax\u2026 more waiting\u2026 then I was set free. SIDE NOTE\u2026 the lady in the chair across from me (colon cancer so totally diff drugs than us) was not happy at all yesterday. She was complaining from the start to her daughter who was cajoling her\u2026 well long story short she did not take her heart meds that day and halfway through her treatment she started to show signs of a stroke! That got the ward in high gear. It was great to see the nurses in action \u2013 SO competent and calm \u2013 but very informative! We have to be on alert with every aspect of this process. I wondered to myself if \"chemo brain\" got the best of her and she forgot to take her normal meds? Silverbell \u2013 see above regarding my reaction. The nurse mentioned that they have good results when patients take Claritin before their treatment if they have SE's during treatment. She confirmed this with my doctor and they agree that I should take Claritin before my next infusion. I am sure I will be bumped up to 50 mg of Benadryl from the start too. I know that I have a very sensitive system ( I have had allergies since my teen years) and the nurse say my body definitely knows what it likes and doesn't! I used to tell people I worked with that if I sneezed walking into the office (which I did!) the air quality was bad! I am like the canary in the mine!! CC, Erica, Bonnied \u2013 thanks for the love. My girls are home now. They were worried but as we progress through the days they can see that I am \"ok\" I am making light of all this\u2026 that is pretty much my nature anyway and we are just getting on with life. Haley is in college at University of Iowa (go HAWKEYES!!) so she is a bit of a haul away from us. Good to have her home! Knitting \u2013 ugh. The HAIR! Well mine is going today via a buzz cut. We are making a family outing for the event (crepes afterwards\u2026 my girls favorite!) I have been holding out doing anything with my hair until Haley came home from college. I wanted to break her in slow since she was the most freaked out with my diagnosis! What a pain!! For me it started coming out on day 15 and has been falling out every since\u2026RAPIDLY! I have been wearing a nice knitted cap\u2026 hair in that\u2026 on the pillow, on the scarft around my neck. EVERYEHERE. It needs to go\u2026comes out in clumps in the shower. By the way\u2026 those b-stard gray hairs that I really could not see before\u2026 they are holding on for dear life!! So now I look \"old\" Also the fu man chu facial hair in my mole\u2026 that is FIRMLY rooted. For real. Other hair (ahhh you know seems to have stopped growing\u2026) I have my wigs and skull caps read but I have to say while on the steroids I am warm! And the weather here is warm so I am not sure what I am going to do with the dome later today!! Will keep you posted!! Btw\u2026 we did do the bats J BreatheIn \u2013 I do not take extra meds either but we must do what we have to do! The chemo works\u2026 evidence with the side effects etc. I am doing neoajuvent and I have noticed after three weeks that my breast is not as tender and is less firm around where the tumors are! Yahoo! My doctor is understanding but FIRM with what is needed etc. I totally trust her. So we get the shot!! Dee \u2013 I agree with the similar hair \u2013 nothing crazy. This has seemed to keep everyone in my house very happy. They say it is NOT the same as my hair but close. I know the wigs are more for them than me J Amyslp \u2013 loving the head scarf and the SMILE!! We have the same diagnosis J YIIKES. Just read your post on falling! Take good care!! Tally \u2013 love the pixie! You are rocking it girl! JUST a quick note on the WIG front. I was trying on several and then I put this one on my head and ITS was a YES! Amazing how it just was me!! Wish is were a beat less $$ (this C trip is getting expensive!) but in the end I just got it. Christmas present for me! Not sure what you guys are experiencing but \"the wig\" was $600. Ugh. MidLife \u2013 I had some wild pain about the same time as you\u2026 and then I got my period the next day\u2026not sure if this is similar to you but once the cycle started it went away. Never had pre-p symptoms like that before! My nose is sore too with bleeding at times! I have an air filter running at night and have added a humidifier. I also use \"alba\" non petroleum jelly in my nose to keep it miost. This has really helped me a lot! Luckyshoe \u2013 I can so relate to your hives! For the past 8 months I have not been able to have alcohol. I am not a regular drinker but would have wine from time to time and of course when my buddies come to visit we would kick up our heels per say! But as each month passed my body would reject any alcohol! The last glass I tried to drink just the night before my mammogram I had a violent reaction to! Sent me to the carpark where I waited for my husband to finish his meal. Of course I have not had a drink since but it really got me thinking if this was a sign from my body that something was just not right! Btw\u2026 I am the same with hives\u2026 stress or nervous and I break out! No fun! Ahhhh. Just read Erica's response to the ice sipping. I have lost my taste buds and it is SO SO SO sad! I'm making the turkey dinner today for our \"early\" celebration and I can't taste a thing. Dang. Erica & Midlife \u2013 I mentioned this earlier in a post but good to remind\u2026 I chug this stuff\u2026 plant based and no sugar \u2013 makes drinking water SO much easier http://www.amazon.com/Ultima-Replenisher-Lemonade-90-Servings/dp/B001JQLT18/ref=sr_1_4?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1416925865&sr=1-4&keywords=ultima+replenisher Camera girl \u2013 the hair just starts to come out in your hand if you run it through your hair. Also the shower\u2026 it just keeps coming out \u2013 once it starts! I am sure the wind will give it a good blow too J I found my head to get tender at the root of the hair when it started\u2026 sort of irritating. When I started to to rub my head in the shower and detach the loose hair it felt better (mostly in the back of my head!) Today I am getting it buzzed off (day 22 since start for me\u2026 hair started coming out on day 15) because I just cannot deal with the little hairs all over the sink, floor, sweater etc! Time to embrace the loss!! Debby & Bonnied! I am with you\u2026 I would be up for a closed FB group! Bonnied I sent you a message on FB\u2026 may be in your \"other\" message folder! Wendy",

The SE's went away after about 30 minutes and we resumed the tax. From now on I guess I will take Claritin before I go for the infusion and they will hanf 50 ml right away of the benedryl to get me going. We'll see how that goes! Good luck to us sensitive chicks!

So here goes some random posts based on my (vast!) experience over the past week of being a newbie to chemo-world. I asked my dr about hair loss... she said that would be around day 15 post chemo. I have scheduled a hair cut! Just going to get in front of the loss and deal with it. Took lots of pictures with my kiddos this weekend. One thing to mention is a service that the support person told me about. They make a hair cap sort of thing from your own hair. Check them out... Hats with Hair http://www.hatswithhair.com/ I read on some discussion here that a woman was swishing with salt water every time she was in the bathroom. I have been trying to do that and so far my mouth is not too tender! I have been drinking TONS of water and electrolytes. I love this stuff... http://ultimareplenisher.com/ for hydration. I get it from amazon. Just yesterday I started to have really bad aches. Sort of like wicked cramps. Much more than the little ones I was attributing to the nulasta shot. Horrible. So I started taking Tylenol and so far so good. The last thing is the \"sea sick\" bands on my arm! I have to admit. I slapped them on and I take them off only for a shower. I HATE feeling nauseous! So I am taking no chances! So far so good! So, had first chemo 6 days ago. I responded with some itching and had to have 25 ml of benedryl otherwise all went as it should! The next day I felt fine. Sort of walked around thinking \"no what?!\" and then just had a chat with myself and got on with it. The next two days I basically slept... couch to bed and back again. Day 4 was a WEIRD day for me. I wanted to attend my daughters school play so I rested and by the afternoon I was bugging out! I wanted off the train. Why am I doing this? I don't want to do this! What am I going to do when my husband has to travel for work. I will be alone to deal with this... I was a mess. Called the doctor and was reminded that I have \"help\" lol. Took a little pill and all was well. THIS IS SO NOT ME to take this kind of help but I think it is needed. I am a planner/manager type and there is no planning or managing THIS! At least to the extent that would bring me comfort all the time!! After my little bug out I have been fine. Bouts of being tired. Body hurts a bit but all is well and I am staying focused. So thankful for this website/group. Wishing us all well and praying. xx",

If you are looking for all sorts of caps that can be made to order this may be helpful. Not bad prices too! BTW... I do not know this person at all!! Just happened to look up cancer hats on etsy to see what I could find :) I could not resist getting some fun sleeping caps and a few pretties in different colors to go with sweaters. Not sure if I am going to be able to pull off the wig.., what are you guys thinking? Any wig shopping tips?! I did read someplace that it is good to go to a shop before you loose or cut your hair to get an idea of what \"normal\" looks like individually. https://www.etsy.com/shop/CJHats?ref=search_shop_redirect",

Karen I hope your Dad is doing better soon. Not good to have extra worry! Readytorock we are nearly neighbors! My husband was pushing me to go to our GP and get a second opinion and if I did I would have likely been over at Winchester! LOVE LOVE LOVE my docs. That certainly makes a difference doesn't it! My onc calls to check on me every other day. I gave her a hug the last time I saw her and she was a bit off with that. I get it... but I could not resist. It is fab to be able to ask her anything. BTW.... anyone read the FINE PRINT of all the documents that get passed to us in our pre-chemo meetings. My husband was combing through the details with the nurse practitioner when he came across the suggested condom use! She said for days after chemo and in the docs it says a year. I am giggling as I write this (my daughters are 14, 16, and 20) thinking about the last time we had to wrap it up (sorry I hope I am not offending anyone!) Just another facet to this adventure! Have a great day girls!  ",

Good thing I have the wig on standby in case the family needs a break from my head! Feeling pretty good and getting out/exercising. Next chemo date is Monday... planning on cooking an early Thanksgiving meal on Tuesday since last round I had a burst of energy on day 2... and then slept the next two days! Everyone seems in good spirits! Keep up the great work ladies! Love & Prayers, Wendy",

Not much to add at this moment... the basics would be I just moved to the area and started doing hot yoga with my husband (to improve our health!!) Within a week I felt an uncomfortable lump on my right side. Got myself in for a mammogram and then the process started... you know the drill. I am unable to have an MRI because I broke my tib/fib and I have metal in my leg that is not compatible with the machine so we are estimating the tumor at 2cm and there are calcification's in a separate area that have been biopsied as well. I feel very fortunate in the sense I was able to get right into a breast clinic at Mass Gen where I have 5 doctors pouring ove.r my results every Thursday in a consortium and making recommendations. Since I will be doing neoadjuvant treatment starting TODAY my appointments last Friday were to poke me every way you can! After 5 hours I was exhausted but pathology has everything they need to test. The hormone target drugs are supposed to be amazing. My onco was really positive when I tested hormone/HERS2 positive and said she new just what she wanted to use to attack. That made me feel great. Still waiting on genetics to see about the BRCA.  Turns out that I have a guardian angel working overtime. As I mentioned, I have just moved to the area - in September. I have the best team of doctors... which all started with a yelp search to find a great imaging center near me! So here I am. Wide awake and waiting for my first treatment at 10:30. I'm not anxious anymore (thank God!) that ended when I got my bone scan back - all clear yahoo!! I will have the Neulasta shot tomorrow and plan to exercise (thanks for the tip.) BTW do you know how much that costs?! My specialty pharmacy called to get payment of $40 for it and I asked why it was not covered. The woman said it was the co pay with a giggle... the non insurance cost is well over 4k!!!",
