I feel for you when you say you are frightened.  That is so natural.  But know that having this kind of technology is truly a blessing.  Catching breast changes early on....it is just so important.  I have read over and over that 80% of calcifications are benign too.  I will be thinking about you tomorrow, please let us know how things go. hugs, Donna",

Ultimately I truly believe that our healthcare is in our own hands.  If you are concerned, even in the slightest way, it is always within your right to get a second opinion.

It is very good to know that things cannot always be seen on a mammogram for younger women and for that reason additional testing maybe required. Thank you, Donna ",

I had quite the start to my day today, I have to say.  I waited until 8am and then called the specialists' office to see if I could get any information on an appt. time.  To which the receptionist....or whomever it was....said that they had no record of a request/referral for me to see the specialist.  I was a little more than upset, given the week I had last week with worry, so I called my family doctors' office again.  They couldn't understand the mixup.....nor could I...she offered to contact them again and I insisted this time that she call ME back, instead of the other way around.   So it's all setup.  June 27th I go for the consultation with the specialist.  And then we go from there.  I guess once he looks at the films and asks a few questions and maybe talks about the risks of whatever procedure he thinks is best....we'll go from there.  This is so new to me.  Can you describe how the consultation usually goes....I guess I just really want to prepare myself.  And maybe can't. I thought having this date would magically make me feel a ton better.  I'm just as upset as I was before, only now I know it is real.  Having the appointment....not just wondering when I'll be going...now it is becoming more real what is going on here. When you spoke of the monkeys.....I felt like you were describing my life for the past few weeks.  I can so relate. I am sending you best wishes for your surgery tomorrow.  You will be in my thoughts. Hugs back to you, Donna ",

This is just so new to me, I guess that I have a lot of questions.  The family doctor, or the receptionist at the family doctor's office, said that the specialist's office would be contacting me directly for the biopsy appointment.  I have the name of the doctor and have been checking him out online (how he rates etc).  Is it wise to just sit and wait for the call.....is it too pushy to call their office to check on how long I am looking at waiting?  I think they were hoping for me to get in sometime this month....but nothing definite has been said.  From what you have said about the other testing...I feel blessed that I have had so much done so quickly.  I had my annual physical on May 30th and on June 4th I was in for the mammogram/ultrasound. I really am a spiritual person....not overly religious, but spiritual all the same.  I believe that I am being guided.  As though by having this experience, good or bad resulting, I am learning more about myself and those around me.  Now if I could just stop the chattering monkeys at night all would be good :) Donna",

It's soo bizarre....because even now I remember waiting for the mammogram thinking to myself.....the doctor said to take when mom was first diagnosed and go 5 years earlier for the test.  And I was thinking.....I'm a little early to be here.

I am scared.  Although everyone around me says not to worry until there is something to worry about...it is much easier said than done. Thanks for listening.",

I have had the mammogram....they took 7 pictures (5 of my left because they had to do some enlargement pictures).  Then they did an ultrasound to see if there were any masses growing underneath, and there weren't, thank heavens.  Talk about a first experience; I thought this was gonna be easy breazy clear sailing....just a routine baseline mammo. So after the radiologist came and left 3 times getting these pictures, another lady came in to discuss the films with me.  She said that I had a very small cluster of microcalcifications on my left breast.  They were slightly irregular intermixed with powdery calcifications.  I have no idea what they mean by \"interdeterminate microcalcifications\" but that was mentioned. She basically gave me 3 options.  Mammogram every 6 months for the next while to chart the growth of the calcifications (cuz this was the first mammo, they have no idea what \"normal\" is for me), go for a stereotactic core biopsy at the breast health center in town, or get them cut out.  The last option seemed a bit harsh, but the first option seemed a bit passive, given moms history.  So now I wait.  Wait and wait and wait, to see when they can get me in for the procedure I just never dreamed I'd be doing in 2008.  I am not trying to be all \"poor me\", gosh....if anything I have really learnt that there are just soooooooo many of us out there going through this process. I guess that I am just trying to make peace with it all.  And trying to remember that it is probably all okay.  Worst case....precancer....and you can deal with that with surgery.  Best case, just another mammogram in 6 months. I'm so grateful to be able to express all of this worry somewhere.  Thanks so much for caring and responding. Donna",

I guess that all of this is still sinking in.  And hopefully by the time it all sinks in....everything will come back fine. I'm glad that they will discuss all of the options, and then explain why one specific option is better for me.  Asking me to make a choice on tmt when I clearly have no idea....can be a little stressful.  Like when the radiologist said I had three options.  Mammogram once every 6 months for the next while, biopsy, or cutting the little suckers right out.  How do I make a choice without all of the facts.  Maybe I will want to just get them out altogether and be done with it.  I totally agree with your school of thought \"when in doubt, take it out.\" Thanks so much for listening to my worries.  I am wishing you the best of luck for your appointment on the 23rd.  You have been through so much already.  I may just do what you suggested.  Call my doctor for something.  For now I am okay....a little wine here and there to calm the old nerves.  But as the date gets closer for the procedure....I know I am no superwoman.
