I have only 2 more tx's, next 12/24 and 1/14 is my last!!  Tired of sounding negative, but it sounds so easy, \"only 2 more\".  The fact of the matter, AS YOU ALL KNOW :), is that you have to deal with the weeks that follow each treatment!  OK, enough sniveling. (I can't help but think of how grateful I am for this group each time I post)  Anytime anyone is having a pity party, I'd like to be invited :)  I rather enjoy them sometimes LOL  I'll bring the shot glasses!",

This morning I woke up looking like Chow...black spots on my tongue! LOL  The solemn and sad news is that I got a call from my 66 yr young aunt last nite (a lady with a beautiful heart) and she told me that she was dx'd with IDC on 11/30 in the left breast (2.8cm)  Her first appt with onc is Thur.  Please add her to your prayers (Sandy Aguilar).  I know she has a lot of faith, but I could still hear the fear of the unknown in her voice.  Luv u guys....and I wish you all a lovely day.",
