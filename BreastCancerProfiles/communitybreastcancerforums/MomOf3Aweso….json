I went for my yearly mammo and just kept getting call feom imaging place that more test were needed that my Dr was ordering. I still haven't talk to a Dr :-\\ I was told results can take up to a week. I'm hoping by Friday. I have no idea if I will be getting a phone call or if I will have to go in for results. I hope everything turns out ok for you too! I will be keeping you in my thoughts. The waiting and not knowing is the hardest!",
