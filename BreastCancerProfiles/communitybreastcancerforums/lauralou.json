I have had so much support through all this over the last 15 months but feel I am more on my own for this latest hurdle as I feel everyone is \"tired\" of me being in crisis all the time. This website has been helpful to reach out to. I went to Nordstrom yesterday and got some items which helped and got my first look at a prosthesis...they don't look too bad but truly didn't think I'd be at this juncture. :(",

I just learned I have to have mine out too due to skin damage and ongoing infection. I am going to keep my other one and decide later about another type of reconstruction...maybe lattimus (from back). I am looking forward to being without physical pain and all that has come with it...but I am struggling with having no breast even though what I have is really not a breast! My immediate decision is whether to have it out in 3 days or wait until after a trip I have planned with my Mom which is the 19th-25th. I am thinking of going ahead and doing it so at least I am comfortable and out of pain. How was your recovery? I'll have 10 days to recover before leaving.  How did you get info re: what to buy, where to go, and what in the heck is a fluffie?  The Lord will see me through this next bump in the road. ",
