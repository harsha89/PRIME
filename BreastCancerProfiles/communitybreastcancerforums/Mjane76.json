They say she has two spots, one very large tumor that has possibly grown into her chest wall? And one smaller one that is isolated to the ducts. They told her yesterday that she is HER-2 positive. We still do not know her stage, we will be finding out on Monday. I want to know what this HERS-2 means for her, does it automatically mean aggressive cancer? And could she still be an early stage cancer if she is HERS-2 positive? They also said her cancer is grade 3, I guess I am trying to get some information from someone who has been through all of this. I keep all of you in my prayers. Thank you",
