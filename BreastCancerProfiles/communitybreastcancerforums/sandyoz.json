I discovered a lump December 2012 had to wait two months to see BS he did a FNA had to wait a week for results said it wasnt cancer but to come back in 3 months my lump had got bigger during this time so i had a core biopsy said it was Benign come back in a year. Had another mammo and ultrasound a year later March 2013 lump increased in size saw BS again had lumpectomy on 30th April diagnosed with PASH.. having followup baseline mammo and Ultrasound next month. Lump was 5cm occasionally a bit painful. I asked questions including will it come back he said no.. did he get it all he said yes..despite this I still have a lump in the same position. Is it normal to still have a lump after lumpectomy? BS said i dont need to see him again unless i feel i need to he said the first mammo i have will show what appears to be a breast tumor he said this is normal? My incision scar is slightly raised also wondering if that is what usually happens? Hope someone can advise me ..thanks",
