      "Content": "Ninany wrote: After several years of diagnostic mammos and US and one previous core biopsy to monitor microcalcs in my L breast, I now have new microcalcs which appeared near the older site. I had a stereotactic core biopsy on 6/11 and was dx ADH. I had a wire localization excisional biopsy yesterday and now am waiting for results. My worry is that I have dense breasts, multiple complex fibroadenomas and hx of melanoma. Yet my BS doesn't want me to have MRI bc he says too many false positives. But I want to know if there's more stuff going on inside and also on the other side (they concurrently did a FNA of a node of the R breast that was B9.) Anyway, I guess I'll wait on the results and then revisit more testing if all comes back B9. Any thoughts? Suggestions? Also I'm not sure I can take preventive meds like Tamoxifen bc I have endometriosis and uterine fibroids.
