I am thinking I will get it checked, as you said at least for my peace of mind. Thank you also for saying I could get it checked by my ob/gyn! That alone gives me some comfort! I will keep you posted. Hugs back!",

I found this site by googling some recent symptoms and was very surprised to see this forum come up second on the search results, with IBC being the first. First let me say that I am not looking for an internet diagnosis. I just want some input from people who understand this and are quite knowledgeable on it, as all of you seem to be. Life is all about helping each other right? So I am really not sure what to think about my symptoms. About three weeks ago, I noticed a bright red dime sized mark on the upper edge of my areola exactly in the center on the left breast. The best way to describe it is that it looks like a cigarette burn. It feels very scaly and I can feel it without having to look at it. There is some itching around it at times. I should also mention that the skin above my breast looks mostly ok. If I look closely, at times it reminds me of the color of a bruise that is almost healed with little streaks of bruising. For a few days after it started, there were also some tiny dark bruises on the skin high above my areola, that were strangely the same size and shape as the red mark. At the moment those tiny bruises are not there. The skin color isn't too concerning, as the problem is mostly with the areola, which does seem to be a slightly darker color and slightly different texture than the other side. The thing that first made me examine my breast is because that one feels very heavy, hangs lower, and looks swollen. I am very thin with a small chest, so this usually doesn't happen; and it is only happening on that side. It kind of feels like there is a water balloon inside it. Sometimes there is also a shooting pain that goes through it, but I don't know if that is related or not. I do try to ignore this but the heaviness on that side constantly brings my attention to it. Today I noticed there is now another red mark as well towards the side of my areola on the same breast; so there are two marks in total at this point. I should also say that I am 41 and do not know my family history. I do not have kids and not currently pregnant, but I do have PCOS. Does anyone have any thoughts about this? I am not sure if I should pursue this or if I am over reacting and should wait it out. Your energy flows where your mind goes right? My second question is that since this is female related, could I go to my ob/gyn instead of my primary doctor? My primary is male and ob/gyn is female, so I would definitely feel more comfortable going to my ob/gyn for this. I also feel she would be more knowledgeable on how to proceed. If not then what kind of doctor would I have to see to start this process? Thank you in advance for your help! Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "jenanns wrote: Hello. I posted here a while ago about these marks on my areola that looked like burn marks. It started with one mark, then grew to three marks, lasted for three months, and currently they are still there but faded. At the time when the marks showed up, there was a tiny lump on the upper middle part of that breast, way higher up than the marks but directly above the first mark. Fast forward to this past Tuesday night. I happened to touch my chest by accident and it made me say ouch. I realized that the little tiny lump back then is now almost the size of my fist in width, about as long as my middle finger, hard as a rock, does not move, and the whole breast is very swollen. It feels like a peach pit. It does not hurt unless I push on it. I can feel it whether my arms are raised or lowered. That breast also feels very heavy, which did start at the same time as those marks. I am 41, do not have kids, and do not know any family history. My friend who has a history of breast cancer told me that I need to get this checked out. I do not know if this is an effect from whatever those marks were, but interesting that it is on the exact same side. I do not have anything on the other side. I am thin, so at first I thought it might be a bone, but there is nothing on the other side. If I look at the areola, it looks like there is a patch of it missing, but that may be from those marks. Does anyone have any thoughts? Thank you for your time. Log in to post a reply",
