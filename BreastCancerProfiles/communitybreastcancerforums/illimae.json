Lumpectomy/ Nodes / Something Else? To stop further spread and have lumpectomy. 3. Was it successful or did the breast cancer turn to Mets? I already had Mets but it was successful and reduced my tumor from the size of an egg to just a small group of cells. 4. If your daughter was given this treatment plan would you feel comfortable suggesting it to her? Yes, I wouldn\u2019t call it easy but it worked and chemo has come a long way in recent years. 5. Did this treatment prevent you from having any surgery after treatment? No, I had my lumpectomy as planned and the positive Axillary and supraclavicular nodes were no long visible by ultrasound after chemo. 6. Did you respond well to Neoadjuvant Chemo Treatment or did you need to stop and have surgery? I had a good response and had surgery after chemo as planned, I got to save more of my breast and had a reduction and lift at the same time. 7. Are you under 40? No but close, I was 41 when diagnosed. 8. I've read chemo is not effective and I'm concerned going this route will lessen my chance of survival or increase my chance of Mets if I do not respond to the chemo. I found it successful I\u2019m my case but your oncologist should be able to explain and answer all questions, if not, maybe meet a new one. Best of luck to you :)",

I should be receiving a spreadsheet soon with the exercises, reps (gradually increasing) and sample schedule soon for a 12 week period.

Our instructor plays a lot of Michael Jackson and Motown remixes, I like both, so it\u2019s cool for me. JoE, I wish I had some advice but although I have a few bone mets (left hip, right scapula and a lumbar), they\u2019ve never caused pain or discomfort. The hip bone was the only one present at dx and although confirmed as mets by biopsy, it was already healing. I do stretch every night, touch my toes, etc., I know that helps my joints at least, I get really stiff after sitting too long. Are you doing any post radiation exercises?",

So, got scan results a day early, as I received a call telling me to skip H&P treatment today and go to my MO\u2019s office instead. It was a bit alarming but I decided to reserve judgment until I read the results myself. Brain MRI is stable with lesions decreasing slightly in size, which is normal as the best results aren\u2019t seen until about 3 months post gamma knife. The CT body was also stable, nothing new, nothing suspicious (yay!!!) However, my echo revealed a decreased ejection fraction rate, this happens to some HER2+ people due to Herceptin, which is why my treatment was cancelled. So, off to an unplanned cardiology appt, I go. After he reviewed all echo results for the last year 1/2, he determined that there has been no steady decline and that the fluctuations are attributed to technician interpretations and a 5% +/- computer error rate. So, everything is good including my heart and treatment is back on. Tonight, I celebrate. ",

When found early and treated, especially with minimal disease in the body, life can resume to a fairly normal state. 3. MBC is typically not as show on TV.

I remember a girl in middle school was killed when a car hit her bicycle, it made a big impact in a town where nothing bad ever happened.

Hopefully, it\u2019s just SE\u2019s from something boring 🙂 Friday, I was asked to please stay a little longer and train the new person, the two higher ups are going the extra mile to try to make the bonus blunder right and I agreed to help out through July. I\u2019ll work a part time modified schedule as I see fit and will only train the new girl. My office will be cleared out this week and after Friday, I will not be responsible for anything but training. I feel good about it, I hated to leave them high and dry.

I don't feel very lucky with stage IV from the get go, then again, things could always be worse for anyof us. I hope you feel relief soon :)",

Even if you're \"cured\", it's possible it could come back, most likely within a few years but sometimes 15, 20 down the road. It seems to lurk around the corner and we have to find a way to both be aware and move on. 2. I got checked out 2 days after feeling my lump and was diagnosed in less than 2 weeks, I thought I caught it early but it was already stage IV at 41with a spot on my hip bone. In my opinion, catching it early is mostly luck not necessarily what cancer awareness ads and literature predict. The good news is we're tough enough to handle any crap that comes our way :)",

Toughiebird, sorry to hear you have so much weighing on you and agree that getting answers is critical even when you're too upset to think straight. As for diet, I don't think you need to do anything pre-surgery. Post surgery, I would have some prepared or easy meals, you probably won't feel like cooking right away. Coffee should be fine, I wasn't advised against it and drank daily but I would skip the wine for a while due to anesthesia and pain meds. Best of luck to you and your mom.",

My approach to scans is simple, I'm uneasy at times about the unknown but when I have facts, I can have a plan and I'm a planner. Even if it's bad news, I am so much more confident when I know what's what. I also love my annual evaluation at work, it's like my birthday, lol! (Last year I walked and said \u201cso, basically just tell me I'm awesome and you're giving me a raise\" and that's how it went 🙂) My bag is packed and I'm super excited!   ",

My maternal aunt was dxd about 5 years ago in her 60's, my mom was dxd about 3 years ago, also in her 60's. I told my PCP when I found out about my mom (this became more significant family history) and he ordered a mammogram just before my 40th birthday. The mammo was normal and my moms genetic testing came back negative, so life went on. Fast forward 18 months, Saturday 10/29/16, while undressing for bed I feel a lump, it was big, like an egg and I'm sure it wasn't there days before. I cal my PCP Monday morning 10/31, he does an exam that afternoon and orders a mammo. Mammo and ultrasound performed Friday 11/4, afterwards a nurse talks to DH and I and it sounds grim but I'm scheduled for a biopsy on Tuesday 11/8. Biopsy done and on Thursday 11/10 I get the \"I'm sorry, it's cancer\" call. I leave work immediately, go home and call MD Anderson. I'm seen and scanned at MDA on Wednesday 11/16 where due to a suspicious lesion on my hip bone, I was told I'd be treated as stage IV (bone biopsy later confirmed). I was completely blown away. Partly, because my genetic testing came back negative too, although I was told that there is very likely a risk associated with a combination of genes yet unknown. The other thing was that I thought, if I reacted quickly, I would catch it early. It never occurred to me that it could be so advanced before any symptoms appeared. What's got me though this is DH, of course! The fact that I've always felt I was a lucky person, minimal mets (just the left hip bone), having normal pre-cancer energy and my relaxed attitude.",

It started yesterday and I'm pretty sure it's nothing but will mention it anyway. Other than that, I'm well, catching up on shows and trying to stay reasonably active this week.

I passed my neuro exam with no symptoms from the lesions and as it turns out, the migraine may have been a lucky coincidence. Today, I feel good like usual but confused, I just don't get this cancer crap, how can I be in such poor condition without feeling the effects of it. It's so bizarre. Hopefully Mondays meeting with my MO comes with no news of any additional progressions.",

I think your actions were totally justified and that you should not feel the slightest bit bad about it. This is a little odd to read though as I am an uncaring daughter myself. I am never mean and I was generally neglected by workaholic parents, I even ran away once overnight and they never knew. Recently, my mother offered to come visit for a week, I advised her not to because we have nothing in common, she stresses me out and frankly I don\u2019t enjoy my parents company (I didn\u2019t actually say all that, only the stress part, lol). She is upset but i don\u2019t care, it is not my job to make her happy. My point is that you did your job raisingher to adulthood, you are not obligated by biology to take her shit.",

I work for the transportation dept in roadway maintenance, specifically contracting. The cost of cleaning up debris and fixing submerged pavement and traffic signal electronics will not be cheap. Both of my former supervisors have retired in recent years and I'm the only one left who's been through this before (Hurricane Ike was a direct hit), it's a lot of stress to try to be quick, efficient and train others in the process which includes lots of rules at the state and federal levels. So, the emergency work, plus concern about my area flooding on top of cancer has mad enough for a hell of a week. Still feeling good though :)",

Jumping in to the discussion here and while I'm not a parent, I am a kid (in my head I'm still 21). My parents grew up with rules and chores, so we had none. My older brother took full advantage of being momma's boy and lived w/my parents his entire 48 years so far, except for about 3 years when he dated his ex wife (dumbest person I've ever met!) and when they and their two sons lived with me. I on the other hand Iwas out at 18, back briefly after being laid off, then gone for good. I think it's more personality than how you raise the kids, some people just don't enjoy doing things for themselves. One the surface though, I might be seen as a brat. I raised myself and hope my parents saved money for a home when the time comes because they are on their own.",

I guess in some way I'm lucky, not many Stage IV folks even get surgery and I don't have to worry about becoming stage IV since I started here. I will tell you though, that chemo is totally doable and you are way tougher than you think. Live it up ladies :)",

The Port can be tricky, for me it was a little weird at first but I hardly noticed it after a week (hopefully, your port surgeon was dr. Brown and he sang to you). Just to clarify, I was diagnosed last November at stage IV from the beginning, so this is new for me too but I decided early on that I could lay down and worry or stand up and push on.

It has the same ingredient as the other two but instead of being mixed with a chemical solvent, it's mixed with albumin (human protein). It's considered by many to be a kinder chemo and works very well. It's more expensive and insurance wouldn't cover it until I tried and failed the other two first but there are option.

Do you get many comments like that and do you politely thank them or do you tell them that you are stage IV and that while you're treatable, you are not curable?

I do have 2-3 glasses usually once a week (Sunday nights I have friends over for dinner and TV, wine is part of that for me). I also enjoyed several at a brewery tasting and crawfish boil without regrets. Kandy, I've had a couple of glasses while taking tramadol but nothing harder than that, Vicodin once or twice maybe.
