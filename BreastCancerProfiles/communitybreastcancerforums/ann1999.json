She was the one to get an appointment for me the next day with an oncologist who saw me and was able to schedule the biopsy for a couple of days later. Otherwise it would have been at least eight week delay to see an oncologist as they are booked out so far. I\u2019m pretty sure telling them I wanted them to do the biopsy really caught their attention. Don\u2019t know know if you are going to have genetic testing done, but when I was there this past February it was a clinical trial so free - done through TEMPUS.

I\u2019ve read some of the posts but plan to continue. Know that I am very greatful to you for sharing your journey - it gives me support and hope on this sometimes lonely road that I have been on since first DX in 1999. To share with you, DX with MBC (liver and bones) 2/2018 after going through all of the AIs. I\u2019ve had IDC 1999 and ILC 2015 both new primaries ... yup that\u2019s right. I didn\u2019t even buy a ticket. Was on Ibrance and Faslodex since 3/18 and PET scan this week showed \u201cmixed treatment response\u201d with some liver lesions responding well and some growing. Yup and I checked to make sure it was my scan cause of course the panic sets in. So having a biopsy of the growing liver site and staring Halaven next week. Sounds like the infusion is quick but wondering if I need a PICC line - my veins aren\u2019t the best. Hate to lose the hair but that sounds like it will happen too at least to some degree... it really thinned out on the I/F too- so guess what the heck. We sure put up with a lot don\u2019t we? But it is worth it. I feel strongly that every step we take will help the medical community learn more so future women won\u2019t have to have to takeany steps down this road.

I can't thank you all enough for sharing your stories and knowledge - I am stronger and have hope because of you. I was DX with MBC with multiple liver and bone mets last month. I have a question about HER2 and wondering if anyone has any more insight or understanding about this test. Biopsy in 1999 was HER2 negative. The one in 2012 was HER2 \u201cequivocal\" with FISH showing negative. This timeout it was \u201cequivocal\" again and FISH came back negative again. My tumor ratio number was 1.02. To be positive had to be >=2. The report also said \u201cit is possible that this result may not represent the entire tumor population since only a part of the tumor was tested.\" I asked my oncologist if we should rebiopsy and he said no -I was definitely negative for HER 2. I tried to argue but that was useless. So I have tried to research this as much as I can on this site and google but still wonder about things. One site said HER2 Treatment may benefit those with \u201cequivocal\" results but couldn't find any specific research done. Should I rely on someone's rating that is only .08 away from a positive result which could lead to a different treatment plan? Genetic testing results won't be back for a couple more weeks. Will there be any results from that test that can provide more insight? Oh yes- my oncologist is from a very highly rated cancer center. After reading everything you all do in terms of research and advocating for yourself, I realize I have to up my game. My thoughts and prayers for everyone",

My previous MO was a \u201cstandard of care\u201d bone-head who my gut told me I should fire 2 years before I became metastatic. Mayo seems to be somewhat \u201cstandard of care\u201d too but there are definitely brain cells churning and so far the care/service is very good which gives me confidence that everything that can be done is being done - with of course my own advocacy. I will probably get another opinion because I want creative great minds to look at my case and u never know what they may be able to contribute. Yes insurance is a problem....grrr. Hope your visit goes great! I\u2019m on my way now to Rochester for my Havalen treatment! Cure- ious- thanks for the info on the CDK7",

I agree it should be so much easier to access information about clinical trials and the trials too. I tried an online clinical coordinator and that didn\u2019t work. I just keep Googling and I am soooo thankful for u and everyone else that shares what they have learned. By the way for those with lobular, I was interested in the ROLO trial in the UK. Actually got an email response from one of the MDs which was a surprise. The trial there hasn\u2019t started yet but learned one may start in the US. Don\u2019t have any more info on it but will try to learn more. ",

Hi Bornfighter - sounds like you are starting the Alisertib/Fulvestrant trial. Are u at Mayo Clinic or one of the other sites? Alisertib alone put the stop on my cancer for six months and now with progression added Fulvestrant. There is a thread for this clinical trial so please join us and keep us updated - if u want. Best to everyone",
