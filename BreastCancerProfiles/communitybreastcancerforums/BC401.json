The radiologist the one that set up the radiation schedule. The oncologist the one who 'took over' ongoing check ups etc ... following radiation treatment. Myself, continued to enjoy life once the surgery was over... but there will always be lapses .. generally nothing happens until a month after surgery to give surgical site time to heal. I took 2 personal extended stays with family and friends prior to my radiation treatments, for ex. As to the importance of enjoying each day ... that goal remained firm in my mind. Good Luck and God Bless.",
