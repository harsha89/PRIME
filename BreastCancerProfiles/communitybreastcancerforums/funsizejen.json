There are so many options. I can tell you that I personally opted for the mastectomy because I didn't want to go through this same diagnosis again. I had cancer in one breast and numerous suspicious areas in the other. I felt like I would always be worried and having biopsies every few months, So, the pros are that my breasts are reconstructed and symmetrical and I haven't had any more breast cancer scares. The con is that I no longer have real breasts! Wishing you wisdom and clarity as you make your decisions!",
