The needle is not that large and would not suck out an entire 1cm breast lump which i assumed was fixed to the tissue and cannot be sucked up through a needle. Also, if that happened, it would cause all sorts of problems for every diagnosis because women would be told they have smaller tumors when really their tumors are 5mm-1cm larger, which would effect outcomes and treatments. The core needle biopsy is meant to give just a sampling of cells. Kathie100, i do believe that mammos and MRIs are more sensitive to size than an ultrasound. What size did your original mammos indicate? I wouldn't assume it is gone if the biopsy came back positive, it may just be hiding or the MRI might not be clear. I had to repeat an MRI when I moved to a top cancer center because the local place that did my MRI had a unclear image according to my breast surgeon. Also, special K is right. Your Her2 status does matter. It is very important and can change your treatment. If it is your doctor telling you that it does not matter, I think you need to see another doctor because that would not be following guidelines for treatment. There is a chance that if you had a really, extremely tiny tumor, herceptin would not be advised because the risks outweigh the benefits, but if you have a 1cm tumor, i do believe herceptin is advised. But, you may get results of your fish that the tumor is her2 neg. and that is important to know too. You would then be able to have your tumor sent for oncotype (assuming early stage, hormone positive) which will give you an approximate score of your risk of recurrence. ",
