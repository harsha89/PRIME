My question is - has anyone had their port removed? What is it like? Mine was a godsend for chemo to go IN but never worked quite right for blood to come out - and I still can feel it when I lay certain ways, etc....I want it out of me. Thanks for any input and good luck to all this week!",

I am glad to have 7 done - should be done week before Thanksgiving - but the fatigue is a factor.  They told me that the lasting fatigue from chemo will roll into the fatigue from rads.  I really cant imagine getting the fatigue from the 5 minute zaps but I still have the heavy leg thing going from chemo - My duaghter tells me that doing 2 Making Strides Against Breast Cancer 3 mile walks in 2 weeks may have been a bit much. Anyone know when hair grows back?  I never lost all my eyebrows - my lashes were always sparse - I was actually hoping they would fall out and grow back thicker like they tell you your hair will but no luck with that one.  But hair on my head is NOT there yet - nothing under my arms or on my legs - geting tired of the wig - wear it to work and out but when get home - wear a turban thing that is soft and comfie!  I think back to after I started chemo - every morning I would wake up and look at the pillow - for hair to have fallen out - now every morning I wake up and ask my honey - did any hair grow? I have an odd sense of humor. Well , It is Friday so no rads til Monday - yeah - just having to leave for work earlier to go there first is making me tired - LOL Next week I hit the big 50 - get to go for a lymphedema consult on my B-day- my rad onc sends everyone even if having no problems - get my port removed the next morning - yeah to that - and on Fridaynight - get to go out to a nice dinner/staff appreciation event (very small staff) at a local winery - so big week for me - then I may sleep for a day or so. Have a great weekend all!",

Diamond Girl - that is awful what happened to you - I am so lucky I have wonderful techs - they are all women although my sim/tatoos were done by a guy -he was so nice. He is usually on the other machine while I am there. I am tired though - and having finished chemo 5 weeks ago - I really wish I had more hair! Any ideas on how to make it grow faster?????It appears to be coming back on my legs - whopee - how about my head? But others have it much worse than I - I do not have small children etc depending on me each day - I can go to work and then come home and simply sit or sleep if I want to. Myhouse is a mess though - the vacuum cleaner does not hold much appeal after a long day at work. Tomorrow is Friday - yeah for that and two days off from rads! Everyone have a  great day and weekend!",

As to male/female - when I went for my sim and the tattoos - I had a male - and my rad onc was there - he is male as well.  I then looked at the list of techs and I had gotten the only male. He was very caring and tried to keep me covered as much as you can be.  I have two females each day for my treatments now - they are great! I can't see any side effects but I feel like a slight pressure when I lay on that side - I think it could be in my head - too early to prob feel anything? I am three weeks post chemo - but still have the fatigue feeling in my legs - it is very annoying. I have worked full time through all of this - lumpectomy, chemo, and now radiation. I obviously took day of surgery off and the first day of chemo(1st treatment) as well but have worked rest of time.  My job is as a finance/business manager - so not strenuous labor - biggest danger is falling asleep at my desk - which has almost happened. But when I go home I am tired - I do far fewer errands etc on way home.  And by Friday evening - you wont find me out \"clubbing\" . I am lucky to stay awake until the TV show at 9 is over. I will start tamoxifen after rads- the onc here feel that it can cause swelling with rads so like you to wait.  Not really sure if pre or post menopausal yet - will be 50 next week! No regualr periods but part of that was due to birth control before diagnosis. Sorry to ramble- my current thing that has set me off is that I am having my port (from chemo) removed next week - surgeon says - oh we just numb it up and take it out - very quick. So the paper comes from the Ambulatory Quick Surgery Center - the word surgery bothers me - scares me etc.  My Sig Other - says - it is just a word - you know - it will be quick - after all that you have been through - why should it bother you?  NOw let me say that he has been the MOST caring and attentive and wonderful man for all of this - but he just cant understand some things. hard as he tries.. The nice thing is that all of you understand - even when I know I am not being rational - just emotional - unless you have been there - you cannot understand - THANKS TO ALL OF YOU FOR LISTENING- and yes I am shouting. Love to all",

I went yesterday for my markings and simulation - expect to hear back from them next week and get started beginning of Oct - 26 w/ 8 boosts - can be done by Thanksgiving! Yeah - then on to Tamoxifen. Did not have serious SE from chemo - just frustrated at the fatigue level - especially in my legs - they feel like they weigh 100 lbs a piece when trying to walk. But I hope Rads will be a bit easier than chemo. Enough about me - hope all of you are doing well and we can go through this part of our experience together. Bopeep - sorry you are doing this again but your insights and experience will be an inspiration to us all. Everyone have a great day!",
