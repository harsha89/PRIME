I was called back for a diagnostic mammogram because of some microcalcifications. Slightly more calcifications were seen this time (8 as opposed to 5). My radiologist recommended I speak with a surgeon about a stereotactic biopsy. During my breast exam with the surgeon, she discovered my right breast (same breast as the calcifications) had a nipple discharge from one of the ducts. I have known this for about 6 years, I had even mentioned it to my gyn way back when I first noticed it and she said it was normal. Now I am completely terrified. I am scheduled to have an ultrasound on Tuesday to look under the nipple. For what? There is no lump that can be felt. Has anyone else out there ever had a nipple discharge for that long? Should I be worried because it has gone on for so long, or less worried because it has gone on for so long? Help!",
