When I was disagnosed with BC at age 39, 6 years after my twin sister was diagnosed (she underwent BRAC testing twice prior to my diagnosis. Both results were - yes you have a mutation, but it is of undertermined signigicance). I briefly considered lumpectomy - my breast surgeon gave me all the facts - she was very unbiased in which course I would consider - but I am a mother of 4 young children  - and I know cancer comes back - so I decided to undergo a BMX. After 6 years of being cancer free and seeing how 'easy' I made my surgery (w/recon) look, my twin underwent a Proph BMX too. Only after I made my decision did I learn I was also BRAC1 + with a mutation of 'undertermined significance',  However, in defense of the gene testing, 9 months after my diagnosis, my analysis was changed to 'suspected deleterious' meaning - they had more data collected/analyzed and it showed that my particular mutation would result in increased chance of bc. I'm now 'in remission' and I sleep better at night. But cancer is always a crap shoot, if you will. I have 3 daughters and 1 son and I have a heavy heart thinking I may have passed along my compromised genes to them. What will I tell them?  Best wishes in your journey.  Diane at Pink Pockets - The Surgical Drain Solution   www.pink-pockets.com",
