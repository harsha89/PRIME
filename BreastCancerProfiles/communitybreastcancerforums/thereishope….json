(61), and strong family history of cancer, he believed chemo was a good choice.  He would have advised a family member with the same results to do the same. He is referring me to an oncologist and now I will have to wait AGAIN until March 8th.  I shouldn't complain because that will give me time to prepare myself for what is to come.  Actually, my daughter (who is an RN) said that she knew it was a good decision for me to proceed with chemo given the type of person that I am.  She said if your score had been lower and you didn't have the option to choose, you would have always wondered if you should have done more.  So, I'm going to \"kick butt\" and get through this like so many others have.  Again, so glad to have this web site to lean on.  Thanks for listening!  Karen",

I've made a few posts on this web site, but am glad to find a Stage I \"home.\"  I had a BLMx on January 5th of this year.  My drains are all out and I'm busy filling up with fluid, especially on the left side where nodes were removed. It isn't painful, just weird feeling.  My surgeon will drain them the end of the week. I am unusual in that I had a false positive on my sentinal lymph node at surgery.  I learned that less than one percent of people get a false positive.  It was good news to find out that the cancer had not spread when the lab reports came back a few days later, but by that time they had removed an additional 13 nodes.  Not that many, as I understand it.  Lymphadema chances are very low.  So, now I'm waiting for my OncoType DX score to get going on my treatment.  I hope it just involves hormone therapy.  We'll see.  Hopefully the score will be in by Friday, which is my next follow-up appointment with my surgeon.  I can't help but feel that my dx just barely meets the criteria for serious consideration compared to higher stages, etc. of BC.  But, cancer is cancer.  I'm learning that it can come back no matter how much we do to prevent it.  That, in itself, is reason enough to need the support of others.  So, I feel blessed to have others with Stage I to share with.  Looking forward to knowing y'all.  Karen (aka ThereIsHope)",
