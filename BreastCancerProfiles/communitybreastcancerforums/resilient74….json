No family history, they said it looked like a harmless fibroadenoma. But then it wasn't. It's definitely a crazy ride. So many appts, tests, more tests. I just had the first of 6 chemos, and there will be surgery, radiation, and herceptin infusions for a full year. But, it's treatable, and I get to keep my breast. So what if I have to lose my hair? It's all only temporary. Trying to stay focused on the positives ;) Much love!",
