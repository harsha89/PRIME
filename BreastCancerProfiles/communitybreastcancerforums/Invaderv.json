    "Content": "Invaderv wrote: I am a 25 year old woman who used to be dangerously thin, and gained a great deal of weight over the last 3 years (105 lbs to 280 lbs). I did not really develop breasts until I was about 19/20 - likely due to the eating disorder - but am now very top heavy. As such, I don't really know if what is happening to me is normal or not, and I'm quite scared. I currently have what seem to be multiple signs of breast cancer: severe itching, pronounced veins, and dimpling. About 2 months ago, I noticed my left areola was staring to invert, just to the side of my nipple. It came and went at various times and I didn't really register it. However, it has recently become inverted all the time, and much more prominently, especially when I am lying down. However, despite rigorous checks, I don't feel a lump anywhere. If anything, I seem to be lacking tissue in the center of my breast. Apologies in advance for the freakiness, but I can even stick my hand into the center of my breast about half the depth of a pants pocket without feeling any tissue. After keeping my weight under control for a year, I recently fell of the food wagon and gained about 40 pounds in the last 6 months. I'm hoping this issue is simply related to the weight gain, but I can't find any evidence that plain fat inverts your nipples. I'm not pregnant either, nor do I think I have fibrous breast tissue. My mother died of bladder cancer when I was a teenager, and my aunt currently has ovarian cancer. However, there is no history of breast cancer, specifically, in my family at all. But what else could this possibly be? I've scheduled a doctor's appointment for next week but I can't sleep for fear. Please help me. I'm aware my weight fluctuations are not healthy, but I am worried something is additionally, terribly wrong. Is this probably just a rapid-weight-gain problem, or should I be concerned about cancer? I'm so scared... Log in to post a reply",
