My first nurse navigator left a lot out so I was kind of blindsided by the call about genetic testing with terminology I had never heard before and very frightened when I looked up the type of cancer. I have a triple negative stage 2 cancer. They are testing for the BRAC1 and 2 which may change how I want to plan my treatment. The surgeon says I most certainly should be able to have some sort of reconstruction, just not the type that uses my own muscles and fat because that is too hard to heal for a diabetic. I do feel a little better now.",

I go bald at home all the time unless my head is cold. Even though I am on the Taxol I have some blond hair about 1/4 inch all over my head growing in.  Very soft and fine. Sparse though.  I think I will come back as Pink. LOL",
