My symptons was bloody discharge from my nipple--so not same as you--however i went through many imaging-ultrasound, xray, MRI and ductogram--they couldn't find anything--I was at wits end and worried--but reassured I guess that it was about a 13% chance of cancer--still enough to worry me--but the doctor persisted and talked to one of his colleagues and asked for another ultrasound and it was then they saw a 'white; mass--and biopsied it--so I was in the 13% but it was a great sense of relief to have an answer and get on with treatement--while it was still small. I can honestly say the worry of not knowing was, for me, way more stressful than the shick/suprise offinding out I had concer. So good luck to you",

Really a constant worry. In the end in my case I was very glad that my doctor was very persistent (took 5 months to finaly get to the bottom of it). I think it is a good sign you have doctors who want to find answers. I wish you a very speedy discovery and resolution--and hope/trust it is nothing more than dense breast tissue. If it isn't, then you will have the reassurance that something is happening for which treatment can then immediately begin. Take care. You are well supported here.",

In my case, I had bloody discharge and I had galactagrams, ultrasounds, x-ray, mamagrams and a MRI--they could not detect what was going on. Finally after 5 months they decided to do one more ultrasound and found something to biopsy, and it turned out to be cancer. As shocking as the news was, and it was shocking to me, I was so relieved to find out what was wrong and ironically I was so thankful to have the discharge--as they found the tumour, it was small and I have negative nodes--so without the discharge, I probably would still have a tumour growing undetected.--so even when these things turn out 'bad' there can be a silver lining.",

I happened to be one of the more unusual cases that was not benign. However, as shocking as the news was I look back now and thank my lucky stars that I had some discharge to alert me that something was going on--the alternative of having something going on  undetected would have been far worse. I had a galactogram (ductogram)--usually that will determine there is a benign papiloma. So, chances are very  high this is nothing to worry about. Best wishes to you both.",
