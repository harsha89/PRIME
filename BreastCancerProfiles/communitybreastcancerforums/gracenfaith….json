Lymph node negative, er/pr+, her 2  neg. in January. Because my pr% is low, my onco ordered a onco dx test and I'm waiting for results. Praying I don't need chemo.  I've been researching everyday about side effects of radiation and am leaning towards a bilateral mx w reconstruction. My RO felt it may be a little overboard, but I know I'm a worry wart and can't just skip the rads and do just the tamoxifen and chemo if necessary. My RO said there was a 1% chance in 10 yrs to  get a cancer  from the radiation and 2% in 15 yrs in your body, not just the breast.  Clearly there are other short term side effects but he really downplayed any short term side effects. I should have asked if this risk continues to rise as the years pass. I know a bilateral mx is major surgery, but I met wonderful woman on this forum while searching for a reputable plastic surgeon who have gone through it and are very happy with their choice. I figure if I can get through the surgery with no complications, I won't have to always wonder what the radiation will bring years down the line. Don't get me wrong, I'm still struggling and contemplating if this is the right choice, but this is where I am currently. I met with ps today and thought it would help, but I've decided to get some second opinions. I know there's not much data out there on LT effects of radiation and ultimately, it's going to be what feels right to me. I pray everyday for strength and guidance to make the right choice for me and my kids. There's days where I'm so mentally exhausted and scared, but I know I need to be strong for my kids and that we will get through this! ",
