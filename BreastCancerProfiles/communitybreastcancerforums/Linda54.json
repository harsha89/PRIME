I am 6 weeks post-op.  I am going through the expansion stage and hope to be finished by September.  Good luck to you..... Linda",

I was going through infertility treatment when my first cancer was found.  I had taken DES as a treatment for infertility.  Even though it caused cancer in mice my doctor told me that I did not take enough for it to cause my breast cancer.  They give large doses to the mice he said.  I was the first and so far the only one in my immediate family to get breast cancer or any cancer. This was 25 yrs ago. I had a lumpectomy with rads.  2.5 yrs ago DCIS was found in the same breast so I had a bi-lateral MX with reconstruction. Who can say that the DES I took did not cause my cancer....no one.... I was 31 yrs old at my first DX and I did not continue infertility treatment.  2.5 yrs later I got pregnant and had a healthy son....and only child. I have talked to him about men getting breast cancer and not to ever overlook a lump, no matter how small it is.  DES could affect our sons too.",
