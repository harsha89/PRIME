I had a concerning mammogram and they requested a diagnostic mammogram and now they said Birad 4 for a new cluster of calcification since last year. My aunt passed from ovarian cancer a couple of years ago at 50 and we've already been watching a 3cm lump on my thyroid and now this. They are going to ultrasound the thyriod and do the breast biopsy on Thursday and I can't calm down. I'm researching and watching videos and thinking of my teen and I swear I feel the lump on my thyroid when I swallow, but I don't know if it's in my head or not. I'm loosing weight and sleep I lost 4 close family members in 2 years including my Dad and I just feel like I can't breath. I'm scared of the procedure and the possible out come and I feel like I'm fighting tears always and I don't know if thyroid and breast could be related.. seems so close. Thanks for letting me vent a little, just don't know what to do. Log in to post a reply",
