I want to do everything I can to prevent another reoccurrence but I\u2019m afraid of the possible side effects of radiating the same area.  The doctors\u2019 plans are so different. Can anyone offer any information?  I don't know what to do.

I had a CT scan today to develop a new plan with the doctor who provided the second opinion.  I crossed paths with the original doctor after the second opinion appointment yesterday and she looked past me.  It made me feel uncomfortable, especially since she will be responsible for my care if the new doctor is not available.",
