      "Content": "madeditor wrote: have had my port since early August. It was hard to access at first because of swelling at the site. Got through adriamycin and cytoxin just fine although it had some buildup and they needed to inject a medication to clear it. When I went to chemo to begin the taxol my port wasn't working right. No blood flow. So we did it intravenously last week and this week. I have to go for a dye study next week. I really am not looking forward to it. If it isn't working, I don't want a new one put in. I am done with unneccesary surgery. Just take it out. I'll go the next 10 rounds as I have the last two. Any of you have this problem? I've been doing so well and really hate to see anything ruin the momentum.  Dx 5/29/2014, IDC, 2cm, Stage IIIB, 6/17 nodes, ER+/PR-, HER2- Surgery 7/2/2014 Lumpectomy: Left; Lymph node removal: Left, Underarm/Axillary Chemotherapy 8/13/2014 Adriamycin (doxorubicin), Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide), Taxotere (docetaxel) Log in to post a reply",

This is a just in case treatment since I had lymph nodes removed along with the lumpectomy. Radiation begins in 2015 and I plan to be done and move on. If it comes back, it comes back. Once I am done with treatment I wanted this thing out of me anyhow. I'll discuss with my doc, of course. But I'm really done with this thing.",

You can imagine how vigorously I rang that bell! I'm near the end of my radiation and the first thing I am going to do once radiation is completed is have the port removed. It bothers me when I roll over in bed. The area around it often becomes sore. In order to move on, I need it gone. If cancer comes back, I'll deal with it. But right now I need to be free and think positive. My oncologist is supportive of my decision and has gone over all the possibilities with me. I need to focus ahead and never look back. ",

The hysterectomy was the easiest to recuperate from. I could have gone back to work in a week, except for underarm pain and drains. I am happy to report that I will return to the office on July 21 - a couple of weeks prior to my 66th birthday. Chemo and radiation ahead are probably going to be the hardest parts of my journey. Good luck. You'll be fine!",
