I had a mammogram and all that was found was a small (2mm) area which I was told is a lymph node, and not to worry, just come back in 6 months for a follow up mammogram, my PCP just wanted to err on the side of caution and sent me for an MRI which came back with \"no suspicious findings\". I asked my gyno about it and he did an exam and found nothing. My worrisome nature is getting the better of my here and I'm still worried about it. My friend told me that since it seems to appear in the beginning of each month, it is probably hormone related, she said since I'm pushing 40 my body is going to start doing all sorts of nice things to me, which is something my Gyno also mentioned. I know I should probably be put at ease, but I guess I'm just looking for someone else to tell me that they are both probably right, it's just that this month it seems to be coming with a little more frequency than most other months, in fact last month I didn't have it all, come to think of it. One more thing...has anyone heard of caffeine causing problems with their breasts, because I had given up caffeine for a while, which seemed to coincide with the no pain and burning, but now I'm off the wagon, I wonder if it's possible, or just coincidence. I'm sorry for all the questions, I just wanted to ask people who might know. Thank you in advance for any replies. Log in to post a reply",

I was worried when the tech came out and said she had to do the right breast again, so she did, and then told me the radiologist would talk to me. When the radiologist came out she told me that \"there's a lymph node in my right breast\" she went on to say that is not at all uncommon, she sees it all the time, and there were no worrisome findings. She said since it was my first mammo, that she wanted to see me back in 6 months. I'm just wondering why, if \"there were no worrisome findings\" I'm so worried, should I be???
