Later that day a tightness developed across my right breast and upper back. I have not been unwell but did have a reaction to an insect bite, which i was putting it down to. I went to the GP today and was given a referral to an ultrasound after saying I would prefer to avoid a mammogram if possible. Now i have an uncomfortable stiffness above my left collar bone and am starting to feel a little heated inside, like one does when they're starting to feel a little unwell. I will proceed with the ultrasound tomorrow and follow up from there. wasn't too concerned until today after speaking to my mother, finding out that my aunt had breast cancer a few years ago and both my maternal and paternal grandmothers had breast cancer before it progressed into other cancers. I am calm and feeling proactive but would like to learn a little more regardless of whether it turns out to be breast cancer. I guess I am wondering if anyone here had a similar experience or symptoms. I Also, has anyone here had genetic/dna testing? I'd be interested in knowing the cost and whether is covered by Medicare (I am in Australia) Log in to post a reply",

The GP said it felt like my lymph node was swollen. I also have a smaller lump which i have had for years and was told was a Ganglion cyst. It is on the same armpit and probably unrelated but am wondering now.",

I can assure you I am not asking for a diagnosis, I was actually hoping to chat more about experiences, whilst waiting for my diagnosis and wondering whether anyone here had experienced something similar. If that is not allowed that is fine. I am a little confused. I am interested in seeing the link about family history and genetics.",

I am really trying not to get further ahead with this than I am, stay in the now and curious about this knowing that i can cross whichever bridges I need to when i come to them. All of this helps as i am finding being curious and trying to learn more is allowing me to do so whilst not going into denial with possibilities either. I am 44 years old. I have only just found out that both paternal and maternal grandmothers had breast cancer and had assumed that it had turned into other cancers because from memory my paternal Grandmother died from pneumonia and had leukemia at the time. It is something that i will need to discuss further with my mother. My paternal Grandfather had cancer also though i am not sure specifically which one either. I will need to look into that as well as whether there are any others in my family who have had cancer and if so, what type. Thank you for sharing the information with regards to genetic testing also. It's all very interesting. The particular gene you have is what I had read about in passing in another article and actually what led me to know that genetic testing for such things is available.",

He has sent a referral to have a biopsy as they found 2 lumps, one in each breast. Apparently the lymph node is ok according to the scan however I thought i read somewhere that ultrasound isn't very effective with lymph nodes/glands? Does anyone know this to be true? Regardless, I would like to know what is happening with my lymph as well, i find it hard to dismiss as it's not usual and if it is signalling an infection then why isn't that being addressed? Also, why do i think of these questions only after leaving the doctors.. sigh. So, the next step is a scary one for me and am hoping they can perform it under a general. I know the chances are slim however, I do not do well with needles at all. The mental anxiety i can manage, I am just not sure I can stay conscious. If anyone here experiences similar fear/phobia and has had to have this procedure, please sing out The GP has also referred me for bloods to screen hormone levels, which i am grateful for but am puzzled as to why he wouldn't have requested a blood count or to test for an infection as well. What a process this is, it's a real doozy, on every level.",

I only pressed her, once upon lying down, as to whether she could tell me what she sees. She responded with a very firm no. So I thanked her for being clear with the boundary and laughed as i tried to look at the screen whilst twisting my neck awkwardly. I, of course, had no idea what i was looking at but it was still fascinating. She looked at both breasts although the referral specified one as I had a dull ache/tightness under the collarbone on the other side. What I am curious about now, is what do they biopsy if they find no lumps or masses within my breasts? Can it be completed under a general anaesthetic? The ultrasound operator took quite a number of captures and measured a few black areas within both breast's tissue. Are these the areas which would be of concern and possibly biopsied? I need to wait until next week to see the GP for results.",

I ended up revisiting the female GP I usually see and she spent a good 30 minutes chatting with me and helping em to debrief. She has sent a referral to a hospital and requested that i have a general or at least conscious anesthesia. She said they're not cysts and that they may want to do an excisional biopsy as you mention. I was told the hospital will be in contact shortly as i would be considered fairly high priority. She also says that the chances of me having bilateral breast cancer would be slim. Also that there was no need for blood screening at this stage, so one needle averted there. I am not sure but waiting has been hard. I am now coming down with a cold so am now glad that i have a chance to recover beforehand. This process certainly shakes things up and though i have not liked the waiting, I have been glad for the time for things to settle down a little.",
