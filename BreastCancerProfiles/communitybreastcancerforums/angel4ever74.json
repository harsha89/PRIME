Of course I'm a little nervous, but not as much as I was before.   I received a copy of my report from the radiologist and this is what it says: Mammogram: Extremely dense breast tissue, could obscure a lesion Needs additional imaging, ACI BI-RAD 0 Ultrasound and spot films were perfomed the same day and correlated with the mammogram. Follow up or surgical consultation is recommended. BI-RAD 4A Ultrasound: There are small hypoechoic areas noted at the 1 o'clock position measuring .7 x .2 x .5 cm, at the 5 o'clock position measuring .4 x .5 x .5 cm. There is a inhomogenous ill defined structure with cystic components noted at the 11 o'clock position measuring 1.1 x 1.6 x 1.7 cm. Dilated ducts are noted adjacent to this structure. Impression: Multiple hypoechoic areas as described, ill inhomogenous lesion at the 11 o'clock position, follow up or surgical consultation is recommended for the 11 o'clock lesion. I'm a little worried because the BI-RAD score is a 4A. I'm also concerned because it says that it's ill defined but has cystic components. The breast specialist says she feels strongly that it's fatty tissue. However, I can't help but be very worried about this. What's the chances that this could be cancerous? Any input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! Log in to post a reply",
