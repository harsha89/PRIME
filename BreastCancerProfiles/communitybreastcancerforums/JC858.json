Wearing my bra constantly really helps.   Are you able to move your arm?  I am having a hard time lifting my arm over my head, and I don't have much strength in it. Does anyone know how long it takes to regain strength and mobility?",

He knew when to leave it alone. I was impressed. Wearing my bra was extremely helpful.  I experienced a lot of pain. I hope your surgeon drains it for you when needed; like someone else said, there is instant relief when it is drained.",
