I will check in during the next couple of weeks to track my healing of the underarm and the underbreast pain.  But, to answer the question \"When will they find a better way to take care of cancer?\"  I believe it will be when men start getting breast cancer.  And although I do have one male friend who has been diagnosed with breast cancer, I don't believe that is going to happen to any large number of men.   We women will have to figure out an alternative way to bring it to the attention of a world dominated by patriarchal interests and standards.  I only have the slightest hope for the empowerment of women doctors and researchers who have been able to go through the system while maintaining the egalitarian traits of our ancient cultures of the loving nature of The Great Mother, also  known by many of the lucky ones as our Loving Grandmothers (I am one of those fortunate ones) who made sure everyone had a place to live, clothes to wear, food to eat and proper healthcare.  Any ideas, anyone, for how to make that work in this arena?",
