At first we thought it was the cipro I was on for a UTI but I have been off of it almost a week and still completely covered in hives. Dr put me on prednisone and xyzal. Had a cortisone shot yesterday. Nothing is helping. The plan with the Oncologist office is to stop the aromasin for 1 week starting Sunday. If the hives disappear then we know the aromasin is the culprit. I am so sad. I did not do well on armidex or femara, blood pressure was too high. Can't take tamoxifen as i developed a blood clot. Armoasin was my last hope. Anyone else has experienced hives and aromsin?",
