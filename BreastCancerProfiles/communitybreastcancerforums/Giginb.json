I can see some hairs already coming back but the color of my skin is so dark right where my eyebrows are/were. I can't seem to find any info about this online and hoping someone here has had a similar experience?",

I am 3 1/2 months PFC and getting my hair colored in 2 weeks. I can't wait. Hoping it turns out nice. I have always had long hair and would have never cut my hair short. Even though I plan on letting my hair grow, I don't mind as much as I thought my pixie hair-do. At my appt with my MO last week he told me that I looked sexy with short hair (LOL).",

I find it strange how my WBC and RBC is lower now than it was during chemo. My MO had me take 1 neuprogen shot on Wednesday and I had my blood drawn this morning. I will be having a lumpectomy, sentinel node biopsy implants removed and replaced with smaller implants and a lift. I originally planned on implants removed and not replaced but PS convinced me I would not be happy with outcome. He also gave a something called Venapro. They are cuffs/wraps for my calves that are electric/or battery charged (have not opened box yet). I am suppose to wear them at least 8 hours a day after surgery to help prevent blood clots. Does anyone else have these? I, like most everyone, am very nervous about my surgery and even more so about what the outcome of my surgery. Did they get clean margins? Has my cancer spread to my lymph nodes ? Pain? After my cosmetic breast implant surgery 16 years ago I was in so much pain I felt like an elephant was sitting on my chest. I thought at the time if I knew how uncomfortable it would be I would have never done it. Anyways, I am happy to have found this place. I pray everyone has a speedy recovery. ",
