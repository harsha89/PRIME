They didn't find anything additional on my scan. I know whatever decision you make will be fine. Take someone with you for emotional support if you would like. They didn't have any talk after mine.",

I have been on hormone blocker for 2 months now. The title Breast Cancer Survivor is not one I had ever hoped to have. This whole process is just crappiness. I'm glad the tumor is gone and I hope to not ever have another but it is just the chapter not the entire book. My son asked, I know you have all that happening but how's the rest of your life? Really, consumed with fatigue and trips to radiation that IS the rest of my life, for now. I don't have the energy to do much more! Geez. Oh and apparently, I still \"look good\"! What's that supposed to mean anyway? I don't look like I have cancer? Great! Yea me! I know it could be worse, but it's bad enough, thank you!",

I'm tender under my arm and across the breast. I have a lot of \"random boob pain\" that hits and goes away. I had one sentinel node removed but ended up with at least a 4\" incision, no cancer in the node. My oncotype score eliminated my need for chemo, yea! My score was 15. Started the arimidex a little over a week ago and I am fatigued and achy in the bones. I'm still working full time. Thankfully it's not a strenuous job. I work in an office. Thank goodness because I wonder how the radiation will affect me with the fatigue. I am saving as much of my paid time off as I can just in case I need to take some time. I don't have a lot since I've been at this job only 2 years. I run out of energy fast. I wake up in the morning feeling like I could easily sleep a few more hours. I'm just trying to keep on so I can keep on. I am a lot more emotional. I try not to complain but I'm just feeling miserable all over.",
