There are some steps in preparing the slides for examination that just take time to complete. Some places do frozen sections which can be examined much more quickly, but from what I read that's not as accurate. The biopsy itself wasn't bad at all. I got as comfortable as I could on the MRI table (really important) and didn't have any problems with staying still. The staff apologized profusely in advance for having to use paddles to compress my breast, so I was expecting that to be horrible because I thought it would be like having an hour-long mammogram, but it wasn't as tight as a regular mammogram, and truly didn't bother me. There was a sort of pinch when they injected the numbing medication, but it wasn't severe enough to make me flinch. The actual biopsy wasn't a problem either. They injected more numbing medication before each portion of the biopsy, which I didn't feel at all. I did get a hematoma (sort of a blood blister into the breast tissue--it feels like a lump about the size of a pingpong ball now) which the radiologist informed me of before I even got off the table, but that's uncommon and not particularly painful. In fact, the only thing that actually hurt--and that wasn't much--was when they accidentally pinched me as they were releasing the paddles that compress your breast. So I don't think the biopsy itself was awful. IMO, the waiting is really the worst part. This has been a multi-part experience for me. First the original MRI on September 10th. The call-back the next day. Waiting for over a week to get in for the core biopsy. Waiting for the pathology on those results. Now waiting for an appointment with a surgeon to talk about the excisional biopsy, and then, I'm sure, more waiting for the biopsy itself and then another 5-7 business day wait for pathology again. The only plus to the whole process is that it's given me time to do research so I feel that I know what to expect, which makes me less anxious. I just hope this is all going to turn out to be benign. Good luck to you!",

That was over a week ago, but it takes 5-7 work days to get results, and we're in the military system, so the recent federal holiday is slowing things up. Today is realistically only the second day that I could expect to hear anything. The thing is, all of this originally started with a screening MRI back on Sep. 10th, so it's been dragging on for well over a month. I was informed the day after the first MRI that something was of concern and I'd need to come back for further testing. At first I wasn't concerned at all because I knew MRIs have a lot of false positives, but as I've moved through the testing process I've gotten a little more concerned. I had no idea it would take so long to get an answer. I've been told that whatever they're looking at is about 7mm, so it's still pretty small. The ultrasound couldn't see anything, and my surgeon couldn't feel anything. (I'm high risk because I have ADH, so I go in for a manual exam by a breast surgeon and alternating mammograms and MRIs every six months.) However, whatever they're seeing on the MRI was concerning enough to trigger a needle core biopsy. Since that's only recommended for BI-RADS 4 and up, I'm assuming I'm in that category. I realize that BI-RADS 4 patients are quite unlikely to have even DCIS, but due to the fact that I have ADH and other risk factors, my personal lifetime risk for developing breast cancer is 37.4% That's high enough to freak me out a bit. The waiting is getting on my nerves. Sigh. I really hope I hear something today and that I'm worrying pointlessly. Sue Log in to post a reply",

The verdict is a radial scar (a small complex sclerosing lesion) plus atypical lobular hyperplasia (in addition to the atypical ductal hyperplasia that we already knew about). Because all of this means there's still an increased risk of some LCIS hiding in the area, and because they like to be conservative, I'm going to have to have another needle localization biopsy so they can take the area out and take a closer look. The clinic nurse will be getting back to me to schedule that. The good news is that today's results are benign. Yay!!! The bad news is that I get to have more surgery and wait some more. Sue",

Also, they are *sometimes* associated with LCIS or ILC at the edges of the lobules (I've read everything from 7 or 8 percent of the time up to 30% depending on whose study was being looked at--with the higher numbers being associated with atypia at the same time) which can be missed because core biopsies only sample a small area of the lesion. Therefore, many doctors feel the prudent course of action is to do an excisional biopsy to remove the entire area so it can be checked. That said, the lesion/scar is considered to be a benign finding unless further examination finds something to the contrary--which is usually doesn't. Because of that, some doctors feel that close monitoring with more frequent exams/screening is an appropriate course of action. My own surgeon is doing an excisional biopsy on my radial scar this Friday because I do have atypia.",

      "Content": "Oct 28, 2015 08:21AM Suetois wrote: Still waiting. I saw the BS yesterday for about 5 minutes. I asked for a copy of the pathology report, which the doctor had one of his minions get for me after he'd left the exam room. I was given the patient's version of the report which has essentially no information on it other than the names of the findings. I've been given real path reports in the past, so I know they're actually much more detailed. So that was irritating. I also asked about the cosmetic impact. The doctor told me that he'd be taking about half of a tennis ball's worth of tissue, but couldn't tell me the location of the resulting dent without looking at the \"pictures\" which he hadn't done. This is concerning because I already had a similarly sized biopsy on that breast. I wear a size A bra, so that much tissue creates a very noticeable deficit. I also asked about risk and was told not to worry as only about 15% of these biopsies come back positive. In my mind, 15% is fairly significant--not to mention that my research here and elsewhere online leads me to believe that the doctor minimized the risk by nearly half given that the core biopsy showed atypia. The 15% rate is for patients who don't have atypia I think. My final concern was the anesthesia issue. My previous biopsy was very unpleasant as they only used a local anesthetic and it wore off partway through the procedure. I don't want a repeat of that experience, but I'll be taking that up with the anesthesiologist in a couple of days. I'm also supposed to see a MO about going back on Tamoxifen again. I took it for 5 years after my first biopsy, but that was over 15 years ago, and as I understand it, they now know that the effectiveness wears off over time. The actual procedure is scheduled for Friday, Nov. 6th--followed by the 5-7 business day wait. Because Veteran's day is smack in the middle of the following week, I can't expect results until sometime between the 16th and 18th of the week after that. All of this started on Sep. 11th when I got the callback from the screening MRI. It will be more than two months, and the waiting is making me crazy. I wish this would just be over.",

It's too soon to tell what the final cosmetic result will be. The only negative thing so far is that I had general anesthesia and reacted to the muscle relaxer they used. Apparently, sometimes it makes your muscles ache for a couple of days after the procedure. It's called Sux myalgia. I felt like I'd run a marathon--just super stiff and sore all over--but now I'm back to normal. I feel pretty relaxed about the outcome, but I'd still like to *know* sooner rather than later.",
