I think I might have lifted something too heavy ( a granddaughter) Anyway your pics are just like mine. some days are worse than others. I already wear compression stockings so I think I need a body compression suit. My grandson suggested this! I also have had too much salt lately so I wonder if this was why it showed upo all of a sudden? I do drink a lot of water. I still have blood problems, low hemoglobin mostly but I take Procrit shots and I do worry about blood clots from that. Carolyn",

I found a lump just after Christmas and thought it was the fibrocystic lumps I have had before but then this one felt different. I did not run to the doctor because the last one I did and they did not even see it on the mamogram or ultra sound. They said it was just some thick mucus membrane. I have fibromyalgia and so I figured this was making sense. My arm pit started swelling one night after I had taken care of a baby and holding and playing with him made it sore so I knew that was different. I am almost 61 years old and should know better! anyway they have done a needle biopsy and I am due for an MRI next Friday 23rd. I don't dread that but I am ready to get on with the treatment but I have not told my children yet. I am waiting until I know something from the MRI and getting graduation over too. My youngest son was getting his BS degree and one of my grandsons is graduationg from a Tech school and also High School I don't want to spoil that time for them. If I was just not doing anything about it right now i would be worried but I am doing what the doc tells me so I leave the rest in God's hands. I guess I came here just to be able to say it to someone other than my husband. My fear is the kids finding out and knowing I have not told them yet.",

If you need the meds take them, I do not believe in this driving you crazy. You will have to watch though not to take more than is prescribed. If you can keep the meds to the amount your doc reccomends then take then until you can do without them. This is my opinion some may have different thoughts on the matter. gramma23",
