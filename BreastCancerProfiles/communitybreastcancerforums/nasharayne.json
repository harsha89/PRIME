I will definitely try the stool softners sooner than later.  I think regardless of how many times you hear it you just don't really expect it until it hits you.  I just wish it didn't hit sooooooooooo hard.  Ann-Idiot - I was hoping to avoid chemo until my her2 was highly amplified but, they did tell me regardless because of my age (31) they would have recommended it anyway.  However, I do consider my Onc my partner and I must feel completely comfortable in the fact that we are working toward the same goals.  The first Onc I went to just seemed a bit off.  Which I think I may have been right because she actually called me and asked why I chose a different doctor. Sessna1 - I love your posts.  Even if you are talking to someone else I take a little bit of it for me.  Thank you. Hoping we all have well managed SEs this week!!!!!!!!!!!!",

I travel for a living and my onc said he wasn't so concerned with me catching the common cold from an airplane.  He was more concerned about bacteria from other places.  This is all after I get the nuelasta shot of course. I haven't been on a plane yet because I wasn't sure how I was going to do but, I plan on getting back to work next week with other trips planned after that.  If everything is all paid for your trip maybe you can get your white count checked before you go or he can give you a boost or something. I was planning a trip to Hawaii right before all this started, so I can understand your pain. Luv2sing - good choice with the red dress and scarf.  I debated a lace front wig because it's all the rave but, I was concerned about not being able to switch up.  Once you get it glued on how long can you keep it on? I know so many people that wear wigs just because.  It helped out because it's like they speak their own wig language that I have no clue about.

I got two liters of fluids and felt a little better. Wednesday I still feel like crap. I wake up from a nap feeling like I was baking. temp is 102.4 - opps. I slept through the 100.6. Of course my onc says go to the ER. I get there and my neutrophil count is 0. So, I guess I know why I felt so bad. Of course I am admitted to receive my 5 different kinds of antibiotics. Then the diarrhea starts. No biggie right, I'll just take some Immodium and get this done. WRONG! my onc said better out then in. Ugh. It was agony. Then, because I'm so weak I hadn't done the baking soda swish and I have like 4 sores my mouth. I plan to call my onc in the morning for what rx he can give to make them go away.  I finally came home yesterday. Still a lot of stomach cramping mild diarrhea and sores in my ears? I dont remember that SE.  Well today my period comes.  I was like you have got to be freaking kidding me. I did pray to perserve my fertility but, still I didn't expect it to still be hanging around. I guess it's still early. Hopefully next week I'll be better and can contibute. I think I want that cannabis pill too.",

This second time around has less fatigue but, the other stuff is worse. My mouth sores moved in early.  The heartburn got way out of control.  My onc told me yesterday I can take two nexium a day so, we'll see if it works.  Now I have the metal mouth.  Which I didn't get last time.  Also, this diarrhea with hemorrhoids.  Ugh, I think I would rather have fatigue.  At least I can just lay around all day. I went for my Herceptin yesterday and that was all I needed.  I was so shocked I didn't know what to do with my self.  Every time I went to the onc before I was there for no less than 4 hours for some blood test being out of whack. Now that I'm fairly healthy I can't take these regular SEs.  Okay done gripping. I didn't get a break down of my tumor or an oncotype score.  I did get a second opinion and both suggested TCH because of the tumor size and her 2 status.  The onc I chose did offer a clinical trial but, he didn't know if it the additional drug would have an added effect on sterility so, I opted out.  I would have liked to contribute to research because I am in the research biz but, it's not worth me maybe having kids one day.

I had tx #2 yesterday. Everything went ok.  I was a little worried about having a reaction to taxotere but, I was fine.  My mag was low so that added two hours on to an already long day.  My hgb was 8.7. My onc likes to transfuse under 9 but, I felt so good he decided to wait.  I go weekly for herceptin so I get a cbc every week.  They told me I will probably need a transfusion next time because they don't expect it to get better. Every time I go to the onc I always end up being there most of the day. For extra fluids, mag, potassium and who knows what else. With my 25% dose reduction I am hoping for better days ahead. I will be getting nuelasta later today  I don't think my insurance will have a problem approving it to avoid another hospital stay like last time.  About Caffeine I wasn't told to avoid caffeine but, they did tell me it doesn't count in your daily fluid count. For that reason alone I avoid it but, that's easy for me to say because I wasn't a heavy user anyway. Vangoghpro - I use Nexium for heartburn.  It's an RX and a little pricey but, it is so worth it. The only time I had a problem was when I forgot to take it.  An hour later I was back to normal. My hair is thinning but, I still have most of it.  I wear my wig because it's cute and I don't feel like doing my hair.  When I go to the onc I generally wear a scarf.  I'm a low maintenace kind of girl so I go for the path of least resistance. Crusader 1 - Loved the pic Chrisc433 I get Aloxi via IV the day of treatment then I use EMEND for day 1-3.  I generally only get nausea when I smell something really bad. (my nose has been extra sensitive) A peppermint mostly does the trick or I have Zofran for a back up. All in all nausea has been kept in check. Michele54  - I am down for a tatoo.  I don't have any but, I would love to experience it with my fellow Warrior Princesses.  Marshall2000 - My posts are too wide also, I have to scroll over to read it all.  Gina - Im so sorry you're having these reactions.  I know they will find that perfect cocktail for you.  You pick out such great ones for us!!! Thanks for being our leader. Buddy1 - When my mouth is uncomfortable I just don't drink.  Oh wait that got me in trouble with dehydration.  I have tried bomb pops.  They have all that sugat but, it feels so good.  Right now I'm on day 2 of tx 2 and I can't get enough to drink.  Soooooooooo thirsty.  I hope this passes soon for you. Hoping for us all to have a wll controlled SE week!!!!",

Also, I asked my onc how long I had to wait to try to get pregnant (praying my period will come back) and he said as soon as herceptin is done I can get started.  I have read you should wait at least a year but who really knows what we should do? After this whole ordeal I'm not going to sit around second guessing everything.  I plan to live as normal because I don't really think this is in our hands. Crusader - I take 5,000 mcg of biotin daily.  You should check out the hair, hair hair thread. They say 10,000 which I don't think is bad because your body will excrete what is not needed. I don't know what I want more my hair or my period.",

I was clearly at the reckless driving stage for this area (80 in a 55, i know i know....too fast).  I just apologized and said I was trying to get to the Dr. in charlotte and he asked what kind of appointment and I said Chemo (which was true) He just let me go and told me to slow down.  Which I did slightly.

Also, good news (I hope) I starting spotting today.  I pray this is a return of aunt flow.  I never thought I would be so happy to see that.  Good luck to all and have a great weekend!!!",

That helped a lot.   I'm doing good on day 2, I just took my EMEND and decadron this morning.  I'm not looking forward to the days without these meds.",

My mom can't come visit beause she has strep and some other leaking infection. So that just leaves me to fend for myself.  I thought I would be so wired from the decadron but, all I've been doing is sleeping off and on.....so exhausted.  sessna1 - thanks for the post.  The wig people seemed so nice when I was spending money but, when I wanted it back it was a different story.  I just went to the shop and had a minor breakdown so, they just gave me the wig with no additional money!!! The owner was still very rude throughout the process so, of course I won't be going back there for anything.",

I had my annual Mammo today and the doc says everything looks good but of course it's hard to see on the breast where I'm nursing.  Unfortunately I won't be able to get a clear one until next year when I stop.  It's such a scary situation especially being a little lumpy from nursing in general.  I just pray that everything is alright.",
