I also had a node disection surgery before chemo; 4 nodes excised and none were positive.  Rounds 1-3 were pretty easy; round 4 kicked my butt with crushing fatigue but 5 & 6 were not quite as hard. I drank coffee for the brain fog. Some side effects from the Neulasta shots but my MO let me use a long acting NSAID with the Claritin & that helped with the bone aches. White counts on the last round were ugly & I ended up w/ prophylactic antibiotics for a week and I stayed home. I was never \"sick\" or ran a fever. I had a  almost complete response with only .1mm left of an almost 7CM lump & cyst. lumpectomy 2nd week of Nov w/ a re-excision 1st week of december for better margins for some DCIS they found during the 1st lumpectomy. Now in the 2nd week of IMRT radiation. I was able to maintain my weight & lose 6 lbs during my chemo w/ the MOs blessing. I started an exercise plan Nov 1 & have been able to continue it except for surgery days. I tried to walk every day during chemo but it was hard. Most days I just had to rest. I worked 32 hrs a week until chemo 3 and had to go out on disability. Working on call now. My surgeries were EASY compared to chemo but again, I was exercising & eating again & felt SO much better. Being stronger is also making the radiation go easier, at least so far since I am only on week 2 of 6.5 weeks (28 IMRT w/ 5 boosts. 33 total) Its a personal choice but I'd do it the same again even knowing what I know now. You will bounce right back after the last chemo. 6 weeks later you will start seeing hair again!",

The port was actually more uncomfortable than the node biopsy!  Chemo day was a good day. Neulasta shot on the 6th. The 7th & 8th...fatigue and brain fog from hell but a little coffee helped. By Monday up to running @ full speed again.  No nausea @ all for me & my hair, which is cut short is all still firmly attached. I finish shaving my head & pick up my wigs on the 12th. 10 days From chemo all blood values are normal. I think I had more aches from the Neulasta than from the chemo; and on the pain scale was maybe a 4? I can have Tylenol or Lortabs but no NSAIDS. Mild GI symptoms for maybe 3 days? but not troublesome. I am on a 3 week 6 dose cycle then lumpectomy & whatever else is reccomended at that point. I am not sure of my staging; will get my \"measurements\" at my next chemo/Dr. appointment. Diagnosed May 31, 2011 IDC Stage IIb Tumor grade 3 ER17% PR- HER/NEU- Tumor size7cm N 0/4",

I started exercise with strength training Nov 1. Some sharp pains but never w/ exercise. I am lifting maybe 15 lbs using only 1 arm @ a time. My node dissection never bothered me; the port hurt worse! Only a little tan from the rads and that is fading fast.Like you, my surgery was on the left side. My lower ribs can ache a bit & under my left shoulder blade. Did you get a handout on exercises to do after surgery? If not i'll try to find the link others have posted on post mastectomy range of motion exercises. For me, they have helped quite a bit. I've seen the MO this week and am waiting for the arimidex presciption to arrive. I will also be taking a statin with it because I haven't been able to get my cholesterol in hand with a pretty restricted diet and plenty of exercise. I see the RO in 2 weeks & expect to be released from her care @ that time. No mammo or MRI until Sept. The MO is every 3 months for the next 2 years. Then every 6 months for 3 years. Te only thing that really bugs me is the partial numbness in my hands & feet. Its better than it was 6 months ago but it still bothers me not to be able to open a jar or that I have to hold on to the treadmill when i walk.",

I had a good 6 weeks of not being messed with and being able to be normal & the every day to the rads center really puts me off. It's easier to say everything is ok than be honest about how you really feel!
