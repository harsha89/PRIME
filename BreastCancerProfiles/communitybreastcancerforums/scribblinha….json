Surgeon is calling it Radiation Recall. Since the biopsy it has gotten worse and now itches.  I see oncology on Wed. And he needs to give me something to clear it up because I am on vacation starting this weekend and the last thing I want is a itchy rash while on the beach.",

The one thing I feel lucky about is that I am not having any major bone pain with the Nulasta, just some minor aching.  I take Claritin the day of chemo, shot day and then for 2 days after.   I am seriously funned out and don't want to play anymore.  I keep telling myself that next year this time I will look back and be proud of myself.  I have to just get there.  ",

I had really bad anxiety at night.  It was like my brain wouldn't shut off so Doc prescribed me Xanax.  First time in over 10 years I slept all night. This forum is a great source of information and I am constantly on it and grateful to see that I'm not alone in this journey. (((hugs)))",
