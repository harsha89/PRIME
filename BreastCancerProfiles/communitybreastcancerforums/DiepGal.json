I know several plastic surgeons across the United States and some in other countries because of the nature of my work. There are many fine ones and we can only share our own personal success stories. I went to PRMA and had a very successful delayed DIEP flap surgery after a second breast cancer diagnosis. As far as checking insurance the best course of action is to contact their patient liaison named, Brittany, at their office. She walks patients through the process and can answer many of your questions. I hope this helps and I wish you all the best. Asking questions is certainly what you need to do in this process to put your mind at ease. Happy to answer more questions if you have them.",
