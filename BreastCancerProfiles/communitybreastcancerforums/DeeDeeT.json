CHB87-So sorry you are uncomfortable! I think extreme temperature changes aren't good for radiated skin. Now, I'm not the expert on skin care here, because I'm having all kinds of problems, but I do think I've read to stay away from heat and cold. I have really wanted something cool too! It sounds like it would feel wonderful! So, I've been using miaderm, aquaphore, and now have added in cortisone (per doctor's instructions). I have nine more sessions (out of twenty). Guess what? I have turned from pink, to itchy, to red, to now peeling and I think my skin may be starting to crack. I'm doing everything I'm supposed to do, but my skin is just not happy. Wahhhh. Well, I'm off to slather on more aquaphore. I just keep telling myself that it's almost over. We can do this to keep the cancer away, right?",

I had been treating myself to a good coffee every Friday after treatment, but this Friday, I may need to change it up. Hmmmmmm.",

I hate it that you are going through this and hope you heal quickly. Aquaphor has helped me the most, but I can't use the antibiotic creams because of allergies, so they may be better. My husband was reminding me last night about my initial consult. They told me I may react like a \"mild sunburn.\" He said, \"they should have told you that you may look like you fell into a campfire! \" At this point, we both just had to laugh. It was that or cry. But the doctors did not prepare me for this.",

As of Friday,I have reached the halfway point! I am doing, um, okay. I'm very, very tired. I am also pink and rashy. I started itching a lot. My doctor asked me to add in cortisone cream before I use miaderm. She said it was \"unusual\" that I'm reacting as much as I am and she wants me to use it 4xs a day to see if it helps. She had seemed distracted when I met with her before, but this time, when I had an issue, she did give me her full attention. I felt better about her after that.

I hate to share negative news, because I'm still thankful for radiation treatment. I wanted to give this cancer everything I could. I'm youngish (44) and do not want to have a recurrence. That being said, I am going to share what is happening to me, but please feel free to skip this if you don't want to hear anything negative. Because again, even with this, I would still choose radiation. I am still blistering. Even more than I was at the beginning of the week. It hurts. A lot. I am also peeling. It's not like a sunburn peel. It is bright red and deep. It's painful, kind of like a rug-burn. It is like the skin is being ripped off, not like it is just peeling off after a sunburn. Sorry for the graphic description, but I just wasn't prepared for this. It did not start off this way, but it is getting progressively worse, not better. The outer areas ARE starting to heal. But, the area with the blisters is still quite bad and the area that's peeling is also very bad. I did call my doctor and was told to use aquaphore. I am allergic to most antibiotic creams, so there aren't many options. I was told I could expect this to be bad for two weeks before healing. I didn't realize how painful this was going to be. I am migraine prone, so the pain from this is triggering severe migraines. This includes nausea. It's been rough. My encouragement in this is that it is temporary. It should get better soon. I am so impressed by the ladies here who are working through this! You are amazing!! I hope everyone else has a MUCH better experience!!",

I have disappointed in myself that I just physically have had a rough time with this. My skin has not tolerated this well.

She told me to start taking Tylenol and ibuprofen, alternating them every three hours. I should also keep moisturizing. She predicted things may get even worse over the next week and half or so, but should improve dramatically after that. She thinks my extra pain with nausea is related to my migraines and said that the radiation therapy does have muscle involvement, so the deeper muscle pain, as well as the obvious skin pain is triggering everything for me. She also told me that our center has a 24/7 hotline I can call if I have more issues in the future. I'm feeling a lot better about everything today. Carebearzzz-- yikes about the new lump!! Every new find now is so scary. I'm sorry! About celebrating on Friday, I haven't really thought of anything too exciting. Funny how now just being finished is making me really happy! Before, I wanted to do something really special and now just being done is it's own reward. :) HPFULL-- Retrain your brain to not mind pain? Ugh. No wonder you cried. (((GentleHugs!))) Salamandra--I'm sorry about the tattoo situation. You would think they would have given you an option, since our treatments aren't for very long. I think you have some good ideas for dealing with them, though. Maybe they will fade over time? You are right, though that radiation can be rough on some of us and should be taken seriously.

I am SO HAPPY to have them off! I spent the whole time nervous that I was going to accidentally wash or rub one off. You also can't moisturize over them, so it's difficult every. single. time. you. apply. anything. So, stickers aren't without their own set of problems.
