    "Content": "Rosekittyhawk wrote: My last previous mammogram before finding this lump after Christmas was April '08.  Before sending my films off to Duke for my upcoming appointment I looked at all of them going back 13 years.  The recent finding which is very obvious on the 1/12/09 mammogram was definately not on the April mammogram.  Can a tumor grow that fast?  The sonogram shows a dense area as well so they don't think it's a cyst.  Anyone else have a similar finding?
