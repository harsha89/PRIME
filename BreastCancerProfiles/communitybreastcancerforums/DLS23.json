Being hormone receptor positive makes me a good candidate for hormone therapy however just wondering if/ when that stops working, will I need to do chemo anyway. Does it make sense to do chemo now while I am still young?",

At first it looked to be stage 2B, however after my PET, confirmed 3C and high suspicious stage 4 as there are specs in my bones. I've been to 2 of the best cancer hospitals in NYC- one says they cannot biopsy the region as it's too hard to reach and too risky so they want to assume stage 3C and do the curative approach which is chemo and the second says they need to biopsy it to determine staging in order to chose treatment. If confirmed stage 4 they want me to go w hormone therapy. I understand that stage 4 is not curable however I feel like hormone therapy will only work for a certain number of years. I of course don't want the toxicity of chemo however I am afraid I'll need it in the future anyway if I chose hormone now. If anyone has been in this situation or know of anyone, I would be very interested in speaking to them or knowing what treatment they chose and why. It a confusing decision but one that I need to make very soon. Log in to post a reply",

I feel like I'll need it regardless so why not when I'm young and not competing w other issues . Maybe future radiation can kill the mets. Maybe a new drug will come out soon! I'm hopeful! Good luck to everyone !",

I am hoping chemo can kill this and then possibly radiation, then hormne therapy?  But I am concerned about the toxicity, especially when the textbook answer is hormone therapy b/c there is no cure. ",
