      "Content": "Sep 15, 2010 12:00AM - edited Sep 15, 2010 12:08AM by odinsmom Sorry I have been missing in action since my July 30th LMX.  Between the computer being down for a couple of weeks and a nasty bladder infection post OR I just have now been in the mood to write.  The path report showed 2 invasive carcinomas with ductal and lobular traits, an area of DCIS, multiple papilomas and hyperplasia and metaplasia in the breast. 0/7 lymphnodes! Yea! I only had one drain but the drain was removed at 5 weeks even though it was still having a lot of drainage.  Drainage began to build up the next two days and my incision which had an area of infection opened and drainage leaked out. The original incision site was glued closed. I went back to Or where opened the entire incision and irrigated the entire area and inserted another drain in a slightly different site.  They also trimmed some of the skin that was infected and sutured me closed.  A week later the drain suddenly stopped.  IMy BS removed the second drain and aspirated fluid.Fluid built up again and had it drained again. I am headed to my BS tomorrow because of more fluid build up. BS will decide if another OR is needed to correct the fluid build up.  Has anyone had this kind of trouble with drainage?  I feel like I am doing well but each OR also feels like a set back.   Carol",
