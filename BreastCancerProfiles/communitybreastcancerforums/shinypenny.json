At least from reading all your posts I got an idea what i am in for. Thanks and hugs to all of you for your information on your treatments. I go 3 weeks on and one week off and next week i am going on a pain study with fenytol ( I think thats what its called) you use it for break through pain. and take it like a nasal spray. It is suppose to work within minutes. Cristl i have dry patches on my forehead and face which started about one month ago I am wondering if that is because I have  tumor in my liver now? I didn't start any new meds, what else could it be? also thanks Kerri for your day by day feelings that helped alot Thanks again sisters Much Love LYnn",
