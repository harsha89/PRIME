    "Content": "JessEmf wrote: hey everyone, I'm new to this site, and posting in forums in general. For the past month and a half my right nipple has been peeling, itchy, lighter in colorand dry. (I don't tan, haven't changed any soaps, no known allergies) At first I ignored it about a week, then I put Vaseline on it, then tried lotion, nothing worked, just made it burn some. Every few days the skin flakes off. My whole nipple she'd like I'm a snake or something. About a week or two later I was having a pain in the same breast on the left side, that lasted a few days and stopped, but the peeling continued. For the past few weeks itching has started. I called and made an appointment with a nurse practitioner at the gyno office. She said since it wasn't red she didn't think it was fungal or anything and just told me to buy cortisone 10 and use that for two weeks and see. It's been a few days and so far that hasn't helped at all. I took a bath tonight and all of the skin on my right nipple peeled off again. I'm only 20 and I know pagets is really rare, I just thought it was strange that it's only on one nipple. Just wondering what y'all think! Thanks Log in to post a reply",
