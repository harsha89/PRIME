I got very sick for the first 12hour both times.  The first week is really hard and the metallic taste sticks around for a while. Just try to drink what you can and rinse with baking soda and salt water twice a day. My nausea meds just don't seem to work and the onc will need to try something else next time.  Hang in there.  It should get a little bit better each day.  My hair started to come out on day 14 so be prepared. Good luck Tracy",

It feels like l've got a cord running from my shoulder to my thumb.  I was really sick all weekend and everything I eat tastes like Chalk.  I really hope you don't get any of this, but it's nice to have a heads-up.  I love food and it's hard to eat when you can't taste.  My white count is very low again and I'm getting an eye infection.  It's hard, but I'm just telling myself \"only one more to go\".  Hang in there and good luck with #2. chiluvr1228 Everyone is different, but many of us want to know what could happen to prepare for the worst and be happy if we're spared.",
