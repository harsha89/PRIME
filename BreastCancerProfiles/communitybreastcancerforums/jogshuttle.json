    "Content": "Apr 6, 2011 03:38AM - edited Apr 6, 2011 03:57AM by jogshuttle I had to skip my second DD Taxol today cos my liver enzyme levels were higher that the acceptable range. and my doctor is very concerned as my liver was pristine throughout DD AC. He had given me some medication (Ursofalk and Jetepar) to help lower the enzyme levels, after which I will retake a blood test on Sat. If nothing improves, he wants me to switch to weekly Taxol. Why did your doctor choose to reduce the dosage instead of switching to weekly? And did he say apart from the L-Glutamine or Taxol, what could cause the liver enzymes to spike?
