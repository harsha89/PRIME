      "Content": "TexasMelody wrote: So, here is my story: In Dec 07 I found a hard little bump. It is about pea sized but hard. Right boobie, between 3-4 oclock about 1\" from my nipple. Went for annual mammo. Had sonogram. It showed an \"ovoid 9mm, well circumscribed, hypoechoic structure with a central echogenic area. This most resembles a lymph node.\" This did not show up on the mammo. The radiologist spoke with me before I left and said I could have a biopsy or wait for 2 mos and then come back for another sono.  My Gyn sent me to the surgeon. I saw him today and he told me that my options are needle biopsy, core biopsy or surgical biopsy. I opted for the surgical biopsy. He wanted to do it next Friday. The surgeon said that it does resemble a lymph node based on the shape but the question is (1) why is it hard, (2) not show up on previous mammo & sono or CBE. And, he and the Radiologist both said it is an unusual place for a lymph node. My surgeon indicated that lymph nodes can either be reactive (meaning they are reacting to something in the body like infection) or neoplasm (meaning new growth like a cancer). His scheduler just called and I am going in next Friday to have the wire and dye put in and then the surgery a few hours after that. Ugh. I just buried my Mother who was diagnosed with cancer last April. It was in her bones. It was a miserable year for her and she died a very young 70yo. I am finding it rather difficult to be upbeat about this because all the memories of my Mother's ordeal keep creeping in. I have had a previous surgical biopsy on a lump they found on my first mammo at age 33 when I was being prescreened for a hysterectomy due to cervical cancer. That biopsy was b9. Since then I have had quite a number of lumps & bumps that have had me getting regular sono's with my mammos. So, that is my story. But reading all of your stories I realize how lucky I am that this is going pretty quickly. Waiting a few weeks would just be miserable. Thank you all for listening. And thank you for such a wonderfully supportive board. I have lurked for several years off and on and follow your stories with prayers for each of you. Melody Melody Log in to post a reply",

I'm not that good with all the abreviations (and there seem to be a lot of them). Did they do all 3 wires on 3 different areas or all coming at a different direction to one area? I am going to spend the weekend painting our upstairs hallway and one of the bedrooms. We run a business out of our home and are having to expand into another bedroom. Now, the business has taken up the entire upstairs. I want to paint the walls before setting it all up. And, I really like freshly painted walls. They feel and look fresh and sparkling clean. Yeah! Yes, the xanax is a good idea. I still have some from dealing with my Mother and Father. It was a very tough year and especially the past couple of months. But, I was proud that I was able to deliver my precious Mother's eulogy. It was, without a doubt, the toughest thing I've done so far in my life. It's funny about the xanax. The little monkeys in your mind can get all worked up and if they are left untethered, can rage out of control with all sorts of wild and imaginative scenarios that will have you in a state of hysteria. They do seem to take little naps given the xanax incentive to hush. Whew.",

I got a copy of the path report before I left. All looks great .... until I read these words: \"Rare periductal chronic inflammatory cells consisting of lymphocytes are identified. Some of the ducts are cystically dialted and the lumen show proteinaceous material. Focal periductal fibrosis is also identified.\" Of course I didn't read this until I got home and the Dr is in surgery this afternoon. I did some google's on the words but just don't get it.  Any insight? Melody Melody Log in to post a reply",

I have been through quite a number of surgeries but this one has me real spooked. I read all of your stories and know that no matter the outcome I will get through it.
