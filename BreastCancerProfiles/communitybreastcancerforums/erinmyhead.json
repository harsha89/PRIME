Currently in my first infusion right now via IV-going very well: 7-9 hours initial neoadjuvent THCP chemo. Getting port on 2/10 with 2nd of 6 infusions set for 2/14. Not sure if I should be in January or February start group, so reaching out to both (more friends with great insight, I figure--hopefully you amazing Mods will set me straight). I found my nugget the end of August 2016, and when asked for the afternoon off for mammo, was fired (\"Everybody loves you, you do great work, but we are a small litigation firm that can't tolerate the potential accommodations that can come from this.\" Then the female partner added, \"and Im well aware of the emotional problems that can come from this and its not fair to the firm.\" Then seeing my mortified face laying on the floor quickly added, \"its not fair to you either.\" On they went \"We're giving you two weeks severance and wish you nothing but the best.\" Wow). No, its not legal, but it happens. A lot more than you think. Colorado unemployment nightmare (won), coupled with Cobra, Medicaid and two separate grant nightmares. Guess what? I got the job of my dreams, started 12/5--immediate benes, great insurance, incredible support, and am on my journey in a much better place! Hindsight is not only 20/20, but it was meant to happen this way, for me. That higher power, the one I was screaming profanities not so long ago, made the clouds part? I like to think so. It, and the great advice of experts and community posts on this site, got me to this great place today. I'm developing a healthy cancer comedy routine (my fabulous support system not finding it funny, just yet). But, wanted to (finally) take part in this community, offer what I can, and thank each and every one of you for being here, sharing support, and giving loving information like no others can. This is by far the best site this professional researcher has found. Hope to be part of that now. Any questions? Throw them my way--I will try to be short--not so much fluff like this first post. Just a little emotionally charged today (in a good way). Hang in there all--this TOO shall pass. \"Pray to God, but row for shore!\" Old Amish proverb so appropriate here. Big hugs all around! Take care!!",
