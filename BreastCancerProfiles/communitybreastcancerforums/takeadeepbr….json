      "Content": "Jun 7, 2011 10:57AM - edited Jun 12, 2011 06:43AM by takeadeepbreath Hello gals....I had a prophy BMX (nipple sparing) this past December. I used Dr. Swistel from Cornell-Weill as my BS (he had done 3 prior surgical biopsies on me...I was seeing him a bit too regularly for my comfort!). He agreed to work with Dr. Sultan (Chief of PS) at Roosevelt. Dr. Sultan did my exchange 7 weeks ago, exactly 4 months after first surgery. There are no words to express how grateful I am to have had them as my surgeons.  They both have \"cure\" as the number 1 priority but feel very strongly about getting the very best aesthetic outcome possible. I went from a small (and kind of lopsided) A cup to a solid B that looks very natural on my 5\"1\" frame. While things are still settling in and there are some areas I am hoping will fill out a bit, I look better than when I started out. The incision is in the fold, and I don't think anyone would know I had a BMX.  While uncomfortable the first week after BMX, I had virtually no pain (some soreness and discomfort but nothing advil couldn't alleviate). After the first week, I stopped taking the vicodin and valium. I was back at work full time in 3 weeks. Sleeping with the TEs was a drag throughout the process, but again--uncomfortable, not painful. The fills were in small increments (30 cc's a week) and I think that probably helped. Both docs have truly wonderful office staff as well, which I know realize, is definitely a part of the experience. Ilene",

Prophy NSM (with TEs) last tues afternoon. Home from hospital on thursday. BS called late Sunday night (Sunday!--just one more reason I love him forever,--he actuallyapologized for calling on a Sunday! Pretty sure the man never sleeps.)...path report came in...side that had the 3 prior lumpectomies/LCIS had more of the same (actually, a lot more than he actually expected-- he said there was a fairly extensive amount). No LCIS on left side but said there was abnormal activity that definitely did not look right, but was not cancer. (Might have been the activity that lit up on last MRI?) He said this MX was undoubtedly the best decision I could have made for myself--I would have been facing constant suspicious findings and untold number of surgeries. Used a hand shower that attached to tub to rinse off yesterday and wash hair and made my way uptown to PS to have the 2 drains removed--what a relief--those were really horrible and not for the faint of heart (aka: me). BTW--I lived for a week in hoodies that had those inside pockets (Columbia had them and a company called Alternative made super soft ones)--they were perfect size for drains. Took a valium before having drains out (pretty sure it did nothing-should have had vodka!)--really strange sensation--painful but literally took less than 10 seconds on each side, so in the scheme of what we have gone thru, not major. As far as constipation---thanks to erythrymyacin I had completely the opposite problem as everyone! The antibiotic turned my stomach inside out. All seems to be healing well--one nipple is pretty red and PS anticipates blistering but said not to worry, just apply bacitracin and keep it covered. Still VERY sore and tight--I have real stitches not steri-strips (I get rashes from the adhesive)--these come out thursday. I was filled to about the same A cup size I started out as. The boobs are still looking a bit banged up, but I think pretty incredible for just one week out.  In 3 weeks PS starts fills to get me to the \"boob goal\" of a full B. Right now, aside from the vice-like tightness, my biggest problem is a hacking cough that... well...you can imagine how awesome that feels. Will take next set of pics after stitches come out and try and figure out how to get them all posted. I'm in NYC and I used Dr. Swistel (BS from Cornell Weill Hospital) and Mark Sultan (PS from Roosevelt Hospital)--they have worked together before and agreed to operate on me together out of Roosevelt. There are no words that express how I feel about these two guys. One of the sweetest parts of this story--I had my lucky button charm on a chain from my grandmother's sweater ( I am beyond superstitious when it comes to certain things, particularly this 50 year old button!)--I asked if it could be wrapped in plastic and brought into surgery--the PS looked at me and just said, \"how about if I wear it for you while I operate?\" and he put it around his neck and off we went. These two docs are talented, compassionate and have been so supportive. Will post this on NSM thread as well as I know sometimes folks are looking for dr suggestions/experiences.  Sending much love and good wishes to all... Ilene ",

NSM Surgery was tuesday---I got to hospital at 11, they didn't take me until 2.30...I was a ball of stress by then. got out of recovery at 8.30pm and almost strangled a private nurse who was insisting i get up and go the bathroom.I got up but to prove my point threw up about 5 times! Weds in hospital was fine but somehow they forgot to give me pain meds weds overnight so thursday was not a good day, lots of pain, lots of vomiting. Today seems like I am off to a better start--still feel like i am in a vice. Taking vicodan for pain, valium to ease the muscle spasms and an antibiotic. Have 2 drains in which I hate (it grosses me out that you see them under the skin, and they itch and are uncomfortable), There is almost nothing draining into them and doc said he plans on removing them monday afternoon, so not too bad. Still praying for good path results next week and so glad to be on this side. Even at this early stage in the process, I am so, so glad to have done this.The nipples look ok color-wise, though overall I think my boobs look like purple pancakes (I am not worried--doc said they look great so I am going with that).  I have started taking pics to post as I know how helpful the pic forum was to me. Signing off for now as typing makes me a bit weasy.... Ilene ",

I have LCIS, 3 surgical biopsies in past 4 years and just can't keep doing the 6 month \"watch and see\". Feel fortunate this relatively new procedure is out there (have you been on NSM thread yet? Really helpful). Crazy as this sounds, I am more anxious about anesthesia/5 hour surgery and the fear of them finding something the mammos/mri/ultrasounds may have missed than I am about removal of breast tissue/reconstruction process. Also hoping LCIS is not near nipple as that seems to indicate the nipple would have to go. For the past week, I have been treating this like as more of fashion crisis instead of a health crisis (can anyone say D-E-N-I-A-L!?) and spent Black Friday buying an absurd number of soft zip up sweatshirts (and clogs as I assume I won't be able to pull on tight winter boots or bend to tie sneakers!). There's a benefit to Holiday surgery I guess!  Trying to maintain my humor and my nipples. Ilene",

Went back and read through the November board to try and see where we all might be in a months time. Was good to see some of the anxiety I have had about not waking up from surgery or them finding hidden cancer that evaded detection is not all that unique.
