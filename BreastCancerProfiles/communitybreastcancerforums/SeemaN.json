The first time she had it,mom had painful mouthsores and the 2nd injection had to be delayed. The 2nd went okay. From 3rd onwards she is experiencing uneasiness and pain in her stomach for which she has to take a painkiller everyday.Is this normal? When we went to the doc, he said it could be constipation or flatulence, but her motions are regular. I am worried and miserable to see her so down. Can you please share or help suggest about it? Also, today ( 3 days post her 5th injection),she again complained of the bonepain which she experienced around her foot. The kinds which she is able to relate to the disease. So does that mean , Navelbine is not working on her?? Please help!
