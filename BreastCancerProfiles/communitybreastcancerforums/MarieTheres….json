I am guessing that my hospital is very conservative and afraid of being sued later so they do not do that kind of testing in a biopsy. I even asked my doctor flat out if anything was being kept from me and was told no. It was even explained that it was illegal to hide or keep any information from me. All of the hormone receptor tests will not be ready until probably the end of September at this point. I meet with the surgeon in the beginning of September. Surgery hopefully the following week and then 5-10 business days after that. It makes me think of that mister Rogers song\" let's think of something to do while we are waiting\" if you don't know it, look it up on Online. It has become my personal anthem MT",

I guess it can only be determined after lumpectomy? I am seeing some comments here and there that mention how much and how often the original diagnosis changed from the start. Just having a moment of panic that maybe I have something far more serious than I thought. Any thoughts on this? MT",
