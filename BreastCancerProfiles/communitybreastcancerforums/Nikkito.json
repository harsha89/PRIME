I will be so happy to get the biopsy done and behind me as you all know the waiting is difficult *sigh*, but I appreciate you all waiting with me. I got the call from the hospital yesterday, the booking lady said she was booking me in as soon as she could, next Wednesday. I didn't register it at the time, but she said it's because \"we only do one of these per day\". After I got off the phone I thought how odd, it's a cancer centre how do they only do one biopsy per day. Hopefully it's not a lobotomy they've booked me in for lol. Sorry a bit of dark humor!.Then had the thought, do they mean an excisional biopsy. But think they would have told me if that were the case. My understanding is it's a core biopsy. She suggested I have them contact me with cancellations. I tried calling today but just got voicemail, so I  will try again tomorrow. Holeinone, thankfully my experiences with the onc and radiologist/techs and other staff have been quite positive so far. Nope never got a birad score, not sure if they have the same here (canada) on my original u/s just gave all the descriptive stuff and their recommendations. I haven't gotten the results yet from my u/s and mammo from the bc done on Saturday. I was supposed to meet with the onc this Tuesday, but cancelled and rescheduled so that I could go in to see her after all of the results including the biopsy had come in. And you're right one step at a time in terms of what to worry myself with. Do you mind my asking how they recognized and discovered your lobular cancer? Hope your week is good! Thanks for that reminder infobabe! I will be sure to ask for copies of the pathology reports as well as the u/s and mammo reports.  Thanks mjm1 for all of this info, I think I need to write out a list of questions to ask the doctor. Including getting more info on the different types of lumps. That's amazing that they removed those masses without there being a noticeable difference for you! Hope your mum is having a good week. Goodnight all. x",

So I have a lot of cysts, but there is the one that they are concerned about that I'll be having the biopsy on this week. Solid, 3.3 cm. Apparently there are calcifications as well. So the radiologist did the scan and then had the doctor come in and do it. From there I went to have a topographic mammogram, they took a bunch of pics of that one mass. So I'm just waiting to hear tomorrow when my appointment will be to have the biopsy. They couldn't do it yesterday because that department isn't open on the weekend. Good news was that my lymph looked ok on this scan.  Ddkath hope you are making out ok this weekend - know that you had a lot to get done, thinking of you. NSwrites, I'm sorry that you are going through this experience. I would trust your feelings and ask for further clarification on what the radiologist felt he was seeing and a biopsy. When do you get the report of that?. I haven't read all of your posts so forgive me, do you have a doctor that you trust?Can you be referred to a breast centre? I also know how difficult it is when you have young children and also have this to deal with. Hugs to you both",

Now because I have this mass and other cysts I will be monitored by the BC - In future how will I know what to be concerned about and what not to? A number of these lumps are palpable, how will I know when there is a real difference in current lumps or new lumps? Lumps lumps and more lumps. Frustrating! Even when doing an u/s it gets very confusing which lump is which! And at what size should I consider having them removed? (Lump being biopsied is 3.3 cm) The thing is I have small breasts and if they were to start removing these I wouldn't have much left!. This has been quite stressful and I imagine it will continue to be somewhat stressful knowing that I have a lot going on in there. The main thing of course is that I just want to ensure that none of these have cancer. Just wondering if anyone could offer input, as how to best deal with very lumpy small breasts?

It's hopeful to hear and remembering, as you've said that there is another side and even if I have to travel this path, that I can get there too. So thank you for taking the time to share, it' appreciated. Holeinone, thank you. Yes you are absolutely right in how overwhelming it all is, when you say you felt as though your legs weren't working, I get it. Are you doing radiation? Great mantra btw. Jeslyn, I so appreciate you taking the time to sign up and respond. First I'm sorry that you have to deal with all of this, especially while being a mom to your children and going about life. But I smiled while reading because I can feel your strength and gutspa and love for your kids! I appreciate your humour too. If you don't mind my asking, in your case why did they choose chemo first and then surgery?  Campkid195, absolutely. I just read your other post and I can appreciate the fear of finding these lumps. One step at a time and deep breaths. First step is seeing your doctor and then having and ultrasound. Don't be nervous in telling your doctor, she'll want to know so that it can get checked. Hopefully she can get you an ultrasound quickly to cut down on the wait and worry for you. I believe that they will be doing the biopsy on Tuesday, fortunately they have rapid diagnostics there, so I should be able to get the results pretty quickly. My initial impression was that I would be going to the clinic having an exam done by the np and then I would have the biopsy/ and any other tests and then I would have an appointment a day or two after to get my results from the doctor. Now this has changed a bit to seeing the onc first and then going from there. So the waiting is just nerve wracking. In reality it's only a few more days, but it feels as though it's stretching on forever. I'm trying to keep calm, especially for my sons sake but my emotions are so fluid and fluctuating. I am very thankful for this site because it has given me information and all of you ladies have been wonderful and supportive. This was actually my first experience of posting in a forum. I struggle sometimes with sharing and asking for help, but it truly does help.This has shown me in a very powerful way the ways in which I've sometimes neglected to take of myself. An ultrasound was ordered last year for the same breast and I didn't go. I just kept putting it off, until I felt that I had put it off beyond being able to go in for it. I guess I've carried a few misconceptions, you practically need a magnify glass to find my boobs(not really but they're not gonna knock you over or anything lol) so that was the first, that if I had larger breasts then it would be more of a concern. Anyway throughout the year it kept nagging me that I hadn't gone and then came this years physical and here we are. The hospital that I'm going to is one of the best and I'm thankful. Just scared. There have even been moments where I feel a sort of primal scream rising.  But hearing from you is helping me keep it together.And my heart really goes out for all that you've each individually dealt with but along this road and with that a \"Wow\"these women are incredibly strong! Thank you ",

Beautiful to read through your story and learn that you are NED. That's wonderful! Holeinone- yep, one more day. Looking forward to having the wait behind me. Hate not knowing what to expect.

Your body tells you And it's not really optional. And yes the waiting... For appointments, treatments etc. I'm glad to hear that you are assigned a \" Nurse Navigator\" there seems to be so much information that you are suddenly inundated with and I can imagine when I am in the thick of the emotions that it could be hard for me to keep track of it all! Forgive my ignorance, but what's chording? Thanks so much for sharing... Momto3boysaz: I'm glad to hear your surgery went well!...and that you are on to the road of recovery from that. Do you know yet when you are starting radiation? It sounds like you've had a great deal of strength in a short period of time and also like you have a great attitude, that it's a bump in the road that you will move beyond and then get back to your \"boring life\" as you've said. : )  Ddkath70: I'm glad to hear that you've been able to get an appointment set for next week. Good for you for taking the bull by the horns! I'm sorry that you are still waiting....but I think you said they told you latest Monday right, so by then you should have much more information I hope. *hugs*  In my head I'm having a bit of a hard time not beating myself up a little, I feel stupid and foolish for not having followed through with the ultrasound last year and for having not mentioning things to my doctor that I probably should have. All of a sudden it's like this neon spotlight has been turned on my body and I aware in a way that I have never been before. \" Just venting some feelings\" It's quite possible that this is totally different and unrelated to any of this stuff going on, but has anyone here ever had lower rib tenderness??. This is something that I've had for a while now. I don't know if what the radiologist may have seen with my abdominal ultrasound could account for this? I guess I'll know know more Tuesday.",

I'm thirty four and during my physical last year (and I think the year before that :( ) my doctor ordered an ultrasound because she felt some lumpiness in one breast in particular. I just immediately thought it's a cyst and put off getting the ultrasound. My breasts are small but dense.So a few days ago I went for my physical again and again she said she had some concern about my right breast. She also ordered an ultrasound on my abdomen and found a small lump on my cervix. So yesterday I went for my ultrasounds and wasn't expecting anything out of the ordinary. But it became clear that there were some issues. One 2cm spot was found and one 3cm spot. There also seemed to be an issue with my abdominal ultrasound, though I don't know yet what that is. I think what scared me in particular was that when she was doing the measurements and looking at one of the spots, I looked and saw the colour doppler light up most of it, which concerned me.At this point I am waiting. The technician also made some comments that concerned me. The waiting is hard! ahhhh. I am fine and then I'll have a moment where my anxiety peaks and of course the question \"What if\" ? And it's scary.... So that's where I'm at... Thank you for reading and I wish you all a good day!",

I'm sure all will go well on Wednesday. I decided to make the switch to princess margaret, which felt like the right choice for me. My CD and report went over on Friday and now I'm just waiting to hear from them. When I talked to them last week the lady was wonderful and assured me that she would have me in soon. They have a rapid diagnostic centre which means that everything happens much faster, instead of waiting for a longer period for a full diagnosis/plan. Also relieved to know that they can biopsy the lymph in the same way they do breast. momto3boysaz: I'm glad to hear all is going well since your surgery. Good news that all came out well after one surgery. It does appear to make such a difference to have a \"team\" approach and everything needed in one place. Can't imagine what it would be like otherwise! Good luck for your appointment Monday. Hope everyone is having a nice weekend ",

It sounds as though you have really thought over the node issue and have come to a decision and one that you feel most comfortable with. These are not easy decisions by any means, But you are making them and doing it and in the process showing your strength. You will get through this.!!

People are strange sometimes. Give energy to those who you can really rely on and forget the others. Your true friends will support you. Looking forward to hearing how your doing x",
