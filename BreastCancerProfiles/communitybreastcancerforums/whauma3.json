I got that news on Wednesday and initially I felt optimistic because I wasn't a 6. Now I'm terrified.  My lump is less than 2cm as per mammo and ultrasound and the biopsy report said it is mostly benign but small focal of a few atypical glands, and they gave me a 5. I've been reading all kinds of post and praying for so many very brave women. I want to be brave like that but I'm terrified and and don't want to face what i know lies ahead. Lumpectomy, more cancer, mastectomy, pain, radiation, chemo, misery???? My husband and i missing work w/o pay .... the list goes on and on. I've always been able to pray my way through every difficult situation but that peace and assurance seem to elude me most of the time.  I'm in the process of switching all my diognostics to the Mayo here in Jacksonville, FL and have to do some extra stuff for my insurance coverage. If all is in place I'll see a cancer specialist at mayo on Thursday, then after they look at all the data they have on me  and concur, they'll set me up with their surgeon. So I'm just waiting and worrying! Payers of comfort and strength for you Margie",

I've always shied away from needing anyone, except family, so already I've grown! Here I am opening my heart to strangers! It's one thing to read all the clinical information available online, it kinda fills my head with all kinds of thoughts that may or may not pertain to me. But reading the real live words from the lives of real live people going through this is the information that hits home the most. I'm not alone and I can't thank all of you enough for sharing because it's with you that I think I'm going to get the most strength. I kept telling myself, God isn't going to let me go through this alone or let me be so terrified----so here i am and we'll see what happens My goal for now is try to keep my mind open to all the positives and I wont be afraid to laugh! I'll have to check out your blogspot, it has a catchy address.  Thank you for caring, you're in my prayers Margie ",

I'm still new to this myself  (the waiting to see what happens after the biopsy and before the surgery stage).  It's been the interaction with some very wonderful ladies that has allowed me to move from one day to the next with a somewhat normal pretense. You will be well cared for here and never ever have to feel alone.  Please keep us posted with your progress-- My prayers are with you -- xxoo, Margie  Margie ",
