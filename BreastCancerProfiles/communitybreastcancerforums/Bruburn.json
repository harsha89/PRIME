The emergency weaning brought on a period (my last period ever), while the chemo was in the process of slapping me into menopause.  So, at one point, I was still lactating, having a period and having hot flashes at the same time.  CRAZY! Anyway, you've got shoulders to lean on here...glad you're using them! Bruburn ",

So, I've finished 7 treatments of dose dense AC.  It was supposed to be 8.  But, an echo showed minor changes in my heart so we decided to stop at 7.  Cat Scan shows no disease remaining in breast, nodes clear, bones stable and multiple small lesions stable on liver.  Onc says the spots on the liver may well be scar tissue.  Either way, the 3 liver spots I had that were in the range of 2cm are now tiny spots which are too small to measure.  All of the other small spots also shrunk in size.  I'm happy, but terrified at the same time. I am 5% ER+ and PR-.  So, we are going to try Femara and keep a close eye on things.  What's close?  Is three months reasonable for my next scan?  Should I push for one sooner? The onc has also suggested a mastectomy with NO node dissection.  She says there is a possible survival gain and it also reduces complications at \"the end\" when the cancer comes back.  She knows I want to fight and she says this is an option for fighting.  The surgeon said he would do it, but does not agree with the aggressive approach we are taking.  I think I'm up for the mastectomy...had a c-section last June and had no problems with recovery (and I was full of cancer!).  What do you think?

After 4 rounds of Adriamycin and Cytoxin, my onc says there is regression in the liver.  She wouldn't give me specifics (like a %), but said it looked promising.  So, she is signing me up for four more rounds.  I asked about the taxanes, but she said if AC is working let's stick with it and get more regression...keep the taxanes for later. I was disappointed that she didn't provide more detail...I felt like she was trying to shield me from something...like maybe only 10% regression or something.  Anyway, I've decided that any regression is good and I should be thankful!

The report from July simply says (re the liver) - \"no evidence of metastatic disease\". The October report says (re the liver) - <paraphrased because report it HORRIBLE> ...Multiple lesions are noted.  Of these there is a 1.5 cm nodular lesion in the left lobe suspicious of metastasis. There is a 1.1 cm hypoechoic lesion in the right lobe...A paragraph further down says the lesions are in the opposite lobes, so it was confusing. Also, this report had N/A under patient history!!!  Anyway, the palliative doc said that the take home message was the same...significant progression in the last three months.   So I finally spoke to my onc yesterday.  She sat down with a different radiologist  and they went though all of my scans together.  They have concluded that the lesion in the left lobe had been there since March and that it has been growing very slowly.  Since ultrasound isn't very sensitive, they cannot say whether or not it is really growing at all.  She would argue that this is actually stable disease.  Apparently the lesion on the right has also been there since March and has not changed and the second radiologist feels that it is not a met.  Apparently the radiologist from July agreed. So, she wants to wait six weeks and do a CT scan.  Her original proposal was to wait three months, but I said NO WAY.   So, I am in a weird limbo...happy if the second radiologist is right...wondering why none of these lesions were reported in July...guess I never was NED...confused as to how you can go from NED to significant progression to stable disease based on interpretation... I always knew radiologists didn't always agree etc...but this is freakin crazy.  I know this has happened to many women here...hugs to you and to all of us!
