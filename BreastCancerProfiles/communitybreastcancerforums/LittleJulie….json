BRCA1 positive and a huge history of breast cancer in my family, me, my fam, and my genetic counselor all felt it was not an \"if but when\" situation as well. I cannot describe the relief I feel knowing this risk is now down to less than 1%. Reconstruction options today are better than ever, and at only a few weeks post-op my boyfriend agrees that the new \"girls\" are very very sexy. Good luck with your decision, take care of yourself. Preventative action is a choice, there is no RIGHT answer, only your OWN answer. Whatever you decide is right for you IS the right thing.",
