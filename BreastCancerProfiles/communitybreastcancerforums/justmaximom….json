My breast itself is red and looks not great but doesn't really hurt. Underboob is a bit sore but not like underarm areas. Finished 4 of the 8 boosts this morning so I'm almost there. Zelda - Congrats on finishing! Kate - Congrats on the house, that is so exciting. Marijen - Please do not think anything at all about asking for whatever you need to get you through this. I'm prone to panic attacks so my primary care doctor has me a scrip of emergency Xanax at all times. When I started chemo my MO prescribed Ativan because as mentioned previously, it helps with nausea. I did not use the two together and preferred the Ativan. It helped me relax when I needed it. I have plenty left and I keep it with me at all times. My RO told me to take one before my simulation and for my first radiation just to help me relax. I found that it's actually a relaxing experience for me so I haven't taken any since. Your RO should be ready and willing to do whatever is necessary to make this as comfortable for you as possible. Luckily, my RO started our first appointment by telling me to let him know if I needed anything like this or if I needed him to put me off work for any amount of time and he'd be happy to do so.

Unless you look at it, then it looks painful. mdoc524, I've worked full time since the beginning. I took a week off work when I had surgery but actually did some work from home by the end of the week. During chemo, especially when I was doing weekly Taxol, I basically came home from work and did nothing. Honestly, it's been two months since that ended and I'm just now starting to feel back to myself. The rads don't seem to bother me fatigue-wise but if the skin issue gets worse I might have to take some time off to deal with that.",

I really hate to be a grumpster but if I seriously don't start getting some warm and fuzzies from my radiation crew, things are just not going to be pleasant. I know there are other facilities but this one is close to my office so I'd rather go there but things just aren't clicking for me. There was a bit of a hassle getting my first appointment scheduled, then I was there waiting for the doctor over 2 hrs before he even came in. The simulation or what I assume was the simulation was scheduled for the 21st. That day they did a CT scan and marked left with a lot of blue markers and told me to make sure and not scrub them off. They said if my mold was finished last week, they would call me and we would start today. Well, no call and all but two of the marks have faded and I promise I did not scrub them. I'm set up for the hospital's online scheduling messenger which I understood that this RO didn't update. However, this morning I got an email showing that I'm scheduled for appts with the RO every Monday for the next 6 weeks, beginning 1/4/15. I called the RO's office and spoke to one of the RT's who said there was a note to \"call patient\" but he wasn't sure what was going on with me so he would talk to the other RT who did my CT scan and have her call me this afternoon. Other things that I don't understand is that everyone else seems to have gotten tattoos but I was just marked with a sharpie. Also, my entire appointment last week which I thought was my \"simulation\" was done in the CT room. The only reason I even saw the radiation room was because I asked to see the machine. Does this even sound normal?? ",

I specifically asked him about the lotions because he had initially told me not to use any unless we saw a problem. He's still standing by that and said there's no proof that using anything prior to skin issues helps. He did give me a sample of Aquafor and said that if I begin having problems that's what we'll use. I think I'm going to go ahead and order one of those cooling cloths from Amazon. They're fairly cheap and SO works outside so even if I don't need it, he can put it to use in the summer.

I went in last week for my bloodwork and I had been running around like crazy so when they took my vitals, my temp was 99.8 which concerned them. They took it again and it dropped to 99.5, then I saw the NP who was worried that an infection might be brewing in my port site. They drew more blood for cultures and even though before Ieft my temp was back down to normal she insisted that I should begin antibiotics. Results came back from the blood cultures, no infection but I've been on these antibiotics since Thursday and she told me to continue them. That bugs me because I'm always apprehensive about taking antibiotics and one of my pet peeves is people that don't take them correctly!",

I'm going to message her and see if she can squeeze me in this weekend if they don't have too many plans. Cheesequake, I'm sorry your hubby isn't being supportive of your decision. I'm sure he means well but I would just sit him down, hold his hand and tell him why you made this decision and showing you those pictures and stuff isn't helpful. ",

Friday when I took a shower it came out in handfuls which got worse on Saturday and when I showered Sunday morning it was everywhere. I'd had enough of it. I was going to get SO to buzz it for me and he just wasn't comfortable doing that himself. I didn't want to bother my regular hairdresser on a Sunday morning so I just went to Great Clips. They got me right it, the girl knew exactly what she was doing and seemed familiar with what I was going through. When it was done, she told me there was no charge. I was surprised and thought that was a very sweet service for them to offer - I did tip her though. Now, I'm practicing my scarf tying skills and even easily made one of those turbans using the bottom of a t-shirt - and I'm not talented at all. I used a red t-shirt then weaved a white headband around the twist and wore it to the Cards game last night. Have a great week everyone!!! oh, here's my buzzed head. In the last 24hrs it's gotten a little mangy looking though lol ",

My head was itchy and tiny little hairs were flying everywhere which made the rest of my body itchy. I showered when I got home and after the towel dry, it's pretty patchy looking up there. I have family coming to visit this weekend and I have chemo #2 tomorrow so I'm hoping that it goes as well as last treatment. I have forewarned my family that even though they are coming to see me, I might not leave my room much and they're okay with that.",

I was glad to get home but SO is working weird hours this week so I was only able to spend about an hour with him before he headed to work. I slept most of the evening and it was difficult getting up to go to work this morning. Such a strange feeling. I felt sick to my stomach but hungry at the same time. ",

Also, they couldn't draw blood from my port for some reason. It sounds like it may be a common thing because the nurse didn't seem concerned but she did inject activase to get the flow going again and that worked even though it takes about 45 mins to do so. BTW, I got my period 2 days before A/C #2 and it was exactly on time but it has continued much longer than normal. I'm usually done in 5 days but as of yesterday which was Day 10 of my menstrual cycle, I was still spotting slightly. My MO said that my ovaries must be strong! Not what I wanted to hear, I'm ready to get that over with too.",
