I also had Barretts esophagus which was problematic. The surgery was scheduled and although all the tissues looked normal I had dozens of difuse foci of signet cell carcinoma.  It wasn't until this spring that the lab doing research was able to locate the gene mutation in my blood tests and tissues.  I have the mutation.  so I have done pretty well so far with everything...Actualy I think I had more stomach trouble before my second surgery. God Bless you and may he keep you safe for your surgery.  My breast cancer risk is a concern for me but I have been on tamoxofen and changed to evista but the side effects are not so much fun.  seeing a surgeon next week since I am 54. ",

My sister had a propholactic gastrectomy although there was no genetic test available at the time show a mutation.  But what are the odds 2 siblings develop stomach cancer (the exact same kind) in their 30s.  So now I know I do have it and the rest of the family is being tested. If you have any questions I would be glad to share.  I am now on tamoxifen since i did find out about the heightened risk for lobular breast CA. ",

I would find another surgeon for consult with oncologist. ",
