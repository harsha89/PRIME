I had my last Herceptin treatment yesterday and will have my port removed on Jan 6. I was hoping to get the tattoo ASAP but researching online has made me think that I have to wait a year. the original scar is 13 months old and healed nice & flat but Doctor will have to rip it open again to remove the port. Has anyone tattooed over their port scar and how long after it was removed?Â ",
