She said it feels like normal breast tissue with maybe a cyst inside, but that we take ALL lumps very seriously, even if it doesn't appear serious, and has sent me for a mammogram and ultrasound. She said we don't ever celebrate until we have clear results. It's the most serious I've ever heard her, and hope that it's just because she didn't want me to assume it was all okay and skip out on testing.

I said that doesn't sound good , but she said don't panic, that's what they tell everyone. I'm now actually really nervous. I feel sure now I'm going in to get bad news this afternoon",

My genetic counsellor said QLD health will only fund genetic testing for high risk patients. I was able to get testing for one gene (tp53 - negative) but not anything else.

The hard thing was that I couldn't take sick leave: I had to keep doing my job. Here are some thing some I did to get by, I don't know what will apply to you: - if people offered to help, I tried to say yes. Mostly it was meals, but a couple of friends stopped in, brought coffee and swept my floor or cleaned my bathroom before they left. The best help, though, was the friends who came over, made us both a cup of tea, and then played with my daughter! Three year olds need a lot of attention, and I didn't have the energy for it. - I lowered my expectations even further than they already are. So what if my bathroom wasn't spotless? I can sleep on my dirty sheets for a little longer - just let me sleep! - I put stuff in the dryer instead of hanging it on the line if I was feeling too sick (then I bought an indoor airer, and I still use it!) - I did online grocery shopping. - I cooked a lot in a slow cooker. I could put dinner on in the mornings when I still felt good, then by night when I was feeling gross dinner would already be done. We were going to pre-cook some meals and freeze, but we didn't get around to it before treatment started. - there was a lot more TV than I would normally allow. Everyone else tells me my daughter doesn't seem worse off for it, but I can tell. I got her into an online learn to read programme (she's a bright cookie and was ready for it) - Reading Eggs for any Australian mums reading this - and that made me feel a little better about her screen time. I love the Lego video games too, so I let her play with me in the afternoons because they involve problem solving. - both my husband and I dropped everything inessential in our week. We are on all sorts of rosters at church, and people were happy to fill for us both. He dropped out of his indoor cricket team. I focussed on getting better and he took the kids to soccer training and swimming lessons and birthday parties. If I didn't feel I was up to going somewhere, I didn't. ",

Sometimes the stabby pain takes my breath away, then I suddenly become conscious of my breathing and then think 'oh no, why can't I breath properly', then I end up anxious and it gets worse. Sometimes the achy bones just make me want to curl up and cry. Sometimes the general crampy soreness makes me unconsciously curl up my shoulders. It's all left my upper body in a mess. Every muscle in my neck, upper back and upper chest is sore and tight. Working with a physio, and getting my husband to massage the knots in my back, but it is a long slow process. Wish I had known before how much chronic pain I would have to deal with.",

The reason I changed doctors recently was (in part) that my previous doctor would brush things off all the time. I went to my new doctor with a problem that my previous doctor kept telling 'no, that's normal' even though I knew it wasn't. My new doctor told me tha it probably is normal, explained why, then ran some tests just to make sure. But now I'm worried that when I went in complaining about chest and arm pain and my old doctor did a breast exam that she missed something (I suppose a year and a half ago?)!!!!! The pain comes and goes (and of course has been back this week, but it seems to be an injury that I keep aggravating picking up my toddler, made worse by specific activities. I will try to relax.",
