If you can't get Intravenous Vitamin C, Liposomal Vitamin C can be a big help if you can't afford or find IV Vitamin C. Having extra Vitamin C, 1,000mg to 3,000mg per day for at least a week before surgery and for at least 2 weeks afterwards. That is what Dr Andrew Weil says. I tend to think it is possible to have even higher amounts of Vitamin C safely. I did that on a number of occasions, what is called \"Titrating to bowel tolerance \" Basically it means to take a Vitamin C tablet, (chewable type are some of the easiest) once an hour throughout the day. When your body is finally starting to have more Vitamin C than you need, then you will begin to experience loose stools. Then you stop taking Vitamin C, count up how many tablets you have had over the course of the day, and the next day take one or two less tablets of Vitamin C for that day. Repeat that for several days, but as you heal and your health improves you will get to the point of loose stools sooner and sooner (needing less and less pills every day in a gradual taper downward) It is quite safe to do it this way, if you have normal kidney and bowel function. The worst that happens is that you can get diarrhea. It is a great way to tell exactly how much Vitamin C your body needs. Sufficient Vitamin C is crucial to wound healing, helps with making strong collagen. When you hear stories of surgical wounds that dehise it is a high probability that there is a Vitamin C deficiency leading to inadequate collagen production.

      "Content": "Jul 19, 2017 07:22PM - edited Jul 19, 2017 07:35PM by macb04 Surgery can be a painful and hard process to go through. Luckily, there are certain supplements that can be taken before and after the procedure to prepare your body for the intricate process of repairing itself. Some nutritional supplements help speed wound healing while others reduce bruising, swelling, and discomfort such as pain and itch. Others are recommended to prepare your body for the intense experience and increase resilience. Optimizing your post-surgical diet by eating healthy foods and taking supplements also improves the immune response and prevents wound infections, sepsis (blood poisoning), and other possible complications. The following vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and bioflavonoids are recommended to promote surgical healing: Vitamin C supplementation is highly recommended by experts. It helps promote healing and it is the key nutrient required for making collagen, which is what heals your tissue together. It plays an essential role in collagen formation, a resilient immune function, and as a tissue antioxidant. Also, it is a free-radical scavenger. Without proper amounts of vitamin C proper healing is not possible. Additional vitamin C intake before, during, and after the operation is especially recommended for those who smoke and others who may risk being deficient. Read more about the role of vitamin C in wound healing. says Michael A. Fiorillo, MD, a New York City area plastic surgeon who serves as a spokesman for the AAPRP (American Association of Professional Ringside Physicians). The next supplement and possibly one of the most important is zinc. Medical research has shown that zincsupplements can increase the speed of healing dramatically. Zinc has reduced healing time after surgery by 43% in some cases. It plays a vital role in the immune system can reduce inflammation, bacterial growth, and scar tissue creation, whereas a deficiency can worsen the scar. Zinc also helps to aid proper metabolism, balance blood sugar, and increase sensory perception. Vitamin B has just recently been noticed for its benefits in the healing process. However, there is limited information on its exact benefits and function in the healing process. Vitamin B complex is thought to speed up wound healing, increase protein synthesis and the amount of repair cells at the wound. It also prevents excessive inflammation. Vitamin B5 is particularly beneficial right after the wound occurs. Opt for either a Vitamin B complex or a multi-nutrient that contains 25 to 50 mg of the B complex vitamins. Another important supplement is vitamin A. it is required in cell growth (especially epithelial and bone formation), which is very important in the healing process that takes place after surgery. It is known to activate production of connective tissue, including collagen (promotes tissue synthesis), and helps new blood vessels grow , which is necessary in nourishing newly formed tissue. Vitamin A also enhances resistance to infection by stimulating the body's immune function. A very popular supplement is arnica montana. Arnica is a mountain extract that has been used for many years. It helps reduce and clear bruising and it also speeds the healing process after surgery. Available as a cream and in capsules. One of the most popular brands of capsules is SinEcch. Another well-known and popular substance is Bromelain. It is used to reduce bruising, swelling (edema), pain, and healing time. Certain claims are disputed because studies show mixed results. Various studies however indicate that Bromelain reduces swelling, bruising, pain after surgery and physical injuries, and healing time. Bromelain is often used in conjunction with Quercetin. Quality brands that offer both in one are NOW Foods and VitaMedica. Quercetin, a plant pigment naturally found in foods such as onions, is a so called bioflavonoid. It promotes histamine release in the body and thus acts like an anti-inflammatory. Usually after surgery inflammation is a common response by the body. While it is totally normal, it can be quite uncomfortable and sometimes painful. Luckily Quercetin is known for its anti-inflammatory traits. On top of that, it is also know in speeding up the healing process. More about bromelain and quercetin. Don't underestimate the benefits of protein. Protein, boosts the immune system. In the human body it breaks down into amino acids. Adequate dietary protein is absolutely essential for proper wound healing. Especially L-Arginine and Glutamine are very important and commonly used to shorten post-surgery recovery time. They can increase the amount of reparative collagen, help white blood cells and fight of bacterial infections. Glucosamine appears to be the rate-limiting substrate for hyaluronic acid production in the wound. (hyaluronic acid is naturally present in the human body and plays a role in injury recovery) Probiotics are not only known for their specific healing benefits regarding certain surgeries but they are known to have beneficial effects in general. Surgery patients often receive antibiotic treatment. This disrupts the gut flora and may create fungal disorders (including yeast infections), digestive problems, and diarrhea. Probiotics can help neutralize these unwanted effects.After surgery, it's recommended to use a strain that contains acidophilus and bifida bacteria. Clinical evidence demonstrates that Coenzyme Q10 is especially useful when undergoing heart surgery. Mayoclinic speaks of \"promising evidence to support the use of CoQ10 before heart surgery.\" A study compared patients undergoing cardiac surgery. One group was given CoQ10 supplements while the other group got a placebo during 2 weeks before the operation. The CoQ10 group showed improved healing and strengthened heart function. Another study demonstrated that oral coenzyme Q10 therapy for 7 to 10 days preoperatively could improve clinical outcome.",

Carroll and his team uncovered a possible explanation for why women whose breast cancer cells carry two key molecules \u2013 called the oestrogen and progesterone receptors \u2013 do better than those whose cells only carry the oestrogen receptor. Even when they receive the same treatment. They revealed that when signals were sent through the progesterone receptor it slowed down the growth of breast cancer cells. To find out if this had potential as a treatment, the researchers tested a new combination of hormone therapies and found it slowed down tumour growth in mice. This was a really important study, but had only been carried out in mice, so it was too early to say whether it could help treat women with breast cancer. Now, just 2 years after the discovery from Carroll's team, 3 clinical trials are set to open that will test this new approach in people. Carroll's study was instrumental in understanding how the progesterone receptor works in breast cancer, and how it can act as a handbrake on cancer cells' growth. The team's results have now led to a possible new approach for stopping double positive breast cancer cells growing. Normally, women whose breast cancer cells carry the oestrogen receptor (so-called ER positive) are treated with drugs that cut off oestrogen or directly block the oestrogen receptor. This will either be tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors, depending on whether the woman is pre- or post-menopausal.  Dr Jason Carroll But Carroll's results showed that treating mice with those oestrogen-blocking drugs and a dose of the hormone progesterone had an even bigger effect compared to the oestrogen-blocking drugs alone. Progesterone changes the genes that oestrogen turns on and off by forcing the oestrogen receptor to sit in different positions in the genome, and according to Carroll this means the combined treatment offers a safety net. \"It's like a double blow,\" he says. \"We cut off oestrogen, and as an insurance policy we use progesterone to pull the oestrogen receptor away from the genes that support cancer's growth.\" This was the evidence that was needed to take the research into early clinical trials. When the results were published, they caused quite a stir. Carroll says they challenged how people thought these different types of breast cancer worked at the time. \"For years there'd been a lot of confusion over whether progesterone encourages cancer to grow, and this has largely come from population studies looking into hormone replacement therapy (HRT),\" he says Some women choose to take HRT to ease symptoms caused by the menopause. There are different types, and the combined form contains a man-made version of progesterone called medroxyprogesterone acetate (or similar versions). It's this combined form of HRT in particular that is linked to an increased risk of developing breast cancer. \"This led to the popular belief that progesterone encourages breast cancer to grow,\" says Carroll. \"But it's not that simple. Different versions of man-made progesterone seem to have different effects on cells compared to the natural hormone. \"Plus we were trying to understand what role progesterone plays after a breast cancer has developed, rather than looking at how it affects risk of cancer beginning in the first place.\" Just 6 months after the findings were published, Carroll was approached by Dr Richard Baird, a clinical trials specialist based at our Cambridge Centre, to discuss possible trials. \"A clinical trial from Brazil showed that around 40% of women whose cancer had stopped responding to standard oestrogen-blocking therapies, including tamoxifen and anastrozole, still responded to a man-made progesterone called megestrol acetate,\" says Carroll. Their idea was to try the combination of oestrogen-blocking drug and progesterone as the first therapy women receive. And setting up the trial was surprisingly simple. \"Because the drugs we want to test have been used by doctors for years for a variety of reasons, including in the treatment of late stage metastatic breast cancer, we know they are safe and what doses to use them at. Plus they have the benefit of being cheap,\" says Carroll. The Pioneer trial is being led by Carroll and Baird, and will start enrolling women with early stage breast cancer in June 2017. Women joining the trial will still get the gold standard of care treatment that all women with early breast cancer receive, but the team will test the combination in a gap that exists between diagnosis and surgery. \"What happens is there's normally a few weeks' wait between a women having a biopsy and then having surgery to remove her tumour. \"In our trial, we're going to ask women to take the combination of an oestrogen-blocking drug \u2013 in our case anastrozole \u2013 and the man-made progesterone (megestrol acetate) during this wait. Then we can study the biopsy sample and a sample of the tumour removed during surgery to see the effects of the combination treatment on the cancer cells.\" Carroll and Baird are focusing on post-menopausal women in their trial, but there are 2 other trials that have been set up in partnership that look at slightly different things. One of the trials, led by Dr Carlo Palmieri at the University of Liverpool, is being funded by us. The approach is similar to that of Carroll and Baird, but Palmieri's trial will involve pre-menopausal women who will be given a combination of tamoxifen and man-made progesterone instead. The third trial will be opening in Australia, testing a combination of aromatase inhibitors and natural progesterone in post-menopausal women. If the trials show that the combination treatment is effective by studying tumour samples, the next steps would be extending the studies into larger trials so women are given the combination after surgery too, to see if it improves survival and doesn't cause any harms in the long-term. Another interesting angle to the trials is finding out if adding progesterone to oestrogen-blocking drugs helps reduce the side effects of treatment. \"For the maximum effect, women should take oestrogen-blocking drugs for the recommended time period after surgery,\" says Carroll. \"But unpleasant side effects mean many women stop their treatment early, and this increases the risk of their cancer returning. \"As part of this trial, we're also finding out if a lower dose of progesterone routinely used to alleviate menopausal symptoms works as well as the higher dose. This could make the side effects of hormone therapy more manageable and improve the fraction of women that stay on their standard treatments.\" The clinical trials are only just opening, so we'll need to wait until they've got some results before knowing if this will benefit women with double positive breast cancer and could be made widely available. But thanks to some excellent lab research by Carroll and his team, and our funding, the trials are up and running and we're another step closer to an answer.",

The idiot doctor should have told me about Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy when she was frying the crap out of my poor tortured chest. I had to figure it out myself. Now my skin is nearly normal looking and feeling. I only have a little tightness, nothing like the iron bra feeling I had before. Ladies, if you are tired of tightness, and want to finally take off that iron bra, then head to your nearest Wound care center that uses HBOT to treat soft tissue radio necrosis. That, by the way is a Medicare approved diagnosis for getting treatment. Log in to post a reply",

I probably don't actually need it at night, but my fears my arm would swell while I was sleeping were freaking me out. I don't think it is harming my arm, wearing it at night, and the jury is out whether working out in the gym with the sleeve is a problem. It seems to be unchanging. I work out with the sleeve on usually and then I go swimming. I can tell if I have a little bit of swelling because my arm starts to ache. I measure my wrist area with my thumb and second finger. I now know exactly what the size is by that, sort of a built in measuring tape.",

Insurance will pay for treatment if it is for wound healing in certain circumstances, ie with reconstruction therapy, especially if you have had radiation fibrosis or infections. The correct term for rad fibrosis is SOFT TISSUE RADIONECROSIS. That is tthe term to use to get insurance to pay. That is a diagnosis even Medicare recognizes and pays for. The other way is to get HBOT at a hospital based outpatient center. They are often attached to Wound Care centers. I gotmy husbands insuranceto payfor HBOT as I had bad radiation damage and bad infections twice during reconstruction. They hated to pay for it, and turned down my first requests and I had to appeal. I did suceed, I have had 100 HBOT sessions and plan to get 20 more when I get nipple reconstruction in December 2015. There is a private HBOT place in Redmond, near Seattle. I found out they would give 20 treatment sessions for $1600 to $2000 depending on if you use the lower pressure or higher pressure chambers. Each session takes from 90 to 120 minutes. Your ears pop like you are in an airplane as they gradually increase and then decrease the pressure. That is why it takes solong for each treatment. Also it makes you temporarily more nearsighted when you get to treatment number 20. That happened to me each set of treatments I had. It all went away, and my vision went back to normal. My skin is nearly normal. My skin was crazy tight and weirdly hard, like leather, even my PS is really surprised at how much improved and nearly normal it is. I wish I had known about it before I had those two bad infections, maybe I could have avoided them. That fool of a rad oncologist should have told me about HBOT.",

      "Content": "Apr 25, 2016 10:29PM - edited Apr 25, 2016 11:14PM by macb04 Surgery is well known to deplete Vitamin C. Sufficient Vitamin C is necessary for wound healing/collagen formation and wound strength. Vitamin C is also crucial for immunity. Most people do not get enough Vitamin C for one reason or another, so titrate your intake to bowel tolerance. Since Vitamin C is water soluble, you can not overdose on it, unless you have bowel or kidney issues. The amount of Vitamin C a person needs is dependent on their health/physiologic stressors, so if you have a cold you might need between 2 to 5 grams of Vitamin C per day, but if you are well, you might only need 1 gram per day. The bowel tolerance part of the equation is that when you have reached the maximum amount that your body needs of Vitamin C per day, you will get loose stools. The idea is that gradually over time as you get well, you will need less and less Vitamin C. Also Zinc is very helpful for wound healing, perhaps a good multivitamin as well as making sure to get plenty of vegetables and some fruits. Hope some of this information is of help, you will get better. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7038579 Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol. 1982 Mar;53(3):231-6. Ringsdorf WM Jr, Cheraskin E. Clinical studies provide evidence that wound healing in subjects judged not deficient In Vitamin C can be significantly accelerated with supplements of this nutrient above the recommended daily allowance (RDA). The authors administered daily dosages of 500 to 3,000 mg., which is roughly 8 to 50 times the RDA of 60 mg., to subjects recovering from surgery, other injuries, decubital ulcers, and leg ulcers induced by hemolytic anemia. Genetic impairment of collagen synthesis has also been observed to be responsive toascorbic acid supplementation in an 8-year-old boy with Type VI Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Four grams of ascorbic acid daily produced a significant improvement in the quality of newly synthesized collagen but did not alter that formed prior to the supplementation of C. The combined evidence in this review provides a substantial base for further research, both clinical and experimental trials, concerning the interrelationships between vitamin C and the body's healing potential.",
