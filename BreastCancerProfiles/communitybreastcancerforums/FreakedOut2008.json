I have been told that the lump is 3.5cm in length and 1.9 cm in width. I have also been told that it is invasive cancer. It started in my ducts and has managed to spread outside of the wall of the duct. They have told me that I will have to go through Chemotherapy and Radiation, and we are hoping that I am a candidate for the Hormone Therapy. Since being told that I have breast cancer, my whole world has been turned upside down. I don't know anything about cancer and I am extremely scared of the treatments. I am hoping that once they do the surgery I won't have to have anymore surgeries, but being uncertain about all of this is really about to drive me mad. I was hoping that I could find a friend with some similar situation as my own to talk with about all of this. I have my family but they just don't seem to understand how I am feeling, for that matter neither am I. Thanks for listening. Hope to talk with someone soon. Freaked Out 2008 Log in to post a reply",
