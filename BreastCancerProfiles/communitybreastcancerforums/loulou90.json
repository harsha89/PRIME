She gets mammogram screening annually and this year they discovered new micro calcifications.  I went on this forum quite a bit and read various messages and topics. I admire all the strength and support you all have shown. It really helped me get through the difficult time of waiting. Going through this has really put my life into perspective. I am going to sign up for various breast cancer awareness events and I am going to pursue oncology as my medical speciality.  My mother was very fortunate with her benign diagnosis but I know very well this is not the case for everyone. You ladies are my inspiration. You are always in my thoughts and prayers. Thank you again Log in to post a reply",
