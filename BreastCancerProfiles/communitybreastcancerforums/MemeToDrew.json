I have yet to meet a radiologist, and the super-young ultrasound tech was snippety when I winced a couple of times. They were not forthcoming with info, even when I asked. I have to say, I left there feeling let down and clueless. I will stay on them to find out my results, and I want a paper copy of the report, too. Right now I feel like just another number. Thank you ChiSandy, for sharing your experience! It was eye-opening.",

I'm 42, and up until last week had never had a mammogram. Just happened to find a small lump a couple weeks ago, had a screening mammo last week. During the exam I was able to see my little lump onscreen. It was bright white and had \"tentacles\", and I thought it looked like a firecracker or an octopus. Didn't think much about it til the doctor's office called early the next day to schedule a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. So, me being me, I've scoured the internet for info and have succeeded in scaring the tar out of myself. I know better, but did it anyway. My tests are this Thursday, and I guess I just need some digital hugs, as my son calls itüòä Log in to post a reply",
