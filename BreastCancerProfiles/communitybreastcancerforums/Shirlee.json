    "Content": "Apr 2, 2012 07:48PM - edited Apr 2, 2012 07:49PM by Shirlee I was diagnoised last December as well with stage 11 breast cancer, grade 2, no lodes involved, ER+/PR+, HER2- and had the Oncotype test done.  My score was 19 and I decided with the help of my doctor to go straight to radiation and slip the chemo.  I have 5 more radiation treatments and then will start the Arimdex medication.  I sometimes worry if I made the right decision but I have to go forward now.  I dreaded taking chemo, was scared of the effects of such a strong drug at my age of 64.  I will do my best to keep healthy, have all my check ups and then leave it in God's hands from there. I understand how you feel and hope my note has helped a little.  Good Luck, Shirlee",
