My doctors tell me that I'm stage 4 because of cancer in a right lymph node ( my primary cancer was on my left side). I never cried this much when I was diagnosed. I'm not sure what's going on. I went thru chemo, radiation, and ovary removal over the past year. I thought I handled things OK up until now. This is the first time I have posted. Does anyone feel the same way?
