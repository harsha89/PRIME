Unfortunately/fortunately it was discovered I had an oval shaped cyst in left breast.  The doctor said  don't worry most likely it is b9.  Follow up CT showed no change in cyst but pneumonia was gone.  Today they said I have a complex cyst with separate calcifications. I asked how many and it is about 20. They want to do a stereotactic biopsy on the calcification and aspiration on the cyst.  The doctor (radiologist) said that possibly with the calcification and and the complex cyst I have fibrocystic brests which is b9. My question is has any one had this result before and what was the outcome? Log in to post a reply",
