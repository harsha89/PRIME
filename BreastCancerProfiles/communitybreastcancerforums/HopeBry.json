I wanted to know for those who had a dbl mastectomy, nipple sparring mastectomy etc. If you have a desk job, how soon are you able to go back to work? Were you in a lot of pain or just numb and soreness? I ask because Ive been at my new job only a month and if there is a 6week recovery like Im reading online, They may let me go. Im not sure.",

I assumed it was the medicines. I had back pains and headaches. A day later more pain and now my right expander is red and swollen and hurts like hell. Feel like there is a slight rash in some areas. it looks like little hives. Nothing is wrong with my left side and he expanded that one as well though. Does this mean I have an infection or something else? anyone experienced this? Im getting worried. This is a holiday weekend so not sure if I can even reach him now.",

The hospital saw no fluid around the expander with the catscan but my surgeon thats in Aruba is adamant about removal. He said thats what they do to fix. So I guess I will have 1 expanded boob. The other will have to be added all over again when the infection is fully gone. Yea it sucks and I wish the best for you with what youre going through as well. ",

No mention of radiation as there is no lymph activity. I guess it will give me more time to think as the tumor hopefully shrinks. I am leaning towards a dbl Mastectomy whether my genetic results are positive or negative. I just dont want any reoccurance or additional surgeries outside of reconstructed boobs. My husband wants me to do what's best but he feels MX is a last resort. He's obsessed with nipples/areolas as most men but they are not that important to me as a woman when it comes to preventative choices. I am curious as to other people's choices in my situation being a TN Grade 3.",
