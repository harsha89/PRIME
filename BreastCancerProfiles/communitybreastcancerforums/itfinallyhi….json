      "Content": "Jun 21, 2017 08:48AM - edited Jun 21, 2017 08:49AM by itfinallyhitme I hope it's ok to jump into this thread. It seems a good place, since I've tried to read (soooooo many posts) and it's really the posts here that have made me question my LE appt.  I'm 8 weeks post-op, BMX. I also had a partial mastectomy, SNB, resection, and rads in 2016. A few weeks post-op I got really heavy feeling in the backs of both arms. One swelled to start showing a crease, shiny skin, veins hidden. It took 5 weeks to get in to see an LE PT (also supposed to address mobility issues). I finally had my appt yesterday, and while it may be early to draw conclusions, based on what I've read here, I have questions about whether the treatment is the best or a complete course of action.  She wrapped my arm after taking measurements. She mentioned there was massage and said I shouldn't be doing it on my own. She said the plan is to wrap, try to get swelling down, then wear a compression garment. She said there's not much else that can be done and I can't expect any improvement. Other than limiting repetitive motion and not lifting more than 8 pounds ever again, she said there's nothing to avoid. When I asked about bp, blood draws, she said ask my dr. She also said there is nothing else I can do proactively. My range of motion is still pretty compromised, but we are going to try to get garments and all in place before dealing with it (being 8 weeks post-op I'm getting worried about long-term mobility issues). I can't afford the garments until I get back to work, and she said Medicaid won't cover them. I'm not supposed to shower, swim, wash my hands, etc (do anything to get wrapping wet, or take them off) until I get garments. Swimming is the only thing that helps really and will decrease swelling. I also have a skin issue that has made all the bathing restrictions this year really bad, and I don't need months more of the same. And I WANT TO BE ABLE TO EXERCISE, not be further immobilized. I'm in terrible, terrible physical shape after this past year and starting to become afraid for my future. I think the wrapping is helping my upper arm (the only place that was swollen) but my hand hurts. I'm willing to do whatever I need to do, but my question is ... does this sound like good care? I don't want to submit to something that is going to stall recovery, or make things worse, if the standard of care has changed. Although I'm not sure what my alternative would be. She is trained in lymphedema. But she was very skeptical when I mentioned talking to ladies online that had gotten improvement. If she's not expecting any improvement, then am I being treated correctly? And if she says there's nothing else I can do, or avoid, than she's mentioned, am I being treated correctly?  Thank you if anyone read this far.",

That's my concern. :( The LE therapist hasn't done MLD, told me not to, and hasn't shown me how. And I'm not clear on what exercise IS allowed/encouraged, or not, I only know that being in water (I shouldn't say swimming - i \"ride\" a noodle that puts me about shoulder deep and I bicycle around the pool, and swish my arms through the water - that brings down swelling and feels great - but as long as I'm not supposed to get wet AT ALL I can't do that. I'm going to ask her about showing me how to do MLD and how to re-wrap, and if I can't unwrap to swim then re-wrap, etc. Since I've seen a pretty dramatic improvement from wrapping, I'm on-board, and I'm willing to do whatever it takes - timing is good because I'm off for at least 6 weeks with school out. I'll stick with whatever I need to do. But I need to know it's the right thing, and what I've read in this thread had really made me question that. I wish it wasn't so hard to get in to see anyone here. This appt took me 5 weeks to get.",

I'm also planning (can't see a reason not to?) to start walking again tomorrow, early before sunrise so it will be cooler. I want VERY BADLY to do a little yard work - even just a tiny bit! - but I'm guessing I need to hold off. At least the walking is restricted to lower body and I can easily track exactly how much I do. I'm wondering about things like foods, so I'll see what I can find to read. :)",

If that's an important part of the wrapping being effective, then I want very much to get started, but I've been told the LE therapist will do that on my next three visits, and teach me as well.  So with being able to rewrap (hopefully effectively enough) ... I am MUCH happier than I was after my first visit. :)",

I ended up doing exactly that - maybe about ten minutes of activity, INDOORS, then resting. Repeat, repeat, repeat. About half the day not even wrapped (I kept putting off getting to the pool) and still I did just fine. I think yesterday's problem must have been heat. I'm going to have to stick to very early morning for outdoor stuff in summer, I guess. I hope, hope, hope I can get my flower borders in order and my plants repotted. I'm glad I did most of the potting before surgery. 1.5 hours in water today, concentrating on working my legs harder and arms less. I think I got a tiny bit of sun, which I tried to avoid, but midday pool is about half-shaded. Evening is safer. Massaging scar several times, it's slowly improving. Did MLD twice, once while in the pool, and once before wrapping. It seems it was a pretty good day. :)  I'm getting there, with everyone's help. Thank you all",

Thank goodness it was cloudy, and I really tried to stay mostly in the shade. I'm sure 1.5 hours in the sun would cook me completely.  So no pool today. No appreciable exercise. I just went to Church, ran some errands. It was enough work that I'm in the choir - we sing much of the time for an hour and a half so lots of deep breathing. Hubby wanted a bag of charcoal and he got an 8# bag. He's really going to have to come with to buy charcoal, kitty litter, and animal food. I'm not willing to risk picking them up anymore. I should probably unwrap so I can do MLD but I've done trunk and shoulder anyway. I have appt tomorrow so I can discuss these things with CLT. I just hope I'm not appreciably swollen.  Still learning, but that's good too. I look back a couple of weeks ago and had no idea how to wrap or do MLD, and no real plan of action for dealing with this, so I'm pretty pleased to have made some progress. :)",

Well before I read here, I took her advice. It's my upper arm that's swollen (at least that I notice). Wrapping had slipped some, didn't feel tight anymore, and itching started driving me completely crazy., so I unwrapped it to re-wrap. I was stunned! My arm is a different shape! I measured it, which I'm no expert at, but it was definitely smaller. The crease disappeared. So ... I'm a little more convinced, though I'm still concerned that some things aren't as I would prefer. So I re-wrapped, worried I didn't really do it right though I definitely have swelling in my pit, especially now that the arm is better. And I've been thinking my trunk is a little swollen (not just now but for several weeks).  Wondering if there's a brand of cami that works well?",

I will gladly set a timer. :) And won't do when it's blazing hot.  Great idea on the vet sleeve. I've seen it mentioned but had forgotten. :)  As far as the assistant, I know she hasn't gotten LE certified, but she mentioned going for training in wrapping. Honestly, she communicated much better, did a better wrap from how it feels and how it's holding up (though I did part of it), explained EVERYTHING to me, answered all my questions, etc. I've dealt with this rehab center before and I would expect everything is as it should be, as far as following rules. I hope so. I made the mistake of asking hubby to wake me up to go walking while cool. No idea why, but he didn't. My sleep has been SO messed up lately, I usually fall asleep in the evening, wake up around midnight, then fall asleep again around 4am, so if I want to do something at 6am I'd need an alarm. I guess I'll plan on tomorrow. I live in Florida, so if not getting overheated is a thing, I can only exercise at night or early in the morning outdoors",

I have a question. No swimming today. I need to get some things done around the house I've been working on for about a week. Moving things around. Small, light things, one or two pieces at a time, so it wasn't the weight. But I made many trips to garage (where it is sweltering) and back porch (sunshine Florida summer heat). I didn't mark the time, but after about an hour, my arm really started to hurt, and the swelling at the top of the wrap was terrible. I lay downand elevated my arm, tried to do MLD. Not enough improvement, just terrible pain from constriction of wrapping (wasn't too tight before) and I really hated to take it off since she just wrapped it, but I finally did. Arm is about 1/4\" larger. So ... this is useful info? Different people react differently, and I cannot have even that minor exertion in heat or perhaps time spent in heat? Do we watch and try to figure out our personal limitations? I should have paid closer attention. I'm fine doing stuff like that indoors. Do I rewrap? I'm thinking I should do MLD and rewrap. It really hurts right now because I probably should have gotten it off sooner. I might just elevate. Just wondering if my thinking is correct. These are probably pretty basic questions, but I'm just not sure of things yet. Thanks  BTW, I talked to my CLT later in the day to confirm costs. The custom glove is even worse than I thought. She's thinking to order a less-compressing sleeve so maybe I can get away with just custom sleeve and a gauntlet, which if I start with just one arm, I can put on a credit card, so even if I don't find anything else to help, I can try. But if it doesn't work, I won't be able to get the glove if I DO need it. Maybe in that case, I could just keep wrapping my fingers?  Edited to add ... amazing how good MLD feels!",

I was actually down almost 3/4\" from the swollen measurement after MLD and a little more rest and elevation. I feel MUCH better. I might just wait, swim in the morning, then wrap. She said I'm doing a good job of wrapping. I wasn't lifting chairs and lamps though. A vase, a picture frame, a small pitcher or cup. One item in each hand. I doubt anything weighed more than a pound. VERY light work, more just walking into and out of the heat? Maybe carrying, placing items, etc.? But I normally do that kind of thing without swelling. I need a custom sleeve because my upper arm has gotten pretty large, even before surgery and over the past year. My forearm is average, my wrist is quite small. She said if she ordered a sleeve to fit my upper arm, it would be two sizes too large for my lower arm and not provide any compression.  I guess I'm going to have to get used to what I can do. Ten minutes a day? I don't know. I guess I need a log and start getting into the details of this, because I'd HAVE to start building that up. I just can't imagine.

Its self-resistance, not plugged in (batteries to run heart rate monitor, etc). It's a bike, or stand up elliptical-type, with posts to hold for the hands, or poles to move with resistance, so it's kind of a 4-way machine. Maybe worth it, though finding space would be a challenge (its smaller than most things). Anyway, I unwrapped, and got in the pool for about 40 min. Mostly slow swimming that has about the exertion level of treading water. The drop is steep, and there is a REALLY NARROW area that gets my shoulders underwater and not my head, lol, so slow easy swimming was better. It was mostly just figure-8 type swishing with my arms. Felt GREAT! With all the repeated and overlapping no-swimming rules through surgeries, biopsies, rads, I've only been a few times in a year. Took a shower, put on itch cream at the PT's suggestion (actually she suggested powder but I only found a cream so far, it's an aloe/menthol thing), lotioned up, and rewrapped. It really wasn't too difficult, although I didn't do it as well as they do. Took about a half hour. But being able to shower, swim, gently rub the itchiness, was more than worth it. I have to allow extra time to get dressed in the morning. Nothing from before fits, so I'm trying to put together a new wardrobe and a new look. It's a challenge, lol. But hopefully I can get up an extra half-hour or so early and get in a quick walk.  I must, must, MUST figure out how to exercise and try to recover and hopefully improve on where I was before this started. I was overweight, but I could do stuff, and had a degree of stamina at least. Besides, being in better shape, I might be able to modify some of my old clothes and wear them again (no recon, btw, so that whole thing really is a challenge)",

It's like this is my life, and only so long I'm going to be willing for it to be such a focus.  Getting garments should speed up on wrapping. I'm hoping I'll soon be able to do MLD while watching TV or something. Right now I'm listening to podcasts etc while exercising so getting some extra benefit from it. Trying to streamline other responsibilities as much as possible but so far I'm not very successful. That's all I have figured out so far.",

The whole thing (shoulder to fingertips) seemed to be immobilized by the wrapping. At first I couldn't move anything. She had to help me get dressed, and driving home was a trick. Even getting into the car and getting belted in. I've moved around in it. The sticky covering has rolled up from my forearm to rest above the elbow from flexing my elbow in my sleep I guess. I couldn't get comfortable. My hand hurts on top, between wrist bone and base of little finger. It just aches. Maybe it's the tightness, but I have no way of knowing.  I do know btw that none of you can give me answers about my situation in particular, especially online. I'm just concerned that what I heard from her in general doesn't match well with what I read here. And not to put her down, she's had training, but otoh I am concerned to make sure it was adequate and up to date, etc. I don't find much concern or knowledge about LE among anyone here ... just \"oh, didn't so-and-so get training on that?\" and no one is very concerned.  I think my situation is very mild right now. But I want to improve on that, if possible, and hopefullymake sure it gets no worse. And I'm not sure that will happen if I were to rely only on this person. I also want to make SURE nothing that happens makes it worse. I'll call her about my hand. It does ache quite a bit.

I did get her to show me and explain the how and why to do the wrapping. I did about half of it myself. So my plan is to unwrap once a day, go in the water (I shouldn't say swim, but moving my arms under the water), then shower (im guessing coolish water, def not hot, and rewrap, so that should keep me wrapped close to 23 hours a day. When I asked about MLD, (the assistant can't do it) I was told that since I'll have the LE therapist my next three appts, she will do it each time then, and show me how to do it. I very much want oversight and guidance, but I also want to be able to wrap and massage myself, so we are moving in that direction. The odd thing is, I'm not sure she would be doing it if I didn't ask. I was told that from the surgeon's referral, she didn't know if I would need MLD, so didn't plan on it at first. And TBH, when I asked for the referral (I think 6-7 weeks ago) I had had a few days of heavy feeling of fullness in the backs of my upper arms, but no other symptoms that I'd noticed at that point. My concern was that he was referring me for PT due to lack of mobility, and I wanted someone who was aware of LE issues. The swelling started just after that, so I was put on the therapist's waiting list. Her plan is to wrap (and starting next week, MLD) and measure, and when it is reduced, get compression garments. So I guess my idea of \"improvement\" - lessening of swelling - IS something she is expecting. I'm also interested in range of motion, and eventually some strength and stamina, but I realize these will have to be done carefully. So I'm thinking I may be ok for now in this process, though I'm really not happy that she simply didn't plan on doing MLD. My measurements are slightly increased overall, though by very little (could be difference in measuring). One finger was quite puffy when the wrappings came of, but the finger at the base wasnt swollen, just the part between there and first joint. I'm hoping MLD and movement in the water will help. I also pump my fist pretty regularly, and elevate it as much as I can (which probably adds up to an hour and a half a day).  I have more reading to do.",

I'd looked for some guidelines for LE and didn't find much, so I'll be happy to check into that. And no, the pool bores me too. I wanted to listen to a podcast or something but it was near-drizzly and didn't want to take my phone out. I basically tried to find different ways of moving, resistance, studied the landscape and planned things I might like to do, and tried a dozen mental tricks to keep going. But I did really enjoy the moving and the freedom of not being wrapped. :) Hiking actually sounds like a lot more fun. :)  Today I did nothing. I planned to, but my sleep was very interrupted last night (almost none) and I met my friend again this morning and spent until mid-afternoon with her and another friend. I came home and fell asleep, woke up near midnight. But my wrapping isn't holding (swelling really only in upper arm) and I think it's not helping today. But I kept it elevated the whole time sleeping so when I woke up it was really as good as it gets. I think I must be very early stage if it can improve so easily? (If keeping my arm elevated for 9 hours is easy, lol)  My LE appt is at 10am. I'm going to try to rest a bit more, hopefully finally walk while cool outside, though maybe not far, because I'd also like to get in tomorrow's pool time, shower, and possibly rewrap before going to appt. that's going to require an early start. I'm not even sure the pool is warm enough at 7:30 am. But after the therapist wraps I'd like to keep it on longer than a day.  I'm actually wanting to ask her tomorrow what her goal for reduction is before getting garments. I'm wondering how she set it since there is no measurement pre-swelling. I was actually in really good shape when I went in the first time ... she hasn't even seen it the way it can swell. So I want to make sure we are on the same page  If it's a matter of comparison, well, the other arm swelled a bit the other day. It's rare in that one though. And I honestly don't want both of them wrapped at once. I need to be able to take care of myself",

That's why I wondered if it was reuseable ... if it has to be removed and discarded, I doubt I could afford it. Just gathering info since I suppose I have truncal LE ... not entirely sure if that's accurate, but right now I swell below and especially above my scar, which goes all the way across.  75 minutes in pool. Went to try out the exercise machine and it's perfect - not a ton of resistance so mostly cardio, but hopefully it will be here tomorrow and I can add that.

The video is a bit different from what my CLT does, but I think I'll follow the video except that she said if I used a video NOT to route the lymph to \"the good side\" since I don't have one. And I can't remember if the video includes the deep breathing but she told me to do that, so I will.

She did MLD and showed me how, though I'm not ready to do it myself quite yet. She's going to show me again. Having her teach me wrapping also was better, because the two highlighted different things. And I think we are probably about ready to order garments soon, since we began with near-best-case in my arms (I had rest/elevated them a lot for several days before my first appt.  The real surprise is something I didn't understand, but had seen, and she knew immediately when she saw it. My biggest problem is really adhesions of the scar. I get swelling above it, and it is TIGHT. So she showed me how to massage the scar. And when she had done the MLD my shoulder was MUCH better, less swollen and softer. I don't know if breaking the adhesions will mean my arms won't swell anymore. But anyway, I have a way to move forward. I'm really, REALLY not wanting to have to wear compression on my trunk. But seeing a drastic improvement rapidly from the MLD is encouraging. I'm also down some from the wrapping, at one point she took the measurement several times because she couldn't believe it was down that much. It also explains the swelling I KNEW I was seeing in my upper abdomen. My belly has actually shrunk a little, but my surgeon thought it was just comparison with my bellyfrom not having breasts anymore. Only 20 minutes in the pool today. I overslept and had to make an extra stop before my appt, and didn't want to be late. My LE therapist supports me exercising, few restrictions (avoid overly repetitious movements, no heavy weights) but she is of the mind to monitor carefully, find what I can and can't do, and avoid anything that aggravates it. I'm REALLY interested in upping my exercise though!  Overall I'm so much more pleased with how things are going. We really didn't communicate well at first, and I think maybe she thought I was grabbing all sorts of random silliness online.",

I can't find info though - is it washable and reusable, or meant for single use? I don't know if it has the right elastic properties for the rest of us. I do notice they say it is used because of lymph accumulation, but their site says it LIFTS the skin to allow lymph to flow, rather than compresses. Which makes a certain intuitive sense, but depends on a healthy lymphatic system? I'm guessing? Anyway, I certainly do love the idea that it seems to be not needing other layers, can be worm comfortably for days, can get wet, and so on. I'm just curious if it's washable. Don't worry, everyone, I'm too new at this and too early in the process to take off and do anything different from what my CLT advises. But this stuff sounds like it's worth knowing about. Especially since I don't know what's going to happen with the swelling across my chest, above the scar, and I'm sure now it's not in my mind that I get lower truncal swelling that comes and goes ... perhaps that's part of the lymphatic clearing, from what the CLT described to me as the overall process.  This whole cancer thing has made me feel like I need to know everything in order to make good decisions. I've had some excellent physicians, and some that would have made disastrous choices for me if I'd allowed it. It reminds me of when I had a legal situation and trusted my attorney, with terrible outcome. We need the expertise of professionals, but at the same time, we have to know a very great deal to evaluate and either accept or reject their guidance. But I admit, lymphedema is the topic I come to it knowing the least about.   And no walking AGAIN this morning. It's raining. But I'm going to a second-hand shop to look at a piece of exercise equipment I was shown. She's offered it to me very affordably, and it will fit in the air conditioned area of my home. Sort of a bike/elliptical stepper, with or without arm involvement. I think the pool is wearing me out every day but I want to add something not dependent on weather/time of day",

Scar is developing a ropey appearance above the skin where it was flat before. I have been massaging along and across as they advised to break adhesions.  I didn't think of not wearing it for too long. I got all approval from them, and actually cancelled my next appt, got more exercises. I'm going back in a few weeks but 2X a week not really necessary anymore.  Still wasn't bad really wearing sleeve. More comfortable 2nd day. The gauntlet seemed to be hurting my hand, so I took it off a couple hours before sleeve. It didn't swell my hand much. My fingers were a tiny bit swollen (2 up, 3 down) at appt. but then my fingers have always reacted a lot to many things pre-LE so I want to keep an eye on them of course, but it could even be unrelated.  I think it's going to go well. :) Got in a bit of walking today. I need to work out a good schedule and get more exercise but it may have to come in stages. The time/distance monitor on my exercise thing isn't working, but my phone will keep up with how far I walk outside. It's just so hot so early and I know my arm swells in heat so I'll have to see how things go. But I'll do SOMEthing(s)",

I was given a pair of shoes that are perfect for me but they don't make them anymore and mine are wearing out so it's been on my mind.  Not doing great with LE stuff. I have a few chickens and baby chicks and many of the chicks got sick a few days ago. It was pretty intense figuring out what was wrong with them (treating the wrong thing at first), treating them, etc. and I'm coming down with something myself. Decreased exercise means insomnia - almost no sleep for me for days, and lack of sleep usually drops my immunity.  On the plus side my PT has moved to mobility exercises. She said I'm slightly improved since my first visit (maybe the exercise and probably scar massage has helped) and now I'm getting to work on improving.  As far as weight I have major trouble losing. I don't eat much anyway (maybe need to actually eat more) and my weight is stubborn about not moving. But getting used to exercise, then reducing it, even without eating much, and I can gain a pound plus in a week. I really want to drop a significant amount though if I can manage it so I tend to think long-term about that. I'm still dealing with swelling, and I think I've lost and gained muscle, so again I'm just trying to think long-term.  It's encouraging though hearing about your routines. :)  Hugz, I hope you get past that plateau soon!  Minus, sorry to hear about upcoming surgery restrictions. I hated that ... they made me stay out of water for three surgeries, radiation, several biopsies, etc. so I had most of a year with no pool allowed. I think my surgeon might have let me in too soon after my BMX but I didn't argue. ;) I hope your surgery goes well and heals quickly!",

Sick chicks keeping me busy, now I'm getting sick, and I was foolish and wanted to act for a few days like nothing is wrong with me since I'm feeling pretty good compared to the last year. And they have given me a lot of exercise from PT - mobility exercises, strength exercises, and \"lymphedema exercises\" which my therapist doesn't like to call them that, I think, since they won't get rid of lymphedema. I'm falling behind my goals of keeping up with life, house, exercise, wrapping, and putting out those \"little fires\" of things I MUST do.  And I'm finding that skimping on exercise is not a good thing. I don't sleep as well, so I'm tired and can't do as much, and I GAIN weight even though I barely eat. I'm sure I'll get things sorted out, though.  It's great hearing what you all are doing. And how well things are going. And bread sounds wonderful (though I rarely eat it anymore). When I was doing my exercises at PT, I asked if I'd be able to make bread (knead dough) again anytime soon. She reminded me that my hand is wrapped. Oh well ... I also have a stack of hand-washable that need doing, but I can't get the wrapping wet, and I can't do it with one hand.  Still a learning curve. :)  You'll be in my thoughts, 2Fun. Looking forward to hearing from you after your surgery. :)",

Getting cut around to the back is no fun. :(  I think the starvation mode can be a real issue. At one point, I wasn't much interested in food and ate between 350-700 cal a day, but did not lose any weight. Got frustrated with docs telling me I need to diet. Scale seems to stick, not gain or lose, no matter what I do (unless I try for a while, then I will gain a pound or two when I stop trying!). Nurse pulled me aside and said maybe I'm not eating enough - I managed to lose some after that by eating more, but the whole cancer thing has interrupted all of that. I need to start again. I'd like to lose before having any revision surgery. But I typically eat one or 1-1/2 meals a day (900-1000 cal total per day. I do like sweet tea though",

Now that the color is returning to more normal, I see a scratch in the skin (not breaking it, just a light colored line) with one tiny point broken through in the middle of it. Right in the center of where the rash was/is. I don't know what caused it, my cat accidentally having a claw out? Brushing past a thorny weed? Sharp edge on a drawer?

But I didn't mean diets don't work, exactly. I mean that my normal eating is less than most diets, and I'm still fat. I followed my doctor's diet plan for a few weeks, but it was more food than I'm used to. I'd be stuffed and still have several hundred calories under the amount. She told me not to eat less, but the only way I could easily reach 1000-1200 calories was to add a soda or candy, and I know full well that's not what she had in mind.  I don't get enough exercise. I used to have a situation where I was active all day, and now that I don't, I'm sitting too much. But my knee is giving me trouble (arthritis) but I have had physical therapy and it IS improving, so I have some hope. I could use a good non-impact workout, probably.  I have tried to change what I eat, which lowers the calories even more (that may not be a good thing - a few years ago under a nurse's advice I was able to lose about 5-7 pounds by eating more frequently, but I didn't keep it up. I normally really eat 1-2 times a day.  I'm hoping high protein and cutting carbs and exercise, and probably eating more often, will be the right combination. I don't normally limit carbs on purpose, but frankly I don't eat much of them anyway. I used to, but now I get much less anyway. (I used to be a bread-aholic but now I get it maybe a few times a week.)  I do love sugar though. Or kind of. I like chocolate with nuts. And sugar in my tea. But I drink mostly water. Still, probably more water and a regular sleep cycle would help too. My sleep has been awful since all this started.  Again, just rambling. But it's good for me to think there are things I can do, and your post had lots of good suggestions. I do need to drag myself into some kind of exercise especially",

I'm in treatment for lymphedema now, mostly one upper arm/shoulder, somewhat the other arm, and also my trunk. My incision started on my back, went completely across the front, and onto the back on the other side. I have swelling that varies usually above but sometimes below the scar line. My surgeon thought at first that I was imagining it and that my belly seems larger to me because I don't have breasts now. But my belly is actually smaller than it was - however I do have swelling that comes and goes in my trunk and abdomen. The lymphedema therapist found it was caused by adhesions long the scar line I just wanted to update this in case anyone reads it later, having similar question.it might be worth having a lymphedema therapist have a look in case of swelling.",

I looked up those poses, and I can't do either because of limitations with my knee, but surely I can find other core-strengthening exercises. There was a modified squat my PT had me doing that is probably good too. That's a good point though, to be more ready to have the lower body do what I need without my arms. I'm probably actually going to be alone mostly after surgery, so ... I need to be as strong as I can, and set things up as well as I can. I have had two surgeries already, though I realize this will be a lot worse. :( At least I have some idea of general stuff to do to prepare (need to re-stock my freezer meals - I have leftovers that I didn't care for, but the good recipes I should make lots of). I saved my \"after surgery\" clothes which are mostly very large t-shirts cut down the front with tie added, and soft scrubs that open in the front. The scrubs have pockets inside, so that might help with drains - not sure yet.  And I don't need \"comfort food\" probably - I'm just as happy with healthier stuff, but I may sneak in some dark chocolate covered almonds - my husband gave me a bag after the first surgery because it was about the time of our anniversary.  I'm still not entirely sure what I'm going to wear post surgery. I guess if I get a soft bra and something to go in it, I can wear some of my regular clothes. I do have this one swing-type top, very long and loose below, and I put it on and squashed my breasts - I think it will look much better WITHOUT breasts than with, and it's detailed and flows well. The only problem is that it's sleeveless, and my upper arms - ugh. I just might start exercising them too, see if I can make them better. I don't have to look like a 20-year-old-model - just a LITTLE better would make me less self-conscious. I think arms are key to a lot of what I want to wear, and I was going in very short sleeves before all this started. The last year has just made my arms go to pot.  Thanks again I'm afraid I'm still just trying to wrap my brain around everything. I'm getting closer though. ",

I'm trying desperately to clear up another skin issue before surgery, because not showering will cause problems with that one, but I saw a dermatologist and it's doing better.  I have a large kitchen sink with a spray nozzle on a high arced faucet, so I think washing my hair in the kitchen sink would be relatively easy. My hair is fine as long as I wash it 2-3 times a week.

I know I need to get busy cooking meals. I had a partial mastectomy with SNB last year, and a second surgery (no clear margin) and I remember how hard it was to get up having one arm restricted. I had cording from the SNB so that arm was useless, but I could use my left. I just heard from an old friend who wants to come stay with me, if she is able, after the surgery. That would be a lifesaver. But it's still very much unsure. I can get someone with me a few hours here and there, but otherwise, I'm not sure. I'm supposed to be in hospital one night only (I guess assuming things go well). I'm not sure if something else can be arranged or not, but thank you for letting me know so I can start asking. I really want to get back home ASAP, but on the other hand, I hadn't thought about falling. Thank goodness ... I have intermittent dizzy spells that come and go (inner ear thing, not really a problem in itself) and it's just about cleared up from having it for some months again. I'd better let them know that too, just in case.  I'm glad I have several weeks more to prepare. It still seems overwhelming!

      "Content": "Mar 21, 2017 03:53PM - edited Mar 21, 2017 03:55PM by itfinallyhitme I should be fair to my husband in this.  Yes, he has said things that were not very kind. But to tell you the truth, I think he lacks certain filters, or something? We are from different cultures. He may just not understand what his words are doing. I did tell him very directly that commenting on another woman jiggling was out of line and I was having mine CUT OFF and didn't need to hear it! I think it was a joke (based on something else we had joked about) but he turned it to the wrong thing and took it too far. But I do also worry about the stress on him handling all of this. To be honest, I kind of need him to stick around, in several ways!  But he is NOT pressuring me to have a reconstruction. He said it's totally up to me, and he's more worried about additional surgery risks and what I'd have to go through. I think for those reasons, he'd actually prefer that I don't, but he won't say so because he says it's my decision. I'm just getting inside his head (or trying to) when I say it's more for him. It's really more how I feel with him, or what I think he thinks, if that makes sense.  But I'm really not sure that little slice of \"reason to do it\" is worth all of what I'd have to go through, and the physical effects I can expect to deal with. At the end of the day, I'm more concerned with my long-term function and comfort than I am with my appearance.  And to be honest, I guess I'm still talking my way through this. For a little while I thought I could have small round breasts, maybe tattoo over the scars, and I liked the thought. But I haven't even been able to talk to a doctor (other than my surgeon yesterday for a few minutes) about the effects of going through and living with a recon and possible side effects. I've gotten that mostly of browsing this forum, and from my imagination thinking about the procedure. So my expectations may be unrealistic, but I am having a hard time knowing what to expect.  But any potential need for more surgeries, failure of a device or surgery, long term lack of strength or mobility, ongoing discomfort - these are kind of in the \"worse than being flat chested\" category for me. I think.  I guess I'll know better when I see the final results, after things get to a final result, and when I've lived with them for a while. I was pretty horrified when I saw the shape left by the first surgery, and if I wear a t-shirt or anything that doesn't float away from me, it looks like a have one round boob and a smaller angled ridge on the other side. People have probably noticed, but I try to cover it up and then I go out and don't worry about it. But then again, I never wear form-fitting.  I'm going to miss my v-necks, and princess-style necklines. The only styles that used to flatter me won't anymore. I wish I could lose weight. I'm going to try again, with macros and exercise. My thyroid is stable now. If I could be at least halfway \"in shape\" compared to where I am now, I think I would feel a lot better about the whole thing.  I guess I'm still talking my way through this. You ladies are very kind to listen! Somehow having to put it into words helps me see what I really think and feel.  And I'd better get busy freezing some meals and trying to get everything done around the house that I won't want to look at un-done after surgery. That kind of stuff drives me crazy! I'm also trying to make a nice place to sit on the back porch and be surrounded by my plants and flowers, in case it's not too hot by then. :",

They say a higher waist, empire, or no waist is better Avoid v and sweetheart necklines (my favorites) ... wide shallow scoop or boat are supposed to be better Long hemlines on shirts, asymmetrical, flowing. A-line type outlines are supposed to be good. Sleeves flowing, loose. Maybe dolman or poet or gypsy. Or sleeveless, with maybe a close-fitting 3/4 sleeve t-shirt below. Large patterns, drapes. They say solid colors can give away the lack of shadow below breasts that aren't there. Scarfs, pleats, details, lace, embellishments. Earrings or dramatic necklaces (not too long/low). Makeup. Cardigans or vests (layering), scarves, etc. tunics  That's what I've put together so far. I searched images of the things mentioned here - boho, caftans, cardigans, tunics, and sometimes I add search terms plus size or mastectomy, and look for the kinds of things I listed above. I'm gathering images, and starting a Pinterest board with comments, since most have this part right but that part needs modifying.  I doubt I can buy a new wardrobe (though 2-3 shirts would really be nice, some are so pricey though!), but maybe I can look for patterns or learn ways to modify thriftier clothing. It's a starting place. I think it's not going to be easy right after surgery, but at least I have a direction to move toward.  I have a feeling I'm going to need to get much more comfortable with my sewing machine.",

My surgeon says I'm going to have \"side boobs\" still (he said I'm lying on the table so he won't go that far back) and I guess that's a plastic surgery thing.  I normally wear yoga pants, t-shirts, etc. a lot, I don't dress up at home. I guess mentally I'm trying to deal with this. I suddenly WANT to dress more feminine. I do have blouses and skirts for Sunday, and I often throw those back on during the week. But unless I wear something fake in there, I don't think those are going to look right.  Maybe it's just a sudden self-esteem hit. I really don't know why I'm thinking this way, but I am. I don't think it's so much about how other people (at least strangers in public) see me, now that I think more about it. It's strange for me to worry about their opinion. But maybe I want to wear something pretty for ME. I think it's really me that has the problem with losing the breasts.  Never thought I'd react this way, especially almost a year into this thing. I cried for a few minutes when I got the disagnosis - maybe shock. But I've really done pretty well through two surgeries and radiation, follow up biopsies, all that. Now I'm upset because I want pretty shirts? I feel like I must be losing my mind (or at least my perspective) but that's how I feel.  I hope I can get back to doing stuff soon. My gardening and activities suffered last year. I don't want to lose this year too.  And 2-3 weeks or more without a shower is not making me happy right now. My skin has issues if I don't shower. At least losing the breasts entirely should help. The lumpectomy side (actually more like a partial mastectomy - he removed half the breast) is doing better on that count.  Thanks for letting me rant a little. I guess I need to process this.",

I don't like having to make decisions based on what I can research online, but then again, I've found doctors can give opposite information/advice and aren't always right.  I didn't know rads would mean implants were a problem, but I don't like the thought that they will almost certainly require replacement, and I don't like the sound of them going under chest muscle.  Otoh, I did read about some of the flap surgeries. Looking like I've had a \"tuck\" AND having boobs again both sound good, but when I saw how long the surgery takes, I became concerned. I guess I'm not that old, but yes, I'm overweight, and I for one just don't like that thought. I don't know about the real risk of tissue necrosis or somehow otherwise \"failing to take\" and what the effects might be on cut muscles or other tissues. It starts to sound like too much risk for the potential benefit.  I think - I THINK it's mainly for my husband's opinion that I'd want to have \"breasts\" again surgically. As for me, I THINK that I just want to feel good (or at least accepting) of how I look in clothes. You all are making me feel better in general. Maybe I can figure this out and do this.  I don't like how I've had to make the decisions. It feels like there should be \"an answer\" you know? They're not even sure exactly what's going on inside, and my decision to remove the one where I've already had it partly removed is mostly prophylactic, but images don't give an accurate indication on me, and I'm not willing to always wonder if I have cancer, or continually keep getting biopsies, in which I HOPE they catch it. (They didn't think I had a tumor on the one breast until I had surgery.)  I guess I'm hoping I'll get through this, and find a way to be ok with it, and then I really don't want any more surgery.  My surgeon did tell me that I wasn't without options for reconstruction down the road even if he doesn't leave any skin, so that made me feel less backed into a corner",
