    "Content": "Amerimex wrote: Originally gyno was able to show me 2 cysts on the screen. Mammo and Ultrasound show nothing 2 days later. Went back to OBGYN and now she cant find the original cysts, but OBGYN can feel it and sends me to breast surgeon (of course have to wait a month-and people complain about Canada?) Pain and size comes and goes with menstrual cycle, but pistachio size lump does not go away completely. Will see nurse practitioner in a week. Smushy lump and movable. Have dense tissue.
