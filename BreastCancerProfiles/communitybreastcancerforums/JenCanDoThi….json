      "Content": "Dec 7, 2018 11:45AM - edited Dec 7, 2018 11:46AM by JenCanDoThis My ultrasound report sounded very similar other than the angular margins. I just had my biopsy yesterday and am awaiting results. Appointment with breast specialist on the 13th to get the results per my OBGYN who is a BC survivor since 2009. I'm 44 and have dense breasts. Somehow I have managed to NOT Google things and I think that has helped to keep me centered. I've been mostly lurking on here and have learned a lot. This seems to be a great place to get info and support. I've been surprised at the number of long term survivors. I really was very unaware of that and that has been helpful for me in staying positive. Djmammo is a wealth of knowledge. The biopsy went fine for me, FYI. I really liked the radiologist. There was quite a bit of pressure but no pain and only minimal bruising and no soreness afterwards. If you are well endowed, I suggest wearing a bra for 24 or so hours after the biopsy - even overnight. I think that helped minimize my soreness. For me they took 3 core biopsy samples - skipping the fine needle part altogether. Depending on the radiologist, he/she might give you some feedback right during the process. Best wishes.",

      "Content": "Dec 7, 2018 12:04PM - edited Dec 7, 2018 12:05PM by JenCanDoThis Thank you and you're welcome. I will check back in with you as well. One thing I've definitely learned is it's very treatable if we are positive and there are lots of funky sounding words that might be \"bad\" but I think some of the time (a lot of the time), even some of the \"bad\" words can be related to benign conditions. I'm kind of in the \"it is what it is\" phase. I am glad that I will get results from a face to face with a specialist. Even if my results are benign, I plan to be a bit more aggressive in screening from now on and I'm already learning about diet changes from the wonderful people on here! I plan to encourage all of my friends to get yearly mammograms no matter what. The 3D imaging seems to be maybe resulting in some unnecessary biopsies but I'd rather be on the safe side. Take care and try to enjoy your weekend.",
