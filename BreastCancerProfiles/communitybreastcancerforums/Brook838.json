Sometimes I feel as if they are waiting for me to leave the room so they can talk freely. Happened last night with my parents and husband. Now I KNOW this all comes from a place of caring and concern, but it still gets under my skin and I can't help but try to overhear what they are saying. I need to let it go and recognize that this phenomenon is just another \"side effect\" that I have to deal with. Just curious how others handle it though...
