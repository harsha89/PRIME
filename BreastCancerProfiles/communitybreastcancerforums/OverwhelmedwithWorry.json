Received the dreaded call back and been on the ledge since. Currently on anxiety medication to try and relax. Returned for additional images via Diagnostic Mammo and Ultrasound. Same spot was confirmed. Radiologist noted how anxious I was and spoke to me a little. Although nothing is 100% without a biopsy, he seemed confident that it appears benign relatively similar to a Fibroadenoma. Rather than watching he decided it would be best for me to just have the biopsy over and done with to which he noted on his report. I went for my biopsy this morning and couldn't contain myself. The spot remained the same. 5 samples were taken and a marker was placed. The nodule appears smooth. Now the waiting begins. I have barely ate or slept in 3 weeks. Super emotional as well. I'm hoping others with similar stories can offer their experience. Bi-Rad 4 given however which scared me further. As I read other reports mine seems like there are no details included like others. Attempted to attach report but it said I couldn\u2019t. Has anyone ever had a benign lump form deep in the breast and only found after an u Log in to post a reply",

First I must say thanks for all the support and blessings to all I recently received my results from my CNB which read benign and concordant after the diagnosis of \u201cFibroadenoma with myxoid features\u201d. I\u2019m to follow up in 6 months to see if anything changes. 4 samples were taken. At first I must admit I was elated and relieved but here I am a week later scared again. After reading so many horror stories I\u2019m wondering if the biopsy is correct and/or effective. My anxiety has been through the roof today. 1. What is myxoid features 2. The fact that I\u2019m 41 and this is less common scares me further. This was my first Mammo/Us so I don\u2019t know if this is something that has been there for years. 3. Are CNB\u2019s effective My PCP has scheduled me to see the breast surgeon since the result did little to keep me calm Anyone who can relate please share your thoughts Log in to post a reply",
