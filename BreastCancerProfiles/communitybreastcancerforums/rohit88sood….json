My mother was diagnosed with Metastatic Breast cancer which has spread into her Liver and Bones. Through recent Chemo sessions her Bone mets have reduced drastically but Liver mets have shown no improvement. Her Chemo had additional drug Perjeta, which initially along with Chemo showed results but when was given individually had no result. Now the doc has suggested to start with Kadcyla. She had her first infusion of Kadcyla last week ( 7 Dec 18), but due to so called known side effect she is not keeping well. She is experiencing nausea, head ache, body ache, loss in appetite and constipation. I was reading though the side effects and one of the major one is that it impacts the liver functionality. Since she has Liver mets, will the drug Kadcyla be effective for her or will deteriorate her liver to more worse. Your views would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance. Rohit Sood",
