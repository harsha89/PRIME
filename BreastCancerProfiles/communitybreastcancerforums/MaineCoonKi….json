The best thing of all...being able to sleep on my stomach for the first time in years!  I really like being almost flat-chested and have no desire to do any recon at all.  No more blouses gaping at the buttons, no more sweaty, chaffing bras in the summer, no more lugging around huge hooters. You have to do what's best for you, but I LOVE being nearly flat chested.",

One thing that I can advise you from my own experience - don't sacrifice your life and your future peace of mind for a mere breast.  If your doctor is advising a mastectomy, then do it.  It may seem devastating at your age to lose a breast, but breasts are easily replaceable with reconstruction or very realistic fake boobs - or \"foobs\".    Your life, your future health, and your peace of mind are not.  Phyllodes is a different animal altogether from other types of breast tumors, benign and malignant with a higher rate of recurrence that does not respond well to either chemo or radiation.  I'm not trying to scare you, but you need the facts from women who have walked in your shoes to make an informed decision.  As one of those women, my best advice is to find a doctor you're comfortable with who has experience specifically with phyllodes tumors and follow his/her recommendations.  Come over to the Phyllodes section of the Rare Cancer Alliance Support Group and the women there will be glad to share their experiences and knowledge with you.  Many of them have done extensive research on their own and know more about the subject than a lot of doctors!",

It's scary...I know.  I have a very rare form of bc - phyllodes tumor.  It's so rare that there is not much good recent data about how to treat it beyond mastectomy.  In the past, that was considered the only treatment.  But because my Onco team is very progressive and think outside the box, they presented my case to the local tumor board, as well as getting direction from a world-class expert in phyllodes from the Mayo Clinic. In preparation for that review, they did a new review of the available literature of this kind of cancer.  Guess what?  They found a new study from Europe that it is now thought that this kind of cancer could respond to chemo and radiation in a similar fashion to a form of sarcoma used in a clinical trial, since it is closely related to sarcoma.  So because of my score of 27, they offered the option to me of  6 rounds of Taxotere and Gemzar, followed by 4 weeks of daily radiation.  Now I have no lymph node involvement or evidence of disease anywhere else at the moment, so most women would say no chemo and no radiation because there's no real research that proves it will be of benefit to me at all.  But here's the thing......every new protocol of standard treatment had to start with that one person who some radical experimental treatment actually worked for, even though there was no proof it would. If I were in your shoes (and I am...kinda), at your age, I would hit this beast with everything I could and keep hitting it until it cried \"uncle!\"  My rationale for doing it is that even if it does nothing and my cancer recurrs somewhere down the road, I want to be have peace of mind that I did everything possible to fight it.  And if it keeps me cancer free for the rest of my life, then I'll know the 6 months of discomfort and the loss of a little bit of hair was worth it.",

I have heard very good things about the success with Gemzar.  This is my first go-around with chemo, but I had a very rare type of BC that is not known to respond well to chemo - phyllodes tumor.  My onc team is using me as a guinea pig in treating phyllodes with chemo and rads, since I had such a large tumor that grew very quickly.  She choose Gemzar because of the good things she is seeing in using it to treat other types of cancer.

Sometime in the next couple of weeks, I'll have a skin graft to close it completely. Despite all that, what surprised me most was how much better I felt the minute I woke up from surgery with that monstrosity gone.  I felt wonderful - no nausea, no vomiting, no pain, no fog at all - from the moment I woke up in the recovery room.  I could put my arm above my head right away and by 4 hrs after my surgery, was up and walking the halls of the hospital with my IV pole and vac pump in tow.  The most uncomfortable part for me were the dressing changes because of the open wound site and the spongy dressing, covered by a plastic film that seals the vacuum over the wound.  The dressing actually debrides the wound and when it is pulled off, it pulls the top layer of the new tissue with it on purpose, to stimulate new collagen to form and seal off the wound.  Yow!  But even that pain was controlled with meds and the dressing is only changed 3 times a week.  Ladies....don't be afraid of the mastectomy.  I think it's actually less painful than many lumpectomies because all the tissue and nerves are removed.  Compared to a hysterectomy due to large fibroids that left me a scar that runs from my pubic bone to up above my navel, the mastectomy was a piece of cake!  You'll be fine and just like me, I bet you won't miss the girl or girls anymore than I do!  After being a DD cup for years, then dealing with the \" Mongo Boob from Hell\" for several months, it's a refreshing RELIEF to go braless or just wear a stretchy sports bra and be able to sleep comfortably. ",

I was a little afraid of the port install after seeing the problems that so many of you have had with it, but it was truly very tolerable and will prove to be a blessing in the long run when my chemo starts.  No more digging around for a \"good\" vein for me, just plug the little sucker in and let's roll!  Honestly...a couple days of soreness was very doable.  I might be one of the luckier ones with so little pain, but I've had more painful dental appointments than this latest round of surgery. Have faith, ladies...it's not bad and you've already proven that you're a tough bunch just by making the decision to fight this monster with everything you have. Rock on, BC sistahs!",

She is my \"team\" leader who coordinates every facet of my treatmentwith the other dr's.  My team consists of my breast surgeon, plastic surgeon, oncologist, radiation oncologist, endocrinologist, and GP.  I love the team concept and it's been wonderful having someone like my breast surgeon running interference for me and I always feel like she's my advocate when it come to getting appointments scheduled and tests run.  When I was having port problems, she was the one who the oncology nurses called for help (my port line became kinked when they got over-zealous pushing hard trying to access it and my chest muscles underneath it swelled). It was also much easier and less stressful for me to get referred to the other specialists that she had worked with in the past because I trust her judgement and knew she would refer me to the very best other doctors.  And she did.......I love my entire team and trust their judgement, knowing that they are all looking out for my best interests and checking and re-checking each others' work constantly.  That makes me feel very confident that I'm getting expert care from many experts who work together like clockwork.",
