I am postmenopausal and was initially diagnosed with multifocal DCIS in my left breast. A mastectomy was recommended. Since I already had fibrocystic disease and microcalcifications on the right, I opted for a bilateral and choose reconstruction with TE. The final path report showed 1.5 and 1.4 cm of DCIS and \"rare foci of microinvasion, none of which measure more than 1 mm.\" I'm Er+ and Pr-; no evidence of lymphovascular invasion; SNB was clear. Margins were .7 cm for the microinvasion and .5cm for the DCIS. How does this microinvasion change things from pure DCIS as far as chance of recurrance or distant recurrance? I read on another site that it would be unusual for an ONCOTYPE to be done on less that 1mm of microinvasion and nothing was shown on HER. I wonder if I should ask for these to be done. My onco said no chemo or radiation but I could take Tamoxifen and then Arimidex if I wanted. I think I would have felt better if she had been more adamant about treatment. Anyone have experience here? Many thanks! Jan Jan - DCIS 1.5 cm w/microinvasion BMX 03/03/10 w TE, exchange 09/01/10 Log in to post a reply",

Like you I seem to keep searching for more information about the microinvasion.  Just not satisfied yet. My doctors are 4 hours away so I am going to try to see an oncologist here for another opinion. On the Ask an Expert on the John Hopkins site I found a post that addressed DCIS with <1mm invasion. It was reassuring for me but I'm still asking questions! http://www.hopkinsbreastcenter.org/services/ask_expert/viewquestions.asp?id=999805220 Thanks for keeping me in the loop. I will also let you know if I find anything else. Good thoughts and wishes coming your way!",

If it's not ER+, Tamoxifen would not be effective.  I do remember reading Beesie's post about her decision not to take Tamoxifen. I'll reread that; she is amazing. Thanks again. I hope you are doing well! Jan",

Like you I was familiar with what the procedure involved but was unsure of how I would respond. I cry very easily, too. When I checked in for the procedure they gave me a valium which helped a lot. It was unfortunately a very painful procedure for me and yes I did cry. BUT a very compassionate nurse saw my tears, patted my head and wiped those tears... several times. That is what I remember most...her sweet gesture. I will be thinking of you tomorrow and wishing you the very best.  Jan",

As soon as output drops to a certain level (under 20 ml for me) the surgeon will remove them. I had bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction in March and only had 1 drain on each side. One was removed in a weeks time and the other a week later. I didn't find them to be terribly bothersome, however as I said I only had one on each side and they were not in very long. I did really well with my surgery and actually went shopping for a few things within the first week. I hope everything goes well for you!",
