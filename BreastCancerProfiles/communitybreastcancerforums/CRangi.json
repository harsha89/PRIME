I have an ultrasound today. Im so scared as I have googled puns found lots on this being a sign of ductual breast cancer. I have a seven and five year old with another bub on the way. Im so scared of not being there while the young grow up. Anyone know of this happening during pregnancy Log in to post a reply",
