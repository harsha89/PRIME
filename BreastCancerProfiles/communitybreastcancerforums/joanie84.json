      "Content": "joanie84 wrote: I had a bilateral digital diagnostic mammography last Thursday after my annual screening came back as incomplete. According to the report from the radiologist my right breast shows Pleomorphic calcifications spanning 2.5 cm Area and a BiRad 4. 4 years ago I had a core biopsy on my right breast that was benign. The current calcifications are not in the same area as the previous biopsy. My breast are also considered dense and are a DD. I am 43 years old, with three children. I breastfed them all to about a year old. My maternal grandmother had breast cancer in her 40's, my mother had breast cancer when she was 65 and my sister had DCIS at the age of 46. My sister had the BRCA test and it was negative. I have been reassured by the radiologist as well as my breast surgeon's PA that the odds are this is benign and worse case scenario it is very early stages. I just can't help but be a bit worried. Having two biopsies in the same breast in the span of 4 years when I am still in my early 40's just seems daunting.
