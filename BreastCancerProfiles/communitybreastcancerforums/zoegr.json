At the beginning the doctors were thinking of lumpectomy and radiation but since there are two suspicious areas in the same breast they told me that with mastectomy i would be more safe and i wouldn't have any problem in the future. Also with mastectomy i would have a better cosmetic result than with lumpectomy. My operation will be December 12. As soon as you get home from hospital, please send me a message how things went. I forgot to tell you that i will have a 2 cm lift in my good breast in order to have symmetry.Â  I'm waiting for your news.",

My plastic surgeon measured my breasts before surgery and told me that the left was a little bit bigger than the right. Besides i was told that it's more difficult to reconstruct after lumpectomy (of course depends on the area that has to be removed) and especially after radiation which makes skin not very elastic. I decided single mastectomy for the following reasons: - I want to have feeling of at least one breast - I saw the breast of a friend who had lumpectomy and radiation (not very good cosmetic result) - I will not have to worry anymore that another lump will appear in my bad breast anymore (my surgeon told me exactly this to convince me for mastectomy: It's a bad breast and we don't want it. At least there is something positive after all: I will have a breast lift and my insurance covers it!!!",

I search the internet about all the different procedures and i change opinion every 5 minutes. Next week i will meet a plasti'c surgeon and ask him all these questions about how symmetrical my breast will be after. I have seen some pics where they have mastectomy and reconstruction to one breast but also a lift to the other breast and the look pretty good. Check this pic: http://www.realself.com/all/before-and-after-photos/Hisham-Seify,-MD,-PhD I would really like to be in touch with you.",
