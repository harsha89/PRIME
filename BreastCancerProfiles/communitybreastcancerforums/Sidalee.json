Fingers crossed that it doesn't get worse. Good luck to everyone this week, at least we can check these daily treatments off pretty fast!",

For me, rads has been a lot easier than chemo physically and tougher mentally and emotionally. We're here for you. Palesa, RiRi, or anybody else that is done--what is the follow-up schedule with your RO after tx is complete? Do you go back for weekly checks or are you just supposed to call if you need something? Anyone using Mepitel--will you just let it fall off or will you continue trimming and replacing for a week or two?",

Spoonie, still thinking about you girl, have you called your RO to have them take a look? I am so sorry this has been so tough for you. I finished rads on Friday and I rang the bell while my doctor and techs clapped for me. Yesterday was my first Monday that I didn't have to go, what a great feeling. I'm still really tired despite walking at least 30 mins x 6 days per week the whole time I was receiving tx. I am pretty red around the edges of the rads field especially on and just above my collarbone, but overall my skin is doing really well. I am still wearing the Mepitel Film for now. My RO told me I could take it off anytime, but I can see the little red dots on the skin underneath and it seems logical to just leave it on for now. I'll probably just let it peel off mostly on it's own and just cut away the excess. My throat still hurts if I try to swallow anything very dry or too big of a bite. I will see my RO for a follow-up in about 4 weeks. Hang in there everybody, please keep us posted on your progress!",

She said they are utilizing IMRT mapping to cover my entire chest wall, breast and nodes with a smooth layer of radiation beams that come from all different directions so that damage to healthy tissue (and my heart and lungs) is minimal. Unfortunately, that leads to some \"scatter\" hitting the back of my throat and aggravating my esophagus. She recommended soft, slippery foods and magic mouthwash to help as it will probably get a little worse before it gets better. She said my thyroid is one of the structures they calibrated the machine to avoid. Spoonie~sorry you are having so much pain. I'm sore all over the left side of my chest now and visibly swollen after each tx. Still praying for expander to survive this! I take ibuprofen about an hour before tx most days now and it seems to help some with the swelling and pain. I think I'm going to work from home as much as possible this week. I am so tired and my work environment is stressing me out. Congratulations Palesa! Please keep us posted on how your recovery goes!",

I too have been very emotional about radiation and I'm not sure why it is upsetting me so much more psychologically than chemo and my BMX did, but it is. I had my first treatment on Monday and I was done in 20 minutes. Yesterday I felt like I was doing the exact same breath hold as the day before, but they said I wasn't going deep enough so it ended up taking 40 minutes and the techs seemed a little grumpy about it. I hope I'm going to have better luck today. I am wearing Mepitel Film over as much of the radiated area as possible, there are studies that indicate much less skin damage and zero desquamation with this wound covering in-place. I'm hoping for the best for both my skin and my tissue expander, but it's too early to tell. Glad to have this board and happy to share and support you all as we go through another treatment.",

The discomfort in my throat is completely freaking me out, nobody told me that would happen. Does this mean the radiation is hitting my neck? I'm so worried that my thyroid will get fried!

Frog~ my mastectomy was skin-sparing so I don't have nipples at the moment, but I did insist that the techs place a strip of Mepitel across my scar. I have the covering on just about the entire area, but it has peeled away from my shoulder quite a bit and is lifting in the center of my chest a little. They also said it won't adhere to my armpit so I guess that will probably be my problem area. I needed about 2 1/2 of the 15 x 20cm sheets to cover everything and it looks like we may have to start fresh next week, this is going to add up so I truly hope it works.",

My armpit is the only area without Mepitel so I've been applying Miaderm to just that area--not sure if it's in my head or not, but I feel like I'm getting a little tender under there.
