So what I do now is take it for a week then stop one week.  Take it again in a week then I break a week from it. When I am on Ibuprofen my attitude is so full of hope but towards the end of that week when I am off of the Ibuprofen I find myself saying, \"who cares if my stomach bleeds if it takes all this pain away\"?  Sounds like I am a desperate idiot but this is how I live these days.    ",
