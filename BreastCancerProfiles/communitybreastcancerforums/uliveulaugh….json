I had enough milk to nurse an infant army ... no worries.  You will want to pamper yourself the rest of the day.. Plan some nap time.  Pain meds always made me feel worse so I found that advil helped with pain and swelling.  Depending on how strenuous your job is... I teach so I went back the next day with just a reduction of student hugs and board writing.  An extra day off is well deserved since you will prob be preoccupied with waiting for results from your biopsy.  It's really no big deal... Being put to sleep has always made me nervous so I ask for valium before surgery.. it's wonderful for me.  I am having the same procedure yet again Tuesday... sounds like we are prob the same day.  I will be praying for you... That God will protect us both from the \"C\" word.  Good luck and this site is great for support through all breast issues.",
