It looks like anyone who is a BIRADS 4 or 5, per the NIH, should have their results considered \"discordant\" if the path report comes back benign. Better safe than sorry, I suppose. I'm BIRADS 5, so I'm pretty much expecting a malignancy. But once I read that today, even if it's benign, I guess I'll be going back in to check again to be sure.",
