    "Content": "FullMoonNerd wrote: I had a bacterial infection in my right nipple in 2014 that cleared up as soon as I started an oral round of antibiotics. The nipple remained changed though, thicker (a tube if tissue with a diameter the size of an eraser). An ultrasound and mammogram lead doctors to believe the remaining symptom was scar tissue from the infection. A month ago, my nipples got super swollen and itchy. Then both of my breasts were itchy but not anywhere north, south, east or west of them. I was a very localized and intense itch. Then my nipples got chapped and started peeling. I went to an ER because I just lost my mom (56) to cancer (adenocarcinoma -unknown primary (she passed four months after diagnosis)) and her maternal grandmother died of breast cancer -also in her 50s. The ER dr said \"sometimes nipples do that\" even thought by this point, the tube in my right nipple had the diameter of a large marble. He said it's not IBC because I lack the orange peel skin. The next day I went to Urgent Care. She thought it was MRSA and gave me a topical antibiotic (mupirocin) and swabbed my nose for MRSA. The cream made my nipple much worse (inverting, painful swelling, redness, etc.) and the left nipple started to pucker. The MRSA test was negative. I applied an anti-fungal (monistat) and that seemed to help. Some potentially relevant backstory: This summer, I think I got exposed to mold when I moved to a gorgeous brownstone in Chicago in April. After moving in, I found that the shower leaked so bad that when you showered too long, it rained in the living room. In June I was misdiagnosed with a bacterial infection. Upon taking the prescribed antibiotic, I had an insanely bad yeast infection (second one ever). I took something for that and it helped the vaginal infection (no more handfuls of sand-like yeast coming from my vagina!) but then I started to lose time and words and memories (old and the ability to create new ones -I had to write EVERYTHING down /was much worse off than the lead in the film Momento). There was blood and mucus in my stool, bloating and alternating constipation/diarrhea. I lost 15 lbs in a week (am already very slender) and became gluten, lactose and diary intolerant seemingly over night (with no history of GI issues). I was smelling toast, and at times, unable to move my hands or tongue. My body swelled up like a water balloon and it was hard for me to maintain my balance or perceive depth. Then I left my house and started to get better. I implemented a bunch of dietary/lifestyle changes and continued to get better. All blood-work was normal but a holistic doctor diagnosed me with candida. When monistat seemed to help the nipple, I implemented an anti-fungal protocol (eating/bathing in apple cider vinegar and coconut oil, eliminating all processed foods (only eating fruits and vegetables and meat), applying monistat daily, etc.). While that helped, the next Urgent Care nurse referred me to a breast oncologist but then my insurance dropped me, and now I would have to start all over with a new medical group even though the symptoms are almost gone. The only one that lingers in a lump inside the right nipple that is as thick as a small marble but in the shape of a tube. I think that because the lump shrank from a large to a small nipple in size, it's not cancer, right? Or could it be because inflammatory breast cancer doesn't even always result in lumps? Could it be a fungal infection? Something else? I'm in insurance limbo hell now because I got dropped for moving and I was told that the new insurance company won't cover it because the issue is now \"pre-existing.\" Thank you for your time, thoughts and consideration!
