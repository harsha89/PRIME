I have a right modified rad mast scheduled for Jan 30, and have been having nightmares... but your style and courage in this community really helps. I have a wonderful surgeon who spent an hour with me & my husband when I got the diagnosis. She also set up an appointment for me with a PS for reconstruction, 2 hours (I'm not kidding!) after I met with her. So I have hope. Thanks again everyone!",

The ginger root tip is great, do you have to peel it first? How much do you use? I find ginger ale helps but sometimes a hot drink is what I want. For taste issues, I find that regular rinses with warm salt water restore my sense of taste. Sleeping is a problem because of the dexamathasone, but this time I got some Ativan and that helps. My hair is falling out rapidly, I look very mangy, but don't feel like a buzz cut. Have started wearing some nice scarves I got from Headcovers.com DutchinAtlanta - I love your cats! I live with 2 Siameses, and I swear they know when I'm feeling bad, they come and snuggle with me and make me feel so much better. Hugs to everyone and thank you all so much for your tips and sharing. It is so good to know that there is a whole wonderful community of brave tough women helping each other through this. ",

My first week after chemo was brutal because I felt so dizzy and weak; I went to the hospital when I realized I couldn't drive safely. Turns out my potassium was low, has anyone else had this side effect? My family dr. caught this (not the hospital = hah) and told me to load up on broccoli, bananas, and o.j. Now I feel much better. Have been told that I'll lose my hair between my 2nd and 3rd treatments, so here's the plan: On Thursday I go to my stylist, get her to cut it off to about 1\" and then dye it the most wicked red I can find! Then at least I'll look good until it comes out! Good luck to us all with our treatments, this really sucks.....",

But my doctor also told me that my CEA test is 27.4, which can indicate colon cancer,  and is sending me for a gastroscopy, colonoscopy, and abdominal ultrasound next week. My step-daughter is a doctor, and told me that the elevated CEA is probably due to breast cancer, and that I shouldn't worry. Does anyone know more about the CEA? Both my surgeon and my daughter have told me that it's a very unreliable indicator. Thanks in advance for your help, this is all so scary!  Cancer is a word, not a sentence!
