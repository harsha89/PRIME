Good morning KerLyn, looks good on posting your diagnosis and treatments! I'm two weeks post-rads and am in recovery. Some zingers and rough and itchy skin still. But it's getting better. Key to success: lubricate morning noon and night. I've used miaderm and eucerin with some aquaphor on tender areas. Also good to stay hydrated and keep eating enough, especially protein. For new people, the simulation and the first rad are often the hardest. After that the treatments are much shorter and easier to understand. Wishing you all a smooth path forward",

My surgery was right at the bottom of my nipple. They gave me a month and a half between surgery and rads so I had some time to heal. Maybe it would be helpful to get a little treatment holiday before starting my AI. Also as an older person I need to get my second shingrix shot. Don't want to have cancer *and* shingles. There's a shortage but the doctor's office put both of us on the call list for when the next batch comes in. Husband also has cancer, CLL. We're very competitive like that.

Hope you all find the support and encouragement you are looking for. It's helped so many of us to share the radiation experience with others going through it at the same time. I was in December and am wrapping things up as side effects are tapering off. I had 16 treatments but no boosts as the invasive piece was small. The doctors told me I was eligible for this shorter period of treatment but not clear whether that was because of age - 67. Choosing whether to do radiation - it reduces your chance of recurrence. I sure wouldn't want to go through all this again anytime soon. One woman uses this as her signature here: \"Everything is doable. Not easy, but doable.\" This certainly covers life during rads. Lubricate (starting before rads begin) - Hydrate - Share your stories",

It's pretty fast relief for the desperate itchies. Miaderm is expensive and good. There is also a kind of Miaderm that has lidocaine for extra surface pain relief. There are other creams that also work. My dermatologist has me on Aveeno eczema balm which I use for overnight care. She said I can use moisturizer often during the day, nothing wrong with slathering up five times a day if needed. Also ok to use some cortisone like cortaid. There is a kind that comes with aloe. During the day I use cortaid once and use miaderm and other creams the rest of the time. Still taking tylenol and NSAID for general discomfort. Three weeks out I am definitely healing, color beginning to look more normal, like a heavy sunburn that is peeling. The new skin underneath looks healthy and pink. This too shall pass! Then back to normal life I hope.",

That is some seriously messed up stuff. This can HURT. And it can hurt, on and off, for an annoyingly long time. What could actually be helpful is thinking - \"it won't always hurt like this. Sooner or later things will start getting better. My sisters here on the forum report that it does get better.\" So cling to that. We all have our rough days. I have tried to power through and some days the power is off and everything is dark. We need to reach out to loved ones and say, I need extra love and comfort and kind words and hot chocolate today. Couple of thoughts: If you're having rads on your lymph nodes remember to moisturize all the way up to your collarbone, and all the way into your armpit even reaching beyond it a little to where your back starts. If something starts hurting or a lump suddenly appears during treatment, our first thoughts are of new cancer. But this is super unlikely. We are wary and intimidated and ready to pounce on new symptoms as being ominous, when they are just small things usually. Of course always good to check with your doctor.

Sometimes it's better bra on, sometimes better off. Today I figured out I could put a thick gauze pad in between my boob and my bra to keep it from hitting that ONE PLACE again and again.

It's based on the several factors, honestly I wasn't paying attention very well during that part of the doctor visit. So much to think about. Joytxs - you might do fine on skin! Mine was like yours, then got darker as the days went on. Wised described the overall sensation as like having a headache, except in your boob. I got swollen, heavy, and itchy by the end but my skin wasn't too bad. Keep up the good work with lotion 3x a day. My symptoms did intensify for a couple weeks after rads were over, and now that is lifting. On the plus side, no more daily trips to the hospital.

      "Content": "Jan 29, 2019 03:40PM - edited Jan 29, 2019 03:46PM by egregious Welcome M-and-M37! Hope you find the support and encouragement that so many of us have discovered here. Your first treatment is by far the longest, then just a few minutes each after that. Bring moisturizer with you and apply after the radiation treatment as you are getting dressed. That plus morning and evening should be enough. (Avoid putting on within two hours before your radiation) Since I didn't have chemo I can't compare with rads but the procedure itself doesn't hurt, and usually the side effects of sunburn and fatigue come on very slowly. Many people have very few side effects in the first couple of weeks. Being in the radiation room alone is a little unnerving but if you need them to stop just call out and they'll help you. Lots of good fragrance-free moisturizers out there. My docs gave this list: eucerin, lubriderm, cetaphil, calendula, aquaphor, cerave. More $ but works well is miaderm and miadermL that has lidocaine in it, available on amazon. For when you start getting red and itchy, get a spray bottle of 100% aloe vera (Seven Minerals for example - amazon) and leave it in the fridge. It's good for a couple months and gives *instant* relief. If you want to display your diagnosis and treatment below your posts, go up to the top of the page where it says My Profile, then click on Diagnosis or Treatment to get started. I may have had to go to the blue stuff on the left where it says Settings to make sure these were set to be public. For a boatload of good advice, read from the beginning of this January thread and even some of the other monthly radiation threads to see what has helped other people. You will get through this! Good luck and keep us posted. ",

Regarding water, I was dehydrated for a couple of days during rads when I was so tired I forgot to get my usual cups of drinking water. It was enough to make my mouth and lips dry. Usually I'm all about the 8 glasses a day. There is such a thing as drinking too much fluid, so happy medium in there somewhere. Am three weeks post rads and turning from fire engine red/dark brown to lighter brown. Still itchy and going through tubes of miaderm and cortisone and still spraying with refrigerated liquid aloe. It's exasperating to have side effects linger this long, but honestly things are inching better each day. In particular my nipple has stopped hurting like the blue blazes. The crease under my armpit isn't killing me anymore, and the big red spot on my upper breast is fading and peeling like a sunburn. This too shall pass. Greetings to all, old and new!

ER+ means responsive to estrogen hormone, can be treated with a daily pill after whatever surgery and radiation they have in mind. For a small tumor you likely don't need chemo. PR+ is similar, progesterone positive HER2- means negative in testing for another factor. If you did have HER2+ then you could get Herceptin or other medicine specifically for this factor FISH is a type of test for HER2. I had calcifications on mammogram which turned out to be a large DCIS and a 2mm invasive tumor. They did an outpatient biopsy, then did a surgical biopsy and took the entire area out. Because it was a small tumor I actually look the same as before. Now I am almost done with radiation. It doesn't hurt to wait a couple weeks between diagnosis and surgery. Of course it's really hard to WAIT. I think we all remember how terrible the WAITING is. In many ways even if you do have cancer - and you might not - you'll feel better once you have a diagnosis and a treatment plan. Wishing you quick and accurate results and a good path ahead.",

I had a repeat mammogram which I thought was super annoying. Then they kept taking more and more scans and got real quiet. So I knew it was bad. Next step was an ultrasound, fortunately available that same day. They kept looking and were also very quiet. Next step was to see the surgeon who scheduled my outpatient biopsy. Up until this point my husband still thought it was fine but I sensed I would not be in that lucky 80% who get a biopsy and it's nothing. Waiting for the diagnosis was really hard and my blood pressure shot up, had to be treated with extra meds, just what I needed in the middle of all this. On to lumpectomy, rads, meeting w oncologist. It's been quite a journey. In theory they got the cancer out with surgery and rads discouraged any adjacent tissue from heading in the cancer direction. Daily pill starts in January but that's to prevent recurrence. So I am \u201cprobably\" cancer free with that word probably doing a lot of heavy lifting.",

The important thing is that you are being evaluated soon. In a couple weeks you'll know more, then if you need treatment, that can get started. For something small you likely won't need chemo, so surgery and radiation might be enough. If you have a certain type of cancer it can also be treated long term with a daily pill to help prevent recurrence.

I'm in the same boat with a similar diagnosis. Here's my (totally not a doctor) opinion - they think they got all of THIS round of cancer in the surgery. Assuming they have clean margins from the surgery, radiation is to make sure they got it all, and daily meds afterwards are primarily for preventing recurrence.",

They told me exactly what to expect and most important, how long. It was just a few minutes, during which I had to remind myself to hold still and just breathe and remember that people were praying for/thinking about me.

It's been an intense time with treatment. I feel grateful for the support of family and friends and you guys here. Hope your path ahead goes smoothly. Did you see Wised started a new thread for hormone treatment called Starting/Declining Hormone Therapy. Lot of familiar faces there. Hi Lavenderlee! Happy for you that you'll be finished up before the new year. Happy 2019!! And that puppy is adorable. Good going on stepping back from hosting this Christmas. Other people can help us. We just had our family gathering, early because folks are traveling next week. I sat in a chair and ate and unwrapped presents while everybody else did all the work. Once I forgot and jumped up to chase the one year old down the hall, caught him, and came back and said Ooops! Old habits. Sillyoldrabbit, I think you and I are ending on the same day. Raising a cup - cheers!! This too shall pass. Keep up the good work with lubrication and hydration. ",

The worst time for a lot of us was at the beginning, and things really do calm down and get better once there is a treatment plan. Even having the diagnosis steers you in the right direction. People mean well but can say very unhelpful things. I have a bet with myself about how many people will go off on some wacko treatment idea or their aunt who died horribly. I am all like Um-hmm um-hmm and then change the subject as fast as possible. Other people are scared hearing your news, but it's not YOUR job to help them with their anxiety. That's on THEM. Being estrogen positive and grade 1 you are very likely to have a good outcome. So don't let the naysayers get to you. Keep us posted, and good luck with your treatment plan.",

It can be confusing at the beginning when the doctors are still figuring out what the best treatment will be. Chemo can shrink even very large tumors. You have a hormone positive cancer type that might respond very well to the hormone drugs. And some of the new molecular therapies are becoming more broadly available. It's scary at first but almost everybody feels better once there is a treatment plan. They will figure out what to do, then just take it step by step. As one of the women here says, everything is doable - not easy, but doable.",

Chemo can shrink back the tumor, sometimes they will do that before surgery. Then radiation, then followup medicines. You have the estrogen positive type which generally responds well to hormone therapy. (I am not a doctor - get advice from people that know this stuff better than me) ",
