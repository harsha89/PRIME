Â Is colon cancer and breast cancer related? My OB keeps asking me about my bowels, I've always had issues with them especially after my first child was born. I have had my gal bladder out, yet food still runs through me and if its not loose its very thin, I'm wondering if I should have a colonoscopy I'm only 39. I feel like I'm going crazy. I work on an Impatient neruo-rehab facility in a level 1 trauma center, a couple other CNA's on my floor have gone through BC and when I was rubbing my boob in the break room after my underwire was poking the lump they commented on my doing so and asked what was going on, they have been on my case to get it checked out, one was diagnoised with IBC stage 3 I believe hers went undetected for a year after a clean mammo and US, I dont know what the other one was diagnoised, they both have all the nurses bugging me now asking me when I'm going in. I know I've been dragging my feet and making excuses the last month but last time I felt like I was brushed off. I've had this gut feeling since Dec that something was going on but after the BS in Feb said it was nothing I felt like okay maybe my gut was wrong but now I dont know, and I dont want to feel like I am making this all up or being a hypochondriac. I'm always feeling lightheaded, kinda light my brain is spinning, I've lost sensation in my left breast, it hurts but when my hubs plays around there is nothing there when before they were very sensitive if that makes any sense to anyone. I just hate all this waiting, it really sucks wish there was easy answers to all of this, or and easier way to be diagnosed, instead of here let me feel your boobs, dosent feel like cancer to me so lets just watch it and see, and if there is any changes call me. I'll let you know what the BS says on Tuesday with how my luck is going it will prob be another let's juts wait and see, or its nothing. Thanks for letting me vent Log in to post a reply",
