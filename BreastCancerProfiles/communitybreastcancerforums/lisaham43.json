The last 5 were boosts and my skin is really red and tender, but overall all is well. I go back to my oncologist in a week to start on meds, probably tamoxaphen for 5 years.....just so glad I am near the end of appts, etc. Good luck to all, it does go pretty fast actually, but emotionally is tough !!! I think of you all everyday. Lisa",
