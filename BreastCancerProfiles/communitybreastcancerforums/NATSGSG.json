      "Content": "NATSGSG wrote: Hello Brave Ladies: I'm writing to share with those who has not made any decision with regards to above. Now, I had an ultrasound and an MRI done. In both of these, my tumor size was 2.6 cm and 2.5 cm respectively. I was also told to have a mammogram before biopsy. The mammo showed a tumor size of 3.0 cm. Prior to my surgery, one of my SOs said they will take 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 cm (the 2 cm being margins) during surgery. That bugged me so much I couldn't sleep for 2 nights. Logically the MRI should have the most accurate reading (2.5 cm + 2 cm margins = 4.5 cm). Normally, a 0.5 - 1.0 cm margins around the tumor is taken out. I wanted to talk to my original SO and explained that the reading of a 3.0 cm mammo tumor is impossible because breast and tumor are both squoosh, and thus seemed to make the tumor bigger. Finally, I did get to talk to my original SO who returned from conference. She agreed with my assessment, and said that they will take no more than they needed to check if cancer has spread to the margins. Thanked God I had clear margins all around. Now, I had 1/5 or 20% of my breast taken out. Surgery proved that my tumor is the size as indicated by the MRI. Breast reconstruction was done simultaneously during surgery. My 2nd SO did a fantastic job on the reconstruction. She uses a technique that cuts around the entire areola where my 1st SO took out the tumor with margins, and then she (my 2nd SO) did the reconstruction. She did a beautiful job of it. My breast is originally 38D. After reconstruction, my right breast is a 37D, just slight smaller and really not so noticeable. My areola was stitched back using dissolvable sutures, around which a layer of glue was used to keep it in place. It is now healing very very well. I can see that when fully healed, even the scars will fade away nicely, though I can't hardly wait for it to heal (when the redness is gone) so I can apply Mederma**, a scar fader that works wonderfully. The reason I am writing to talk about my reconstruction is because from the many literature I read, many surgeons cut a hole to take out the tumor so most breasts are left with an ugly looking sunken hole. Please, please, if that is the technique your surgeon is planning on using, please stop him/her now. I can send you pictures of my breast so you can see how my SO did it. There really is no need for your SO to butcher your breast in a bad way. So, if you can protect your breast, by all means do so and not let the SO take your decisions away from you. As for sentinel lymph nodes dissection during surgery, my SO said they would take 1-4 nodes. If 1/4, 2/4, 3/4 are positive (not 4/4) they won't take all the nodes out. They will try to see if they can salvage use chemo first to kill the cancers in them before axillary dissection. You see, axillary dissection is painful, and your arms are essentially \"useless\" in that there are much you can't do with your arms.  I have posted an article about EVERYTHING U WANT 2 KW ABOUT LYMPH NODES. Please read it. If your cancer has not spread, please PROTECT your lymph nodes. They are an essentially part of a system in your body.  Fight for it if you can.

It must have been very scary and painful for you...I don't know what I'll do in such a situation....and I feel most doctors do care and some don't give a damn, we are just another patient to them... thank you for sharing your situation so we learn something from it.... I am just thankful my female doctor surgeon is a wonderful, caring and patient person. Every time I leave her a message, she will return my call by the end of the day, no matter how busy she is. She welcomes any concerns I have, respects my decision if I choose something different from her recommendation, provided I am able to provide evidence of my decision. I hope you will find a better doctor for whatever post surgical therapy you have to go through.  Oftentimes, our gut feelings are correct....if it tells us something is missing, it is asking us to question is, to seek more clarity about it... Pleas do not stop reading about conditions similar to yours from the internet because you can learn much from it, and help you make decisions you otherwise wouldn't make without knowing them. The National Library of Medicine has tons of scientific evidence you can find to help answers some of the questions you have... I have even written to some cancer patients for clarification so I can understand better. Many are more than willing to share whatever they have because they want us newbies to not suffer what they have suffered had they known some of the things that their care giver or doctor failed to tell them in their own research... Please take care...also do remember to do your post surgery exercises wherever possible...those exercises can really help to speed up your recovery. Here's a link with pictorial demonstration: http://breastcancer.about.com/od/lifeaftertreatment/ss/arm_exercises_tutorial.htm All the Best Apr. 5th, 2015: Sorry, I went back and checked the link...and re-pasted it above. It should work now. Thanks for pointing it out...all the best in your recovery and .thanks for you well wishes...going for Chemo #2 in about 30 mins. today...",

MRI showed 2.5 cm tumor size, and Mammogram showed 3.0 tumor size. Biopsy was done within a week of tumor identification to determine if it was benign or malignant. The sooner it is done, the better, esp if one's cancer is of the most aggressive grade like mine turned out to be. Biopsy was a 10-15 painless, outpatient procedure. My SO used an ultrasound guided fine needle biopsy to make a 0.5 cm incision to take out 6 cores from various angles of the tumor for pathological analysis. The incision heals within 24-48 hours. Can shower within 24 hours. Please ask your SO to explain his/her method/process to you as I was shocked to read one patient has a 1 inch incision for biopsy when her tumor size was the same as mine. Pathological report came back within 4-5 business days. That's when my SO and OPS discussed the results with me (please see my PJ Hamel post on how to read your pathology report). We discussed my lumpectomy surgery, SLND, ALND, breast reconstruction techniques and so forth. Mine was Stage IIa, Grade 3, ER/PR-  HER2+, IDC, 2.5 cm tumor. (SO = Surgical Oncologist, OPS = Oncoplastic Surgeon) During surgery, the actual size of tumor was 2.5 cm. Margins taken out around tumor was 1 cm all around = 1 + 2.5 + 1 = 4.5 cm. She also took out one 2 cm size sentinel node during surgery. No axillary lymph node dissection consent was given. Thereafter, my Oncoplastic Surgeon (OPS) did my breast reconstructive surgery using the ROUND BLOCK TECHNIQUE. It was an amazing and beautifully conserve my right breast. My OPS said any tumor size less than 5 cm can use this technique if one's breast is large. If not, then neo-adjuvant to reduce tumor size first is generally recommended to preserve and reshape the entire breast. Now, my right breast is one size smaller than my left breast (36D versus 38D), and still looks good. I mean I can wear a bikini still. The hospital policy at my Cancer Center is to attempt to conserve breast (wherever possible) using the various combinations of techniques employ by Plastic Surgeons unless patient specifically request mastectomy. Generally, if a patient's breast can be saved, they would made that recommendation. >>> This link has a video explanation of MRI procedures and equipment used: http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancers-in-general/tests/mri-scan >>> This link below discusses the different Breast Conserving Surgical (BCS) methods suitable for your type of tumor location/size should you choose lumpectomy, and then re-construction. Great to know so you can discuss with your surgeon your option. If they choose a method different from what you want, be sure to ask why and what benefit their method is for your breast, and recovery time, and how it will be affected by other therapy (I am having 12 weeks weekly chemo now, but is supposed to have radiation thereafter for which I am still considering.) http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijbc/2011/303879/  >>> If you like to explore immunotherapy (currently a hot topic in the cancer treatment world as of this writing) that seemingly has lesser side effects than chemotherapy,  please click on this link: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/62/topic/831945?page=1#idx_13  >> If you are interested in reading about my cancer journey thus far, please feel free to visit this link below.

Am holding my breath for the results publication. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00593697?term=SOLD+study&rank=1   @SpecialK , while I realize that this article from Lancet seemed \"old\" does not make it contents obsolete.

I, for one, would find this extremely disturbing, for my family, my friends, my colleagues, and all others who rely on such information to make informed decision prior to any sorts of treatment or therapy. It is a basic truth that over medication, in fact, over-anything, brings more harm than good. Does this not worry you?

I have been doing much reading about this shorter duration, and discovered that Roche Pharmaceuticals, the Swiss Manufacturer has been doing what it can to \"bury,\" \"distort\" this good news. Therefore, I am sharing this info published in Lancet for you to read so you too have more information at hand before making your final decision on adjuvant therapy. Having full information will serve you in a long way.  For example, during surgery and Sentinel Lymph Node Surgery/Dissection, of which normally between 1-4 nodes will be taken out for testing) I also signed consent for axillary clearance. Upon reading, I discovered if 1/4, or 2/4  nodes are positive, sometimes this may not require axillary clearance (based on clinical trials results). Anyway, I cancelled ALND. Glad I did even though my SLND  result was negative. What I mean to say don't easily give up your axillary if you can't help it. The point here is READ, READ, READ lots to educate yourself. Don't be passive and hand your body to your SO and MO. Yes, they hae your interests at heart. But most tends to go with the majority standard treatments...Sometimes, there are results to the contrary that our SO and MO are too busy to read.... Naturally, the final decision is yours to make. Regardless, I wish you all have a less painful, more pleasant recovery, no matter what stage of cancer you are at.... Trastuzumab: possible publication bias The Lancet, 17 May 2008 Herceptin (trastuzumab) for early breast cancer has caught international attention. Yeet, its effectiveness may be overestimated, because important clinical trial data from nearly 1000 women has not been published. Publication bias is of increasing concern, entrenching the use of interior treatments.  This concern now extends to adjuvant trastuzumab (Herceptin_ in women wit HER2 positive early breast cancer, because a key clinical trial has been oly selectively published. As such, patients are being givenan important treatment sequence that may be much less effective than currently thought. Adjuvant trastuzumab can be gven in two main sequences: concurrently with or sequentially after other chemotherapy. Sequential treatment is licensed, is standard practice and is the publicly funded regimen in many countries, such as most of Europe (United Kingdom included).  Once randomized trial (out of six relevant trials) by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) trial NCCTG-N9831, has studied both sequential and concurrent treatments head-to-head, together with a control or usual-care group. However, although this three-group study has trastuzumab, it has only been partly published. Data from the 985 women given 12-month sequential trastuzumab in this study are in effect missing, despite publication of data from the 12-month concurrent and contro groups of the same trial nearly 3 years ago. Interim resuts for all three groups of the NCCTG trial were presented orally in 2005 at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting. After 1.5 yeasr' median follow-up, sequential trastuzumab gave a comparatively small 13% relative reduction in disease evets compared with usual care -- with a reasonable chance of being no better than the control arm (harzard ratio 0.87%, 95% Cl 0.67-1.13)  Conversely, concurrent trastuzumab was significantly more effective than sequential therapy, reducig disease events by a third(0.64, 0.46-0.91). Soon after, Romond and colleagues published the concurrent a control group results fro the NCCTG three-group study with another study of concurrent treatment )the National Surgical Adjuvent Breast and Bowel Project ((NSABP) B31 Trial) in a retrospectively approved pooled analysis. Limited efficacy data from the inidividual trials are available in the online appendix to that publication, but do not include the NCCTG sequential-group data.  These data are only available as part of the slide presentation on a confererence websitem ad have NEVER been disseminated by peer-reviewed publication. The SELECTIVE RELEASE of data from the NCCTGstudy has far-reaching implications for women with HER2 positive early breast cancer. Without these data, sequential trastuzumab seems more effective than i probably is.  Combining the NCCTG sequential data from the conference slide show with updated results for the other trials of sequential trastuzumab (HERA, ad PACS-04) shows a treatment effect ONE-THIRD less than initially estimated...

      "Content": "Apr 25, 2015 12:02PM - edited Apr 25, 2015 12:08PM by NATSGSG Hello again everyone,  I posted a reply back in 15 Mar 2015 about the exercises in the link i told you about that could help you before surgery ? I did those exercises daily for an hour up until until my lumpectomy on March 25th. Now I would like to report back.  I had 1/5 of my right breast tumor taken out with clear margins (5cm total),  1 sentinel node taken out that came back negative. I also had breast reconstruction done simultaneously  by two SOs, both of whom were also trained in reconstructive surgery.  When I woke up 5.5 hours later,  there was No pain on either my right shoulder or my underarm where a 5 inch incision was.  There was a low grade bearable pain around my areola due to it being cut out (with nipple ) from where the  tumor was taken out.  It was stitched around back using dissolvable sutures and then glued over to protect it.  At night I sleep on my left or in a semi sitting position. Lying flat hurts the areola as it stretches that breast.  Other than that, no pain.   I wear a nursing bra to support my 38D breast  to prevent friction to nipple and areola. . For some reason my reconstructed right breast is now 37D.That's how good my SO s are. I am supposed to start massaging my right breast to prevent hardening inside and help circulation.  As of this writing,  the glue has dried up and falling off and the sutures totally gone with a pinky ring around it. It's healing slowly but surely.  Over these 5 weeks,  I have continued to do those exercises in the video except several days when it rained heavily.  I believe those arm swinging exercises did contribute to the absence of  pain.  However,  on  days that I did not exercise,  the underarm did feel sore. Here's the link again if you are interested and willing to give it a try.  Start swinging slowly if you have pain.  Wear sleeveless blouse may help you if you have pain in your underarm.  Do however many you can,  increasing to a longer duration each time.  Recommend s twice a day. If you persist for at least a week,  see if it helps?  Anyway,  seeing doctor coming Mon morning due to a minor infection last week and on antibiotics.  If cleared,  will start chemo same afternoon on 12 weeks weekly concurrent herceptin + paclitaxel with pre medication of anti allergy drugs given intravenously. Bottomline is:  there's no harm trying these exercises at this link.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pahtCOQeKHo For translation of video,  go to section on FITNESS AND GETTING BACK INTO SHAPE.  I truly wish everyone here speedy recovery of your pain. Hang in there. Please please please give these exercises a try?   ",

Hope you will enjoy all these videos.....@!!@ I've watched all 6+ hours of Day ,and more of Day 2 of this conference.... Watching all these doctors, scientists, immunologists, researchers etc presentation makes me feel pretty optimistic... and I can certainly hear Barbra Streisand singing, \"Happy Days are here again....\" to us all Cancer Patients .. P.S  A Suggestion - while watching these videos, please consider taking note of the names of those who presented...if there is a need,  you could consider following up with these professionals with respect to your own type of cancer...? Finally, salute to the passion and persistence of Dr. Bob Wiltrout of the National Cancer Institute.  Dr. Wiltrout is the author of more than 200 scientific publications in the areas of innate immunity, inflammation and cancer immunotherapy.  It appears there are clinical trials out there that have started to recruit breast cancer patients for this treatment....www.clinicaltrials.gov link or NCI can give you more info, or call the different cancer centers around the U.S. to find out if they have one?",

It's a really really cool site to visit after you get your biopsy pathology results. Then go to links below to read some more to educate yourself on the types of treatments, including immunotherapy (current hot topic in cancer treatment. There's a video link included below if you rather watch than read it). As you are educating yourself, you will begin to feel calmer and less afraid of what's ahead of you, believe me *!* Here's the link. Please read the \"Info for Patients and the Public\" to get an idea of how it's being used. Again, it's only a prediction based on a mathematical model. http://predict.nhs.uk/predict.html The more proactive we are in educating ourself, the better off we will be in cruising through this journey, and the braver we will become. Well, at least I found it to be true for moi's case. Please, please, please think only positive thoughts at all times..... never let negative or despondent thoughts into your mind at any time... If we look hard enough, there may be a solution residing somewhere in the tons of info residing in the National Library of Medicine. I will caution though that since the majority of authors of articles there were written researchers, doctors and professionals contain much medical terminologies, it could be dry reading. Therefore, one needs to know these terminology to find what we want, what we need. Which is why starting to learning quickly them makes finding info a much easier task. There is an online medical dictionary in there. Still, begin with a wonderful pdf about understanding your pathology report and its terminology from our own breastcancer.org site called Your Guide to the Breast Cancer Pathology Report at this link http://www.breastcancer.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&term=pathology&commit=Search or at The National Cancer Institute. It too has a very comprehensive pdf file on the same subject at below link, along with many illustrative pictures and graphics to make your understanding easier: http://www.cancer.gov/publications/patient-education/wyntk-breast-cancer Print it out and look it over again and again until you are familiar with its terms and meaning. It is while we are waiting that that's the best time to start one's reading, one's education. Occupying oneself during this time gives one greater hope and strength and desire to face it.

      "Content": "Aug 9, 2015 03:36PM - edited Aug 22, 2015 05:42AM by NATSGSG I had both MUGA and Echocardiogram (aka TTE). I had MUGA test done just before chemotherapy in late April 2015, and the latter in mid July after my chemo ended in 30 June. A MUGA (multi-gated acquisition, see pix below of machine) heart scan is used to evaluate how well the individual walls of our heart chambers work and the sequence of heart muscle contractions. The information obtained from this procedure helps our doctor make decisions about our treatment. If we are currently receiving or about to receive chemotherapy, these information supposedly help our oncologist tailor our chemo dose for maximum therapeutic effect. The whole process for me at my cancer center took about 3 hours. First, I was injected with a radioactive materials via an IV line. Thereafter, I was told to hang around anywhere in the hospital eg Cafeteria, Starbucks, or a quiet corner reading a book, listening to music etc and return back in 2 hours. The reason for this was to ensure the radioactivity will \"tag\" onto the red blood cells so that they can be viewed during the scan. After about 2 hours, I went back to the scanning department. I was told to lie on a very narrow couch-like table (see pix below) that barely accommodated my entire body. I was told to lie very still while something was attached to my chest to feed my heart rate to the camera that records my blood circulation to my heart. The entire scanning took about 30 mins plus/minus. The table I lie on were slightly tilted and pictures taken,(excluding the 15 mins or so prep time). OR rather it could be the two cameras that rotated in a circular motion that made me feel that the table tilted. After MUGA, I was advised to drink as much water as possible to help discharge the radioactive materials. I was also told these would happen between 24-48 hours. During that time, I must stay away from children or pregnant women since I was radioactive. I could shower after about 4 hours or so. The results were transmitted to my MO who would then advise whether I can proceed with chemo or not at my next appointment. I also had my Echocardiogram (aka TTE -- for some reason the nurses at my center also calls it EKG even though it would be better if they use the technically correct term TTE) after the completion of my chemotherapy sometime in mid-July 2015 (10 weekly sessions in all, of 3.5 hours total of concurrent Herceptin and Paclitaxel, including pre-medications to both). My MO said the purpose of the TTE was to measure the degree of cardiotoxicity of Herceptin to my heart after chemotherapy. The entire process for this took only about a hour or so. Luckily for me, the results of both my MUGA and TTE were favorable - heart functioning fine in both situations. NOTE: There are two types of EKGs, (actually yes, EKG/ECG and TTE/EKG) - One is just a simple EKG (commonly called ECG) that we are sent to do a week or several weeks before surgery. That EKG/ECG only takes 10-15 mins. It is done to measure our heart rate. The table we lie on is stationery. Long wires are hooked up to the machine next to the table, and at the end of each of these wires are EKG/ECG patches that are taped to various parts of our chest. The more intensive \"EKG\" that I did post chemo is actually called the Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE, but simplify as EKG at my center, which can be confusing). In this one, I lie topless on a cushioned table. The sonographer performs this test. The process described below is exactly what was done to me:",

I knew absolutely nothing about cancer when I was diagnosed back in late February 2015 BUT I did not allow myself to be disheartened. I knew that I want to conquer it. So within a week's, I read as much as I can to help me make good decisions. If you have time, please go to my thread that have listed many links that hopefully will be of use to you. Just scroll down to the bottom of the top thread ..Everyone's cancer is different, and f it's any comfort to you, I've had surgery, done chemo therapy (but on my terms) and now radiation (on my terms as well)... These decisions made me feel better - If it's any comfort to you, initially I thought I don't want to have chemo after surgery. After reading about chemo reducing recurrence and increasing my survival, I selected the plan I want,  not the standard plan given to HER 2+ patients like me.. During chemo, I thought I wouldn't go for radiation. But after researching and reading about radiation, I decided to go for it (not the whole enchilada)...So today is my last day of radiation. So, I'm heading there as soon I finish typing the rest of info for you:  What I'm trying to say is that I'm very glad that I went through all these because I want to live. Even though I am almost penniless when this is over, I still want to live. I don't know how yet because at our late age, it may be difficult to get a job. But I wont give up either. TRY!  TRY! TRY! https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/147/topic/831038?page=1 Also, there are new breakthroughs in the application of Immunotherapy to Stage IV breast cancer, esp those who are triple negative i.e ER/PR - & HER2 -. My thread below has listed several sources you can call to enquire if you qualify for any immunotherapy clinical trials and such. The major one is The Society of Immunotherapy for Cancers (SITU) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/147/topic/831945?page=1#idx_24 If you have had or are going to have a biopsy and want to know how to read your pathological reports, please visit this thread with lots of details written by By Carolyn Vachani, RN, MSN, AOC, Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/147/topic/831074?page=1#idx_3   So, please Hang in there - and stay the course , please stay the course towards getting better and better...@!!@",

Whether one is diagnosed or NOT diagnosed with cancer is beside the point. Knowledge is power. If you feel it irrelevant to you, feel free to skip and go along your way. No offense taken :-)) @!!@ @MelissaDall\u2026that's why links are posted to offer clearer insights into what immunotherapy is as the experts explain them far far better than I can. @Cowgirl13 - some of us are grateful for any detail information that comes along, and I am not one to wait till the last minute to find information - to each her own.. :)) Again, if you don't find this interesting, by all means, SKIP IT. The title for this thread is clear... so, there really is no need to get worked up over something that is not to your liking or interests.... Having cancer is to nobody's liking either... This is a forum for sharing after all. When you have your own website, you can call the shots. Until then, please respect others their post. For when you post yours, wherever it may be, I'll respect it too...I don't have the time to go around policing or criticizing what others do or not do.....we all walk our journey however we see fit. Thank you. TO INTERESTED MEMBERS ONLY: I've posted VIDEO SYMPOSIUM LINKS on Immunotherapy organized by the NATIONAL CANCER INSTUTUTE below entitles: Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy: Delivering the Promise (Day 1 and 2) that offers in-depth info on this topic. If watching versus reading is better for you, please scroll down towards the bottom past all the in-between irrelevant comments. Have a great day / week / month / year, and all the best to you too. @!!@",

I NEVER claim that I know everything. If you had carefully read what I had written in the first post, I say those who wants to keep themselves occupied, who are interested in acquiring more knowledge, NOT \"everyone\" as you claim because I dont make these sorts of claims. That's a big difference. What I wrote or post pertains to my type of diagnosis (as you've already known in my other threads and see at the bottom), and naturally won't apply to you or to members whose diagnosis are different from mine. It's only logical. OK, so you have more experienced with your cancer than I have because I am new. That's a fair statement because one would only be looking for info that pertains to one's type of cancer. So how about if you START your own thread and SHARE your own experiences and research?  I'm sure your story will be just as interesting, enlightening, informative and very different from mine by virtue of your own unique situation. Won't this help others similar to your case walk this same path better? Cancer forums serve to offer a wide variety of exchanges of information so that anyone coming here can choose to find the thread that are helpful and pertinent to them.  We come here to learn from each other, to support each other, and to give each other encouragement. When you read my subject title and it's of little use to you, couldn't you skip and go on to the next thread or topic of more use and interests to you? We are not here to put anyone down. Why would anyone want to do that? What purpose or satisfaction would it serve you or me or new members looking for information? There are too much negativity and bitterness in this world already. Could we agree not to add anymore to it? Could we just agree to let each other be? Newbies or not, we all have something to contribute. How much to contribute is also up to us. If you are the sort of person who likes to write less, then write less. I am the sort who likes to write more, so I write more. I write more because I like more information. I don't criticise your writing because that's your style and I respect it. Is it so difficult to give others their R-E-S-P-E-C-T?",

I started zumba exercises twice a week last week. It was fantastic...and also discovered how lacking in stamina I am....now set myself a goal. As soon as I regain my stamina, I will get my zumba instructor certification...hope you too will have some goals to set too. We will heal, without a doubt. After the shocking discovery that I have Stage 2 Grade 3 Invasive Breast Cancer, my sister sent me a video of an exercise that a Taiwanese neurosurgeon who was diagnosed with stage 3 intestinal cancer who did this exercise who somehow managed to get rid of his tumor . He was told he had about 5 years, and he gave much thought as to whether he should go for surgery. He said his tumor was the size of an apple. So, he started doing this \"Swinging Arm and Double Bent Knee\" Exercise. After about a year of this exercise for which he does 1000 sets each day, his tumor had reduced in size. Subsequently, he refused to go for surgery, and was warned by his doctor that he was putting his life in danger。 He decided to take the gamble. After about two years of this exercise, his tumor disappeared. While pleased, he believed that he still have cancer cells in his body. So he has continued doing this exercise to keep his body in check from cancerous cells. The 2nd case in this video is a little boy with skin condition with unhealed skins on his lowers legs and buttocks that was both itchy and painful, and wouldn't go away. His mother took him to differents but to no avail. Finally, she came across this exercise, and have her son do this exercise 30 minutes/day Instead. He does it just before he goes to bed. After about a year, he skin condition disappeared. The mother herself also had shoulder ache which she claimed disappeared after two months of this exercise.  According to an experience Qi Gong & Tai Chi master, this exercise supposedly causes the flow of Qi along different points within out body to flow and unblock any block Qi (energy) The 3rd case is of a lady who have an extremely serious eczema and skin outbreaks with pus (you'll see it in the video) She went to many doctors who weren't able to help her. Her condition was so bad that she quarantined herself at home. When she was introduced to this exercise, after about a year, her skin condition improved. After 2 years, her skin recovered completely. She said she even lost weight.. I am amazed by this myself. The 3rd case is an elderly lady with joint pain. She did these same exercises, and after about a year, the joints in her knees gradually lessen, and after two years, they were gone. Whether this exercise truly works or not, I cannot guarantee. However, my take of this is that they can do no harm, as this method consists only of exercises. I am still going for my surgery and treatment, but will continue to do these exercises every morning for 30 minutes, and to gradually increase the time depending on my stamina. I will try to do it for at least a year to see its degree of efficacy. If you decide to do these exercises as well, please share your results here in this forum. As explained in the video, there are 2 ways of doing it: 1) Swing your arms back and forth twice. Swing front to back is consider 1 count. On the 3rd count, bend your knees once. Then go back to this count. 2X + 1 knee bend = 1 set.  You can start by doing it for about 15 minutes and increase it gradually. 2) The 2nd method is swinging your arms back and forth 4X. On the 5th swing when your arms are moving back, you  bend and lightly bounce your knees twice. That's considered 1 set. Note 1： When you bend your knees, you should still be able to see your toes, and your back is straight, which means your butt must jut out. If you do not see your toes when bending, you are doing it wrong, and can hurt your back. That's why you should start gently and pay attention to the posture during the bend. As you get used to it, it will become natural and you can doing more and more each day.  Note 2: You can do it in the early morning, or just before sleeping. Personally, I'd prefer to do it early morning. So, here's the youtube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pahtCOQeKHo Good luck. May this exercise help us improve our physical self. For those of you who are interested and would like to try it, let's compare notes every month or 2-3 months and see if it works. \"Shuai\" in the video means to swing your arms. @!@ Have a terrific summer! @!@",

      "Content": "Jul 21, 2015 02:12AM - edited Sep 23, 2015 09:09PM by NATSGSG UPDATE: July 21, 2015 (TUESDAY) It's been 3 weeks since my last chemo session and here's the latest update. My hair continues to grow back slowly, and I have a full head of very fuzzy light hair...it looks silvery and around the scalp's perimeter, it dark. Kind of strange, though I wish it would speed up in its growth...hehe. I forgot to mention that my scalp feels rather tender and has a stickiness around it. No matter how often I wash my head, or with whatever shampoo thus far, I have not been able to get rid of that sticky feeling. This stickiness feels like one's scalp has sweated all over and it's left on one's head. I'll continue to experiment with different product to see if I can find anything that will help. If anyone out there has experienced the same, and found something that works, please let me know. The decrease in energy and lethargy the week and a half following the last chemo is receding.. I continue to drink as much as 4 liters of fluid as I can to counter the dehydrating effects of the Herceptin and paclitaxel drugs. My only loss in taste, lasting about a week and a half post-chemo gradually disappeared too. At that time when my appetite decreased. It didn't bother me knowing coz I was glad to eat less and lose some weight since I had gained about 3 kg or 6.6 pounds over the 9 weeks weekly session. I continue to take my 3 natural supplements, one to boost my immune system (Brand: Agaricus Blazei) , the other two being anti-oxidants (Red wine and Grape seed OPC-3)... I believe taking these help with my recovery....on days I forgot, I seem to felt weaker so I try not to forget. I started resuming my once a week zumba cardio lessons but I manage to last for only 30 minutes...I also resume doing my weight training at they gym as I got stronger now... I still drink lots of fluid. Each time I go to the toilet, I see the drugs being discharged. Knowing that there's less toxins in my body made me feel good. I also resume walking by the river whenever the weather is good.... My nails - I cleaned off the dark nail colors two weeks after chemo 10, and decided to leave it colorless to see what happens. It seemed it's less sensitive to light now because my nails did not crack as it did the last time. Now, I can go back to using the usual light nail colors that I like - pink, lilac, white or wine red. The same goes for my toenails. The brief chemo brain I had experienced a week after chemo 10 is now fading - meaning my mind is less cloudy. I watch as many documentary shows as I can to keep my mind sharp or play mahjong with my siblings, relatives or their friends. That helps tremendously. The only thing that's a little different is that instead of getting up earlier than I usually did before chemo 8, I continue to get up later, like around half past 9 or 10. Don't really want to force myself to get up early if my body doesn't want to. Perhaps after another week when my body has more time to recover from the chemo drugs, I could settle back to my previous routine. Try to enjoy the longer morning sleep as it won't lasts forever as I need to get back to work, after September. Working on a free lance basis, I'm under no pressure...though I must admit I'm not used to not working at all. So, that's it for now...will come back and update if anything changes. Again, thanks for visiting my thread, and sending good wishes daily to you, wherever you may be. Take care, stay positive and strong @@!!@@  UPDATE: July 23, 2015 (THURSDAY) - TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM TESTING (aka TTE) Went to the National Heart Center to get a Transthoracic Echocardiogram (aka TTE) done because my MO wanted to check if the amount of Herceptin I had for my treatment resulted in cardiotoxicity to my heart. The procedure took about an hour overall. I enjoyed talking to my Sonographer throughout the entire procedure. I do not expect any cardio-toxicity because I had chosen a treatment plan close to the one I wanted, based on my research. Nevertheless, I shall report back and share several TTE images too. P.S. As of today, July 30th, 2015, I no longer need longer sleep. I can revert back to getting up at around 8000 hours...A very encouraging sign indeed. @!@",

Was advised to wear loose fitting blouses or shirts and comfy pants throughout my upcoming radiation treatment. Anyway, I didn't have to wait long...My wonderful radiation therapist (RTs) Ms. O took me to a room and explained the process to me, along with chart images from the planning CT Scans done last week. The simulation took about 45 minutes in all. At my request, she took pic of me in the simulation room - I'm sharing them below with you. The top pix is of me in the prone position before marking adjustments. X-rays are then taken periodically. They are used to match the CT planning scans done last week to ensure that all markings are spot-on (i.e. aligned with each other). The middle pic shows the right breast with adjustments made. The bottom pix shows what my breast looks like after completion of simulation and adjusted markings. NOTICE that I am in the prone, NOT supine position. This position means no radiation reaching and damaging my right lung. If you could, please ask for this prone position too. If the hospital you go to does offer this position, please consider finding one that does - because in the supine position, daily radiation exposure on your lung(s) will result in its/their scaring and hardening, which will result in you having difficulty breathing down the road. That is something I nor any of us want . Who wants more damage to our body, right? It is our duty to protect our body whenever we can at every leg of our cancer journey. Tomorrow will be the start of my 1st radiation treatment (RT). I thought I was going in for only 3 weeks, but found out today that I was scheduled for 4 weeks (3 weeks whole breast radiation and 1 week booster). I informed my Radiation Oncologist that I had psyche myself up for 3 weeks, and depending on how it goes, will decide later whether I want the booster or not. So, if those of you out there have had booster, could you please share your experience and whether it was worth it for you ? Thank you in advance @!!@  Above left: Me in the simulation room before adj markings. Above right: Me in the simulation room after adjusted markings  Above left: View of me in prone position being marked. Above Right: My Breast After Marking Adjustments Could you see the naturalness of my reconstructed breast that was beautifully done using the Round Block Technique after breast conserving surgery (BCS aka lumpectomy)? Doesn't it looks just like my normal left breast below? The pic above and below will enable you to make this comparison. My right breast (which is your left if you are looking at it) is the breast I had lumpectomy. Could you also see the 4 inch scar above (was 5 inch) from the sentinel lymph node surgery from this angle? I regretted not asking my SO to refrain from taking any nodes if I had clear margins (which I did).. My oversight caused the loss of one precious sentinel lymph node - even this loss of just 1 node resulted in my right arms being somewhat stiffer and not as strong as before. That's why I'm a strong advocate of not losing any nodes if you can ever help it. If you have a choice to save it, protect it, please please do so and not give it up lightly. You'll only know if you read a lot about it, and educate yourself and give it careful thoughts, and not leave this decision to others...I guess I didn't read enough about the significance of clear margins at that time. I hope you will learn from my expensive oversight. Please be aware it is standard procedure to take out margins and sentinel nodes. You just have to find out what the policy is for the hospital you go to - and then decide what sort of clear margins is clear to make this decision. 0.8mm-10mm can be considered clear, from my readings, that is. Some people would say 0.5mm but I'll chose the higher standard.   My entire right breast areola was cut out during surgery by my SO (pix below, see the scaring around it which is healing nicely) so she could take out the tumor in the upper right quadrant from that angle. Thereafter, my Onco-plastic surgeon immediately did reconstructive surgery using fat from within the breast by re-arranging it. The areola was then stitched back using dissolvable sutures, and glued over with medical glue to protect the sutures. The latter eventually fell off by itself. My right breast is supposed to be smaller than my left breast (your left if you are looking at this pix). From this pix taken today, it seems as though my right reconstructed breast is slightly bigger than my normal left breast isn't it. That's due to the swelling within. When the scar around the areola heals completely, it will look as natural as my left areola-- so I was told by my SO. However I was also told by my RO that during radiation, that the right breast will also swell and so will be bigger than my left breast. When the swelling subside, it will eventually become a size smaller again. That if I'm lucky, it may just return to a size similar to my left breast. Interesting, isn't it? I discovered \"lucky\" to mean the hardening from within...I thought about it....and need to find out why. The line in the center of my chest is tentatively marked during simulation for a supine position. In the end, I opted for the safer prone position above so my lungs won't be scarred from radiation. Patients who have mastectomy who have to undergo radiotherapy most likely have to do it in the supine position (lying on your back). Consequently, the chances of getting lung scarring is higher. One suggestion is to find out about the total dosage (gray) given for the entire treatment, and asked to have radiation over a longer period at a lower dosage. Please go to the National Library of Medicine PubMed section and search for clinical articles with respect to this that will give you more info to help you come to a decision for your own case. P.S. In case you are wondering, I was wearing my black head scarf during simulation. On actual RAD, I was told I will have to take it off. @!!@ PPS. My MO said I should consult with my RO to see if CT Scan for lungs can be scheduled with him. I spoke with the radiology department manager about it. She said that I will be getting a full CT Scan of my lungs upon the completion of radiotherapy anyway. If, however, I would like one sooner, I can speak with my RO (her boss) next Wednesday when I get to see him. Apparently, after every week of radiation, i'm scheduled to have a follow up visit with him to check on how my breast is taking these radiation beams. Will report back.. POST CHEMO UPDATE: The excessive sweating I've been experiencing throughout the day has not abated. In fact, it's so bad that I have to wipe it a few times a day. The only time is when I sit under the fan to cool off. I only take cold showers. But at night, when I sleep, my head does sweat so much when it's hot that I have to fold a towel as a pillow and lay my head on it to prevent the bedsheet and mattress from getting wet. Let's see how long this continues. Will report back. PPPS. Thanks for visiting... Sending good wishes to all my fellow members currently undergoing radiation therapy as well :-))  PPPPS - 09/11/2015 - I just wanted to come back and add that after speaking with several of the radiation therapists, they've informed me that this machine they are using, well, they can program it in such a way that they can block radiation from getting into sections of the lungs or inner chest walls for patients in the supine position. Wow, that's really great news. I'll ask some more when I visit the center again...Please standby.",

      "Content": "Aug 12, 2015 11:50AM - edited Sep 28, 2015 07:10AM by NATSGSG UPDATE: RAD #1 of 15 Sessions , August 12, 2015 --> EXTERNAL BEAM RADIATION THERAPY FINALLY, the start of another day of reckoning of the 3rd Leg of my BC journey. I have posted pictures below of today's treatment for interested members. 1) Unlike chemo, there is no blood test needed. 2) There was no need to buy any camies as the markings are well and cleanly done as you can see in the pic posted during simulation. 3) 100% aloe Vera is great to use after each radiation. If you can find freshly cut aloe vera leaves, thats even better. Thereafter, emu and other non fragrant moisturising cream or oil work just as great. Treatment schedule, which was generated yesterday Aug 11, was given to me (see pix below). Reported @1025 hours this morning at the Radiation Oncology Department (ROD) where my RADs case officer met up with me to explain the entire registration, check-in, gown changing etc. procedure. I was introduced to the entire team of 5 Radiation Therapists who will be working with/on me over the next 3-4 weeks. Didn't had to wait long, and was quickly taken to \"The Room.\" I was again lying in the prone position. Since my back has all the tattoo markings needed for alignment, and since adjustment markings from yesterday's simulation were done, the entire process to get me ready for RAD #1 took only about 10 minutes. After I was properly aligned, several X-ray pictures were taken of my position to affirm exact alignment before my 1 minute radiation kicked in. This team of RTs seem to be more experienced than the simulation team who had worked on me yesterday at the other location next to my cancer canter. Wow, I thought, \"That didn't take long!?\" I must admit that I could feel the warm seeping into my breast when radiation hit. Then it was over. And I went back to change out of my gown - and was pleasantly surprised that I was out as quickly as I came. During changing, I applied a liberal amount of 100% aloe vera gel to my entire breast. Throughout the entire afternoon, I continue to apply either emu oil or aloe vera. It did get warm and itchy in the area between my breast and where the sentinel lymph node scar was later that evening. Applying these cream kept the itchiness down. I did feel a little fatigue late afternoon, and slept for about an hour and a half or so. Hope any SE will be fewer and imperceptible - will see ... I've also added pix of the planned images taken yesterday of how the radiation beams was and will be directed at my breast. It's interesting to know the details of such things - to me at least, as I want to know everything that's being done to any part of my body in any kind of treatment or treatment plan. Although in one of the pix, I was somewhat concerned about the yellow line where it was too close to the edge of my right lung. I asked my case officer if the photon beams could be adjusted downwards a little as I don't want it touching the surface of my lung. She believes it wouldn't but that she would mention it to my RO...I truly hope it was adjusted today as I don't really want any scaring on the lung... Will see how it goes from here. I'm totally keeping my fingers crossed as it does seem to be easier than chemo. The SEs that I've read seem bearable. Though it would be fantastic not to have any at all...@@!!@@ This Oncology Department has teams of the following to service all patients: (a) Radiation Oncologist - Dr. who takes overall charge of your treatment. (b) Radiation Therapists - the team who do the planning and administer patient treatment through radiation machines. (c) Nursing staff - are there to attend to patients' need eg wound dressing, giving medication, injection etc. where needed. They also help to coordinate patient treatment. (d) Physicist - ensures that radiation machines work properly and accurately. (e) Dosimetrist - works closely with RO to calculate and plan patient treatment. ============================================================ (1) Below is a pix of my radiotherapy schedule with dates/times.  (2) Pix 2 & 3 below are images of my planned CT Scan showing the Angle of Entry/Exit of the radiation beam for Phase I and Phase II of radiation treatment . The different colored lines in the left pix indicate the gradual radiation of the whole breast over the entire treatment, The red patch in the lower right pic shows the location where the booster will be given (ex tumor location) in the final week (Phase II) of treatment, should I choose to do it.  (3) Below are are actual pictures of RAD #1 taken of me today inside the RAD's Room this morning. The machine can move 360 degrees to take X-ray pictures as well as directing the RAD beam to the area of treatment. That's because the table height can also be adjusted. When the machine is stationery, it is as shown in the picture to the left below, The machine will first moves counter clockwise to just below where my right breast is dropping down from the table. The first delivery of 2.67 grays of radiation beams (via 6 megavolts to a depth of 1.5 cm!) will shoot from the left side of my right breast, exiting through the right (as in the planned images) in a diagonal direction.  Then, the machine moves clockwise down to more than 100 degree or so below where my right breast is (pix below) before delivering another burst of more radiation (aka high energy photons), this time entering from the right and exiting to the left..  Hope these pictures help to give you some idea of radiotherapy. Do take care, and all the best to anyone out there travelling this part of your journey as well. @!!@",

This morning, my relatives and I walked to the National Stadium to join the more than 150 people in the weekly free intensive cardio and zumba work out. I found that I can resume some jumping, hoping, swinging, buttock twirling and so forth. It was a fun work-out. Even though my RO had asked me not to do strenuous weight training at the gym, I'm going to go this afternoon anyway to see if I can still lift some weights with my right hand. Of course, I have to be careful not to \"strain\" my right breast. Throughout this entire journey, I discover that having cancer does not mean we cannot do the things we want...As long as we remain optimistic and determine, and continue to read ahead, understand and ask questions of each type of treatment we will be getting or consider getting, our own pro-activity can make our journey less frightening and more pleasing...and yes, I will admit that once in a while, I do experience the blues out of nowhere, but they are really very short-lived. @!!@  ",

Although many people said that getting into position takes time, at this radiation department, it was a pretty much quick in-and-out, taking only about 10 minutes - bearing in mind that radiation time took only a minute or so (thanks to pre-markings and simulation adjustments done before the start of radiotherapy). After I was done, I asked for permission to re-take pictures of my right breast CT Planning images coz I want to use it for a project I am working on. As always, after changing out of the gown, I generously applied the 100% Aloe Vera gel onto the radiated breast. It has worked so far. No redness, some very, very mild painless swelling, and no more itchiness that I had during RADs #1 and #2. Application of the gel soothe the itchiness. Since then it has not returned There was a little dryness initially, but that too has disappeared. Aside from the gel, I also use non fragrant moisturizing cream and oil. These seem to work so far too. Afterwards, I walked over to the National Heart Center next door to my Cancer Center to see if I can get images of the Transthoracic Echocardiogram (aka TTE) that I had done back in July 23, 2015. ...and I was able to do do... Thus, I'm sharing it here with anyone interested to know what TTE images are like. The images below is only a partial segment coz it's quite detail. I'm gonna go over it the next few days in conjunction with the copy of the results my MO had given me to back in Aug 3, 2015 to further educate myself during my free time. Below are images of my Transthoracic Echocardiogram done back in July 23, 2015. There are 112 images in all. I am only posting 2 image segments to give interested members some idea of what your sonographer will take of your heart and its valves. When I click on those images that have a play button, I can see my heart beating...it was truly amazing!! The sonographer applied a gel-like substance similar to the ultrasound gel use by an OB/GYN when one has ultrasound to look at our fetus. But of course mine is being applied over the region of my heart.   MORE POST CHEMO Update: It's been more than 6 weeks since my last chemo. I am very happy to report that the stickiness on my scalp is finally gone, gone, gone...I am happy to also report that my hair is growing, and they have completely covered my scalp. Even though they are short (about 1/2 inch), they are soooo furry soft. I was surprised to see many fine stray stands of 2 inches length hair all around my head too. I'm not complaining. It reminded me of the time after my daughter was born when she had no eye lashes for 4 months or so, and then one day, her long lashes suddenly sprouted out..... I absolutely love touching my new hair every day @!!@ I've started on a salad and fruit diet to try and lose the 6 pounds I've put on during chemo :-(( sigh....I hope it will be successful....keeping my fingers crossed. ******** Looking back thus far, I have enjoyed learning more about myself and my journey. When I was first diagnosed, I told myself that I will make the best of it, learn from it along the way, and do whatever it takes TO PROTECT MY BODY. I have every intention of continuing along the same mentality as I want it to be a very meaningful one, so that when I eventually get to look back at it sometime down the road, I want to feel pride instead of bitterness, of the joy of making it through instead of fear of not making it through, and awe of life instead of regrets...yes, that's how I want to feel.... Thanks for visiting. Please take care, and sending you the best throughout....@!!@ P.S. Will post when I am able to get pictures of my bone scans from the radiologist's office, and MUGA scans from the",

Now, I'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS PART ALREADY... As I was writing these experiences elsewhere, it suddenly occurred to me that I should share them as it happens, here in this section, which are: pre-surgery, surgery, post-surgery, pre-chemo, chemo, post-chemo, pre-radiation, during radiation, post radiation, post treatment and so forth. If I can help to alleviate your fear at this point in your life, then I am happy to have contributed. Please bear in mind that since every patient's cancer is different in terms of grade, tumor size, ER/PR, HER2 status, genes and other critical info. that should be the basis of your treatments. Some fellow members may have more serious diagnosis than I, others may have less serious diagnosis. In the end, our experiences and journey will be different. However, you will, at the minimum, be sent for some of these tests I've already done (see under My Diagnosis). STILL, getting an early overview CAN enable you to prepare for what's ahead, and for you to craft your journey THE WAY YOU WANT... *** Please remember that this is only one person's journey to give you some idea @!@ The National Library of Medicine's(NLM) pubmed section have tons and tons of scientific info relating to practically every type of cancer topics and combination that you can read & harness...YES! This effort requires much of your time, and you must do it quickly too...naturally, you will be feeling very anxious. Who wouldn't? But in your anxiety, may I suggest that you read to reduce that anxiety coz you would at least feel you are doing something, and adding towards your own knowledge of the what, where and how of your upcoming journey..... Also, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) too have much more detail (not general info) of cancer than any other sites that are quite worth your time to visit. ***There is a \"new\" custom cancer treatment which is a current hot topic, with seemingly fewer side effects, called IMMUNOTHERAPY. If this is of interest to you, the link that follows has a very comprehensive VIDEO symposium of this exciting therapy entitled Cancer Immunology & Immunotherapy: Delivery the Promise chaired by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). I genuinely believe it's worth your time watching as it is moving in the possible direction of \"custom cancer therapy\"...such hope by so many dedicated and passionate immunologists, doctors, scientists and researchers that their work could bring to us cancer patients..... videocast.nih.gov/summary.asp?... videocast.nih.gov/summary.asp?... https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/147/topic/831945?page=1#idx_24 To continue, I have had 1st consult with my Surgical Oncologist (SO) on March 5th, all the various and necessary tests between that and my Biopsy (March 9th) and surgery to remove the tumor & lumpectomy reconstructive surgery (done simultaneously on March 25 by my SO and the Onco-plastic Surgeon - OPS). They are written under May 4th, 2015 Chemo #2 section below. I am lucky that all these moved rather quickly at my Cancer Center because all the doctor specialists work as a team here i.e. My SO, OPS, Medical Oncologist (MO) and Radiation Oncologist (RO). I am also fortunate in that everyone of these specialists who saw me are the Senior Doctors of their respective department. My recommendation is that wherever possible, try to find a hospital that has a team of specialist such as mine for it will make your visit far easier to coordinate, as oppose to having to run and drive here and there, which can place even more stresses on you. If it is not possible, then try to plan the location within distance of each other. On Monday, April 27th, 2015, I started my 1st chemotherapy. Details are written below as well. It may seem like I'm jumping the gun here for you. BUT, I strongly feel that if you have more ideas of this journey you will be embarking on, then I have no doubt that it'd be easier to travel forward. I have included a lot of details that I hope can help you know what you need to do when it's your turn. Some of the terms and names of drugs will seem daunting to you now, but believe me, you will want to learn all these terms, names and procedures very, very quickly. When I first came to this forum page, I tried to find such details of each segment of others' journey, but was unable to. Which is why I wanted to do it this way. Also, at the very bottom are listed several links for you to go to, including one discussing various oncoplastic surgical methods available for breast reconstruction after lumpectomy based on your tumor location and size...Forgive me, if some of you may find my info too lengthy. While you are waiting, this very site has a pdf on Your Guide to the Breast Cancer Pathology Report. Please download, save and print it out. It is a terrific guide to keep you up to speed very quickly about your cancer. Keep it by you so you can look at it again and again until you remember the terminologies. This pdf did help me very much to acquaint me of the basics of cancer in the initial leg of my journey. So, I believe it will be useful to you too. http://www.breastcancer.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&term=how+to+read+patholigy+report&commit=Search Regardless, I wish you well. MAY PEACE & STRENGTH BE WITH US, & KNOWLEDGE TO GUIDE US IN OUR EVERY DECISION...^!!^ **M Y *** I N I T I A L *** D I A G N O S I S** Stage IIA, Grade 3, IDC, tumor size 2.5, 2.6 and 3.0 cm respectively (via MRI, Ultrasound, Mammograpm) Pre-Biopsy: Had ultrasound, MRI, bone scan (pix at bottom), chest X-ray, full blood test (FBT), mammogram, abdominal ultrasound test done. Post-Biopsy: Confirmed IDC with some degree of DCI. tumor malignant, ER/PR - (negative) HER2 + (positive 90%), No genetic testing for BRCA1 (BReast CAncer gene 1) and BRCA2 (BReast CAncer gene 2) since there is no family history. Possible lymphovascular involvement.Surgery: Confirmed malignant tumor size 2.5 cm, 4.5 cm taken out with margins, 0/1 Sentinel Node, NO ALND authorized, Lumpectomy, Right Breast Reconstruction via the Round-Block Technique. Healing gradually + beautifully. Post-Surgery Recovery Time Before Chemo Start: Asked for 4 weeks recovery time for breast to heal before chemo starts. My MO originally wanted me to start chemo in 1-2 weeks, but I declined. I wanted my lumpectomy and reconstructed breast to heal some more first.. Pre-Chemo: Had Full Blood Test (FBT) and MUGA tests done before Chemo #1. FBT and weight + height must be taken every time before each chemo. Follow up visit with MO every 3 weeks to review chemo progress, to discuss previous FBT, and to make any adjustments to treatment plan (TP) where needed.CHEMO DRUGS: 9-12 Weeks of Concurrent weekly cycle of Herceptin + Paclitaxel. Please see my spreadsheet at bottom of this thread, listed in infusion order + dosage amount. Herceptin doses are calculated based one's weight = total dosage. Initial Herceptin dosage (1st chemo) usually higher. Subsequent dosages are lesser and remain the same thereafter. Please ask your doctor to give you the details.. For paclitaxel (a taxane drug) both weight & height are used to calculate your dosages.. After chemo completion, I was sent for a Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE) to test for cardiotoxicity from Herceptin. Post Chemo Recovery Time B4 Radiotherapy: Asked for 5 weeks recovery time before starting radiotherapy. Again, my cancer center is good about not making me start radiation therapy when I was not ready. Since chemo already takes a lot out of our body, I wanted mine to heal as much as possible before proceeding onto the next stage. I strongly urge that you please consider and think through all these timelines. If you are weak from chemo, best to let your body heal first. Otherwise, you might feel overwhelm by it all. Of course, if you feel otherwise, you don't have to take my word for it. Everyone should gauge their own strength and ability... What I'm trying to say is you do not have to accept the start date of chemo or radiation. Let your body be your guide. and never be afraid of pushing back the timeline as long as it does not compromise your treatment. PRE-RADIATION: Sent for CT planning scans and markings to my body. A day before actual radiation, had simulation done to make adjustments to markings to ensure accuracy of RT. RADs started on Aug 12, 2015. *******AND SO THE JOURNEY BEGINS ...******** When I was first diagnosed with breast cancer in Feb 26th, I flew home on Mar 1st to get treatment at my Cancer Center there. After my 1st consult with my Surgical Oncologist (SO), I was sent for test after test within the first 2 weeks : Bone-scan test, full blood test, Chest X-ray, ECG, mammograms, abdomen ultrasounds, and so forth, followed by Biopsy^^. Since my SO (a most approachable elegant lady) had to fly to Europe for a conference, she informed me that her colleague, an Onco-plastic Surgeon (OPS) will cover for her for a week. That she will discuss the results of all my tests. At first, my OPS informed me that \"most people choose to do a mastectomy...\" I was aghast at even the thought of anyone not even attempting to save their breast especially if it is saveable. I immediately replied that I won't even consider it, that my SO was already aware of it and end of discussion. Then she presented another option \u2013 & that was to do neoadjuvant** chemo >> surgery >> chemo >> radiation (**Neoadjuvant Therapy - the purpose of which is to shrink the 2.5 cm tumor). Having pre-read about the effects of chemo, I declined this option as I did not wish to go into surgery in a weakened physical state. Also, based on my research, since my tumor size is of 2.5 cm, at one location, and my breast is not small, neo-adjvant was not a necessity. True, I have the most aggressive type of cancer \u2013 Grade 3 and HER2+. I had made it very clear during my initial consult with my 1st SO that I wanted breast conserving surgery BCS (aka lumpectomy, of which I had spent many hours reading about prior to the first consult). I understood that that would be contingent upon whether cancer has spread or not into the Sentinel Lymph Nodes. ^^^Please read my post entitled \" EVERYTHING U WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT LYMPH NODES\" below where I have pasted an enlightening and wonderful article by a group of doctors, along with their link. NOTE: I might have considered neo-adjuvant therapy had my tumor size been > 4.0 cm. Our breast size is among one of the factors determining whether it's advisable to go for neo-adjuvant or not. ^^ Biopsy was a painless 10-15 mins outpatient procedure. First, a local anesthesia using lignocaine was given. Then a 0.5 cm incision was made. Next, my SO used an ultrasound guided fine needle procedure to do the biopsy. The ultrasound is to accurately guide the needle into the tumor to take out 5-6 cores of tumor cells from various angles for pathological analysis. These cores are later examined for the type of hormone receptor for estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) (positive or negative), for the HER2 status (positive or negative), for cancer genes and other relevant info. These results generally determine the course of one's (probably standard) treatment. The incision heals within 24-48 hours. In my case, the results came back within 4 work days. You could always ask your doctor's office to call and inform you of your results, ahead of your scheduled appointment. This then gives you enough time to start your research before your meeting with your SO. If they say they would prefer to wait until you see your doctor to discuss, insists very clearly that they give, fax or email it to you too (nicely). Some office will cite \"it is not their policy\" and so forth. But you insist on being given because (a) you have the right to it, (b) you PAID for it and (c) you are an adult and they should not be treating you like a child. After you get it, start reading the details, and start getting yourself so well verse in your own case (there's a link below on how to read & understand pathology reports). I further suggest that you going to pubmed (in NLM) to do your research on standard and alternative treatments. If you spend enough time researching, you may even come across a treatment plan that was used before, and may even be applicable to yourself or your love one(s). That was how I found my treatment plan, from a proven clinical trial that is adopted by the New Zealand Pharmaceutical Agency for cancers similar to mine. If you really want to be proactive and protect your body, that's what you will do. And you will NEVER, under any circumstances, GIVE UP on yourself or your love one(s). That's the committed kind of proactivity you will engage in when you love yourself or your love ones. Example of possible ER/PR and HER2 combinations are - - -/ - - +/ + - +/ + + + / - + - / + + - DO BE sure to get hard copies of results of every test you are asked to do. Keep them in a file in chronological order. Learning to read and understand the results of our pathological reports ahead of time puts us at an advantage in that when we meet up with our doctor, we'd already know what further questions we wish to ask. For me, I quite rather enjoy this part of the learning process. The 3rd option was presented: surgery >> chemo >> radiation. This was the preference I had in mind all along, after my research. (although at that time, I still wasn't sure about whether I even wanted radiation if I had chemo). So we discussed my upcoming surgery, to be performed by my SO, and breast reconstruction, to be performed by her, now my OPS. She explained all surgical risks involved, type of anesthesia, about SLND, ALND, breast reconstruction details and how she was going to do it and why she elected the method in question, estimated total surgery time, estimated recovery time, and other related info. In my questions to her about SLND, I discovered that my cancer center's protocol during surgery is this -- in addition to taking out the tumor with an all around 1 cm margin, between 1 to 4 sentinel lymph nodes will also be taken out. It is then tested on the spot to see if cancer cells have spread. That if EVEN 1 sentinel node is found to be positive (cancerous), my doctor(s) will immediately proceed to do a complete axillary dissection. This means that the ENTIRE lymph nodes from the breast upwards to ones' underarm will be taken out. Every BC patient can have from between 20 to 40 nodes, some perhaps even more. That's an awful lot of precious nodes to be cut out of one's body, and NOT a decision I would lightly give without serious due consideration. This is especially critical by virtue of the fact that lymph nodes do not re-generate, and once taken out, would be gone forever! I think this is how my SO determines the no. of sentinel nodes to remove. If the tumor with margins removed comes back with clear margins, then only 1 lymph node is removed for further testing to ensure that that is so. If the margins are too close to call (meaning cancer has spread more than halfway to margins), then more sentinel nodes are cut out for testing. If those nodes come back negative, no axillary will be done, If, however, those nodes are positive (even 1), then axillary are automatically done unless you specifically not give permission for it (as in my own case). ^^^Please refer to the picture below for the location of our lymphatic system. See those green colored bean-shape cells at 45 degrees from the left and right breast towards the arms. Well, that's all those nodes that will be taken out as well as those in the underarms, whichever that arm will be. It's not meant to scare you. Its meant to make you MORE AWARE of what's AT STAKE here. These pictures were taken from MissBennettScience ppt presentation and graysanatomyonline.com From all that I have read of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), it's a very, very scary thing because once the nodes are taken out, they're gone forever, and will NEVER regenerate. In addition, the underarm without the axillary nodes will essentially be weak and your entire arm cannot lift anything over 5 pounds. Also, you cannot have any blood extracted, or infusion or vaccines done to it, and you have keep exercising it to reduce or prevent lymphedema. I was not prepared for that to happen and decided I will do whatever I can to keep my axillary nodes. When my OPS went on to explain how she was going to re-construct my breast (which was quite different from the method recommended in current literature ), and explain how her method** will make my breast look more natural and closer in size to my left breast, I was not really listening because I had thought it would be done that awful way. But when she repeated that it would be quite good, I was fascinated though I really had no idea what she was talking about. I thought well, if she can make my breast looks better than current practice, I wont complain. So I asked her the name of the technique and made a mental note to read up more about it. Thereafter, I was asked if I had any questions, before being asked to sign the Patient Consent Form (for surgery, SLND and ALND clearance). ^^^ Now that I have had my reconstructive surgery, I will say that my OPS did a fantastic job on the reconstruction of my right breast. I am a size 38D. After the surgery that took out the 2.5 +1+1 cm = 4.5 cm or 20% (1/5) of my right breast, it is now a 36D (see pix much further below). Can you believe it? God, the method she used, called the the Round Block Technique, retains the natural looks of my right breast. I have a scar around my areola from where the incision was made, and from where the tumor was taken out. But this scar can fade with the application of the Mederma Scar Fading cream, but I have to wait for the incision to heal first before applying. Current literature recommends cutting from the top or wherever the tumor is located, which leaves one's breast with a very ugly pothole and/or distortion, where-ever it is cut out. NOT SO with the method my OPS did. As of this writing, my nipple, areola and breast still retain it's sensation. That's the beauty of this method. I'd be more than willing to send you a picture in my private email if you wish to see it. I gave my SO permission to use pictures of it in any conference presentation she will make in the near future. I think any method that can preserve one's breast beautifully, and make it less distorted is a welcome thing for us breast cancer patients, agree? ^^^It has just occured to me that should you choose the flap BCS or other methods where flesh are taken from your abdomen or other areas, please ensure that your lymph nodes in those areas are not disturbed or inadvertently taken out as well. Please check with your OPS to ensure that this does not happen. You really don't want those good nodes \"accidentally\" taken out because they are really an important part of our lymphatic system and our body. You will see why after you read the link on \"Everything U Want to know about lymph nodes\" posted below. Note: However, if you have had SLND or ANLD dissection, then doing arm exercises are a must. They helped to facilitate healing your underarm faster, and to reduce and/or prevent the chances of lymphedema. It is to your advantage to start exercising the arms the very next day after surgery. Your physiotherapist will likely be the one to show you some of these exercises before your discharge. I only stayed a night for my surgery. For some people, you may feel painful after surgery and thus may be reluctant to move... So, olease do just a little at a time than none at all as lymphedema is not a pleasant condition to have. \"Lymphedema aka lymphatic obstruction, is a condition of localized fluid retention and tissue swelling caused by a compromised lymphatic system, which normally returns interstitial fluid to the thoracic duct and then the bloodstream.\" - from Wikipedia. I have posted alternative exercise pictures link under the Fitness and Getting Back in Shape section of this Forum Page that I found that could be useful. Truth be told, I did not sleep at all for 2 nights about the ALND consent. I went into the NLM website under PUBMED and read for hours and hours about SNLN and ALND. I found new literature stating that even if 1/4 (meaning one of four) , 2/4, 3/4 sentinel nodes are positive DOES NOT NECESSARILY JUSTIFY AN ENTIRE AXILLARY lymph nodes dissection (i.e. removal) under certain conditions^^^. These articles provided strong and compelling explanation and alternatives to ALND. With that in mind, I called and left a message with my SO's nurses (she was in conference in Europe remember? ) that I wanted to cancel the ALND portion of the patient consent form. ^^^ These NCI & NLM link offers more articles about sentinel and axillary nodes: http://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/diagnosis-staging/staging/sentinel-node-biopsy-fact-sheet http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=sentinel+lym... To further continue, My surgery was scheduled for 1500 hours on Wed, March 25. My message to my SO was on Sunday, March 23. I even wrote her an email to make sure she got my message. My SO returned my call immediately after her Monday morning surgery. Naturally, she asked why. I told her my findings and my concerns. She respected it, and asked me to think through and give her my answer on the day of surgery. Come surgery day, just before I went under, she asked** if I still wanted to cancel axillary clearance. I said yes, and she brought my consent form, cancelled the ALND part of consent, had me initialed it in front of the surgical team, and told me they will still give me the care that I deserve, and that we can re-visit this issue after results of the SNLD comes back in a week's time. If I not cancelled, then the SNLD results would be instantaneous. I said that I understood it all. I felt so relieved for having done that before I was placed under general anesthesia. I 've also requested my SO to please take a picture of my tumor as I want to know what the sucker looked like (see below bottom) Tumor and reconstructive surgery were performed consecutively that day by both my Surgical Oncologist & Oncoplastic Surgeon respectively. It saved time, pain and money. Surgery took about 2.5 hours with another 2 hours recovery time. I awoke about 5 hours later in my ward. My SO stopped by to check on my breast again before leaving. I experienced only a low grade pain that was quite bearable. The nurses came to check on me periodically. Had a good hospital porridge dinner. Had to pee in a bedpan over the next 2.5 hours or so until I could go to the restroom myself. My SO's residents came early the next morning to check on breast. She too came with her senior resident in her morning ward round. I felt relaxed and so well cared for throughout. **If my SO did not bring up the subject of the ALND cancellation, then that means my SO didn't get my message. So it is up to me to bring the subject up. Do not be afraid to do so when you are absolutely convinced of your decision. As a patient, you have every right to make changes to any part of any procedure you are uncomfortable. I wanted my surgery to proceed, sans ALND, that's all. I'm not encouraging you to change your mind without rhyme or reason. You must take the time to weight in the consequences. Post surgery visit a week later with my 1st SO gave me the best news I've ever had. I had clear margins and the 1 node taken out was negative. I will say too that that 2.5 cm cancer grew sometime during last August 2014 when I felt the unusual itchiness and growing lump in my right breast, but chosen to ignore it. I have myself to blame for postponing my bi-annual mammogram because I was studying for my GRE, and doing other things. Once that was over in January this year, then went to have it checked up in mid Feb 2015 while I was in Beijing. Ultrasound showed tumor. Had MRI done confirming cancer. So I flew back home beginning March. Well, better late than never. Excuse the detour, but back to what I was saying. With this cancer, I don't intend to be passive where my body is concerned. Like many of you, my world was shattered and all the plans that I had been making had to be put on pause. For instance, I was so looking forward to getting (hopefully) my Ph.D in Education Leadership scholarship at Harvard University for the 2015-2016 school year to which I have applied, and joining my daughter back in the States, amongst the many other ambitious plans I have. So getting news of breast cancer sucks! sucks! sucks! big time. After the initial shock and some tears, I decided from that VERY moment on, that I wanted to be in charge of this part of my life's journey. That it was no time for self-pity. I knew that I will be as pro-active as I can. I will not accept everything that was recommended to me without understanding why, without checking on its validity. I will guard and protect MY BODY at all times. No one will do this job better and with more enthusiasm than I, ourselves. That is not to say that the majority of doctors in this field are not doing their job.They are, and to the best of their abilities, and within the confines of the available time they have. Oftentimes, they are so very busy having to deal with so many details of so many different types, stages, grades of cancer patients and procedures that I believe they are overwhelmed, thus making it even harder for them to keep up too. The adoption of standard treatment plans are thus inevitable. I'm not saying that that is bad. I'm saying that by helping ourselves through reading and researching from as many legitimate sources as we can, and even recognizing bias reports and trials especially from the tons of information available from the National Library of Medicine (NLM), we are doing ourselves a very important favor. We can engage in intelligent conversations with our very busy SOs, MOs, ROs and all the specialists we will have to deal with throughout this entire journey. It is not short a journey by any means. It is emotionally, physically and psychologically taxing, exhausting and at times stressful. So, isn't protecting our physical selves worth our time? Isn't knowing what's being done to us and put into us better for us? I do realize that reading medical reports and clinical trials are daunting or difficult for some people. but please, please, please try, try harder. Really, it's not so bad after all. If you treat it as another learning process, something to acquire to your benefit, you may just find this world of medicine interesting, albeit not by choice. It is important that you involve your spouse (or family) and children (depending on their ages) in this process. When you educate yourself, can you then help them understand the process and what they can expect to happen to you to prepare them so that they, in turn, can provide the support you will need. You must try To be their anchor wherever possible. If not, ask your spouse or family to be the anchor for the family. If you're having lumpectomy or mastectomy, read it first yourself and then explain to him/them. If you hold yourself together, you are giving them strength as well. Believe that you are capable, believe in your own strength, just believe. If your spouse or family member can accompany you during your consult with the SOs, MOs and other specialists, that would be great. Always try to make a list of questionnaires to bring along. Listen to their recommendations, but asks why. If you have been reading up, you would then have some idea of what you'll want? If what is being recommended is not what you want, asks about your alternatives. Great doctors will listen to your concerns, and address it, NOT push it aside or insists that only his TP will work for you. In the beginning, my MO kept harping on my Grade 3 HER2+ cancer aggressiveness which I was already very aware, and wanted me on the 12 months Herceptin plan. But because I read and done my research (quite thoroughly I believe), I wouldn't budged. I explained my points, and why I wanted the plan I had chosen. I sent him articles based on clinical facts and statistics that supported my decision. We \"conversated\" via email for about a week, back and forth until we both reached a compromise that are acceptable to us. I am grateful for the patience my MO extends to me, as did my 2 SOs. Throughout it all, I feel like a part of their team, and that I can approach them anytime. I am truly blessed our paths crossed. I hope you too will find the doctors who will give you the care you deserve. Do not give up on your search. You would instinctively know during the 1st consult if the Dr. you are speaking with is the doctor who will care for you. I went online to look up the credentials of all the doctors at my cancer center, their education and work background, their experiences should be clearly stated in their website. From my experience, I have found that when I can engage my doctors, they love it! And they are willing to discuss my findings with me, and more willing to come to a compromise with me. Great doctors would, anyway. There will be a few doctors who will feel defensive or hostile when we start asking questions. If that is the case, I besiege you to find another doctor who won't have this attitude towards you. You m-u-s-t ! Your life thereafter depends on it. It will make a BIG difference on how you will experience this journey, and you'll want to make the most of it. Doctors who treat you as a member of his team, NOT just a number, will make this unpleasant journey, PLEASANT, so pleasant that you won't dread going in for tests, for surgeries, for therapies. This journey is something that you are unlikely to forget for the rest of your life because the scars will be there to remind you of it. So, as strange as it is to say this - you'll want it to be an unforgettable yet pleasant experience that won't cause you to be sad, or frustrated or bitter. At the end of it all, you want to be able to say, \"YES, I've conquered and survived it ! I'm stronger and it wasn't so bad after all.\" You paid for it, for the entire treatment, one way or another. So, you have the right to expect professionalism and empathy at all times and not be treated as a sub-species of the human race. How to find these doctors? Ask around \u2013 your friends, colleagues, neighbors, relatives, even from forum pages,and your GPs. That means there are a lot of legwork that must be done before embarking on this journey, before your first visit to good , patient specialists, including your commute time, their availability after office hours, what timeframe can you can expect to get answers to your questions and so forth. You'll want to find a medical practice where most of the doctors and their nurses who will go that extra mile to make your journey less frightening. Whenever anyone recommends any specialist doctor to you, ask what it is about them that make them special. NEVER be afraid to ask, ask, ask, and clarify until you are satisfied. NEVER, NEVER EVER short change yourself, no matter how tired you are, please. But you too must do your part to educate yourself since doctors cannot explain everything to you as they allocate certain amount of time for each patient. You could find which days are less busy for them so they'll have more time should you think you have lots of questions. I generally like to get the first appointment in the morning or after lunch or the last appointment of the day, wherever possible. Finally, I am only sharing my experience thus far with you. There will be members out there who may disagree with my decisions and what I have written They have every right to be since we are all different in our cancer stages, grades and so forth. We all choose what we are most comfortable with. So, if you are here to want to share your experiences, I truly welcome it because it enriches my life. But if you are here just to criticize, I respectfully ask that you refrain from it. Please go start your own thread and offer another perspective.P.S. Please leave me a comment to let me know if the above section is helpful to you. Thank you. ***S T A R T *** O F *** C H E M O T H E R A P Y *** April 13, 2015 - Ist Consultation with my Medical Oncologist (MO) to discuss treatment plan. We discussed much about the treatment he wanted me to be on, and the treatment I want to be on. Eventually, he asked me to think over our discussion and to give him an answer of the TP. April 15, 2015: Sent for a MUGA test and Full Blood Count Test (FBC or CBC)April 20, 2015: 2nd Consultation with MO to review the results of MUGA and FBC. Given OK to proceed to chemo. We finally agree on a TP as listed below. ******March 27th, 2015: CHEMO # 1****** Initial Duration: 4.5 hours (including pre-chemo questionnaires + pre-medication infusion) Treatment Plan: 12 weeks weekly cycle of concurrent Herceptin + Paclitaxel (the synergies of these two drugs have proven to give better results for HER2+ patients per FinHer clinical trial. Details reasons given below under Chemo #2). Dosages for Herceptin is based on one's weight (@ 2mg/kg), and for paclitaxel based on one's weight & height (@80mg/m2 - there's a formula which was given to me after I asked about it). (I) Pre-Herceptin Medication: Panadol (2 oral) + Diphenhydramine (25 mg, aka Benedryll) 30 mins, including recovery time. The purpose of these is to help patient deal with the chills and cold that Herceptin can caused. (II) Herceptin: 60 mins (initial dose, 4mg/kg. Subsequent dose 2 mg/kg). It was OK for me except that during the last 15 mins of infusion, the benedryll wore off and I did indeed felt cold and chilly in my body. The Panadol caused my brain to be a little groggy. So, I made it a point to reduce panadol to 1 pill and to request for continue benedryll in subsequent treatment so that I don't feel the chill and cold coming on in my body. (Note: if you are allergic to any medication, then please speak to your MO for alternatives drugs) (III) Pre-Medication for Paclitaxel (Ranitindine 50mg, Diphenhyramine 25mg, Dexamethasone 20mg) - When asked, it was explained to me that these pre-medication help to reduce/prevent allergies of paclitaxel in patients. (30 mins + 30 mins recovery time). I found these to really help reduce side effects for me except that the dexamethasone (aka steroids) caused sleeplessness in the week following Chemo #1. (IV) 30 mins before the start of paclitaxel - Icing of both hands & feet to reduce or prevent neuropathy. My MO recommended that I do this though it's optional. But I have to bring all items myself. (see pix below of item lists). I wore double layer food preparation gloves, and soaked my hands in a basin of water filled with lots of frozen blue ice. I also wrapped each of my feet in plastic bag before soaking them in another basin of water with sufficient frozen blue ice to last me through 2 hours** (30 mins before paclitaxel, 60 mins during, and 30 mins more after infusion end). He said it worked on the majority of his patients, although it didn't work on two of his patients. He did say it was optional, that it's somewhat inconvenient because I have to bring all these items myself. What's a little inconvenience if both my hands and feet come out of chemo without loss of sensation, right? I explained to the nurse how I wanted it done since only my MO recommends it to his patients. I rang for the nurses in the chemo room to help me with taking the melted blue ice ones out and replace it with new ones from my Coleman cooler box (please feel free to send me a private email if you want pictures, instructions and list of items) or if money is no object for you, you could buy hypothermia gloves and slippers at Amazon.com. They cost about US$100+/pair, and you will need at least 2 pairs of each. I prefer to go with the cheaper version. I did go to the NLM and found trials confirming this icing effectiveness. If you want to have this article, either email me or go to the \"Venting About Neuropathy\" Thread where I have posted it. (IV) Paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) - 60 mins infusion. That rate of infusion can sometimes affect how you feel. If you feel uncomfortable at any point of any drug infusion, it's OK to call the nurse to ask that the rate of infusion be slowed down. I did that during my pre-Herceptin infusion of benedryll. When it was done too fast, my head hurt. After the adjustment, the hurting stopped. (V) 30 more mins icing of hands and feet. During chemotherapy, we are allowed to drink to keep ourselves hydrated, and to eat (I brought crackers) between infusion. I always bring along a 1.5 litre bottle of green bean soup that I had boiled earlier that morning. In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), green bean soup (no sugar added, beans crushed to extract max nutrient then discarded) is believed to help to detox our body. I drink it between infusion. During infusion, we will go to the toilet several times. The nurses where I have my chemo are helpful, patient and wonderful. At this cancer center, there are two rooms for chemo, one with 76 comfortable seats and another with 28 seats that can be reclined any way you want. I requested to be scheduled in the smaller room. In front of every seat is our very own TV to watch any channels we want, with our own remote and call buttons. When my infusion was over, I was anxious to go to the toilette for the 4th time. I stood up, forgetting that having soaked my feet in cold, cold water for so long, it would be numbed and red (not painful). I almost fall over but someone caught me. Lesson learned. Then I gulped down the rest of my green bean soup. I will say that I drink at least 4-5 litres of fluid every day. It seems to lessen any side effects. Luckily, my tastebuds did not change drastically. Though I read it did for many people here in the forum pages. I believe drinking lots and lots of fluid helps to reduce the change in taste as well. I was grateful that my sister was with me. When we got home, it was dinner time and I was quite hungry. I had a bowl of baby oatmeal with dried cranberries/raisins/honey. Then I gulped 1/2 liter of water. Then proceeded to have 2 large slices of cranberries/walnut multigrain bread, drank another 1/2 liter of water, took my immune system booster supplement, brush my teeth, and gargled my mouth with biotene (effective and important to have) to prevent sore mouth. Then to bed. I slept like a baby. Tuesday, April 28th - got up late not knowing what to expect. I was happy that I felt normal. As always, I drank 1/2 litre of water, then made a bowl of baby oatmeal (my usual morning breakfast food). My sister made a protein and fiber rich smoothie for me. Took several supplements: Immune System booster, red wine/grape seed extract (anti cancer oxidants) and fish oil (for heart, mind and joint health). I spent the day relaxing, reading online, watching TV and going for an hour walking and exercising during late afternoon. I found my appetite was still good. Ate mostly fruits, veggie soups, porridge with quinoa and fish (mostly Salmon or Red Snapper) or noodles. NO raw salads until chemo over. Dont go to any Japanese restaurant was an advice given to me. My gf did even though she didnt eat sushi. She ended up somehow with stomach upset and was hospitalised for 3 days. Watched Masterchef, then did my usual nightly ritual - shower, brush teeth, gargled mouth, then to bed. Slept well. Wednesday, April 29th - got up early. Ate as usual. Same routine. Went for a walk and do arms swingin exercises by the river. So far, still feeling and eating OK. Same routine. Same supplements. Went to bed around 2300 hours. Woke up in the middle of night to pee. Felt a hint of stinging. Might be the chemo settling in... Thursday, April 30th - Got up feeling an ache all over my body...finished eating my oatmeal, and drank my smoothie...appetite still good, taste buds still unchanged. Let's see what the rest of the day will bring...(decided to lay off fish oil next time the day before, day of and day after chemo after reading about an article about it in this site). Continue taking immune system booster supplement. Got up several times at night to pee. Friday, May 1st- Early morning, hint of constipation. Had usual breakfast and 1/2 litre water. Had noodles late morning. 1st bowel movement. Noticed bright red blood in stool water. Drank more water. Late morning, went for 2nd bowel movement. Again, blood in stool. Drank more h2o. No pain, didn't panic, but email my MO about it (Labor Day holiday today, so don't expect him to reply soon). @ Noon, had 3rd bowel movement. This time, not constipated but blood was darker in color, pieces of red muscusy chunks like those one used to have during heavy menstration. Email my MO again. Drank some more H2O. Went to lie down. Just gotup to update this. Will see what happens. Saturday, May 2nd - Had 2 bowel movement this am. Again with blood in stool...called hospital chemo nurse. She suggested going to the hospital's emergency, which I did, at about 10am.... Wow, what along wait with so many people waiting. Finally, after 3 hours, got to see a Dr. After checking my bottom, he said I have a few small hemorrhoids in my colon. He also took blood samples to do a Full Blood Count. Gave me a prescription called Proctosedyl Ointment to apply just before bedtime and after a shower. I did it Sunday night since the Pharmacy was out of stock on Saturday. After waiting for 2 hours, blood report came back. Everything's normal! Yipeee! So, I don't have to go for a blood test for my upcoming Monday Chemo #2. So that's good...except that now, I need to go for a colorectal follow up in 2.5 weeks time. Also got a text reply from my MO who is on holiday. He suggested the same, and didn't think it would be serious. Filled him in on my status.. I just love all my doctors at this hospital. BTW, Sunday morning's bowel movement and thereafter has had no bleeding. So the Proctosedyl Ointment worked! Note1: My girlfriend who had cancer 10 years ago said she regretted not taking the immune system booster whereas her girlfriend with breast cancer did. She said that she gets infection easily whereas her gf does not. So I took what her gf recommended to her. The ones She got was extremely expensive. My older sister found a comparable supplement called the agaricus blazei immune system booster. Read research on it. Seems to work on mices. Japanese pharmacy sells them for same use too. Note2: I read somewhere that taxanes drugs like paclitaxel/docetaxel causes our nails to be sensitive to light. One patient painted her nails with dark color nail polish on both her nails and toes, and did not get any cracked or darkened nail. She recounted that on the last day of her chemo, she forgot to repaint her nails the night before. When she got out of treatment, and got home, one of her nails turned dark and cracked. So, I'm going to follow this advice faithfully and see how it goes, and will report back. Note 3: My doctor said that by Treatment 2 at the earliest, and Treatment 3 at the latest, I should see my hair falling. I had long hair before, but had cut it short. Then I saw a lady in the chemo room had the same short hair as mine. But hers have already started falling in blotches. So, I've decided to go for a crew-cut next Tuesday, after my Monday T2. I'd rather not get up finding batches of hair on my pillow. I'm not afraid of hair loss coz I know they will come back... Note 4**: When I asked my MO why I need to wear double layer plastic gloves on my hands and feetwhen icing, he said it would make soaking in the cold water bearable. But said I could try it out without and find out for myself. I found his advice to be absolutely true.. ******** Below is a list of neuropathy preventing items I bring with me to chemo each week. Except for the Coleman cooler, you can probably get all these items from the 99 cents store. They are, from left to right: - Food gloves (double layers for the hands), - Roll of vegetable bags (one for each foot, secure with velcro), - Velcro tapes (for securing to prevent water from getting in) - - Blue ice (I got various sizes because I wanted the water to be extremely cold. eg 6 large ones that last 4-5 hours, medium size ones that last about 3 hours and the soft plastic ones that last 2 hours), - Rectangle square box for icing both hands (which sits on my lap over a folded blanket - yeah I sit in an upright position where my chair is angles at about 100 degrees. I can still talk to my neighbors or sleep. It's not uncomfortable for me), - Round plastic basin to soak and ice both my feet in, and - 2 quarts Coleman cooler box to keep the blue ice frozen - the Coleman is useful because I am petite. So, I lay the Coleman on its side with the lid facing outwards should I need more blue ice). Then I sat the round plastic basin on top of it before soaking my legs. This put my feet in an extremely comfortable angle/position. Now before I do my icing, I will go to the restroom first. During this part, I may have to go to the restroom as well. So you'll probably need the help of the nurse. But since our large restroom inside the chemo room is within a few seconds walking distance, I can go myself, along with the IV stand. But the nurses and health care attendants are very quick to come to my assistance if when they see me getting up by myself. When they are busy, I don't bother them. Note: It seems like a lot of things to carry. But you only need to carry 2 pair of glove to double layer it, and a pair of vegetable plastic bags (thick ones). The blue ices would be in the Coleman, and the gloves, vegetable bags, Velcro would be on top of it, along with a handwash cloth to clean any splashes I may inadvertently make). The pastic basins are stacked together in a large bag. When you buy them, check to make sure the size comfortably fit both your hands and feet. You can buy any shape you want. Note 2: If you think this is a hassle, then feel free to buy the hypothermia gloves for hands and feet. You will likely need 2 pairs of each. They cost about $99 - $105 per pair. So, if money is not an issue, then, yeah. But I do like the cheaper version because the water can be really cold. Actually because I put on 2 pairs of gloves, it act as an insulation so it's comforting cold. Same for the feet. When infusion is over, I continue with icing for another 20-30 minutes. Then the gloves and veggie bags are discarded together. I try be considerate and not make a mess because the nurses are extremely busy at this center. If I get water on the floor, when I'm all clean up, I'll call for the attendant to help mop the floor. And I'll certainly clean up whatever other mess I've made before leaving, including folding the blankets they've given me to keep me warm and place them on the chair before leaving. Note: Both feet are standing on a piece of blue ice each below it to ensure they are totally encompass in cold water. ***CHEMO #2: MONDAY, May 4th 2015**** Duration: 3.5 hours All went well as listed in Chemo#1 above except that: Pre-medication for Herceptin was reduced to 1 Panadol, with Diphenhydramine (benedryll) remaining at 25 mg. I read in this forum pages that some sisters here cannot tolerate benedryll. If that is the case, please discuss with your MO on an alternate pre-medication. Again, the purpose of this pre-medication is to reduce chills and colds you may experience during the Herceptin part of the infusion. It has worked well for me, so I wanted it to continue. And it did worked well yesterday too. My hair are still there\u2026the falling hadn't happen yet. I had long hair but had it cut short back in March. I was supposed to go for my crew cut today, but decided to wait and see what happens next. I must confess that I am not unduly worried about hair loss. I read that most people's hair starts falling between the 2nd and 3rd Chemo session. My MO said so too. I supposed it's vanity that stopping me from getting the crew cut done this week. And I wanted to take more pictures before my head goes all commando on me involuntarily. I also thought I am in no hurry to join Charliz Theron in all the fun in that department. Yeah, I've got my 7 headscarves waiting to be adorned LOL @!@ Is it too optimistic to hope that the hair wont fall off? Hehe...time will tell and I shall be back to share it with you.. Note: I read that wearing cold caps during chemo may reduce the chances of one's hair falling out. My MO confirmed that to be so, athough it was too cold for a few of his patients. If you can tolerate the cold, then try it if hair loss is worrisome for you. At least something positive. Yeah!! My taste buds have not gone crazy on me, yet. My appetite is still good, and food flavors have not changed either. Matter of fact, I gained about 1.5 kg between Chemo #1 and #2. I suspect the reason my taste buds have not changed is because I drink at least 4 to 5 liters of water, fluids, soup, fruit juices or combination thereof everyday. During chemo sessions, I would drink up to 1.5 liters between infusion. Whenever I feel my mouth going dry after chemo, I would drink at least 0.5-1.0 liters of water. The reason our mouth gets dry is because the chemo drugs are soaking up fluids from our body. So we replenish it to hydrate ourself to prevent or reduce side effects. If one's taste buds changed during chemo and one cannot stand the taste of water, try sorbets (no ice cream or dairy based products), freshly squeezed juices (I heard citrus works every time - one must try to find ways to put whatever fluids one can into your body, seriously!). Sure, one'll go a-peeing often, and that's good coz one's detoxifying. It seems the standard protocol at this Cancer Center where I am at (they have something like 180-250 cancer patients a day!!) that they only give these pre-medications on one's 1st treatment. If one does not show any symptoms of Herceptin allergy, they do not give them on subsequent treatment. But since my Chemo #1 went very well, I asked that this pre-medication continue because during the last 15 mins of Herceptin infusion, I felt cold and chilly as the benedryll have worn off. I talked to a few patients sitting around me during check-in. They told me that they felt so so chilly during their subsequent treatments without realizing that they could ask for this pre-medication's continuance. See, a little knowledge goes a long way, doesn't it? Now, just behind the registration counter is their pharmacy department which dispenses all the drugs and dosages one gets after they checked one's weight/height for that day (yes, we have to go and weigh ourselves at an automated machine located right next to the waiting reception for correct dosages to be calculated for you). Every treatment has different dosages which means charges are different too) . Also, 2 hours before every chemo session, we have to do a Full Blood Count test to ensure that our WBC, RBC, platelets and other things are within acceptable range for chemo to proceed or be postponed. I always bring my excel spreadsheet and go and talk to one of the Pharmacists (they have like 10 in there) to confirm my day's dosages and infusion time for all my drugs, and that my previous request for the pre-herceptin medications are noted in their system. The Pharmacists here are really good about things like this. Naturally, they will always on be the phone to let my MO knows about my request(s). It seems many cancer patients don't do this, but I made it a point to create an excel spreadsheet (see pix below) listing all the weeks, types and dosage of my preliminary Treatment Plan (TP) when discussing these with my MO to work out a final TP. Originally, my MO wanted to put me on the 1 year Herceptin TP, whereas I wanted to get the FinHer 9 weeks concurrent Herceptin and Docetaxol TP/ That's because being a HER2+ Grade 3 Breast Cancer , I discovered that the synergy of Herceptin + a taxane drug is more effective than just Herceptin alone. The TP I wanted also happens to be the recommended plan that the New Zealand Pharmaceutical Agency aka PHARMAC offers to all NZ early stage breast cancer patients who are HER2+. However, due to \"political pressure\" from the PM's office and other self-interest groups, PHARMAC now offer the 12 months Herceptin plan. This request must come from both the patient and their doctors. I think this is wise because then the onus would fall back on the MO + patient should they choose to do the longer TP, and that could result in cardiotoxicity to the heart. Based on PHARMAC's comprehensive comparison research analysis of 5 MAJOR clinical trials (namely NSABP-B31, BCIRG-006, HERA, N9831 and FinHER), they have found the FinHER TP to be the MOST OPTIMAL TP for HER2+ patients in terms of safety, efficacy and reduced cardiotoxicity to patients. Of course, it's cheaper too because of the shorter duration versus that of the others that wants patients to go for longer treatment plans, which are 12 months to as long as 24 months. Example of my Chemo #1 session, not in NZ$, was about S$2100 at the initial dosage was 4mg/kg for Herceptin + Paclitaxel at 80 mg/m2. There are 8 more sessions to go before radiation kicks in after a 5 weeks rest from chemo. See, I told you I'm pro-active, even about things like this (again see details in spreadsheet at bottom) ** FinHer = a Clinical Trial called Finnish Herceptin, sponsored by the Finnish Breast Cancer Society Oh coming back to what I was saying earlier. During my earlier discussions with my MO, I have already researched on each drugs that are common - Docetaxel (aka taxotere), paclitaxel (taxol), anthracycline etc. and their side effects. Different sites will give more or less information on side effects. So, it's good to visit different sites to see what each says. The NLM has a section and description of all drugs approved for chemotherapy. After much discussion, my MO respected my request for the FinHerTreatment Plan, but also asked me to consider the 12 weeks Herceptin and Paclitaxel concurrent treatment. I asked for dosage information, and enquired on what basis he made this recommendation (on a clinical trial conducted by Sara Tolaney et al). I researched and read that trial, which was similar to FinHER except it was 12 weeks duration, using paclitaxel instead of docetaxel, and allow patients to stop thereafter or continue on to a further 40 weeks on Herceptin only treatment. Since I do not believe in being OVER-medicated, and since FinHER trial results does not see the additional benefits of Herceptin for HER2+ patients like me, I found the 12 weeks treatment alternative acceptable for 2 reasons: (i) the taxane drug use is paclitaxel instead docetaxel. These two have similarities and some differences, and whose side-effects are somewhat similar; (ii) the Sara Tolaney et al trial dosages for Herceptin over the 12 weeks period copies exactly that of FinHER (1st treatment dosage at 4 mg/kg and 2mg/kg for all subsequent treatments). Of course, 12 weeks means 6mg/kg more of Herceptin over FinHER's 9 weeks, and 80mg/m2 x 3 = 240mg/m2 of additional paclitaxel over the entire duration. Now, I asked my MO if I may stop at 9 weeks instead. Again, he said that I may but would like me to consider it to 12 weeks completion. We agree to discuss it further down the road. Please note that I am responsible for all my decisions in the end. When my MO respects my wishes, I cannot go back and blame him for anything. It's unfair to do so especially since he did make his recommendations, but I had chosen not to go with it. As to the 12 weeks TP, my MO wanted my Herceptin to be at 8mg/kg on the 1st treatment, and each subsequent 3 weeks (not weekly) to be at 6 mg/kg. I didn't want that to be so and asked that it be exactly as listed out in FinHER and Sarah Tolaney et al \u2013weekly, concurrently with paclitaxel so that the synergy of these two drugs bring out the optimal treatment benefits. Since he used Sarah Toleney et al plan, I had brought the article. I pointed out the part where she copied FinHER's herceptin portion of the infusion which was given weekly and not once every 3 weeks. He saw and concurred. Whenever I have a point of disagreement, I always bring printed clinically proven articles to show him. I might add that he's a pretty swell, agreeable young doctor. I truly appreciate that unlike many MOs I've read in forum pages here and elsewhere, my MO did not pressure me into accepting the so-call 12 Months Golden Standard Plan. When he and other doctors feel that I know what I want and is able to provide evidence of my decision, they are comfortable and willing to work with me. That's teamwork, and being professional about it. I love this Cancer Center because of their open-minded and receptiveness to hear patients out. Thanks for visiting and a wonderful day every day. Please let me know if this section is helpful to you. Thank you.. ^!^ PS: I am so very lucky to have my younger sister by my side to make sure that I eat nutritionally healthy and bland every single day. We have our disagreements but we do not let it overshadow the many agreements we also have. You see , some of her friends would give her advice about my cancer on some things that I found illogical that that's where we have our disagreements. LOL... Still, I am so blessed. I hope you will be too.... You can always come back here to breastcancer.org. Many ladies here are wonderfully generous to share their experiences with you. Try searching for those whose cancers are similar to yours or your love ones, okay? Below, the location of all your lymph nodes in your body...knowing where they are is important. It just occurred to me that for those who will do breast reconstruction that may required taking some skin/flesh from other parts of your body like the fatty area of the belly, please ensure that no lymph nodes in that section are inadvertently taken off of you.. Please read link # 12 below to fully understand out why our Lymphatic System are very important to everyone of us. At my request, my SO took a picture of my 2.5 cm cancerous tumor, below (2.5 cm + 1 margin left + 1 margin right = 4.5 cm total). Actually, a 1 cm all around margin was cut from around the tumor. My SO told me the tumor is actually yellow, the colour of the fat tissue, with some blood stains and electrical cutting artifacts along with some streaks of brown. The auto correction of the camera made it more red than it was. Radio-colloid is colorless. Ugly looking sucker, isn't it? The string is suture which my SO stitched to the specimen to orientate the tissue where the short length marks the superior border, and the long length marks the lateral i.e. outer side border. Purpose is so that if any Margin is not clear, they know which side they need to excise more tissue. I realize most patients don't care to see it, let alone get a picture taken of it. But I want to remember that this thing has put my life on pause, to remind myself to not ever succumb to it no matter what happens thereafter, to cherish my life and those around me even more... and to be more aware of my environment, my eating habits, the lifestyle changes I have to make from that point onward...I absolutely love my SO and my OPS. The pix below (farthest right) depicts almost exactly the location of where my cancerous tumor was previously located - mine was in the north-northwest or 10 - 12 'o clock position (a size of 2.5 cm). Pix source: National Cancer Institute Below is what a BONE SCAN image looks like. A bone scan is a nuclear medicine imaging test that uses bone-seeking radioactive materials or tracers (radiopharmaceuticals) and a computer to create an image of the skeleton (bones). A bone scan looks at the bones to see if there are any abnormalities, such as a fracture, benign or cancerous tumor or infection.This test is also called bone scintigraphy (Canadian Cancer Society definition) Below is a picture from the NCI illustrating how tumor and sentinel lymph node was taken out. Mine was done in somewhat similar fashion, except that my incision was cut further up my breast & just below my right armpit as can be seen in my pix below this one. Below is the healing scar from my Sentinel Lymph Node Dissection (SLND) where only 1 node was taken out. The reason why only 1 node was taken out was because 1 cm margins all around my cancerous tumor were clear. Clear margins mean it is unlikely that cancer cells has spread to the rest of the sentinel lymph nodes. Consequently, the axillary lymph nodes (clusters) are presumed to be negative as well. To play safe, one sentinel node was taken out for further testing to ensure that that is the case. In any event, that node did come back negative, confirming that cancer has not spread. As an fyi, I bought the Mederma Intensive Overnight Scar Cream and apply them to this scar a few times a week before bed. I apply them more faithfully to the scar around my right areola where the sutures have disappeared. It is still healing nicely. You can see picture of my right breast at the bottom of this thread.

So, I just want to come back and report the following: 1) My hair has grown to about 2 inches long, wavy and nice; 2) The lumpectomy and re-constructive round block surgery on my right breast where the areola was cut around and out to take out the cancerous 2.5 cm tumor + another 1 cm all around margins from that position, and then stitched back, has completely healed!! I am pleased to report that the the scars around it have nicely disappeared. Although I was a little concerned last week about a pea-size lump under my breast that turned out to be a pimple, wheeew !!! 3) I have lost the weight I had gained during chemo. My daily weight training has also helped to build muscles back into my arms and body. I try to maintain a healthy diet nowadays, with lots of juices and vegetables. 4) I even went mountain biking and white water rafting, as well as attending a 4 weeks super intensive course in Chiangmai, Thailand that drove all attendees to near exhaustion, sleeplessness and no time to eat as well as we wanted. But it was gratifying in the end that we all pass the course. So, I'm looking forward to being back in the job market soon. Also want to you each and everyone out there all the very best in your journey. Please take very good care of yourself. Have a good life!! P.S. I wish to recommend to everyone to buy and take this medicinal mushroom supplement called the Agaricus Blazei. It is believe to heal the body and boost your immunue system. I took this from the very beginning, after my surgery, throughout my chemo and radiation. I believe it had helped me from getting or experiencing the major side effects of treatment. I should mention that both my MO and RO advised me against taking any supplements, but I informed them that I do not intend to follow their advice on it for I did my own research on this. The only time I did not take it is on the actual chemo day itself. I met and spoken to a retired air force pilot whose mother had cancer too. He told me that she had late stage cancer, that her doctor informed his family that she has about 3 weeks to a month to live. She was not only bed-ridden, but had deteriorating mental faculties. Then he was introduced to the more potent (and expensive) version of the Agaricus Blazei. He feed it to his mom in her feeding tubes 3X/day, two capsules each. Within two weeks, his mother could walk and some of her mental faculties returned. Her doctors were taken aback by her recovery, and he showed this supplements to her doctors. It seems this supplement is now approved and recommended to the patients. Nevertheless, she passed away 6 months later, he said, not from cancer, but from catching pneumonia. Since then, he would buy this medicinal mushroom in bulk and his entire family has been taking them. I only wanted to share this story because it is herbal medicine. There are scientific evidence to it's potency. Below is the link you can read up on. http://www.alohamedicinals.com/HealingMush_Private... or you can google, healing mushrooms, you can find much info about it too. ",

I'm posting this because one of the guest speakers was Dr. Harold Varmus, previously NIH and NCI Director, ex Nobel laureate and one of the most pro-active cancer researcher and charismatic public leaders whose many works benefit cancer patients. I've started following him since June 2015 this year after I was diagnose with cancer back in Feb 2015. A most brilliant, dynamic, extremely knowledgeable and non political leader/scientist, you'll learn much from whatever he has to say about cancer - because he's right in the middle of all these researches, clinical trials, innovations, using technologies to help cancer patients, policies and so forth versus those doctors who are more into the theoretical and academic. I was extremely sad when he left NCI back in March 2015 , The public, especially cancer patients, has really lost a leader who has fought passionately, and hard for cancer research funding during his many years at NIH and NCI. I certainly hope that he will be asked to come back again in a few years. For under his leadership, many exciting progress were made in research for cancer cure and/or alternative cancer cure. If you have the chance to find his cancer talks in youtube, it is always worth your time to watch because he usually discusses the issues, and solutions at hand and don't waste time talking nonsense. ************************** Below is a very enlightening interview with Dr. Varmus about NCI and cancer research. Only when we read do will we realize how funding at NIH and NCI can affect how all cancer will or will not get the benefits of this research. For this, everyone must be proactive in getting our politicians to increase funding towards our Healthcare. http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/31/science/the-condition-cancer-research-is-in.html?_r=0 Enjoy!",

The final decision of which rest with the Appropriation Committee that controls and decides whether or not to authorize these funds? Well, this video link of the quarterly (?) NCI Board of Scientific Advisors' Meeting in March 11, 2015 can really gives us all an insight into their discussions of how funds they get or not get are being disbursed. It's a fantastic eye opener that is truly worthy of our time to watch: http://videocast.nih.gov/summary.asp?Live=15875&bhcp=1   http://videocast.nih.gov/summary.asp?Live=14250&bhcp=1 I've watched these 2 videos and thought that perhaps if all of us cancer patients work together, perhaps we can write to our government representing our respective State in Congress to get for more funding for The National Institutes of Health (NIH) as it is the primary Federal agency for conducting and supporting medical research - the National Cancer Institute being one of its arm. Just a thought. Thank your for visiting and sending speedy recovery wishes your way...@@!!@@ ",

The Cancer Research Institute (CRI), the Association for Cancer Immunotherapy (CIMT), the European Academy of Tumor Immunology (EATI), and the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) are proud to join forces to sponsor the first International Cancer Immunotherapy Conference. This collaborative meeting will be held every other year, in lieu of each organization's individual meeting, and will alternate between the United States and Europe. We believe that by combining our efforts we can be more effective and efficient in disseminating the latest cutting-edge information. The inaugural meeting will take place at the Sheraton Times Square in New York City on September 16-19, 2015. Entitled \"Translating Science into Survival,\" it will cover all areas of inquiry in cancer immunology and immunotherapy, including: immune regulation of T cell responsiveness, genomic methods for identifying tumor antigens, the tumor microenvironment, T cell therapies, checkpoint blockade, biomarkers, combinations, and the microbiome. More than 60 talks by acknowledged leaders in these areas will be given. This joint meeting will provide an unparalleled opportunity for teaching, learning, and networking among all stakeholders in the field: scientists, clinicians, regulators, drug developers, and patient advocates. We hope this will be the one cancer immunotherapy meeting that you will be sure to attend in 2015. Scientific Planning Committee James P.

      "Content": "Jul 29, 2015 10:02AM - edited Sep 23, 2015 09:11PM by NATSGSG ***START*** OF *** RADIATION*** JOURNEY*** UPDATE: July 29, 2015 (Wednesday): PRE-RADs PREPARATIONS & MARKINGS Today is the day for my appointment at the Radiation Oncology Department of the Cancer Center. I had CT planning scans done in two position (a) prone and (b) supine. During the scans, I had to hold still the entire time while 2 radiation therapists made markings on my back, (for the prone position) and then the front center, and right breast (for the supine position). Markings are done either using tattoo (which are just a tiny dot and permanent) or Henna dyes. The latter lasts about a week to a week and a half. This means markings need to be re-done for a 2nd time. I've chosen Henna, but may go with tattoos for my back later. Since radiation therapy is only 3 weeks (15 sessions in all, total dosage 40 grays or 40/15 = 2.67 gray or 267 centigray per session). Since I am quite comfortable with the prone position, I've decided to go with this position. As I will be lying on my stomach with my right breast hanging down from a hole on a massage-like table, the angle of radiation will come diagonally from both sides. This position results in the least damage to other parts and organs in my bod especially the lungs. The supine position will cause some damage to lungs - so if you can, avoid this position.. Was also informed that on the actual day (starting Aug 12) the entire procedure will take about 30 minutes in all - with 10-15 mins or so to align my body correctly, and another 10-15 minutes for radiation. I'll get some pictures taken and post it below at a later stage. BTW my simulation will be on Aug 11.  POST CHEMO NOTEs: It's been 4 weeks since my last chemo. No longer have any chemo brain. I have resumed weight exercises at the gym. In addition, I've regained most of my strength, although I still experience minor degree of pantings....Overall, I have gained about 5 pounds which I intend to lose after radiation. RO said that during radiation, I should not stretch the breast area too much as it can be quite sensitive - thus I need to cut back on my weight training exercises. Appetite is good, and no longer feel dehydrated. Hair is still fuzzy and only about 2/3 of an inch long... My scalp continues to remain sticky. I still sweat easily and that didn't help. I wonder if this slows my hair growth.. Thankfully, mMy nose hair have all grown right back. Since last week, I've gone back to the gym to work out after regaining my strength that was temporarily lost the two weeks after my last chemo. I noticed, however, that even with one sentinel lymph node was taken out of my right underarm, that arm is slightly weakened (see pix above). When I use weights during training, my right arm cannot carry the weight in the same straight manner as my left. I further noticed that my right should droop about 1/2 inch. So when I do weight training, I try to straighten my right shoulder. . That's the reason why strongly suggest that unless all your sentinel lymph nodes are cancerous (positive), please DO NOT lightly give permission to have your axillary lymph nodes taken out. Save them if you can, and wherever possible. Please read the link posted above about why all these lymph nodes in our body are so so so precious and important. Thanks again for visiting, and sending more good wishes your way in your journey. Take care @@!!@@",

      "Content": "Aug 26, 2015 06:30AM - edited Sep 10, 2015 12:27PM by NATSGSG UPDATE: Aug. 26, 2015 (Wednesday) Today is exactly 2 weeks since I've started radiotherapy. Nothing new to report, except that I had a 2nd follow up consult with my Radiation Oncologist to discuss the x-ray pictures taken before radiation this morning (Results: My RADs are still aligning properly, yea!) , and also on whether I have made a decision about doing the additional week of booster or not. I said I will give him an answer by the following Tuesday after RADs that day. That's because I want to continue reading more published scientific articles on the additional benefits or non benefits of additional booster rads to the tumor bed for early stage HER2+ breast cancer patients like me who have had chemo. So far, the majority of articles I've read discussed the advantages of booster to late stage and/or metastatic cancers BC , or to early stage BC patients like me but who did not go for chemotherapy. As I continue my search on articles on the pros & cons of The Booster, I came across this article PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY below , and would like to share them with interested fellow members. Though at this point in time, my inclination is not doing the booster, especially since I have already done chemo. I actually like it the chemo was given to me first before radiation when the standard procedure for lumpectomy is radiation immediately, followed by chemo, if needed. Anyway, am copying and pasting certain sections/paragraph that seems interesting. If you think so too, and is interested to read it in its entirety, the source link is posted at the bottom. IONIZING RADIATION Ionizing radiation is energy sufficiently strong to remove an orbital electron from an atom. This radiation can have an electromagnetic form, such as a high-energy photon, or a particulate form, such as an electron, proton, neutron, or alpha particle. High-energy photons By far, the most common form of radiation used in practice today is the high-energy photon. Photons that are released from the nucleus of a radioactive atom are known as gamma rays. When photons are created electronically, such as in a clinical linear accelerator, they are known as x-rays. Thus, the only difference between the two terms is the origin of the photon. MEASURING RADIATION ABSORPTION The dose of radiation absorbed correlates directly with the energy of the beam. An accurate measurement of absorbed dose is critical in radiation treatment. The deposition of energy in tissues results in damage to DNA and diminishes or eradicates the cell's ability to replicate indefinitely. Gray The basic unit of radiation absorbed dose is the amount of energy (joules) absorbed per unit mass (kg). This unit, known as the gray (Gy), has replaced the unit of rad used in the past (100 rads = 1 Gy; 1 rad = 1 cGy). Exposure In order to measure dose in a patient, one must first measure the ionization produced in air by a beam of radiation. This quantity is known as exposure. One can then correct for the presence of soft tissue in the air and calculate the absorbed dose in Gy. Percentage depth dose The dose absorbed by tissues due to these interactions can be measured and plotted to form a percentage depth dose curve. As energy increases, the penetrative ability of the beam increases and the skin dose decreases. If you copy and paste the below into your browser, it will open up as a 10 page pdf file that you can save to read later. I've read it all - quite enlightening, and the process is similar to most of what's been done to methus far. www.thymic.org/uploads/reference_sub/02radtherapy.... Sending more good wishes to all my fellow members going through radiation as well... Below are Beds of Flowers for your enjoyment. They give me hope and happiness whenever I look at them. I wish for them to bring you similar joy and happiness too as you are reading along...   P.S. I'm so glad my treatment journey is coming to an end in about a week's time. Take care now everyone. God Bless.... @!!@",

Kinda worry if it's only temporary or will it become something permanent. Wrote an email to my MO to ask about it. Will see what he has to say....But did do some reading of post-chemo sweating. It seems there are others who've experienced similar symptoms and have mentioned it at various other forum pages....Need to look into it more and see what I can find....I must say that the sweat are not the kind of stinky smelly sweat like the underarms after a work-out, but rather it's more of a watery kind, as if water are seeping out of one's head, and therefore, not smelly. Still, I should take note and see if it's anything serious or not...@??@. ",

Other factors that are taken into consideration include whether our Sentinel Lymph Nodes (SLND) are positive or negative, and if our axillary nodes are taken out or node. Sometimes, even whether we choose to have Lumpectomy (aka Breast Conserving Surgery BCS) or Mastectomy are taken into account in treatment plan as well. Me, being HER2+ also mean that I, like you, have to do my research. In the end, I have to decide what treatment plan I want to follow or not follow. There is no such a thing as a clear-cut plan - but there are such things as STANDARD TREATMENT PLANS or plans that are currently adopted by most doctors based on clinically proven methods at a certain point in time. These changes too as new medical and scientific knowledge comes to light. If I did not do my research or reading, I wouldn't have been able to discuss the plan I want. If I didn't educate myself, I would have no choice but to go with the standard treatment plan, whether it's really good for me or not. Therefore, perhaps my suggestion (not so much advice) may be appropriate for others but not for you. I'm very happy for you that you are quite pro-active in your own research (bravo!),  . I wrote what I wrote in this thread in the hopes that such information will be helpful to others, perhaps a point from where to start. I've always believe more info is better than less to enable us all to make better choices, and perhaps better decision. Choice is something we all have - no one can force us to make any decision against our will. Every cancer patient have rights. That mean patients can cancel any part of treatment plan recommended by their doctor, and propose one that they found via their own research that may have proven to work for their own situation. As to the link I've provided in my earlier message, please feel free to ignore it. Perhaps others who comes later who are EP/PR+ and HER2 - may find those links useful. Thank you for your time, and Have a good day EVERYDAY, wherever you are @@!!@@ ",

My MO suggested that I either buy hypothermia gloves and slippers to wear on my hands / feet during therapy (2 pairs each,  very expensive $100/pair ) or bring at least 10-16 frozen blue ice in a cooler., including: - floor mat to prevent water spilling on the floor,  - plastic containers to soak my hands in,  and a separate one to soak my legs in  - towels to dry  - thicker plastic food gloves for hands, wear double layers with rubber band around wrists,  - plastic vegetables bag for each foot with rubber bands tie around shin  - half an hour before and after the infusion of paclitaxel,  to soak hands / feet in cold water filled with 2-3 blue ice each. When water is not cold,  get the nurse to change it from the extra blue ice in cooler.  The rational is that when hands / feet are cold,  it is more difficult for paclitaxel to travel to hands / fingers and toes / feet,  therefore it reduces the likelihood of neutropathy.  I did an NLM search and found two scientificalky proven articles that this is true of patients who had docetaxel.(-10 to -20 degrees are best ) prone to neutropathy.  Of course,  It may not work on some people,  but it worked on most people in their studies So,  that's what I'm gonna do despite the inconvenience.  I only need to do it 9-13 times, but saving my fingers and toes from nerve damage is worth more than the inconvenience.

Now, I'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS PART ALREADY... As I was writing these experiences elsewhere, it suddenly occurred to me that I should share them as it happens, here in this section, which are: pre-surgery, surgery, post-surgery, pre-chemo, chemo, post-chemo, pre-radiation, during radiation, post radiation, post treatment and so forth. If I can help to alleviate your fear at this point in your life, then I am happy to have contributed. Please bear in mind that since every patient's cancer is different in terms of grade, tumor size, ER/PR, HER2 status, genes and other critical info. that should be the basis of your treatments. Some fellow members may have more serious diagnosis than I, others may have less serious diagnosis. In the end, our experiences and journey will be different. However, you will, at the minimum, be sent for some of these tests I've already done (see under My Diagnosis). STILL, getting an early overview CAN enable you to prepare for what's ahead, and for you to craft your journey THE WAY YOU WANT... *** Please remember that this is only one person's journey to give you some idea @!@ The National Library of Medicine's(NLM) pubmed section have tons and tons of scientific info relating to practically every type of cancer topics and combination that you can read & harness...YES! This effort requires much of your time, and you must do it quickly too...naturally, you will be feeling very anxious. Who wouldn't? But in your anxiety, may I suggest that you read to reduce that anxiety coz you would at least feel you are doing something, and adding towards your own knowledge of the what, where and how of your upcoming journey..... Also, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) too have much more detail (not general info) of cancer than any other sites that are quite worth your time to visit. ***There is a \"new\" custom cancer treatment which is a current hot topic, with seemingly fewer side effects, called IMMUNOTHERAPY. If this is of interest to you, the link that follows has a very comprehensive VIDEO symposium of this exciting therapy entitled Cancer Immunology & Immunotherapy: Delivery the Promise chaired by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). I genuinely believe it's worth your time watching as it is moving in the possible direction of \"custom cancer therapy\"...such hope by so many dedicated and passionate immunologists, doctors, scientists and researchers that their work could bring to us cancer patients..... videocast.nih.gov/summary.asp?... videocast.nih.gov/summary.asp?... https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/147/topic/831945?page=1#idx_24 To continue, I have had 1st consult with my Surgical Oncologist (SO) on March 5th, all the various and necessary tests between that and my Biopsy (March 9th) and surgery to remove the tumor & lumpectomy reconstructive surgery (done simultaneously on March 25 by my SO and the Onco-plastic Surgeon - OPS). They are written under May 4th, 2015 Chemo #2 section below. I am lucky that all these moved rather quickly at my Cancer Center because all the doctor specialists work as a team here i.e. My SO, OPS, Medical Oncologist (MO) and Radiation Oncologist (RO). I am also fortunate in that everyone of these specialists who saw me are the Senior Doctors of their respective department. My recommendation is that wherever possible, try to find a hospital that has a team of specialist such as mine for it will make your visit far easier to coordinate, as oppose to having to run and drive here and there, which can place even more stresses on you. If it is not possible, then try to plan the location within distance of each other. On Monday, April 27th, 2015, I started my 1st chemotherapy. Details are written below as well. It may seem like I'm jumping the gun here for you. BUT, I strongly feel that if you have more ideas of this journey you will be embarking on, then I have no doubt that it'd be easier to travel forward. I have included a lot of details that I hope can help you know what you need to do when it's your turn. Some of the terms and names of drugs will seem daunting to you now, but believe me, you will want to learn all these terms, names and procedures very, very quickly. When I first came to this forum page, I tried to find such details of each segment of others' journey, but was unable to. Which is why I wanted to do it this way. Also, at the very bottom are listed several links for you to go to, including one discussing various oncoplastic surgical methods available for breast reconstruction after lumpectomy based on your tumor location and size...Forgive me, if some of you may find my info too lengthy. While you are waiting, this very site has a pdf on Your Guide to the Breast Cancer Pathology Report. Please download, save and print it out. It is a terrific guide to keep you up to speed very quickly about your cancer. Keep it by you so you can look at it again and again until you remember the terminologies. This pdf did help me very much to acquaint me of the basics of cancer in the initial leg of my journey. So, I believe it will be useful to you too. http://www.breastcancer.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&term=how+to+read+patholigy+report&commit=Search Regardless, I wish you well. MAY PEACE & STRENGTH BE WITH US, & KNOWLEDGE TO GUIDE US IN OUR EVERY DECISION...^!!^ **M Y *** I N I T I A L *** D I A G N O S I S** Stage IIA, Grade 3, IDC, tumor size 2.5, 2.6 and 3.0 cm respectively (via MRI, Ultrasound, Mammograpm) Pre-Biopsy: Had ultrasound, MRI, bone scan (pix at bottom), chest X-ray, full blood test (FBT), mammogram, abdominal ultrasound test done. Post-Biopsy: Confirmed IDC with some degree of DCI. tumor malignant, ER/PR - (negative) HER2 + (positive 90%), No genetic testing for BRCA1 (BReast CAncer gene 1) and BRCA2 (BReast CAncer gene 2) since there is no family history. Possible lymphovascular involvement.Surgery: Confirmed malignant tumor size 2.5 cm, 4.5 cm taken out with margins, 0/1 Sentinel Node, NO ALND authorized, Lumpectomy, Right Breast Reconstruction via the Round-Block Technique. Healing gradually + beautifully. Post-Surgery Recovery Time Before Chemo Start: Asked for 4 weeks recovery time for breast to heal before chemo starts. My MO originally wanted me to start chemo in 1-2 weeks, but I declined. I wanted my lumpectomy and reconstructed breast to heal some more first.. Pre-Chemo: Had Full Blood Test (FBT) and MUGA tests done before Chemo #1. FBT and weight + height must be taken every time before each chemo. Follow up visit with MO every 3 weeks to review chemo progress, to discuss previous FBT, and to make any adjustments to treatment plan (TP) where needed.CHEMO DRUGS: 9-12 Weeks of Concurrent weekly cycle of Herceptin + Paclitaxel. Please see my spreadsheet at bottom of this thread, listed in infusion order + dosage amount. Herceptin doses are calculated based one's weight = total dosage. Initial Herceptin dosage (1st chemo) usually higher. Subsequent dosages are lesser and remain the same thereafter. Please ask your doctor to give you the details.. For paclitaxel (a taxane drug) both weight & height are used to calculate your dosages.. After chemo completion, I was sent for a Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE) to test for cardiotoxicity from Herceptin. Post Chemo Recovery Time B4 Radiotherapy: Asked for 5 weeks recovery time before starting radiotherapy. Again, my cancer center is good about not making me start radiation therapy when I was not ready. Since chemo already takes a lot out of our body, I wanted mine to heal as much as possible before proceeding onto the next stage. I strongly urge that you please consider and think through all these timelines. If you are weak from chemo, best to let your body heal first. Otherwise, you might feel overwhelm by it all. Of course, if you feel otherwise, you don't have to take my word for it. Everyone should gauge their own strength and ability... What I'm trying to say is you do not have to accept the start date of chemo or radiation. Let your body be your guide. and never be afraid of pushing back the timeline as long as it does not compromise your treatment. PRE-RADIATION: Sent for CT planning scans and markings to my body. A day before actual radiation, had simulation done to make adjustments to markings to ensure accuracy of RT. RADs started on Aug 12, 2015. *******AND SO THE JOURNEY BEGINS ...******** When I was first diagnosed with breast cancer in Feb 26th, I flew home on Mar 1st to get treatment at my Cancer Center there. After my 1st consult with my Surgical Oncologist (SO), I was sent for test after test within the first 2 weeks : Bone-scan test, full blood test, Chest X-ray, ECG, mammograms, abdomen ultrasounds, and so forth, followed by Biopsy^^. Since my SO (a most approachable elegant lady) had to fly to Europe for a conference, she informed me that her colleague, an Onco-plastic Surgeon (OPS) will cover for her for a week. That she will discuss the results of all my tests. At first, my OPS informed me that \"most people choose to do a mastectomy...\" I was aghast at even the thought of anyone not even attempting to save their breast especially if it is saveable. I immediately replied that I won't even consider it, that my SO was already aware of it and end of discussion. Then she presented another option \u2013 & that was to do neoadjuvant** chemo >> surgery >> chemo >> radiation (**Neoadjuvant Therapy - the purpose of which is to shrink the 2.5 cm tumor). Having pre-read about the effects of chemo, I declined this option as I did not wish to go into surgery in a weakened physical state. Also, based on my research, since my tumor size is of 2.5 cm, at one location, and my breast is not small, neo-adjvant was not a necessity. True, I have the most aggressive type of cancer \u2013 Grade 3 and HER2+. I had made it very clear during my initial consult with my 1st SO that I wanted breast conserving surgery BCS (aka lumpectomy, of which I had spent many hours reading about prior to the first consult). I understood that that would be contingent upon whether cancer has spread or not into the Sentinel Lymph Nodes. ^^^Please read my post entitled \" EVERYTHING U WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT LYMPH NODES\" below where I have pasted an enlightening and wonderful article by a group of doctors, along with their link. NOTE: I might have considered neo-adjuvant therapy had my tumor size been > 4.0 cm. Our breast size is among one of the factors determining whether it's advisable to go for neo-adjuvant or not. ^^ Biopsy was a painless 10-15 mins outpatient procedure. First, a local anesthesia using lignocaine was given. Then a 0.5 cm incision was made. Next, my SO used an ultrasound guided fine needle procedure to do the biopsy. The ultrasound is to accurately guide the needle into the tumor to take out 5-6 cores of tumor cells from various angles for pathological analysis. These cores are later examined for the type of hormone receptor for estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) (positive or negative), for the HER2 status (positive or negative), for cancer genes and other relevant info. These results generally determine the course of one's (probably standard) treatment. The incision heals within 24-48 hours. In my case, the results came back within 4 work days. You could always ask your doctor's office to call and inform you of your results, ahead of your scheduled appointment. This then gives you enough time to start your research before your meeting with your SO. If they say they would prefer to wait until you see your doctor to discuss, insists very clearly that they give, fax or email it to you too (nicely). Some office will cite \"it is not their policy\" and so forth. But you insist on being given because (a) you have the right to it, (b) you PAID for it and (c) you are an adult and they should not be treating you like a child. After you get it, start reading the details, and start getting yourself so well verse in your own case (there's a link below on how to read & understand pathology reports). I further suggest that you going to pubmed (in NLM) to do your research on standard and alternative treatments. If you spend enough time researching, you may even come across a treatment plan that was used before, and may even be applicable to yourself or your love one(s). That was how I found my treatment plan, from a proven clinical trial that is adopted by the New Zealand Pharmaceutical Agency for cancers similar to mine. If you really want to be proactive and protect your body, that's what you will do. And you will NEVER, under any circumstances, GIVE UP on yourself or your love one(s). That's the committed kind of proactivity you will engage in when you love yourself or your love ones. Example of possible ER/PR and HER2 combinations are - - -/ - - +/ + - +/ + + + / - + - / + + - DO BE sure to get hard copies of results of every test you are asked to do. Keep them in a file in chronological order. Learning to read and understand the results of our pathological reports ahead of time puts us at an advantage in that when we meet up with our doctor, we'd already know what further questions we wish to ask. For me, I quite rather enjoy this part of the learning process. The 3rd option was presented: surgery >> chemo >> radiation. This was the preference I had in mind all along, after my research. (although at that time, I still wasn't sure about whether I even wanted radiation if I had chemo). So we discussed my upcoming surgery, to be performed by my SO, and breast reconstruction, to be performed by her, now my OPS. She explained all surgical risks involved, type of anesthesia, about SLND, ALND, breast reconstruction details and how she was going to do it and why she elected the method in question, estimated total surgery time, estimated recovery time, and other related info. In my questions to her about SLND, I discovered that my cancer center's protocol during surgery is this -- in addition to taking out the tumor with an all around 1 cm margin, between 1 to 4 sentinel lymph nodes will also be taken out. It is then tested on the spot to see if cancer cells have spread. That if EVEN 1 sentinel node is found to be positive (cancerous), my doctor(s) will immediately proceed to do a complete axillary dissection. This means that the ENTIRE lymph nodes from the breast upwards to ones' underarm will be taken out. Every BC patient can have from between 20 to 40 nodes, some perhaps even more. That's an awful lot of precious nodes to be cut out of one's body, and NOT a decision I would lightly give without serious due consideration. This is especially critical by virtue of the fact that lymph nodes do not re-generate, and once taken out, would be gone forever! I think this is how my SO determines the no. of sentinel nodes to remove. If the tumor with margins removed comes back with clear margins, then only 1 lymph node is removed for further testing to ensure that that is so. If the margins are too close to call (meaning cancer has spread more than halfway to margins), then more sentinel nodes are cut out for testing. If those nodes come back negative, no axillary will be done, If, however, those nodes are positive (even 1), then axillary are automatically done unless you specifically not give permission for it (as in my own case). ^^^Please refer to the picture below for the location of our lymphatic system. See those green colored bean-shape cells at 45 degrees from the left and right breast towards the arms. Well, that's all those nodes that will be taken out as well as those in the underarms, whichever that arm will be. It's not meant to scare you. Its meant to make you MORE AWARE of what's AT STAKE here. These pictures were taken from MissBennettScience ppt presentation and graysanatomyonline.com From all that I have read of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), it's a very, very scary thing because once the nodes are taken out, they're gone forever, and will NEVER regenerate. In addition, the underarm without the axillary nodes will essentially be weak and your entire arm cannot lift anything over 5 pounds. Also, you cannot have any blood extracted, or infusion or vaccines done to it, and you have keep exercising it to reduce or prevent lymphedema. I was not prepared for that to happen and decided I will do whatever I can to keep my axillary nodes. When my OPS went on to explain how she was going to re-construct my breast (which was quite different from the method recommended in current literature ), and explain how her method** will make my breast look more natural and closer in size to my left breast, I was not really listening because I had thought it would be done that awful way. But when she repeated that it would be quite good, I was fascinated though I really had no idea what she was talking about. I thought well, if she can make my breast looks better than current practice, I wont complain. So I asked her the name of the technique and made a mental note to read up more about it. Thereafter, I was asked if I had any questions, before being asked to sign the Patient Consent Form (for surgery, SLND and ALND clearance). ^^^ Now that I have had my reconstructive surgery, I will say that my OPS did a fantastic job on the reconstruction of my right breast. I am a size 38D. After the surgery that took out the 2.5 +1+1 cm = 4.5 cm or 20% (1/5) of my right breast, it is now a 36D (see pix much further below). Can you believe it? God, the method she used, called the the Round Block Technique, retains the natural looks of my right breast. I have a scar around my areola from where the incision was made, and from where the tumor was taken out. But this scar can fade with the application of the Mederma Scar Fading cream, but I have to wait for the incision to heal first before applying. Current literature recommends cutting from the top or wherever the tumor is located, which leaves one's breast with a very ugly pothole and/or distortion, where-ever it is cut out. NOT SO with the method my OPS did. As of this writing, my nipple, areola and breast still retain it's sensation. That's the beauty of this method. I'd be more than willing to send you a picture in my private email if you wish to see it. I gave my SO permission to use pictures of it in any conference presentation she will make in the near future. I think any method that can preserve one's breast beautifully, and make it less distorted is a welcome thing for us breast cancer patients, agree? ^^^It has just occured to me that should you choose the flap BCS or other methods where flesh are taken from your abdomen or other areas, please ensure that your lymph nodes in those areas are not disturbed or inadvertently taken out as well. Please check with your OPS to ensure that this does not happen. You really don't want those good nodes \"accidentally\" taken out because they are really an important part of our lymphatic system and our body. You will see why after you read the link on \"Everything U Want to know about lymph nodes\" posted below. Note: However, if you have had SLND or ANLD dissection, then doing arm exercises are a must. They helped to facilitate healing your underarm faster, and to reduce and/or prevent the chances of lymphedema. It is to your advantage to start exercising the arms the very next day after surgery. Your physiotherapist will likely be the one to show you some of these exercises before your discharge. I only stayed a night for my surgery. For some people, you may feel painful after surgery and thus may be reluctant to move... So, olease do just a little at a time than none at all as lymphedema is not a pleasant condition to have. \"Lymphedema aka lymphatic obstruction, is a condition of localized fluid retention and tissue swelling caused by a compromised lymphatic system, which normally returns interstitial fluid to the thoracic duct and then the bloodstream.\" - from Wikipedia. I have posted alternative exercise pictures link under the Fitness and Getting Back in Shape section of this Forum Page that I found that could be useful. Truth be told, I did not sleep at all for 2 nights about the ALND consent. I went into the NLM website under PUBMED and read for hours and hours about SNLN and ALND. I found new literature stating that even if 1/4 (meaning one of four) , 2/4, 3/4 sentinel nodes are positive DOES NOT NECESSARILY JUSTIFY AN ENTIRE AXILLARY lymph nodes dissection (i.e. removal) under certain conditions^^^. These articles provided strong and compelling explanation and alternatives to ALND. With that in mind, I called and left a message with my SO's nurses (she was in conference in Europe remember? ) that I wanted to cancel the ALND portion of the patient consent form. ^^^ These NCI & NLM link offers more articles about sentinel and axillary nodes: http://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/diagnosis-staging/staging/sentinel-node-biopsy-fact-sheet http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=sentinel+lym... To further continue, My surgery was scheduled for 1500 hours on Wed, March 25. My message to my SO was on Sunday, March 23. I even wrote her an email to make sure she got my message. My SO returned my call immediately after her Monday morning surgery. Naturally, she asked why. I told her my findings and my concerns. She respected it, and asked me to think through and give her my answer on the day of surgery. Come surgery day, just before I went under, she asked** if I still wanted to cancel axillary clearance. I said yes, and she brought my consent form, cancelled the ALND part of consent, had me initialed it in front of the surgical team, and told me they will still give me the care that I deserve, and that we can re-visit this issue after results of the SNLD comes back in a week's time. If I not cancelled, then the SNLD results would be instantaneous. I said that I understood it all. I felt so relieved for having done that before I was placed under general anesthesia. I 've also requested my SO to please take a picture of my tumor as I want to know what the sucker looked like (see below bottom) Tumor and reconstructive surgery were performed consecutively that day by both my Surgical Oncologist & Oncoplastic Surgeon respectively. It saved time, pain and money. Surgery took about 2.5 hours with another 2 hours recovery time. I awoke about 5 hours later in my ward. My SO stopped by to check on my breast again before leaving. I experienced only a low grade pain that was quite bearable. The nurses came to check on me periodically. Had a good hospital porridge dinner. Had to pee in a bedpan over the next 2.5 hours or so until I could go to the restroom myself. My SO's residents came early the next morning to check on breast. She too came with her senior resident in her morning ward round. I felt relaxed and so well cared for throughout. **If my SO did not bring up the subject of the ALND cancellation, then that means my SO didn't get my message. So it is up to me to bring the subject up. Do not be afraid to do so when you are absolutely convinced of your decision. As a patient, you have every right to make changes to any part of any procedure you are uncomfortable. I wanted my surgery to proceed, sans ALND, that's all. I'm not encouraging you to change your mind without rhyme or reason. You must take the time to weight in the consequences. Post surgery visit a week later with my 1st SO gave me the best news I've ever had. I had clear margins and the 1 node taken out was negative. I will say too that that 2.5 cm cancer grew sometime during last August 2014 when I felt the unusual itchiness and growing lump in my right breast, but chosen to ignore it. I have myself to blame for postponing my bi-annual mammogram because I was studying for my GRE, and doing other things. Once that was over in January this year, then went to have it checked up in mid Feb 2015 while I was in Beijing. Ultrasound showed tumor. Had MRI done confirming cancer. So I flew back home beginning March. Well, better late than never. Excuse the detour, but back to what I was saying. With this cancer, I don't intend to be passive where my body is concerned. Like many of you, my world was shattered and all the plans that I had been making had to be put on pause. For instance, I was so looking forward to getting (hopefully) my Ph.D in Education Leadership scholarship at Harvard University for the 2015-2016 school year to which I have applied, and joining my daughter back in the States, amongst the many other ambitious plans I have. So getting news of breast cancer sucks! sucks! sucks! big time. After the initial shock and some tears, I decided from that VERY moment on, that I wanted to be in charge of this part of my life's journey. That it was no time for self-pity. I knew that I will be as pro-active as I can. I will not accept everything that was recommended to me without understanding why, without checking on its validity. I will guard and protect MY BODY at all times. No one will do this job better and with more enthusiasm than I, ourselves. That is not to say that the majority of doctors in this field are not doing their job.They are, and to the best of their abilities, and within the confines of the available time they have. Oftentimes, they are so very busy having to deal with so many details of so many different types, stages, grades of cancer patients and procedures that I believe they are overwhelmed, thus making it even harder for them to keep up too. The adoption of standard treatment plans are thus inevitable. I'm not saying that that is bad. I'm saying that by helping ourselves through reading and researching from as many legitimate sources as we can, and even recognizing bias reports and trials especially from the tons of information available from the National Library of Medicine (NLM), we are doing ourselves a very important favor. We can engage in intelligent conversations with our very busy SOs, MOs, ROs and all the specialists we will have to deal with throughout this entire journey. It is not short a journey by any means. It is emotionally, physically and psychologically taxing, exhausting and at times stressful. So, isn't protecting our physical selves worth our time? Isn't knowing what's being done to us and put into us better for us? I do realize that reading medical reports and clinical trials are daunting or difficult for some people. but please, please, please try, try harder. Really, it's not so bad after all. If you treat it as another learning process, something to acquire to your benefit, you may just find this world of medicine interesting, albeit not by choice. It is important that you involve your spouse (or family) and children (depending on their ages) in this process. When you educate yourself, can you then help them understand the process and what they can expect to happen to you to prepare them so that they, in turn, can provide the support you will need. You must try To be their anchor wherever possible. If not, ask your spouse or family to be the anchor for the family. If you're having lumpectomy or mastectomy, read it first yourself and then explain to him/them. If you hold yourself together, you are giving them strength as well. Believe that you are capable, believe in your own strength, just believe. If your spouse or family member can accompany you during your consult with the SOs, MOs and other specialists, that would be great. Always try to make a list of questionnaires to bring along. Listen to their recommendations, but asks why. If you have been reading up, you would then have some idea of what you'll want? If what is being recommended is not what you want, asks about your alternatives. Great doctors will listen to your concerns, and address it, NOT push it aside or insists that only his TP will work for you. In the beginning, my MO kept harping on my Grade 3 HER2+ cancer aggressiveness which I was already very aware, and wanted me on the 12 months Herceptin plan. But because I read and done my research (quite thoroughly I believe), I wouldn't budged. I explained my points, and why I wanted the plan I had chosen. I sent him articles based on clinical facts and statistics that supported my decision. We \"conversated\" via email for about a week, back and forth until we both reached a compromise that are acceptable to us. I am grateful for the patience my MO extends to me, as did my 2 SOs. Throughout it all, I feel like a part of their team, and that I can approach them anytime. I am truly blessed our paths crossed. I hope you too will find the doctors who will give you the care you deserve. Do not give up on your search. You would instinctively know during the 1st consult if the Dr. you are speaking with is the doctor who will care for you. I went online to look up the credentials of all the doctors at my cancer center, their education and work background, their experiences should be clearly stated in their website. From my experience, I have found that when I can engage my doctors, they love it! And they are willing to discuss my findings with me, and more willing to come to a compromise with me. Great doctors would, anyway. There will be a few doctors who will feel defensive or hostile when we start asking questions. If that is the case, I besiege you to find another doctor who won't have this attitude towards you. You m-u-s-t ! Your life thereafter depends on it. It will make a BIG difference on how you will experience this journey, and you'll want to make the most of it. Doctors who treat you as a member of his team, NOT just a number, will make this unpleasant journey, PLEASANT, so pleasant that you won't dread going in for tests, for surgeries, for therapies. This journey is something that you are unlikely to forget for the rest of your life because the scars will be there to remind you of it. So, as strange as it is to say this - you'll want it to be an unforgettable yet pleasant experience that won't cause you to be sad, or frustrated or bitter. At the end of it all, you want to be able to say, \"YES, I've conquered and survived it ! I'm stronger and it wasn't so bad after all.\" You paid for it, for the entire treatment, one way or another. So, you have the right to expect professionalism and empathy at all times and not be treated as a sub-species of the human race. How to find these doctors? Ask around \u2013 your friends, colleagues, neighbors, relatives, even from forum pages,and your GPs. That means there are a lot of legwork that must be done before embarking on this journey, before your first visit to good , patient specialists, including your commute time, their availability after office hours, what timeframe can you can expect to get answers to your questions and so forth. You'll want to find a medical practice where most of the doctors and their nurses who will go that extra mile to make your journey less frightening. Whenever anyone recommends any specialist doctor to you, ask what it is about them that make them special. NEVER be afraid to ask, ask, ask, and clarify until you are satisfied. NEVER, NEVER EVER short change yourself, no matter how tired you are, please. But you too must do your part to educate yourself since doctors cannot explain everything to you as they allocate certain amount of time for each patient. You could find which days are less busy for them so they'll have more time should you think you have lots of questions. I generally like to get the first appointment in the morning or after lunch or the last appointment of the day, wherever possible. Finally, I am only sharing my experience thus far with you. There will be members out there who may disagree with my decisions and what I have written They have every right to be since we are all different in our cancer stages, grades and so forth. We all choose what we are most comfortable with. So, if you are here to want to share your experiences, I truly welcome it because it enriches my life. But if you are here just to criticize, I respectfully ask that you refrain from it. Please go start your own thread and offer another perspective.P.S. Please leave me a comment to let me know if the above section is helpful to you. Thank you. ***S T A R T *** O F *** C H E M O T H E R A P Y *** April 13, 2015 - Ist Consultation with my Medical Oncologist (MO) to discuss treatment plan. We discussed much about the treatment he wanted me to be on, and the treatment I want to be on. Eventually, he asked me to think over our discussion and to give him an answer of the TP. April 15, 2015: Sent for a MUGA test and Full Blood Count Test (FBC or CBC)April 20, 2015: 2nd Consultation with MO to review the results of MUGA and FBC. Given OK to proceed to chemo. We finally agree on a TP as listed below. ******March 27th, 2015: CHEMO # 1****** Initial Duration: 4.5 hours (including pre-chemo questionnaires + pre-medication infusion) Treatment Plan: 12 weeks weekly cycle of concurrent Herceptin + Paclitaxel (the synergies of these two drugs have proven to give better results for HER2+ patients per FinHer clinical trial. Details reasons given below under Chemo #2). Dosages for Herceptin is based on one's weight (@ 2mg/kg), and for paclitaxel based on one's weight & height (@80mg/m2 - there's a formula which was given to me after I asked about it). (I) Pre-Herceptin Medication: Panadol (2 oral) + Diphenhydramine (25 mg, aka Benedryll) 30 mins, including recovery time. The purpose of these is to help patient deal with the chills and cold that Herceptin can caused. (II) Herceptin: 60 mins (initial dose, 4mg/kg. Subsequent dose 2 mg/kg). It was OK for me except that during the last 15 mins of infusion, the benedryll wore off and I did indeed felt cold and chilly in my body. The Panadol caused my brain to be a little groggy. So, I made it a point to reduce panadol to 1 pill and to request for continue benedryll in subsequent treatment so that I don't feel the chill and cold coming on in my body. (Note: if you are allergic to any medication, then please speak to your MO for alternatives drugs) (III) Pre-Medication for Paclitaxel (Ranitindine 50mg, Diphenhyramine 25mg, Dexamethasone 20mg) - When asked, it was explained to me that these pre-medication help to reduce/prevent allergies of paclitaxel in patients. (30 mins + 30 mins recovery time). I found these to really help reduce side effects for me except that the dexamethasone (aka steroids) caused sleeplessness in the week following Chemo #1. (IV) 30 mins before the start of paclitaxel - Icing of both hands & feet to reduce or prevent neuropathy. My MO recommended that I do this though it's optional. But I have to bring all items myself. (see pix below of item lists). I wore double layer food preparation gloves, and soaked my hands in a basin of water filled with lots of frozen blue ice. I also wrapped each of my feet in plastic bag before soaking them in another basin of water with sufficient frozen blue ice to last me through 2 hours** (30 mins before paclitaxel, 60 mins during, and 30 mins more after infusion end). He said it worked on the majority of his patients, although it didn't work on two of his patients. He did say it was optional, that it's somewhat inconvenient because I have to bring all these items myself. What's a little inconvenience if both my hands and feet come out of chemo without loss of sensation, right? I explained to the nurse how I wanted it done since only my MO recommends it to his patients. I rang for the nurses in the chemo room to help me with taking the melted blue ice ones out and replace it with new ones from my Coleman cooler box (please feel free to send me a private email if you want pictures, instructions and list of items) or if money is no object for you, you could buy hypothermia gloves and slippers at Amazon.com. They cost about US$100+/pair, and you will need at least 2 pairs of each. I prefer to go with the cheaper version. I did go to the NLM and found trials confirming this icing effectiveness. If you want to have this article, either email me or go to the \"Venting About Neuropathy\" Thread where I have posted it. (IV) Paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) - 60 mins infusion. That rate of infusion can sometimes affect how you feel. If you feel uncomfortable at any point of any drug infusion, it's OK to call the nurse to ask that the rate of infusion be slowed down. I did that during my pre-Herceptin infusion of benedryll. When it was done too fast, my head hurt. After the adjustment, the hurting stopped. (V) 30 more mins icing of hands and feet. During chemotherapy, we are allowed to drink to keep ourselves hydrated, and to eat (I brought crackers) between infusion. I always bring along a 1.5 litre bottle of green bean soup that I had boiled earlier that morning. In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), green bean soup (no sugar added, beans crushed to extract max nutrient then discarded) is believed to help to detox our body. I drink it between infusion. During infusion, we will go to the toilet several times. The nurses where I have my chemo are helpful, patient and wonderful. At this cancer center, there are two rooms for chemo, one with 76 comfortable seats and another with 28 seats that can be reclined any way you want. I requested to be scheduled in the smaller room. In front of every seat is our very own TV to watch any channels we want, with our own remote and call buttons. When my infusion was over, I was anxious to go to the toilette for the 4th time. I stood up, forgetting that having soaked my feet in cold, cold water for so long, it would be numbed and red (not painful). I almost fall over but someone caught me. Lesson learned. Then I gulped down the rest of my green bean soup. I will say that I drink at least 4-5 litres of fluid every day. It seems to lessen any side effects. Luckily, my tastebuds did not change drastically. Though I read it did for many people here in the forum pages. I believe drinking lots and lots of fluid helps to reduce the change in taste as well. I was grateful that my sister was with me. When we got home, it was dinner time and I was quite hungry. I had a bowl of baby oatmeal with dried cranberries/raisins/honey. Then I gulped 1/2 liter of water. Then proceeded to have 2 large slices of cranberries/walnut multigrain bread, drank another 1/2 liter of water, took my immune system booster supplement, brush my teeth, and gargled my mouth with biotene (effective and important to have) to prevent sore mouth. Then to bed. I slept like a baby. Tuesday, April 28th - got up late not knowing what to expect. I was happy that I felt normal. As always, I drank 1/2 litre of water, then made a bowl of baby oatmeal (my usual morning breakfast food). My sister made a protein and fiber rich smoothie for me. Took several supplements: Immune System booster, red wine/grape seed extract (anti cancer oxidants) and fish oil (for heart, mind and joint health). I spent the day relaxing, reading online, watching TV and going for an hour walking and exercising during late afternoon. I found my appetite was still good. Ate mostly fruits, veggie soups, porridge with quinoa and fish (mostly Salmon or Red Snapper) or noodles. NO raw salads until chemo over. Dont go to any Japanese restaurant was an advice given to me. My gf did even though she didnt eat sushi. She ended up somehow with stomach upset and was hospitalised for 3 days. Watched Masterchef, then did my usual nightly ritual - shower, brush teeth, gargled mouth, then to bed. Slept well. Wednesday, April 29th - got up early. Ate as usual. Same routine. Went for a walk and do arms swingin exercises by the river. So far, still feeling and eating OK. Same routine. Same supplements. Went to bed around 2300 hours. Woke up in the middle of night to pee. Felt a hint of stinging. Might be the chemo settling in... Thursday, April 30th - Got up feeling an ache all over my body...finished eating my oatmeal, and drank my smoothie...appetite still good, taste buds still unchanged. Let's see what the rest of the day will bring...(decided to lay off fish oil next time the day before, day of and day after chemo after reading about an article about it in this site). Continue taking immune system booster supplement. Got up several times at night to pee. Friday, May 1st- Early morning, hint of constipation. Had usual breakfast and 1/2 litre water. Had noodles late morning. 1st bowel movement. Noticed bright red blood in stool water. Drank more water. Late morning, went for 2nd bowel movement. Again, blood in stool. Drank more h2o. No pain, didn't panic, but email my MO about it (Labor Day holiday today, so don't expect him to reply soon). @ Noon, had 3rd bowel movement. This time, not constipated but blood was darker in color, pieces of red muscusy chunks like those one used to have during heavy menstration. Email my MO again. Drank some more H2O. Went to lie down. Just gotup to update this. Will see what happens. Saturday, May 2nd - Had 2 bowel movement this am. Again with blood in stool...called hospital chemo nurse. She suggested going to the hospital's emergency, which I did, at about 10am.... Wow, what along wait with so many people waiting. Finally, after 3 hours, got to see a Dr. After checking my bottom, he said I have a few small hemorrhoids in my colon. He also took blood samples to do a Full Blood Count. Gave me a prescription called Proctosedyl Ointment to apply just before bedtime and after a shower. I did it Sunday night since the Pharmacy was out of stock on Saturday. After waiting for 2 hours, blood report came back. Everything's normal! Yipeee! So, I don't have to go for a blood test for my upcoming Monday Chemo #2. So that's good...except that now, I need to go for a colorectal follow up in 2.5 weeks time. Also got a text reply from my MO who is on holiday. He suggested the same, and didn't think it would be serious. Filled him in on my status.. I just love all my doctors at this hospital. BTW, Sunday morning's bowel movement and thereafter has had no bleeding. So the Proctosedyl Ointment worked! Note1: My girlfriend who had cancer 10 years ago said she regretted not taking the immune system booster whereas her girlfriend with breast cancer did. She said that she gets infection easily whereas her gf does not. So I took what her gf recommended to her. The ones She got was extremely expensive. My older sister found a comparable supplement called the agaricus blazei immune system booster. Read research on it. Seems to work on mices. Japanese pharmacy sells them for same use too. Note2: I read somewhere that taxanes drugs like paclitaxel/docetaxel causes our nails to be sensitive to light. One patient painted her nails with dark color nail polish on both her nails and toes, and did not get any cracked or darkened nail. She recounted that on the last day of her chemo, she forgot to repaint her nails the night before. When she got out of treatment, and got home, one of her nails turned dark and cracked. So, I'm going to follow this advice faithfully and see how it goes, and will report back. Note 3: My doctor said that by Treatment 2 at the earliest, and Treatment 3 at the latest, I should see my hair falling. I had long hair before, but had cut it short. Then I saw a lady in the chemo room had the same short hair as mine. But hers have already started falling in blotches. So, I've decided to go for a crew-cut next Tuesday, after my Monday T2. I'd rather not get up finding batches of hair on my pillow. I'm not afraid of hair loss coz I know they will come back... Note 4**: When I asked my MO why I need to wear double layer plastic gloves on my hands and feetwhen icing, he said it would make soaking in the cold water bearable. But said I could try it out without and find out for myself. I found his advice to be absolutely true.. ******** Below is a list of neuropathy preventing items I bring with me to chemo each week. Except for the Coleman cooler, you can probably get all these items from the 99 cents store. They are, from left to right: - Food gloves (double layers for the hands), - Roll of vegetable bags (one for each foot, secure with velcro), - Velcro tapes (for securing to prevent water from getting in) - - Blue ice (I got various sizes because I wanted the water to be extremely cold. eg 6 large ones that last 4-5 hours, medium size ones that last about 3 hours and the soft plastic ones that last 2 hours), - Rectangle square box for icing both hands (which sits on my lap over a folded blanket - yeah I sit in an upright position where my chair is angles at about 100 degrees. I can still talk to my neighbors or sleep. It's not uncomfortable for me), - Round plastic basin to soak and ice both my feet in, and - 2 quarts Coleman cooler box to keep the blue ice frozen - the Coleman is useful because I am petite. So, I lay the Coleman on its side with the lid facing outwards should I need more blue ice). Then I sat the round plastic basin on top of it before soaking my legs. This put my feet in an extremely comfortable angle/position. Now before I do my icing, I will go to the restroom first. During this part, I may have to go to the restroom as well. So you'll probably need the help of the nurse. But since our large restroom inside the chemo room is within a few seconds walking distance, I can go myself, along with the IV stand. But the nurses and health care attendants are very quick to come to my assistance if when they see me getting up by myself. When they are busy, I don't bother them. Note: It seems like a lot of things to carry. But you only need to carry 2 pair of glove to double layer it, and a pair of vegetable plastic bags (thick ones). The blue ices would be in the Coleman, and the gloves, vegetable bags, Velcro would be on top of it, along with a handwash cloth to clean any splashes I may inadvertently make). The pastic basins are stacked together in a large bag. When you buy them, check to make sure the size comfortably fit both your hands and feet. You can buy any shape you want. Note 2: If you think this is a hassle, then feel free to buy the hypothermia gloves for hands and feet. You will likely need 2 pairs of each. They cost about $99 - $105 per pair. So, if money is not an issue, then, yeah. But I do like the cheaper version because the water can be really cold. Actually because I put on 2 pairs of gloves, it act as an insulation so it's comforting cold. Same for the feet. When infusion is over, I continue with icing for another 20-30 minutes. Then the gloves and veggie bags are discarded together. I try be considerate and not make a mess because the nurses are extremely busy at this center. If I get water on the floor, when I'm all clean up, I'll call for the attendant to help mop the floor. And I'll certainly clean up whatever other mess I've made before leaving, including folding the blankets they've given me to keep me warm and place them on the chair before leaving. Note: Both feet are standing on a piece of blue ice each below it to ensure they are totally encompass in cold water. ***CHEMO #2: MONDAY, May 4th 2015**** Duration: 3.5 hours All went well as listed in Chemo#1 above except that: Pre-medication for Herceptin was reduced to 1 Panadol, with Diphenhydramine (benedryll) remaining at 25 mg. I read in this forum pages that some sisters here cannot tolerate benedryll. If that is the case, please discuss with your MO on an alternate pre-medication. Again, the purpose of this pre-medication is to reduce chills and colds you may experience during the Herceptin part of the infusion. It has worked well for me, so I wanted it to continue. And it did worked well yesterday too. My hair are still there\u2026the falling hadn't happen yet. I had long hair but had it cut short back in March. I was supposed to go for my crew cut today, but decided to wait and see what happens next. I must confess that I am not unduly worried about hair loss. I read that most people's hair starts falling between the 2nd and 3rd Chemo session. My MO said so too. I supposed it's vanity that stopping me from getting the crew cut done this week. And I wanted to take more pictures before my head goes all commando on me involuntarily. I also thought I am in no hurry to join Charliz Theron in all the fun in that department. Yeah, I've got my 7 headscarves waiting to be adorned LOL @!@ Is it too optimistic to hope that the hair wont fall off? Hehe...time will tell and I shall be back to share it with you.. Note: I read that wearing cold caps during chemo may reduce the chances of one's hair falling out. My MO confirmed that to be so, athough it was too cold for a few of his patients. If you can tolerate the cold, then try it if hair loss is worrisome for you. At least something positive. Yeah!! My taste buds have not gone crazy on me, yet. My appetite is still good, and food flavors have not changed either. Matter of fact, I gained about 1.5 kg between Chemo #1 and #2. I suspect the reason my taste buds have not changed is because I drink at least 4 to 5 liters of water, fluids, soup, fruit juices or combination thereof everyday. During chemo sessions, I would drink up to 1.5 liters between infusion. Whenever I feel my mouth going dry after chemo, I would drink at least 0.5-1.0 liters of water. The reason our mouth gets dry is because the chemo drugs are soaking up fluids from our body. So we replenish it to hydrate ourself to prevent or reduce side effects. If one's taste buds changed during chemo and one cannot stand the taste of water, try sorbets (no ice cream or dairy based products), freshly squeezed juices (I heard citrus works every time - one must try to find ways to put whatever fluids one can into your body, seriously!). Sure, one'll go a-peeing often, and that's good coz one's detoxifying. It seems the standard protocol at this Cancer Center where I am at (they have something like 180-250 cancer patients a day!!) that they only give these pre-medications on one's 1st treatment. If one does not show any symptoms of Herceptin allergy, they do not give them on subsequent treatment. But since my Chemo #1 went very well, I asked that this pre-medication continue because during the last 15 mins of Herceptin infusion, I felt cold and chilly as the benedryll have worn off. I talked to a few patients sitting around me during check-in. They told me that they felt so so chilly during their subsequent treatments without realizing that they could ask for this pre-medication's continuance. See, a little knowledge goes a long way, doesn't it? Now, just behind the registration counter is their pharmacy department which dispenses all the drugs and dosages one gets after they checked one's weight/height for that day (yes, we have to go and weigh ourselves at an automated machine located right next to the waiting reception for correct dosages to be calculated for you). Every treatment has different dosages which means charges are different too) . Also, 2 hours before every chemo session, we have to do a Full Blood Count test to ensure that our WBC, RBC, platelets and other things are within acceptable range for chemo to proceed or be postponed. I always bring my excel spreadsheet and go and talk to one of the Pharmacists (they have like 10 in there) to confirm my day's dosages and infusion time for all my drugs, and that my previous request for the pre-herceptin medications are noted in their system. The Pharmacists here are really good about things like this. Naturally, they will always on be the phone to let my MO knows about my request(s). It seems many cancer patients don't do this, but I made it a point to create an excel spreadsheet (see pix below) listing all the weeks, types and dosage of my preliminary Treatment Plan (TP) when discussing these with my MO to work out a final TP. Originally, my MO wanted to put me on the 1 year Herceptin TP, whereas I wanted to get the FinHer 9 weeks concurrent Herceptin and Docetaxol TP/ That's because being a HER2+ Grade 3 Breast Cancer , I discovered that the synergy of Herceptin + a taxane drug is more effective than just Herceptin alone. The TP I wanted also happens to be the recommended plan that the New Zealand Pharmaceutical Agency aka PHARMAC offers to all NZ early stage breast cancer patients who are HER2+. However, due to \"political pressure\" from the PM's office and other self-interest groups, PHARMAC now offer the 12 months Herceptin plan. This request must come from both the patient and their doctors. I think this is wise because then the onus would fall back on the MO + patient should they choose to do the longer TP, and that could result in cardiotoxicity to the heart. Based on PHARMAC's comprehensive comparison research analysis of 5 MAJOR clinical trials (namely NSABP-B31, BCIRG-006, HERA, N9831 and FinHER), they have found the FinHER TP to be the MOST OPTIMAL TP for HER2+ patients in terms of safety, efficacy and reduced cardiotoxicity to patients. Of course, it's cheaper too because of the shorter duration versus that of the others that wants patients to go for longer treatment plans, which are 12 months to as long as 24 months. Example of my Chemo #1 session, not in NZ$, was about S$2100 at the initial dosage was 4mg/kg for Herceptin + Paclitaxel at 80 mg/m2. There are 8 more sessions to go before radiation kicks in after a 5 weeks rest from chemo. See, I told you I'm pro-active, even about things like this (again see details in spreadsheet at bottom) ** FinHer = a Clinical Trial called Finnish Herceptin, sponsored by the Finnish Breast Cancer Society Oh coming back to what I was saying earlier. During my earlier discussions with my MO, I have already researched on each drugs that are common - Docetaxel (aka taxotere), paclitaxel (taxol), anthracycline etc. and their side effects. Different sites will give more or less information on side effects. So, it's good to visit different sites to see what each says. The NLM has a section and description of all drugs approved for chemotherapy. After much discussion, my MO respected my request for the FinHerTreatment Plan, but also asked me to consider the 12 weeks Herceptin and Paclitaxel concurrent treatment. I asked for dosage information, and enquired on what basis he made this recommendation (on a clinical trial conducted by Sara Tolaney et al). I researched and read that trial, which was similar to FinHER except it was 12 weeks duration, using paclitaxel instead of docetaxel, and allow patients to stop thereafter or continue on to a further 40 weeks on Herceptin only treatment. Since I do not believe in being OVER-medicated, and since FinHER trial results does not see the additional benefits of Herceptin for HER2+ patients like me, I found the 12 weeks treatment alternative acceptable for 2 reasons: (i) the taxane drug use is paclitaxel instead docetaxel. These two have similarities and some differences, and whose side-effects are somewhat similar; (ii) the Sara Tolaney et al trial dosages for Herceptin over the 12 weeks period copies exactly that of FinHER (1st treatment dosage at 4 mg/kg and 2mg/kg for all subsequent treatments). Of course, 12 weeks means 6mg/kg more of Herceptin over FinHER's 9 weeks, and 80mg/m2 x 3 = 240mg/m2 of additional paclitaxel over the entire duration. Now, I asked my MO if I may stop at 9 weeks instead. Again, he said that I may but would like me to consider it to 12 weeks completion. We agree to discuss it further down the road. Please note that I am responsible for all my decisions in the end. When my MO respects my wishes, I cannot go back and blame him for anything. It's unfair to do so especially since he did make his recommendations, but I had chosen not to go with it. As to the 12 weeks TP, my MO wanted my Herceptin to be at 8mg/kg on the 1st treatment, and each subsequent 3 weeks (not weekly) to be at 6 mg/kg. I didn't want that to be so and asked that it be exactly as listed out in FinHER and Sarah Tolaney et al \u2013weekly, concurrently with paclitaxel so that the synergy of these two drugs bring out the optimal treatment benefits. Since he used Sarah Toleney et al plan, I had brought the article. I pointed out the part where she copied FinHER's herceptin portion of the infusion which was given weekly and not once every 3 weeks. He saw and concurred. Whenever I have a point of disagreement, I always bring printed clinically proven articles to show him. I might add that he's a pretty swell, agreeable young doctor. I truly appreciate that unlike many MOs I've read in forum pages here and elsewhere, my MO did not pressure me into accepting the so-call 12 Months Golden Standard Plan. When he and other doctors feel that I know what I want and is able to provide evidence of my decision, they are comfortable and willing to work with me. That's teamwork, and being professional about it. I love this Cancer Center because of their open-minded and receptiveness to hear patients out. Thanks for visiting and a wonderful day every day. Please let me know if this section is helpful to you. Thank you.. ^!^ PS: I am so very lucky to have my younger sister by my side to make sure that I eat nutritionally healthy and bland every single day. We have our disagreements but we do not let it overshadow the many agreements we also have. You see , some of her friends would give her advice about my cancer on some things that I found illogical that that's where we have our disagreements. LOL... Still, I am so blessed. I hope you will be too.... You can always come back here to breastcancer.org. Many ladies here are wonderfully generous to share their experiences with you. Try searching for those whose cancers are similar to yours or your love ones, okay? Below, the location of all your lymph nodes in your body...knowing where they are is important. It just occurred to me that for those who will do breast reconstruction that may required taking some skin/flesh from other parts of your body like the fatty area of the belly, please ensure that no lymph nodes in that section are inadvertently taken off of you.. Please read link # 12 below to fully understand out why our Lymphatic System are very important to everyone of us. At my request, my SO took a picture of my 2.5 cm cancerous tumor, below (2.5 cm + 1 margin left + 1 margin right = 4.5 cm total). Actually, a 1 cm all around margin was cut from around the tumor. My SO told me the tumor is actually yellow, the colour of the fat tissue, with some blood stains and electrical cutting artifacts along with some streaks of brown. The auto correction of the camera made it more red than it was. Radio-colloid is colorless. Ugly looking sucker, isn't it? The string is suture which my SO stitched to the specimen to orientate the tissue where the short length marks the superior border, and the long length marks the lateral i.e. outer side border. Purpose is so that if any Margin is not clear, they know which side they need to excise more tissue. I realize most patients don't care to see it, let alone get a picture taken of it. But I want to remember that this thing has put my life on pause, to remind myself to not ever succumb to it no matter what happens thereafter, to cherish my life and those around me even more... and to be more aware of my environment, my eating habits, the lifestyle changes I have to make from that point onward...I absolutely love my SO and my OPS. The pix below (farthest right) depicts almost exactly the location of where my cancerous tumor was previously located - mine was in the north-northwest or 10 - 12 'o clock position (a size of 2.5 cm). Pix source: National Cancer Institute Below is what a BONE SCAN image looks like. A bone scan is a nuclear medicine imaging test that uses bone-seeking radioactive materials or tracers (radiopharmaceuticals) and a computer to create an image of the skeleton (bones). A bone scan looks at the bones to see if there are any abnormalities, such as a fracture, benign or cancerous tumor or infection.This test is also called bone scintigraphy (Canadian Cancer Society definition) Below is a picture from the NCI illustrating how tumor and sentinel lymph node was taken out. Mine was done in somewhat similar fashion, except that my incision was cut further up my breast & just below my right armpit as can be seen in my pix below this one. Below is the healing scar from my Sentinel Lymph Node Dissection (SLND) where only 1 node was taken out. The reason why only 1 node was taken out was because 1 cm margins all around my cancerous tumor were clear. Clear margins mean it is unlikely that cancer cells has spread to the rest of the sentinel lymph nodes. Consequently, the axillary lymph nodes (clusters) are presumed to be negative as well. To play safe, one sentinel node was taken out for further testing to ensure that that is the case. In any event, that node did come back negative, confirming that cancer has not spread. As an fyi, I bought the Mederma Intensive Overnight Scar Cream and apply them to this scar a few times a week before bed. I apply them more faithfully to the scar around my right areola where the sutures have disappeared. It is still healing nicely. You can see picture of my right breast at the bottom of this thread. Scar healing from sentinel lymph node dissection on my right underarm. >>> MORE UPDATES POSTED FURTHER BELOW, WITH PICTURES. ***** MORE ***** U S E F U L***** L I N K S****** (1) Here's a terrific link with more detail info of breast cancer: http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/early-stage-breast-cancer.html#a http://www.cancer.gov/research/progress/snapshots/breast (2) This link gives pictorial information of the different Stages of Breast Cancer http://www.newhealthguide.org/Breast-Cancer-Pictures.html (3) This is another good link to read if you are interested: http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/32/8/717.full (4) This link teaches you HOW TO READ YOUR PATHOLOGIST REPORT after you've had your BIOPSY https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/147/topic/831074?page=1#idx_ (5) This link gives a very indepth explanation of what a BONE SCAN is, how it is performed and many other information: http://www.radiologyinfo.org/en/info.cfm?pg=bone-s...

      "Content": "May 11, 2015 11:07AM - edited Sep 1, 2015 07:15AM by NATSGSG UPDATE CHEMO # 3 of 10: May 11, 2015, Monday 0750 hours - Arrived at Blood Test Registration Level 2 at National Cancer Center Hospital for Blood Test. Already 32 people ahead of me. Waited till 0835 before being called. Results of Full Blood Count posted into their computer system within an hour. 0859 hours - Check-in at Chemo Desk on Level 3. Had weight/height taken with assistance from cheerful young lady at lobby. Info and docs given to her to hand to reception desk to be inputted into computer system so Pharmacist can prepare drugs for this session. Was told to go for breakfast at hospital cafeteria and to report back at chemo desk at 1000 hours.. 0905 hours - Had breakfast. 0945 hours - Check back in at the reception counter to check on cost of Treatment #2. Was given similar cost as Treatment #1 though Treatment #2 has lesser mg of drugs. Was advised to speak with Pharmacy department behind reception counter. Brought my spreadsheet to Pharmacy and verify dosage for Treatment #3 and Treatment #2 charges. Also requested reduced Dexamethasone (steroids) from 20 mg to 10 mg due concern about long-term side effects of steroids on body. Pharmacist called my MO who authorized reduction from 20 mg to 16 mg. On Treatment #@ charges, was told it is estimated to be about half of Treatment #1. Treatment #3 is estimated to be similar to Treatment #2. Went back to waiting reception to wait for my number to be called. Was called at 1003 hours to go to the Jasmine Suite for my chemo. Duration: 4.0 hours (from 1030 to 1430 hours) Started 30 mins late due to nurse didn't get IV line correctly into vein on right arm. Tried left arm but couldn't find a proper vein. So went back to vein in right arm was one which was almost straight but at a lower position from the same vein. Was able to get IV line into vein. Listen to music until lunchtime. Sister made pureed basil garlic chickpea pumpkin soup and steamed chickpeas for me. It was simply delicious. Bless her for being so thoughtful and thorough. All went smoothly, and fallen asleep until the last 15-20 mins of paclitaxel treatment where I felt breathing constriction for like 20-30 seconds. Waved for my sister to call the nurse. Nurses came, doctor-on-call came. Said they will watch me closely. That feeling didn't come back. Continue icing for 20 more minutes after paclitaxel completion. Finish the last of my 1.5 litres green bean soup, and went home. At home, felt fatigue set in. Had a banana, a mango and a slice of raisin bread. Showered and went to bed for about 2 hours after drinking another 1/2 litre water. Went out for dinner. Appetite still good. Flavor still good. Water still taste like water. Ate a lot. Drank a large cup of barley water. Went home, drank another 1/2 litre of water. Had another banana. Research on necessity of radiation after chemo. Still debating if I want to have radiation or not. Looking for material that justify radiation in view that I have clear margins and negative nodes and felt chemo is sufficient at this time. So far, trials I've found suggested radiation for positive nodes, and could not find any on addressing people like me with negative nodes. Will continue to research this week until I am satisfied so I can make my decision later.. Relax. Had 1/2 litre water and 2 slices of raisin bread. Watched Professional Masterchef, showered, brushed teeth and gargle with biotene before going to bed. Thank God biotene prevented mouth sores. Let's see what the coming week brings. UPDATE 4: May 12, 2015 (Tuesday) <<@ 2112 HOURS this evening during shower, THE INEVITABLE FINALLY HAPPENED !!! >> Hair continues to thin. I have to say the crew cut did made me look like Sinead O' Conner, and I did like it. May 18, 2015 (Mon)- Did FBC test that morning, followed by a visit @ 1400 hours with my MO. Was told that FBC result showed a mild liver inflammation that they will keep an eye on, and not to worry. Was given appointments for Chemo #4, 5, 6 every Tuesday mornings at 1000 hours. Began to experience sleeplessness. May 19, 2015 (Tue) - Did Chemo #4 + icing as usual. Everything went as per normal. Drank lots of fluid daily (about 4 litres). Breakfast of Oatmeal with dried fruits/honey/banana daily. Started adding delicious mackerel to diet. Increased exercise duration. Breast reconstructive surgery scars healing nicely. Continue using Mederma scar cream around areola and SLND scars. Scars seem to be fading nicely thus far. Sleeplessness reduced with the reduction in dosage of pre-paclitaxel medication dexamethasone (steroids) from 20 mg to 16 mg, and from 12 mg to 8 mg (minimum needed to counter taxol SE). Hair loss continues. Crew cut makes it less visible... Decided to take lots of selfies for keepsake, and adorn my head with different accessories, bandanas, etc. and sent pix to my friends around the world, including Canada, the US, UK, Singapore, Hong Kong, Beijing, Malaysia. Virtually everyone text back that they love my new look !! It was fun receiving all sorts of emoticons... and Zumba classes this week was terrrific!  ***UPDATE CHEMO #4 ***5/19/2015, TUESDAY Continue to lose my 2-3 mm hair daily (80% gone now). Every morning, I have to use a sticker roller to clean out the hair off my bed, pillows and floor. My scalp has patches of hair here and there such that my head looks like some sort of artwork. Taste buds still OK. Still lethargic. Visit loo often due to good amount of fluid intake. Same nightly routine. For the rest of this week, appetite remains good. I have begun to drink freshly squeezed citrus juices - oranges, grapefruits, lemons.  *** UPDATE CHEMO #5***5/25/2015, MONDAY MON > Took longer to start due new nurse unable to locate vein in lower left hand for IV line. Met my chemo ward resident doctor for the 1st time. Wow, what an inspiring, terrific and determine guy - survivor of polio at age 2 and Stage IV leukemia cancer as well !!! Being wheelchair bound did not stop him from loving life! The nurses told me that every year, he uses his annual leave to run marathons in different parts of the world to raise funds for charity - for different cancer org and for children stricken with cancer. What an amazing person! This week, I experience mild diarrhea. Luckily, it's the sort that's controllable. Sent an email request to my MO requesting a standing release of my FBC so that each time before chemo, I can get a hard copy that day to enable me to track changes in blood count, platelets and other info. FINALLY, all my hair is totally gone! As were my underarm hair, my nose hair and 75% of pubic hair. My eye brows are still there but thinning. My abdomen seems bloated and digestion slower today. Experiencing loads of gases. Feeling uncomfortable most of the day as a result. Didn't eat well for 3 days this week. Mild diarrhea continues throughout week. Laze around most of day as body didn't feel like it want me to do anything. Tried sleeping in a reclining position. Unable to sleep since bloating did not subside. Got up and mixed 2 cups of probiotics yogurt with honey, ate, and gargled mouth with biotene. Was able to sleep thereafter. Forced myself to do some exercises. Below is a picture of the Chemo Room. The seats are comfortable and adjustable to a sleeping position if one wishes. Directly in front of every seat up above the ceiling is every patient's exclusive TV to watch any shows, movies or news they want. Everyone is given a earphone too. There are curtains between all seats. If one wishes to have privacy, these curtains can be drawn. Visitors and their families are respectful of others and do not talk loudly.  Note: Chemo #6 and #7 update posted at below this thread. As always, thank you for visiting this thread...sending good wishes to fellow members undergoing chemotherapy as well. Have a great journey @!!@",

There are, after all, between180-250 patients daily. I, for one, prefer to look at things from the positive perspective. At this center, it gives me the chance to talk to other patients waiting with me, and learn from their experiences as well. I'm grateful of these opportunities. The reason are that when one sees other patients who are in a worse off situation than ourselves, it makes us realize how lucky we are, and how important that we need to be more emphathetic towards our fellow members. I provided feedback to the Cancer Center whenever I could. In the end, it is a Center with 1ST CLASS facilities, where the Doctors & Nurses are CARING. THIS ALONE far outweighs any other disadvantages...I am certain you read the many discussion pages here where you'll hear stories of so many of our fellow members who either have to wait a long time for results, or call and call and left messages, or who were stressed out by unresponsive doctors or medical offices that do not get back to time on a timely basis. If you had read my timeline, you will surely noticed that things move along rather quickly = efficiency. Would surely like to read a summary of your timeline that you've experienced @!@ Still, wish you continue good health and life's enjoyment. Have a terrific summer. P.S. Even while in chemotherapy currently, I started going to Zumba classes twice a week, and is intend on learning a musical instrument by the end of this year. No, my enthusiasm for life has not dampened because I have BC. On the contrary, it is making me even more determined to live and cherish life ;)) ",

Luckily, the result indicated my heart is normal and has not been affected by the Herceptin drug during chemo. However, I did noticed that I have a tendency to pant on long walks or when I am walking up a flight of staircases, even if it is from one floor to the next. I've informed my MO of this as well as the fact that every once in a while, I feel my chest section just below my breast tightens up such that I feel some difficulty breathing. He stated that on rare occasion, paclitaxel drugs could cause scaring of the lungs, which means that it could affect one's breathing. He suggested a C.T. scan to check if that is the case. That's the first I've heard of lungs scarring, When I looked it up, it seems pretty scary if it is. So I've decided to ask for a C.T. scan as I really want to know the condition of my lungs, plus my insurance covers this. So why not. Since I shall be going for radiation therapy simulation this coming Tuesday (Aug 11) and actual radiation starts on Aug. 12, I may have to wait until radiation is over. But I'll send my MO an email to find out if the CT scan will interfere with my radiation treatment or vice-versa before proceeding. Will come back and report on this when I get more info and confirmation. Below is a description and procedure of TTE taken from the U.S. National Library of Medicine if you are interested in knowing what it is and how it is done. This took 45 minutes. Please note that THIS IS different from the ordinary ECG heart test that takes only 10-15 minutes.   How the TTE Test is Performed - TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM (aka TTE) - from National Library of Medicine link below. TTE is the type of echocardiogram that most people will have. An echocardiogram is a test that uses sound waves to create pictures of the heart. The picture is more detailed than a standard x-ray image. An echocardiogram does not expose you to radiation Here's the link if you wish to read more... http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003869.htm My hair started growing and I love, love, love the soft feeling....the stickiness in the scalp is now gone. BUT in its place, I found that my head sweat excessively, so much so that I must carry a towel with me wherever I go. I sweat at night. It's almost like I've just gotten out of the shower without towel drying my head sort of sweaty feeling. I wonder if this is temporary. Hmmm, let's wait and see. Take care. Thanks for visiting my thread, and sending some more good wishes to everyone's way. @@!!@@ P.S. Please see below for images of my TTE.",

Yippee Just got back from my15th, and last, session of radiation therapy today - actually I have chosen not to have the boost dose (which would have been another 5 days or a week of radiation). My RADs case manager was waiting to have an interview me (a sort of exit or completion interview, if you will) about my experience there, and asked if I could share with her my reasons for declining the boost dose.. I did. We had a very good conversation and discussion about other things as well, eg. those relating to the cancer center's support programs for patients. I told my SO and my RADs case manager my interests in volunteering with new cancer patient education. I was told that someone from their social work (?) department will be in touch with me. Let's see how this part will go... Then I had 3rd week post-RADs visit with my Radiation Oncologist. He took a look at my breast and thought they look fine even though there was a slight blush color...He told me to continue applying whatever it is I've been applying. Gave me an appointment for a follow up visit in early November, then sent me on my way... so I thought \"Wow, that's it then!\" SO below are some words I want to leave us all with....and to think about....   FINAL COMMENTS.... From the very beginning, this journey has been eye opening and fantastically educational because I chose to make it so. I am pleasantly surprised & happy to find that the Cancer Center I had chosen to go to moves everything along pretty quickly and efficiently 90% of the time. The radiation part of it was the easiest and the chemo part, to most extent, was not as bad as I had imagined.... I think that's due to 2 major reasons (1) I prepared by reading up on the side effects of herceptin and paclitaxel, and go further by reading the actual side effects others' experiences. Then I think about what I can do to lessen that effect on me. I read about TCM and organic vitamins that can strengthen my body and boost my immune system. (2) I elected not to go with the standard treatment plan. I had countered with the clinically proven alternate TP I wanted for early stage BC and HER2+ cancer patients. I'm glad my MO was willing to work with me on my request with no fuss and no threat. Of course he did have his say. The senior nurses in the chemo room did try to make my chemo experience comfortable, and fearless. However, the less experience nurses were somewhat overwhelmed by the large number of patients they have to look after. Consequently, they were less attentive and the ambience can, on those occasion, become somewhat robotic... I appreciated the friendliness and professionalism of the team of radiotherapists in Room 8 at my Cancer Center. They were wonderful and patient, great to interact with, and took the time to explain in detail questions I have. Most of all, I love the prompt responsiveness of all my doctors in getting back to me on all my questions before every procedure, every treatment as well as any post treatments questions I have. In this respect, I am quite blessed... Well, I would like to thank you again for visiting my thread, & wish you, my dear fellow members, the VERY BEST, wherever you may be, if you are still travelling along whichever part of your Journey....Make it the way you want, on your terms so you'll feel good about it when it's completed... @!!!@  P.S. I am certainly aware that completing these treatments bring no guarantees... That there is the 5 year, 10 year, 15 year, 20 year or more survival milestones... I'm not gonna waste my time dwelling on them now because I'm more in a hurry to continue onto the many things I still want to do, and to catch up from where my life was put on pause 7 months ago.:-))... and I am feeling quite H_A_P_P_Y right now. I will savor this feeling of Happiness while it lasts... QUE SERA SERA, whatever will be, will be..::--))))...now back into the job market and see where that will lead...ANOTHER JOURNEY to remind myself to stay upbeat too....SEE, LIFE IS ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER....@!!@  PPS. Want to know why I chose to post this last pix of \"I Did It to Save My Life\"?????????????????????????????????????????????????? BECAUSE THAT'S HAPPENING ALL OVER THE WORLD -----.EVERYONE IS DOING WHATEVER THEY NEED TO DO TO SAVE THEIR LIVES, NOT JUSFOR CANCER PATIENTS...... if you ever do get a chance to read this book, you'll find that their survival rate are quite beyond their control too.

      "Content": "Sep 9, 2015 12:29AM - edited Sep 26, 2015 02:23AM by NATSGSG More Update: Ordered a short wig from Jon Renau last night coz a fabulous young breast cancer patient name Erin Leigh talked about it on her youtube videos. They look really natural and beautiful on her, and I found a beautiful one on Voguewig. So it will arrive within a week or two. They are expensive ($99.84 after $20 labor day discount, with free international shipping though). The customer service person who chatted with me online was knowledgeable, and friendly. She said I could exchange within 10 days, or return less a 15% re-stocking fee which I think is reasonable. Though I hope neither will happen. BTW, Erin has other videos on youtube that you can check out that increases cancer patient's esteem. Bless her young soul :-). So, I decided to get one because I've started applying for jobs. These jobs deal with the public or standing in front of an audience. So, I need to be more professional looking. I'm not saying I'm ashamed of my baldness. I'm not. While I like my Sinead O Connor look, I'm still competing with 100s of other people applying for similar jobs. Of course, if someone gives me an offer that's attractive, I won't turn it down either :-)) So, we do what we need to do to beat the competition to get that job, right? Not working for 7 months (actually 9 months for me) is hard and unusual for me coz being busy working have always given me happiness.... Besides, no job = no income. My entire treatment (ie. Consults + tests + surgeries + chemo + radio ) came up to about 35K after subsidies (yep, which is that large 52.5K cost). Total treatment cost about 87.5K. Luckily, because of the insurance and rider I bought, my out of pocket is bearable. And my annual insurance premium cost about $1300. It will increase in about 5 years, naturally. I am forever indebted to my younger sister for her constant nagging to get this medical insurance more than a decade ago. Can any other country beat this? No insurance will ever accept me now with this pre-existing medical condition......so I had better make very sure there is no lapse in my premium payment... Neuropathy update: 2-3 weeks after chemo, I did feel the occasional numbness and/or bloating on both my fingertips. These usually occur in the mornings, but would be gone by late mornings. I'd just wiggle my fingers to encourage the flow of blood. My feet are OK. The numbness on my finger tips get fewer and fewer as the week passes by. I'm happy to report that today, 10 weeks after chemo, there aren't any more numbness or bloating sensation on my fingertips... Also, when I urine, there aren't any more bubbles in the urine. I like to think I've gotten most of the drugs out of my system, and that they did their job killing the enemy cells as they run throughout my entire body. Post radiation-wise, my right breast continues to have some mild redness.. Try to diligently apply the various cream I've bought. Was told it could lasts for a little bit (??) before it will go away....So, I'm keeping an eye on it. But otherwise, I'm eager to be working again.... Thanks for visiting my thread. Sending you this bouquet of tulips and good wishes along your journey...May you continue to be strong and blessed every moment of the day, wherever you are @!!@ ",

      "Content": "Feb 5, 2018 09:30PM - edited Feb 5, 2018 10:04PM by NATSGSG Greetings Everybody: Feb 26, 2018 will be my 3rd anniversary since my right breast cancer was diagnosed, followed by round-block method lumpectomy surgery, chemotherapy and finally radiation (with several weeks recovery time in between each segment). All of these were done over a 6 months period, from March - early September, 2015. By December, I was well enough to go from my intensive 4 weeks CELTA course in Chiangmai, Thailand. I even did many exciting outdoor activities such as white water rafting, canoeing and mountain climbing. Since then each year, I am grateful to be alive...^!^ I have gone on to work and to accomplish as many of the goals I have set out for myself. Having and recovering from cancer certainly changed my perspectives and my priorities in life..... LIFE is such a beautiful thing,.. I am quite determine to make it positive, constructive and beautiful. I have been both working and playing hard... Just this past Thursday, on Feb 1st 2018, I went in to see my surgical oncologist, Dr. BT. So far so good... I love her charm, her accessibility, her smiles, but most of all her caring. No matter how busy Dr. BT is, wherever she may be, she will always, always, always either return my calls or email to reply to my questions. I am very fortunate to be under her care, then and now. Later today, I shall be flying out to Phuket for my 7 days vacation of deep sea fishing, snorkeling, motor cycling and doing whatever I fancy... Today, I want to stop by to wish you, my fellow members a speedy recovery...regardless of the stage of journey you are now at, please be positive and strong at all times. Take very good care of yourself, drink often to hydrate if you are doing chemo. Green bean soup worked well for me, In TCM, it has detoxifying properties. I drank 1.5 to 2 litres each day.... Your journey is understandably a difficult - but one that is NOT impossible to walk... Again, the National Cancer Institute and the National Library of Medicine are truly worthwhile sources, with scientific information that may help you. That was how I found mine. It took many hours of researching and downloading. Oh, please do not forget to look for new updates and clinical trials of the most exciting new cancer treatment \"Immunotherapy\" from the NCI website. Sending everyone tons and tons of best wishes, ",

      "Content": "Jul 2, 2015 02:24AM - edited Sep 23, 2015 09:06PM by NATSGSG UPDATE: CHEMO #10, 6/30/2015 (Tuesday) >>> F I N A L L Y, M Y *** L A S T *** C H E M O <<< Originally, my last chemo session is scheduled for July 14th (12 weekly sessions). However, after Chemo #9 on 6/23/2015, I felt like I have had enough of chemo drugs in my system (being infused over a 2.5 hours each time, although in actuality it generally takes from 3.5 to 4.0 hours, because of recovery time, going to toilet time, and trying to find my basilic vein time etc)... On my follow up visit with my MO this past Monday, 6/29/2015, I was going to let him know that Chemo #9 would be my last. Since there are only 3 more sessions left, he asked why not finish it? I gave my reasons as stated above. Finally, just to make him happy, I said I will do one more session, Chemo #10 and that's it. Tho he classified the non-completion of my 12 weeks treatment as sub-optimal in his report, I won't hold it against him (for me it's subjective anyway, based on my research). I've thought long and hard about it a 2nd time, and am still comfortable with my decision. I have also come to the conclusion that THE LAW OF DIMINISHING RETURNS** in economics also applies to chemotherapy as well. ** Defined as: As more investment is made, overall return on that investment increases at a declining rate. My interpretation of this law (which I call THE LAW OF DIMINISHING EFFECTIVENESS) in terms of chemotherapy is that \"as more and more chemo drugs are given, overall effectiveness of these drugs increases at a decreasing rate so that beyond that certain amount, chemo drugs become more harmful (toxic) and less beneficial to the patient .\" Again, this is only Yours Truly's believe. Another reason is that since I've decided to also do radiotherapy now (starting August 11,2015), I see no reason in having more chemo drugs than needed put into me. Thus, my MO signed off on it, and here I am, at the Jasmine chemo ward at 10 past noon, Tuesday of June 30th, 2015, seated at J14 doing the last of my chemo. While waiting for my usual blood pressure to be taken, and for my now favorite Nurse Myra to come and put the IV line in for me, I suddenly felt somewhat emotional. On the one hand, I am glad that the 2nd leg of my cancer journey is over after today. On the other hand, I knew I will miss the many other cancer patients whom I've met, talked to, laughed and shared information together. It was some sort of unspoken kinship we have whenever we see or run into each other, at any part within the Cancer Center. Our different types of cancers have brought us together. At each of my chemo session over the past 10 weeks, when I looked around our chemo ward, I would make eye contact with my fellow cancer patients. We would smile at or nod to one another, silently encouraging and sending good wishes and strength to each other. I was always happy to see my fellow cancer patients, no matter their age, new or regular... Sometimes, their kid or family member would stop by my seat to come talk to me, which I welcome. For example, while waiting at the chemo ward registration for my turn to be called, a Brunei family of 4 were seated behind me. The mother smiled as I sat down. I asked how she was. She looked nervous and said it's her first chemo session. When I asked if she knows what drug(s) she will be given? She had no idea as her English wasn't good. So she woke her teenage daughter sitting next to her up. I repeated the question, and the daughter said they have no idea either. I explained that if she wishes to know what drug(s) her mother will be having, or how long her chemo infusion is, and what side effects the drug may cause, she could take her mom to the pharmacy behind the reception and asks for any of the Pharmacist there. They will gladly and patiently explained it to them. So they did. About 10 minutes later, I saw that their number was called and went to the Pharmacy to get them. Shortly after they went into the chemo ward, my number blinked. When I entered, the mother saw and waved to me. I pointed to where my seat was, and she nodded. 30 minutes later, the daughter came to my seat and showed me the name of the drug her mother is having. I took a piece of paper from my backpack and wrote www.chemocare.com down, and suggested that if she visits the site, she can read up more about the drug as it contains very comprehensive info of every chemo drugs, including side effects, precautions, self care tips, monitoring, etc. That the more she knows, the more she can help her mother since her father cannot speak English. She further asked what the1.5 liter of green colored fluid is that I've been carrying. I explained it's my green bean soup that I always bring to drink during chemo infusion to hydrate my body; that it helps to reduce side effects for me, and it's well known in TCM to detoxify the body. She asked for the recipe (see below) and I gladly shared it with her. She thanked me and as she shook my hand, she brought it to her lips and kissed it. I was surprised, and later discovered that in her culture, it's their way of thanking someone older than her with respect. @!!@ After my Herceptin pre-medication and recovery time, my attending nurse came quickly to start my Herceptin infusion. 15 mins into treatment, I looked up and saw a lady in a dark dress standing next to my seat. She asked if she could speak to me. I said of course, and invited her to have a seat. She said she heard me talking to the young lady earlier about how to cook the green bean soup. She said she's heard about its detoxifying abilities too before and wanted to know how to cook it. Naturally I obliged. I found out that her husband has nose cancer. According to her, his pessimism, edginess and change of temperament made their life miserable. It seems they sold their restaurant business after many years of hard work, and they were looking forward to travelling around the world to enjoy the fruits of their labor. Just before they leave, her husband's ear went deaf. During an examination, it was found that he's got nose cancer. Naturally, their plans are now in ruined, and they have to deal with it. I took out another piece of paper and wrote down the National Cancer Institute website for her so she can read up everything she wanted to know about nose cancer under Nasal Cavity and Paranasal Sinus Cancer. Hopefully, she can find something of use to her and her husband. She thanked me and went back to her husband's side. These are just 3 of the many different fellow cancer patients I met whenever I come for my chemo treatment, including those with lung, liver, ovarian, bone and other forms of cancers. I don't mind talking with my fellow patients, or listening to their stories.. After all, while waiting, we have time on our hands. None of us are here by choice. Why not learn something about my fellow patients? Maybe I'll even learn something from them too along the way... which I did. I know I will cherish them all... Even as I'm writing this, I'm thinking back to a young mother I met several Chemo ago, with her 6 year old son in tow. We were seated next to each other with a column between us, waiting for our follow up visit with our respective doctors. By chance I looked to my left and she looked up to her right. Our eyes met at the same time. We smiled at each other. I asked how she was feeling. She quietly said \"I've got Stage IV BC, and it's spread to my liver...\" I felt her pain, and her courage at the same time. We talked for a little while longer. She told me she wanted to be on the immunotherapy clinical trials there, but did not qualify. I ask her not to lose hope, and got her email so I could send her links of NCI, SITU and The Cancer Immunotherapy Trials Network, CITN that she could write to and make further enquiries there... I realize that whatever we know can sometimes be of use to others...I truly wish her and many like her well in my thoughts and prayers...I plan on emailing her after this update to find out how she's doing... Overall, my chemo journey has not been as bad as I had expected. For that, I am truly, truly thankful. However, I also believe that some of the things I did before and during chemo helped to reduce the overall SEs that I would have gotten had I done nothing. For instance, a month before chemo, I started taking supplements that builds up my immune system as well as OPC-3 anti-oxidants on a daily basis. When chemo started, I made sure that my body is hydrated daily with 4-5 liters of fluid (water, soups, green bean soup, juices etc) to counter the drugs, especially in the initial 5 chemo sessions. I did not take supplements on chemo day or day after, but continue thereafter until before the next chemo day so as not to interfere with the drugs for that 2 days. I kept up this routine consistently. Throughout it all, my appetite has remained steady and good, as did my taste buds, which was unchanged. Fortunately, I did not get tired easily. I gargled my mouth with Biotene 2-3 times a day to prevent mouth sores and it has worked thus far. There were a few days of very mild diarrhea in one week, but it was quite manageable, and an occasional fatigue here and there that did not prevent me from doing my weekly zumba or kickboxing exercises or daily evening walks by the river. However, by the time Chemo 7 and 8 came around, I found my energy level not as good such that zumba and kickboxing became a little exhausting. So I switched to working out at a gym, doing muscles building and workout exercises 3-4 mornings a week for 1 to1.5 hours. I adjusted my schedules so that I sleep an hour or two longer. Before, I used to get up at around 0730-0800 hours. Now I let my body dictate the amount of sleep it needs. This seem to work too. I supposed with the accumulation of so much drugs over 10 weeks, no matter how good my body was in the initial 50% of this chemo journey, it's bound to hit me later. So I surmise this is what is currently happening to me, from these last few sessions....so I remember to take things easy...Good thing is that I have about 5 weeks to recover before heading into 3 weeks (15 days) of radiation therapy. I'm so glad it's not a long radiation regimen - 2 weeks of daily 10 mins session on the whole breast and 1 final week of booster to the location where my tumor was previously (at least that's my understanding) I had thought that since Tuesday was my last chemo, I need not paint my nails black. You may have read in one of my chemo notes that taxane drugs such as paclitaxel and docetaxel can result in nail sensitivity to light, resulting in cracked, blackened or warped nails. And I had read somewhere that by painting one's nail black, this help prevent these from happening. Well, I did paint my nails black throughout it all and it worked - meaning it was looking good. However, last night, I took off my nail polish foolishly thinking that I don't need it anymore. When I got up this morning, the edges of my all nails started cracking!!!! (see pictures below). That's because my bed is next to the windows which are fully facing the light. I quickly drew the curtains, trimmed off the edges of those nails, and painted them over again with dark nail polish. I think I will do this for another week or two just to ensure that the taxol has left my body. I will report back later as to what happens..  My hair has grown to about 2/3 inch now. It has not thickened, just evenly, lightly growing all around the entire head. I still wear my headscarf when I go out. I make sure I apply lots of sunblock on my face and hands. I discovered one of the good things to come out of this chemo is that most of the brown (age) spots on the back of my both lower legs and front of thighs are gone. With respect to the icing of both my hands and legs to reduce or prevent neuropathy, it has worked very well on both my legs because I soaked them in cold, cold, cold ice water up to my ankles for 2 hours during the paclitaxel portion of infusion (actually, 30 mins before, 60 mins during, and 30 more mins after). My fingers, however, do experience a very mild numbness or tingling at both my fingertips on occasion, esp after Chemo #9. My MO said I should have soaked my entire hands in the ice water, not just my fingers...so I did not do it exactly right. But it's not serious... But since it only occurs after chemo #9, my MO said to give it time and they may not last for long...we'll have to see. It hasn't affected my ability to write or type or eat with a spoon or fork. and I will come back to this thread to report back after some time. My reconstructed right breast via the Round Block method is still healing slowly and nicely...It has thus far settled into a size 36D (versus my original 38D). During my 1st consult with my Radiation Oncologist (RO) this past Monday, I found out that there were metal clips inside it where my 2.5 cm tumor was taken out. I emailed my Oncoplastic Surgeon asking about it. She replied in the affirmative that there were six 3 mm size clips in there to facilitate the accuracy of radiation to my whole breast during radiation therapy, and that it's a standard procedure. I've always wondered about it when I massaged my breast each night feeling some hardness, Now I know why I cannot lay on my right side for a long while. and it also explains why it gets sore after a while. I will follow up to see if these clips can be removed after the completion of radiation therapy. Anyway, my RO stated something of interest. He said some large breasted patients of his ended up with their breast being one size larger after radiation. I asked \"Really?\" Well! You know what that means right? :-)) Well, that's all I could think of for now...I'm getting some amount chemo brain in that I feel my head is heavy from the accumulation of 10 weeks of chemo drugs, haha...:-D..So I will lie down a bit for now...I know it will go away eventually...so, I'm not worried about it :-)))  <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><> UPDATE: 07/04/2015 - Happy 4th of July to everyone. Hope you all had a swell one.... This past Fri/Sat, the food I ate started to feel tasteless except for most fruits...and I found that I needed longer sleep. My energy level isn't as good as before Chemo #9....In fact, it has fallen to my lowest level ever!!!. Previously at the gym, I was able to do 3 sets of 20 of different weights exercises without any problem However, after the last chemo #10 especially, I can only do 2 sets of 12-15. I also exhausts easier now....I feel somewhat disappointment but have to accept the fact of the full force of these chemo drugs is finally doing its stuff in my body.  The Law of Diminishing Effectiveness came to my mind then....I wondered if I had inadvertently caused problems for myself by agreeing to go for that 1 more chemo session? I began to feel the full force of the accumulation of 10 weekly 2.5 hours chemo infusions....My mouth started tasting more chemical and dryer than it had ever been.... So I continue with hydrating myself even more.... This is more pronounced at night where I have to get up hourly to drink my green bean juice to reduce the unpleasant taste, and getting the drugs flushed out of my system as much as possible.. I even felt these drugs sucking every part of the fluids inside my body even during sleep...This made me more determined to do whatever I can to keep it from happening. I continue taking my supplement intake of OPC-3s and immune system booster now include fish oil as well.. As each day progresses, I'm more convinced than ever that the over medication of chemo could have contributed to my sudden decrease in strength... I believe our body's reaction is its own way of telling us when we get too much of something...  I've also discovered that that after chemo 10, my sweat stinks like crazy...I mean not the usual sweaty smell, but the really, really toxicky, chemically, stinky smell that even I can't stand it that I have to take several showers a day to get rid of it...The same happens when nature has to call one away. It was exceedingly bad...The good thing to come out of this is that these toxins are being discharged from the body. So, drinking lots of fluid helped to make it bearable..  WRT radiation down the road, my RO finally replied to my email seeking clarification as to the amount of radiation dosage I will get. Radiations dosage are measured in \"Grays or Gy.\" I shall be getting 40 Grays over that 3 weeks period. That's good as it is not a high dosage. Our own site here has a great article on it about rad dosage. Worth reading. So, that's the latest...will come back to add more....Do Take care, and sending good wishes your way, if you're still in chemo...@@!!@@  *** HOW TO MAKE GREEN BEAN DRINK (Pix Below)*** 1) Wash 2/3 cup green beans in water, at least twice and pour into a pot. 2) Add 2 liters of water into the pot. Turn to high heat, and let it cook till boiling. As soon as the water starts boiling, set it to low heat and let it cook for another 25-30 minutes or until the beans are totally soft and broken. Do not cover entirely. 3) When the beans are thoroughly cooked (very soft and broken), turn off the heat. Do not cover the pot. Take a sieve and scoop up such that it filled 1/2 or 1/3 of the sieve. Use the back of a large ladle or spoon to crush the beans. Then soak it back in the soup, You want to extract the nutrients from inside the crushed beans. Continue until most of beans are done. 4) Scoop out and discard all beans. If you like to eat it, leave it to cool and then refrigerate. 5) Leave the soup to cool. When cool, fill it into your container or chill it in the refrigerator until you are ready to drink or take it with you on chemo day. Note 1: On occasion, I will forget to do it the day before. So I will get up very early and cook it. To help cool it down, I fill a basin with 1/4 water, set the entire pot into the basin, and add ice around it. This really helps cool the soup down quickly (transfer of heat from pot to water in basin). When water in basin is warm or hot, I discard it and refill it, set the pot in it again, and re-fill it with ice. It never fail to work, and I was able to leave for my early morning blood test and chemo session with my drink. Note 2: Please do not add any sugar in it. Under normal circumstances, we do add rock or brown sugar. But since sugar feeds cancer, NOTHING IS ADDED TO IT. We will drink it in its natural form until we are done with chemotherapy, and then some. If you add sugar, it will be totally futile. Note 3: If you want a really thick flavor, you could put the cooked beans and soup in a blender, and consume it that way...but during chemo infusion, I find it easier to just drink the soup. If it's refrigerated, I would normally leave it to room temperature. It's better to consume unchill for chemo. Under normal circumstances, we can drink it hot or cold. Note 4: I have also started to make and drink barley water to add variety to my sources of fluid intake. Again, no sugar added. Note 5: If your green bean soup turns red, that means you've overcooked it. Still drinkable, but less nutrients. Hope these info helps. Thanks for visiting, and have a terrific and enjoyable summer...and sending more good wishes to you if you are still in chemo.@@@!!!@@@ ",

Both Doctors checked my right breast and are happy that is it continuing to heal nicely. When asked how long the scar around the areola will heal, was told it would slowing fade from about 8 months to a year. Was also told that radiation will help speed up the scarring, though it could result in a slight hardening of the breast. Now, this explains why the breast could go back up one size after therapy. I found out too how the hardening of the breast can be avoiding during radiation. I will write this during the 3rd leg of my journey under \"Radiation Update.\" Also asked about the 6 clips that were placed inside my right breast during re-constructive surgery, and asked to see what they looked like. Before seeing it, I was told each was like 3 mm. They are used to help find the location of the tumor with accuracy during the last week of rads boost to that location. I've been imagining it to be like a tiny rectangular metal there and didn't feel comfortable. However, having finally seen it today, I felt extremely relieved. There are only about 2 mm about the size of 3 grains of sand (see the diamond like grain below the arrow) and of titanium. Considering that they are not as big as I had imagined, I guess it's OK not to take it out. I was also told that it wont heat up during rads, nor will they cause any problem if I am going through a metal detector at the airport. That's most certainly a relieved too. Since my Medical Onc is out on vacation, I decided to ask my SO about my decrease in energy level, stamina and strength, She said that I'm currently experiencing the FULL FORCE of the Chemotherapy, and that it will take about a month for all the drugs in my body to be discharged. She advised that I go back to doing daily walking exercises instead of gym workouts...I informed her that even waking seems like work now...she said I must do it to keep up my energy and stamina even though I don't feel like it now. I shall be going for my post chemo full cardio-toxicity test next week, and a follow up visit with my MO the week after. Now I understood why this test is being given 2 weeks after chemo...Will report to share the results with you. OK >> that's it for now....Talk to you another time, and have a great day / week / month etc.. Sending terrific summer wishes your way @!!@ Below is the actual size of one of 6 titanium clips placed inside my right breast during breast reconstructive surgery. ",

If it is macrometatasis, then, perhaps one have no choice, but if it isn't, save your axillary if you can. Coz removing your axillary means that hand cannot life anything heavy, like carrying your child, heavy groceries anything over 5 pounds...also longer recovery, and you cannot have anything done to that ar eg vaccination, take blood, IV insertion, taking your blood pressure, practically everything. I was very very lucky my Doctor is such an understanding person. She gave me caring and support all the way. If you can find a doctor who you feel totally comfortable, who is willing to address all your concerns, who takes the time to call you back like my current doctor. The more control you can have over your decisions, the better you feel.

      "Content": "Jun 9, 2015 08:34PM - edited Sep 23, 2015 08:28PM by NATSGSG *** UPDATE CHEMO #6 *** 6/02/2015: TUE > Wow, it took a long while for the nurses to try to find my vein for today's IV line. Apparently, the basilic veins (see pix below) in my lower left arm are deeper, making it somewhat difficult. So, a heating pad was brought and placed on the arm. When asked, was told that this expands the vein making it easier to find. Our attending nurses are generally not the same each week since there are so many cancer patients daily at this Cancer Center. I did not want the IV line on my lower right arm today because alternating the arms are better to prevent our veins from hardening. And it must never be done at the same location of that previous vein. It can be done an inch above or below the last point of the same vein, but not at the exact location. Doing so would damage the vein, hardening it and will take a long time for that basilic vein to heal. I didn't have a port put in because of my short 12 weeks chemo duration. It would be worth it if one's chemo is 6 months or longer. Note: If one has an axillary dissection (ALND) done, it is good to remind the nurses as that arm should not been used for IV infusion, for drawing blood, for vaccine shots, including not lifting anything > 5 pounds etc. If one has ALND on both arms, then a port may be needed. I'm sure your MO will discuss these with you. As I did not have ALND, my arms are fine - although the loss of 1 sentinel lymph node causes the right arm to feel not fully normal :-(( Putting the IV line on the back of both my hands are out of the question as I needed to wear food gloves to ice both hands to prevent neuropathy. Eventually, Senior Nurse Myra was called in to help. She noticed brown coloring on previous locations of both my lower arms where the IV line were taped down. Apparently I had allergic reactions to the regular IV tapes (i.e.Tegaderm Film, see pix below) and weren't even aware of it. She then instructed my attending nurse that day to make a note in my patient file that wef today, only the IV 3000 Ported 7cm x 9cm tape be used (see pix below). I asked what that was, she said it's for patients who have allergic reactions to regular tape. Wow, was I glad she caught it even though I've been wondering about marks (see pix below of those darker marks on my right arm). They were red for a day or two after chemo, but not itchy. Senior nurse Myra also informed me that she has decided to use a finer size needle (0.017 mm) instead of the usual size IV needle on my thinner veins. This also result in a slower infusion rate and is less damaging to these thinner basilic veins. New hair growth seem imminent. Bloating seemed to have disappeared. Nose hair all gone (now gotta wear mask). Appetite back to normal today though not as hungry as in the previous 5 chemo. Thus eating less. Noticed skin now prone towards breakage during shower, so stopped scrubbing body, only allowing the warm water to run through body. There were some mild non-itching hives on appearing on both arms and front of thighs. Applying deep moisturizing cream several times daily appears to help. Exercise as per normal. Appetite normal. Taste buds normal.  6/08/2015: MON, Blood Test & follow up visit with MO. RBC, WBC and platelets within range except for the mild liver inflammation. Though it has improved since the last time I met with my MO, he said there isn't any cause for concern, which was good news. He has already scheduled me for an early consult with the RO next week to talk about radiation therapy. Radiation therapy will occur about 4 weeks after my chemo ends to give my body time to recover, he said. When I told him that some fellow members at our site were sent for radiation therapy immediately after lumpectomy and/or reconstructive surgery without recovery time, he said that is foolhardy and painful to patients. A 4-5 weeks recovery time is generally recommended. Protecting our body is so very important. It seems we shouldn't allow ourselves be put in a position of convenience to others at the expense of comfort and benefits to ourselves. Thought I just wanted to share this piece of info. Of course, you would be the best judge of your own situation. In regards to the hives on both arms and thighs, MO suggested using baby body wash if needed. Continue exercising and going to my zumba and kick boxing weekly classes at the National Stadium. Joined the gym membership at the community center today since it's only a 5 mins walk from my home. Decided that I will start working to get my biceps/triceps and my abs back into shape now that I am stronger. Just hope I have the discipline to go there every day for a 2-hour work-out. Was told to do biceps/triceps every other day, and abs every alternate days. Will do my best to get back into shape, esp since I've put on 2.5 kg already. I need to lose about 25 kg in all, and I really want to achieve this goal. ** Pix below is an example of the 3 types of catheter/port locations available at this Cancer Center. Different hospitals may use different types. Please check with your MO's office. If you google Ports For Chemotherapy you will find a host of other different devices. 1) Implanted port aka port-a-cath (the one closest to you on the right side of this mannequin). This port is an estimated 1 inch round disk that is implanted under your skin (that flap lying down is the skin where it will be stitched back. How may stitches, how large, degree of pain if any, recovery time etc. - that you need to ask your MO for specifics). Surgery is needed of course. There will also be scars of course. It must be cleaned and there's a charge, I believe. I didn't ask for details since I wasn't particularly interested. 2) Will come back and complete this info as I had given the flyer to another cancer patient when I saw that the veins in her arms had hardened while we were waiting at registration desk. She was not aware she can ask to have a port implanted. She said it's probably because her English weren't good that she may not have understood it when they might have asked it of her. Since she has 8 more months of chemo, suggested that she ask her MO if she can get one. Of the 3 port, I thought the middle one (as shown on the right side of the mannequin) would be the best one to do and maintain. 3) Will come back and complete this section later. This is the one that on the right lower arm of the mannequin.  Below is a pix of the location of veins in our upper/lower arms. My IV line is usually placed between the elbow and wrist, and not the back of my hands. I requested it to be so because I need to wear gloves for the 2 hours icing of my hands to prevent post-chemo neuropathy.  Below is a pix of my right lower arm that shows the brown imprint left by the regular IV tape, on center right between the elbow and wrist, from the previous 5 chemo. Now, only the non-allergic IV 3000 tape is used, and I no longer have those brown marks. By late June, all the old brown marks on both arms have faded. Please note that I alternate my arm for chemo infusion each week. Since different nurses attended to me each week, I have to ensure/remind the nurse not to use the same vein for the IV location. Doing so would cause a hardening of that vein that could result in poor blood circulation later. The hardening will heal over time if you make it a point to ensure that. Again, protect our body, always, always, always.  Below is a pix of the regular IV line tape called Tegaderm. It leaves a brown spot on my right arm above. So it was changed to the non-allergic tape, the IV-3000 (see pix below). As a reminder, anyone who have had axillary lymph nodes taken out from your arm(s) cannot have an IV line to that arm - which means one has no choice but had to have a catheter put into your body. Different types of catheter will be offered to you at that time.  Below is a pix of the non-allergic IV 3000 I.V. line tape. This IV tape leaves no brown imprint on one's arm. Nurse Adele told me that there are a few patients who cannot have any tape due to their super-allergy tendencies. So, they ended up using gauzes to tape the I.V. line down.  *** UPDATE CHEMO #7 *** 6/09/2015: TUE Today's chemo went smoothly, and ended sooner. Brought my usual 1.5 litres homemade green bean juice to drink between infusion. I asked for the smaller size IV infusion needle that was used in my 6th chemo. This decrease the infusion speed of the drugs, making my chemo much more comfortable throughout. I also reminded the new attending nurse of the IV3000 tape that should now be used on my arm, and not the regular IV tape as the one in my box. Because this center has many cancer patients daily, and from where I am seated, I can see that the nurses are rather busy attending to 5-10 different types of cancer patients every day. So I can empathize with their situation. Each time before dispensing our drugs, the nurses will re-confirm our names and ID # to ensure there is no mix-up in drugs given. Great news! Confirmed new hair growth this past weekend. I cannot believe it when my sister told me at night. They seemed to have come in all at once suddenly all over my head. Now, they are like seeds suddenly springing into life, about half an inch long. My entire head, as of this writing, is covered evenly but not thickly yet, with dark hair. Last week, I've felt bumps growing around the head when I massage my scalp each night before go to bed. Had initially thought they were hives or head-pimples or something, but thank God they are growing hair bumps. It's quite fascinating really. Of course, I am pleasantly surprised that they are growing back sooooooo soon. Yay... @@!!@@  Thanks for visiting... Sending good wishes to all my fellow members currently undergoing chemotherapy too...",

DIDN'T TAKE RADS #3 PIX TODAY (Friday, Aug 14), But procedures are the same. Will post only when there's something new and interesting eg. side effects from RT. (1) Pictures of the Changing Room  (2) Pictures of Radiation #2 in Action  (3) Pictures of the Bottom & Top of The Radiation Machine. The glass in the pix to the right is where the rads beam discharges from.  Post RADs Remarks: I feel better & good today...again, my right breast felt warm immediately after radiation - so slathered on tons of aloe vera and every 3-4 hours thereafter...I've decided not to wear a bra after radiation to allow my breast to breathe and because of the aloe vera gel.. The bra constricts my right breast. It was uncomfortable after radiation.... Later towards the evening, the right side of my right breast (in the NNE position) felt somewhat hot as if one gets those heaty sunburn sensation after several hours at the beach sans sunblock. So, I sprayed on pure emu oil. That seemed to cool it down. BTW, my hair is growing nicely, about 5/8 inch long now with some strands growing as long as 2-3 inches and curly dotting all over different parts of my scalp. . I take pictures of them every week. I decided when they are long enough, I shallput them together into a slide presentation and share them later. I was showering before bed and discovered that all my nose hair have grown back. Boy, was I glad that the air I breathe is being re-filtered again...hehe ...But the head sweating has not stopped -:(( Anyway, going to bed now. Thanks for visiting my thread....take care now...@!!@",

Good thing it does not hurt, just warm to the touch. Been applying my cream and moisturizer to it, and they feel OK. Still, will need to keep an eye out for it. It's my body after all. Post Chemo Update: My hair is growing quite nicely and thicker now. I just love touching them as they're so fluffy. It's strange to see and feel those \"rogue\" hair throughout my head. I call them \"rogue\" because they are like 3 inches long. I don't mind them at all, though it would be nicer if ALL the hair are rogue. Then it would be amazing to have 3 inches all of a sudden, wouldn't it. I Still getting the head sweats that I had previously mentioned, though not as often as before...Hope it's a sign of improvement in this area. Will have to pay attention. I've also discovered that the continual doing of the arm lifting or swinging exercises are so good for my right armpit. Not doing it a day or two tends to result in a stiffen right arm... OK, that's all for today...Gotta rest now as I have a looooong day tomorrow.。。。 Take care, thanks for visiting and sending good energetic blessings your way...@!!!@ ",

      "Content": "Sep 23, 2015 07:21AM - edited Sep 27, 2015 11:06AM by NATSGSG Post Chemo Update- It's been exactly 12 weeks since. Hair's growing very nicely, and all bodily hairs have returned (underarms, nose hairs, ear hairs, lower legs hair, and even those in our private region). I found out, after talking to a hair specialist, that the stickiness on my scalp before hair growth were due to the sebaceous glands that are associated with each hair follicle that produce an oily secretion to help condition the hair and surrounding skin. Most chemotherapy drugs work by attacking fast-replicating cells. Rapid cell replication is one of the hallmarks of cancer; however, hair follicle cells also grow and divide quickly. Consequently, the chemotherapy drugs usually inhibit hair growth. The dose and type of medicine determine the severity of hair loss, but once the chemotherapy has ended, new hair growth may begin after 3 to 10 months ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_hair_growth) So, I'm not sure if there are any fellow members out there who've also experience that sticky, oily feeling. Still, this lasted about 2+ weeks in my case. However, after the hair stubbles started coming in, and when the entire head is covered with new hair growth, which is about 10 weeks post chemo for me, that sticky-oily feeling has now disappeared. All I have now is just the waiting-for-the-hair to continue growing time... my hair has a little curliness in it too.. Post RADs Update: It's been exactly 3 weeks after radiation. Since a week ago, my right breast has suddenly became mildly reddish. I've been applying 100% Fruit of the Loom Aloe Vera as much as possible.. It really does soothe the skin.. Was kind of surprise to see it because there weren't any reddish sunburned tinge during and up until a week after radiation...I mean I've read about it....it is strange to see it happening after all - it's as if the radiation effect continues on its own.. Furthermore, the swelling that has caused my right breast to become a size bigger than my left during radiation is now subsided such that after shower today, I noticed it being a size smaller now. AND VISIBLY so...-:(( But, it still looks good though...and no one to appreciate it with. LOL Every now and then, the breast does hurts a little.....I onder if this has anything to do with the 6 titanium clips inside my right breat tumor base.. .I'm wondering if I should have it removed ..sigh...I'll have to decide when I go on a follow up visit with my SO on November 2nd....Wow, time has surely fly....and decisions...decisions..decisions...to be made as well. Other than all these, everything else have gone back to normal. In fact, I shall be leaving for Chiangmai, Thailand for a 5 weeks training course. I'm really looking forward to it. Heard it's a beautiful city. Of course I do intend to take lots of pictures like I always wherever I travel so I can look back on them.....and then off to another part of DA WORLD ..to resume the life, and working towards that many yet unaccomplish goals I have been planning all along ... So, L-I-F-E here I come !!!  With that, I like to send a VERY, VERY, VERY best wishes to you, my dear fellow members, OVERCOME, STAY STRONG & THEN HAVE A G O O D L I F E , wherever you are...  >>I'll only come back to give new updates that I will come across. >> You will notice that throughout this journey, I have walked most of it by myself....sometimes it can be a lonely journey. But keeping positivity is especially important... If anyone I will meet from this point forward are either negative, critical, nasty, non-communicative, easily offended, condescending and so forth, I shall stay away from them... I do not wish nor would I want to expand any energy in that direction. I just want to BE HAPPY, and CELEBRATE THE LIFE THAT IS GIVEN TO ME EVERY DAY !!! ",

However, it is being posted under subsection \"Waiting for Test Results\" section.  I've just taken a look at it again. It is under the section as it should be. If one is not diagnosed with cancer, one would probably not read this post unless one is curious to know more about the subject. I wanted to post it there because generally, most people tend to be nervous during waiting to find out whether their tumor is benign or malignant. It's something to keep one's mind occupied....and this treatment is being brought back. To me, it's awesome. Thanks for writing and bringing it to my attention. Have a terrific day.",

The report will confirm the stage,  grade,  type of receptor and HER 2 genes you have  (+ or  -) which can help determine the kind of surgery and treatment plan you will receive.  Once you get these results,  then I suggest you read up via the pubmed website on information similar to yr case to educate yrself.  If you are planning on getting a lumpectomy and then reconstructive surgery, this link below can give you plenty of ideas of which method is the best for the latter. I read that even with a 4 cm tumor size, once it's shrink by chemo, you can still go for lumpectomy to save your breast. http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijbc/2011/303879/ I've copied and pasted a \"How To Read Your Pathology Report\" in this Diagnosed and Waiting For Results Page just above yours.

In fact, a gentlemen who has cancer was informed by his dentist to start gargling his mouth with it before any therapy kicked in. He did and never had any mouth sores at all. I've ordered several bottles of Biotene myself in advance of my treatment too. My gf, who is a mother of 2 young girls, who had mastectomy of both breasts, chemo and radiation, advised told to stock up on it before therapy and start using it. Over time, it protects the gums, interior walls and roof of mouth, and best of all, no sores. Taking pain medication is only temporary and you are putting more drugs in yourself... You can order this from Walmart.com online website, and have it delivered to your home. Good luck! Please let us know if it works for you after a while. ",
