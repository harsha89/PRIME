It was very successful in shrinking it before surgery, so I'm grateful to my oncologist for suggesting it. It wasn't exactly fun, but I found that after the first three days after treatment I could get back to normal more or less. I used to go out and work in the garden. One effect I remember was that whenever I physically exerted myself, as in digging the garden, my nose would run uncontrollably. And I'd forgotten about the red pee! I had quite a lot of soreness in the mouth, and was advised to use a soft toothbrush. This is an extract from my diary, the day of the first TAC treatment: \"When the day came, I was not too anxious, I just wanted to get it over with. It was only supposed to be for two hours, but I disgraced myself by fainting when the nurse put the cannula in! As I had previously had intravenous antibiotics and a blood transfusion, I thought I would be OK...but...Anyway, the nurses rushed around getting me oxygen, lying me flat, taking my blood pressure (which was too low to register on the gauge!) and I recovered. Next time they will put the needle in while I'm lying down, which should avoid that problem. The nurse looking after me was lovely, and very interesting to talk to. She had to sit with me for about half an hour to push two of the drugs through. the third drug dripped in by itself over the course of an hour. The rest of the treatment went smoothly, the nurse took the needle out, and I went home. Almost right away, I felt very tired, and wanted to lie down when I got home. I could still function reasonably well, but even so it was nice to have a meal cooked for me by my husband. I discovered that my taste buds were less sensitive, so I didn't feel inclined to eat much. The anti-sickness tablets and steroids helped deal with other side effects, so things were not too bad.  The day after treatment wasn't bad, apart from loss of taste, but the next three days I felt too tired to do anything, and just lazed on the sofa. My resolution to eat three pieces of fruit a day went out the window (all fruit, especially oranges, tasted like muck!)  My head ached slightly, and there was some sensitivity on the palms of my hands and soles of my feet. But it was all quiet manageable, and didn't make me dread the next treatment. Best of all, the lump started to feel smaller. I would have felt fine a week after the treatment, except that the chemo triggered a premature and heavy period. the loss of blood at this vulnerable time made me feel weak.\" It was the same pattern after each treatment (hair fell out quickly around the time of the second treatment), but it took a little longer to recover from treatment by about the fourth one. Sorry if my story is a bit too far in the past for you. TAC was the best treatment for me in 2005, I don't know what the usual chemo treatment consists of now. The important thing to say is that it worked!!",
