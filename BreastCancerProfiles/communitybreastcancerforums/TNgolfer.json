I am making the changes I need to make to eliminate the stress in my life (that may even mean a separation in my marriage, but it is about me.  I am going to do what I need to do to make my life peaceful.  You can do it, too.  The doctor who is heading up the clinical study that I was in actually wrote a book on the topic.  PM me if you want the info, or if you need anything else. You will be in my thoughts and prayers.  To \"smell the roses\" you first have to go find them! Marianne",

You can review percentages until your head spins....but you will never know if you are in that 2% or 98%.  It doesn't matter.  You have to make a decision that you won't regret.  Trust that you will.  I was just as scared and bewildered, and then I just knew what was right for me.  YOU WILL TOO! Praying for wisdom for you!",

I would encourage all to find as much info as they can.  Estrogen is a hormone and hormone therapy makes more sense than chemotherapy for er+ tumors. ",
