I worked full time and exercised all through treatment, I think staying busy keeps me sane, and staved off the tiredness. I never got any fatigue and my skin is just a little pink and itchy, They gave a big bottle of Garden of Eden aloe that I used the whole time, and eventually needed a prescription hydrocortisone cream to stave off the itching and rash. I was expecting the last 5 treatments, which were small field boosts, to be more intense, but I didn't notice anything different. My 12-yo daughter came to the last few weeks, she sat in the waiting room and drank all their hot chocolate, lol. All the techs were so nice and I loved talking to them and the other patients. Honestly I will miss them, is that weird? I found myself wearing all my shoes to entertain them, lol, what else are they going to look at? The whole experience was very sobering, I shared time with folks with several different kinds of cancers, really hard to watch some times. Lots of suffering with this cancer business. I was amazed by my doctor and the techs, grace under pressure.",
