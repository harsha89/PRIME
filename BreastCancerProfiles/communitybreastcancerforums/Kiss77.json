I don't know why here, in Bulgaria, everything is so difficult. Last year, when I was dx. with BC they said I'm HER negative. 4 Bulgarian labs gave me the same result. I sent the paraffin blocks in Paris and they said it is HER positive, but they weren't sure. CISH was not successful because in Bulgaria they made something wrong with the material and the DNA of the sells was broken (I'm not sure what exactly was the problem but I couldn't have a result from in-situ hybridization because of bad material). I wanted to start treatment as soon as possible but obviously I have to play the waiting game again :-(. Christina",

The second lab gave me different results for PR - it is positive as the ER - the same as the primary cancer characteristics, but unfortunately Ki67 is changed - it is 30% now. It was less than 15 on the primary cancer. Not a good news but I can't change anything about this. I started chemotherapy yesterday - weekly taxol and Avastin. My onc said that we are going to clear all meths with the taxol and then continue only with Avastin....Wish me luck! She will discuss with me the other options for the liver therapy (ablation etc.) after the end of the taxol treatment. Fingers crossed she is right and we can clear all this nasty stuff from my liver. Christina",

As Pet/CT is not reliable for me we are going to make SPECT/CT. I'm not sure what the difference is. Today will try to meet the doc who is in charge of this. I don't know what to pray for :-( Obviously there is progression somewhere. And why Navelbin is working for the liver mets - keep them stable and isn't working for other cancer - wherever it is.

And she don't want to change anything else. Xgeva should heal bone mets and as the liver mets are under control  - we will keep Navelbine. Is it a time for a second opinion ? I like my oncologist and I trust her but not 100%. I hate when I have doubts.",

The gastroenterologist said that PET scan is not reliable for detecting the liver mets. I hope it is reliable for other parts of the body. I'm waiting now the liver biopsy results, but he is sure I have liver mets. Christina",
