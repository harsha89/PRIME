They said since it's stage III we are going to throw everything we can at this to fight it and I was all for it.  I was reading on here some of the side effects people are having and have been down lately with the way I feel and look.  The whole mx, te, weight gain, no hair, looking and feeling liked I aged 10 years over night.  The thought of more of that for the next 5 years suddenly seemed overwhelming. ",
