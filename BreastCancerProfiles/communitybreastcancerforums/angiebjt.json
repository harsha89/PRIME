    "Content": "Oct 2, 2008 12:45PM - edited Oct 2, 2008 12:48PM by angiebjt Hi everyone! My name is Angie and Im from Troy, NC. I am 46 years old and have been a nurse since 1981. I was a LPN for 11 years and a RN or 16 years. My entire RN career has mainly been in the ER. I worked 15 of those years in the ER at a small community hopsital in my hometown. I have recently been diagnosed with Breast Cancer and I am also HER2 +. I have had the lumpectomy and sentinel node removal last week. I will be seeing the oncologist next week to see what treatments I will have to have. I found this site this morning and was thrilled to find this one for \"us nurses\"!! I think even though we have some knowledge it is still very scary when you are told you have \"CANCER\". I am now working for a travel agency and doing the travel nurse thing! My agency has been wonderful so far. The director of nursing there is a breast cancer survivor so Im sure that helps. The director for the ER that I'm currently at, working my 2nd contract, has also been wonderful and supportive and is willing to help me with my schedule so that I can continue to work. I have a great support system within my family and friends but it's great to meet others, while unfortunate it has to be thru this, but who is going thru the same. I look forward to talking to you all. Have a great day!!",
