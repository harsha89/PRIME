Or if anyone knows of any other boards/groups/websites where I can find a discussion of clinical trial drugs, such as Avastin. Thanks so much. Yolanda Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Footsox1 wrote: I have just returned from the oncologist who went over the results from my recent scans. He said they found what appears to be a cyst on my ovary. They are now going to set up an appointment for me to have an ultrasound done to check it out. The doctor sort of said, that it will most likely be a cyst and nothing to worry about, but they just need to check it out. I was just having these scans done to prepare for my upcoming chemo. Now, this is another thing to worry about, that I hadn't expected. Has anyone had this happen? Can you tell me your experience? The doctor said that many women have these cysts and they are not cancerous.... Of course that is what they are going to say to me at this point. Thank you for any thoughts, input or advice.

      "Content": "Footsox1 wrote: I am getting ready to have my port for chemo inserted. I was unaware that this was done with anesthesia. I thought it was a simple office procedure, now I am a bit concerned. Also, I had an IV in my hand before and after surgery, and it was painful and is still bruised there. I hated it. Is this port the same feeling? I understand it is done in my chest. Can anyone tell me how it feels and any other info? Also, my surgeon is going on vacation and wants to do it about 10 days before I will start the chemo for he first time. This seems to be a red flag to me. I would rather have it in for as little time as possible and 10 days prior to the chemo seems excessive. Does anyone have any thoughts on this? Thank you so much for your advice and any info.
