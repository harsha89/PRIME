B9 fibroadenomas.  I'm back here posting because I have a couple questions.  I have found a new lump in the breast that I had the biopsies in and also I have a lump under my nipple on the opposite breast.  I am constantly finding new lumps.  It's starting to stress me out and cause a bit of anxiety.  My maternal grandmother had breast cancer  and I know the odds for me, being only 26, are slim that I would have it.  I also know that 80% of lumps are benign.   I have an appt Feb. 8 with the surgeon who did my biopsies to do ultrasound of my breast ( the lump under my nipple ) to see if it has grown.  Now, my questions:  Would a surgeon be able to read the ultrasound or should I get a referral to a radiologist to get the ultrasounds done?  Also, with women who constantly have lumps in their boobs, what should the course of action be?  Will I have to get an ultrasound every so many months to monitor them?  What are my the other types of biopsies that can be performed besides excisional?  Last question... is there a link between cervical and breast cancer?  I have an appt with a gyno coming up as well since an urgent care dr found a something that looked like a polyp.  I haven't had a pap in 2 years.  My husband is military and we moved right around the time my pap was due and eventually life got in the way and I forgot all about it.   Thanks for reading and hopefully you ladies can help answer some of my questions that I can't seem to find the answers to anywhere else.    Log in to post a reply",
