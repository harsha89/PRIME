Everyone's experience will be different, but I hope each of your experiences goes as smoothly as mine.  Just wanted to offer some encouragement to you all.  Oh, & I just took a shower -- felt so good!  Thinking of you all as your dates come along.",

I had a panic moment when I got on the operation table, but have felt peace since then.  Waiting was the hardest, hands down, no question about it. Got my final path report, the 4 nodes were clear & no signs of anything on the right side.  Cancer was 1.4 cm., so no unexpected findings.   They're running an oncotype DX which will take about 2 weeks to get back.  It'll have to be a fairly high score to convince me to do chemo, but I'm trying to stay open minded. Hang in there, ladies.  Having it over is huge!  I, too, have not been shocked by the sight of my chest.  I'd looked at lots of photos to brace myself & I'm comfortable with what I have.  The TEs are far from attractive, but the incisions aren't too bad.  I'm thinking that I may agree with one woman on one of the topics that said she's much more embarrassed by the cellulite are her thighs than her scars.  Strength & courage is a good mantra to chant this week-end!.",
