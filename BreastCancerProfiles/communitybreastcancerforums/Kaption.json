Bless her for taking on this fatigue because it's likely not just cancer. She's hanging in there with me to eliminate what it's not. I'm having a heart echo next Wednesday and she's contacting an endocrinologist for me. She's wondering if it's adrenal. She did a couple of tests for that and they came back in the low normal range. In the meantime I'm returning briefly to a very low dose of prednisone because I thought I felt a bit better on it. She is concerned that my face and ankles are already a bit puffy. As she was talking about adrenal stuff I kept thinking \"I've seen something about this on a previous scan.\" I got home and poured over my old test results and, sure enough, in 2013 when mbc was found two different radiologists mentioned an enlarged and oddly shaped left adrenal gland with a nodule on it. Hmmm...maybe nothing- but I will show it to her. She did say that in the back of her mind she's wondering if the LM is a factor. Think she's trying to eliminate other possibilities before my next MRI. What our bodies go through !  ",

It's on the lining nearly in the fluid. The worst was assumed-that it would be LM. Had rads to that lesion and one month follow up MRI. Lesion reduced a tiny bit. And nothing new seen. From that, my RO believes this is not LM because I would have gotten much worse in the past couple of months. (I'm on Xeloda which is doing a fantastic job on my bone mets). Anyway, RO (who I respect immensely) said LM moves very quickly and there is not much that can be done. But, then I read here and see that some of you are dealing with it for quite a while. All this to say, my MRI results were great but I'm having trouble relaxing and believing it's over. He is doing another MRI in 3 months to keep a close eye on it. Such a confusing part of mbc!

My RO seemed to think I don't have LM or I would have deteriorated much more quickly. He thinks anyone who doesn't die in 3 months doesn't have LM. I respect him immensely, but this seems to be an area he does not know as well. My initial symptoms were a numb right side chin and weird sensation on my cheek and temple. That was in November and they at first thought it was a mini stroke. I was out of state. When I got home I had an MRI that seemed fine. One month later another MRI showed the lesion above my right eyeball in the lining/fluid area. I had rads on that. I had just started Xeloda during this time (failing Faslodex). I took some Dex during rads for swelling (hated it). Rads ended the end of March. Follow up MRI was good. Lesion reduced, nothing else scary floating around. But since the end of March I have been absolutely drained. No energy at all. A few quick stabbing pains in my head. Weird, vibrating sensations in my groin and the feeling that something is wrapped around my left ankle. All weird stuff I don't know how to interpret. I was on low dose prednisone for 2 weeks and I think it helped the fatigue. Stopped it last Thursday and hit the tired wall again Saturday. Today is my regular check in with MO. I'm anticipating she'll put me back on prednisone a while. My husband wants a CURE for the fatigue. He's having trouble accepting that I may feel like this for a while. Hoping for good answers for us!! Thanks! There are so few to talk to about this. ",

My mbc has been complicated because I was first diagnosed as triple positive from the breast biopsies. ( old slides from 2005 and 2012). In 2014 i started out on Taxotere Herceptin and perjetta. When that failed I had a bone biopsy that was HER2 negative and was treated that way until the liver mets appeared early this year. I had a biopsy and after many types of tests on it, came up HER2 positive, but barely. Thing is, I\u2019m really equivocal and we are retrying the Herceptin route, now through Kadcyla. I\u2019ve been through many AI. There isn\u2019t much I haven\u2019t taken. Thank you. I will read and share with my MO. Right now I feel like Kadcyla is a Hail Mary try. The weird thing is, I have very little pain right now. But MO is really worried about how quickly it could all go downhill now. Hanging on! ",

A small lesion was seen over the right eyebrow. I had rads on it. In the meantime the chin became normal again. My RO is not positive the lesion was what causing the numb chin. He said the numb chin was coming from the trigeminal nerve. It\u2019s possible but unlikely that the lesion was somehow interacting with the nerve. I needed the brain rads, no matter what and that lesion has been stable. I might recommend seeing a neurologist. They are really the only specialist that would know what is going on. As far as being triple positive, when was your last biopsy? I was originally triple positive and H&P failed me too. As I\u2019ve mentioned my HER2 is neither strongly positive or negative.

The first four or five days I was often incoherent. The liver was not filtering the brain. Anyway, back home with hospice support. They have been great. Not much pain, bloating mainly and much fatigue and weakness. Somewhat unstable on my feet, but that has improved. Just happy to be home. I\u2019m not sure what the near future holds. Hanging onto friends and family. I gain strength from all of you. ",

But, when it shot up too 100.3 last night I got a little worried. I know the fever can be a good sign. I just don\u2019t want an out of control infection, especially since I\u2019m allergic to many antibiotics. Your comments have made a difference in how I\u2019ve reacted to these fevers. Thanks! I have a message into my nurse so I\u2019m ready if I have to make a call to the on-call doctor after hours.  ",

After going through one urologist who was no help, I stumbled on another who also happened to have a pharmacy degree. He put me on a preventative Med called methenamine hippurate. He said \u201c no promises, and I don't know how long it will work.\" But in the past 2 1/2 years I've had 2 mild infections that healed quickly with an antibiotic. Quite the difference for me. Worth looking into. Btw, I take 1 gym twice a day. Oh, it\u2019s a tier 2 drug, so the copay is pretty high. But, worth it for me.   ",
