Mine do coloring contests and get prizes for most creative, most colorful, etc when I wake up. Then their drawings will hang as my get well art.

I, too had to make a decision and it is very difficult with conflicting information. I had needle core biopsy and the bs and radiologist wanted lumpectomy. Said the needle biopsy would not be enough information because the lump is too large. Now I am having lumpectomy a year and several months later, then after healing and finding out it is not cancer (I hope) as they say it is not, then I have to undergo reconstruction. This is odd with the mixed advice and a tremendous amount to go through with mixed signals. I feel for you. I would say get another opinion but I just feel have the biopsy and piece of mind. I don't understand why I'm going under if it is not cancer. It makes no sense. See my post if you can and offer advice I am lost on this one. The first bs and radiologist wanted it out within 30 to 60 days and now the bs doesn't feel that way anymore and the surgeon who did not see what they saw in the beginning now does and would excise it if it were her body....it's like a big joke and nobody remembers how they felt yesterday regarding such a serious issue....let's just fly by the seat of our pants. Ugh I hope the best for you, this is tough, everyone wants to say stay positive and that is true but let's be real. This stuff is tough when we have to make decisions as mothers that will affect the rest of our/their lives. I've gone through stages where I feel a radiologist is the one to follow as they are trained to look, detect cancer PERIOD THAT IS their job, while a surgeon is trained in that but also much more to it obviously. But I am told at Mayo the surgeon trumps them all. Ugh",

I was a little crazy before leaving to travel for Mayo for the procedure but oddly extremely calm after the lump was removed while waiting for pathology almost felt as though the anesthesia was lingering but also was being covered in prayer and I want to do the same for you all. Please keep me posted if there is anyone I can pray for or offer any help while you or anyone you know goes though this life-changing time. I feel like I've been given a second chance, after having the other conditions I am blessed to have 1 be nothing, and blessed to have you all. I will copy this to my other post but know I truly mean it to each and every one of you. Inbox me if you need. I will have reconstruction anytime after 8 weeks from now. A little nervous because of ourselves that tissue will be tested but nothing like this. I need to start edu acting myself on what the reconstruction recovery will entail and what I will need. But for now, I'm enjoying the BeNIGN news! Xoxo best to you all!!!!",

      "Content": "Jun 2, 2012 04:50PM - edited Jun 2, 2012 04:51PM by Luvflsun I read that too, thanks just didn't know if there was a correlation between it and anything with your duct issues. I see the difference. It's odd because I saw them (my lump and my ductal issue) as two different issues but the nurse seems to think they are intertwined, and the surgeon will be removing part of that duct if need be as it is included in the mass. I don't like the word wartlike (lol) but have read enough to know it is for the look of the cells just as they can be around the areloa but not be warts. Ah lovely conversations on here haha and it is papillomatosis so I guess my risk of cancer is slightly increased because of that. Time will tell. It is coming out June 13th, if I can work things out (TOUGH) and they are placing a radioactive seed in the day before (small procedure) to get everything that lights up and could be cancerous. I so appreciate all of you ladies! A comment is like a breathe of air! Xo",

Now after reading yours although, I know you say the fibroadenoma did not cause the cancer, were the microcalcifications that were all over your breasts calcifications because I read microcalcifications are usually benign, like fibroadenomas? I'm so glad you had it removed as is was cancer but curious as to what made you come to this decision? Did you have biopsy results of cancer from the microcalcifications or was it all hiding within the fibroadenoma infiltrated from ducts and also in the lymph nodes? Thanks for your help, I think this will teach me a lot to be prepared for the what \"IFS\" as my surgery is next Wednesday. Tuesday small radioactive seed implantation procedure. Thanks, this sure helps pass the time when I can't sleep and am trying to get support.",

Very painful lower right for me and although yes, they burst sometimes and are okay scientifically, they also can be bothersome and painful and affect our daily activities. I know my pain in that area sure does. I'm hoping after my lumpectomy my ovaries will stop producing these and things will quiet down a bit. That's hoping we both get benign results!!!! I truly hope that for you and am praying for all of us going through this mess and scare of the is it \"C\"!? Prayers your way. Sorry I don't have more answers regarding your exact situation but wanted to let you know I can relate on a few issues and one thing I felt was alone (with that said, my husband is great but alone as far as what I am feeling) and as one person told me on here, YOU are NOT alone!

I don't have BC but am having lumpectomy with reconstruction to check as I stated in a question on another post in the undiagnosed but worried section. But I have several other illnesses one involving the brain and need help. So I say from experience, I know how you feel but set yourself up to be in a good place, emotionally and physically that day, so you will not have that worry the day of your first chemo along with the worry you can't control. You can control knowing your kids are going to be picked up no matter what this does to you on that first day. My brother-in-law just finished chemo a few months ago for brain cancer (medulloblastoma) and had someone with him at every appt just even if he slept. I wish I was close, I would take you. People want to help. Obviously if we as strangers are willing, your neighbors and friends and people in your community should be more than willing! God bless you sweetheart!",
