      "Content": "Nov 22, 2017 11:27PM - edited Nov 22, 2017 11:30PM by KeriG Hello. I've haven't been on in several years but I've been reading posts over the past week or so. I was lead to a pet scan after having sternal painot on and off for a while with upper right abdominal pain and slightly elevated liver enzymes. Results received yesterday state intense uptake in distal stomach and antrum with maximum SUV of 19.8 my onc says not to worry most likely gastritis. I am scheduled for endoscopy Monday. I did have endoscopy and colonscopy January 2016 with inflammation noted at that time amd have been on on protonix since then. I always have abnormal bowel movements amd have had heartburn for years. Do you believe with 19.8 that this can be gastritis? I have been up all night researching and realize that stomach ca is a rare met to have. Has this happened to anyone before? I just turned 47 have 5 children 16 to 25 and am full of anxiety all while remaining calm as to not alert my children. Sorry to ramble. Off to work now like I'll be able to concentrate.... Thank you in advance to anyone who may provide any support and advice. Keri I'm also BRAC 2 positive.",
