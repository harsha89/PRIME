Xeloda failed at two months and she is now on her second cycle of weekly paclitaxel we find out in a couple of weeks if it is working or not.  At her followup MRI post GammaKnife they found 6-8 new spots that they just took an MRI again of Friday to see how much they have grown.  She is fatigued from the paclitaxel (the Xeloda didnt tire her too badly) and she was wiped out for a weekend after the GammaKnife. The lack of appetite is a concern because my wife went through (and still does) periods of nothing looking or tasting appetizing yet she knows in order to continue the fight she has to eat.  Her onc has told her sa much, eat or it will speed up the process.  Hug your mom a lot let her vent when she needs to vent and just be there for her",
