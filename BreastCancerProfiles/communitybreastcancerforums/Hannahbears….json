My situation was a little different because I had bilateral mastectomies with TE placement but I think that a lot of what I experienced will apply. I was hospitalized for 1 night and was discharged around midday. My daughter was 9 at the time of my surgery. My daughter did come to see me in the hospital. I had thought that it would ease her mind to see that I was ok but I think it actually kind of scared her to see me that way. My husband and I made sure she had lots of activities with friends not at our house so she didn't have to see my so weak and uncomfortable. I didn't have any trouble getting around in our 2 story house. The most difficult thing for me early on was getting up out of bed or out of the chair. I did use a recliner and highly recommend it. Your daughter may have a bit easier of a time since she will have the use of her other arm. My Plastic Surgeon restricted my arm movement--no lifting/pulling/pushing/or stretching. No shower until drains removed(6 days for me). I had to take sponge baths and my husband washed my hair for me. I was on pain pills for about a week and did doze a fair amount. I wasn't supposed to lift anything so things had to be placed low and I only picked up light things, keeping my arms in close to my side and just bending at the elbow. Hope this wasn't too long--I'm sure other people will chime in with their experiences. Good luck and feel free to PM me if you have other questions. ",

I know how you feel because I got a terrible sinus infection the week of my bilateral mastectomy with tissue expander placement. My family doctor put me on antibiotics and although I was not completely well, I was doing better by the day of surgery--still felt crappy. I still had a cough and drainage. My breast surgeon and plastic surgeon said as long as there was no fever, they would proceed. My anesthesiologist was also aware--they are the ones dealing with your airway/breathing. I did NOT want to postpone my surgery--I had already had to wait longer that I wanted and I was ready to get it over with. My plastic surgeon just kept me on the same antibiotic after surgery until I had completed the correct number of doses. I did ok but I would make sure that you take your pain pills because the increased coughing after the surgery would have been extremely painful without the meds. Good luck and I hope you feel better soon. TCK",

Ronna: My PS was more than happy to order a physical therapy consult for me after my BLM with TE placement. It was extremely helpful to me. My PS did not want any range of motion exercises done until drains were out(1 week for me). By that time I could tell how far I had to go to get back to my baseline and I was worried. It was very painful doing the exercises--especially on my BC side. I even remember crying while I was doing them--but I made myself do them and it did get easier. And my PT was terrific and got me right on track. She was a 10 year BC survivor too. I would suggest asking for a referral if you think you need it. TCK",

My Ob-GYN couldn't palpate it the first visit so she had me return about 5 days later for recheck--she felt it without any problem that time. She referred me to a general surgeon for followup the next week. The general surgeon felt it also. I had had a mammogram a couple of months earlier so she just went ahead that first day and did a fine needle aspiration. The results came back noncancerous about a week later but I had a very strong family history so the surgeon recommended an excisional biopsy of the lump. I had that on July 29. The lump turned out to be cancer after all. My general surgeon did not get clear margins and said I needed a mastectomy because my breasts were small and the amount of tissue needing to be removed to insure clear margins was too much. At that point I decided to go to a breast cancer specialist. I ended up have bilateral mastectomies on Sept 24. My BS did do a sentinel lymph node biopsy  Sept 4 to check that out since I was not going to have the mastectomies until the end of the month. Part of the timing was related to coordinating the BS and plastic surgeons schedules to do the reconstruction at the same time. My cancer breast actually did not have any more cancer in it after all when after pathology results came back from the mastectomy. I totally understand your anxiety related to waiting. Have you got you surgery scheduled yet? Sometimes other treatment is required first. Has your surgeon explained what is planned for you? Good luck and hang in there. We are here for you.  TCK ",
