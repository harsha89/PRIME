I was diagnosed w/ BC 3 days after I graduated from nurse practitioner school and did a full rotation with a breast cancer surgeon 2 months before my diagnosis. How ironic that I would become the patient. My surgeon/preceptor highly reccommended it. I prayed as my surgeon was inserting it that if it was not meant to be it would not fit correctly. Well it did. Everyone commented on how well it looked on the CT scans. Still a little sore but not too bad. I did research about the recurrence rates and both traditional rad and mammosite had the same recurrence rates. My radiologist also said I could go either way. So you do the best you can with the knowledge given.",
