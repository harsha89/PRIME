Like everyone seems to say - it's all about waiting and seeing. I see that some people see the breast surgeon first and the onco second, but here, they do it the other way.",

(gp?) referred me to an oncologist and from there I guess I'm supposed to go through some tests - blood, ct scan, or mri, or pet, or bone and then see the breast surgeon. My sister asked her nurse and bc friends and they all said that's the protocol around here. The gp gave me some meds to help calm me down. I will ask the onco (I hate writing that. I will always hate writing that) when I see him/her on Tuesday what the plan is. Still waiting for someone to wake me up. Thank you for your replies.",
