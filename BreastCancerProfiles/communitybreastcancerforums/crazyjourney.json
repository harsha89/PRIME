    "Content": "crazyjourney wrote: Hi :-) Head is still spinning a bit, and I'm sure this isn't an uncommon story. Have gone from first age related mammogram a few months ago (expecting nothing wrong), through three lumpectomies, an ax clearance, and as the margins were never clear, a mastectomy a couple of days ago. Still, onwards and upwards! My question is this - the lovely nurses gave us an Amoena standard priform and some extra wadding to start with, and it's good, but we are wondering if it's possible to get it to better match the remaining boob a little better or is it limited by design and weight of fill? I'm a 42dd (ish, depending on bra) and we can't get the matching 'teardrop' type shape from the priform. We've had a search around the forum (and it's a really great place with some wonderful stories and help!) but haven't found anything quite right yet. It's not a huge issue, and it's early days yet - this is more something to occupy our minds for a while. Take care all x Log in to post a reply",
