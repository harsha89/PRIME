(forgive my bad english).  Bone and joint pain.  Every time I move my bones just pop.  I was up until 4:30 this morning with pain and couldn't sleep.  Popping percocetes and aleve.  My stomach is a garbage can for drugs.  My abdominals feels like a pin cushion.  I hate taking pills but I have to to get through this pain.  I am a very quiet person and keep my feelings to myself most of the time but if I let loose and tell you how this crap really makes me feel.  Let's say I might just loose my religion.  So honey when you feel you gotta go there let it rip.  Then relaxe...relate...release...  And know that this is only for a season. Take care all Sabrina P.S.  Anyone have any special plans for Valentines Day?",

Well sister all I want to say is that keep your faith and lean not onto your own understanding but stand by the word.  You not being upset is just the peace of God on you.  And know that you have another person standing in agreement with you that you are blessed and not cursed.  By the way milk that husband for what it is worth.  Let him spoil you rotten. I think my husband has cried more tears than I could ever cry. We have been together since we were 14yrs old.  First to see my boobs and last to see it go.  I have two children 12 and 15 that truely adores me.  So I know I have and will win this fight.  Please know that you have a friend in me if ever you need to talk and pray.  I am here for you May God bless you and keep you love your sister, sabrina",

Barb have you joined any support groups in your area yet?  Or do you feel the need to?  I haven't but I want to.  I recently signed up for the Relay for Life fight against Bc here in my town that going on in May.  I am really looking forward to it.  I have been in the past as a spectator and it is truely an emotional event.  But this time I will be participating in it as a survivor.  MY MY MY how life takes you for a loop.  Who'd a thought me a cancer survivor.  Yes I am naming it and claiming it.  Well you all have a blessed day Sabrina",

Barb, before your next treatment won't you be giving blood test to see if your white blood count is up for you to be able to chemo.  I always have blood work done the day before chemo.  Or an hour before.  They have always come back ok.  I don't think they would give you chemo with you being sick still.  And most of the information I have posted at the bottom of my post is information from my pathology report.  Take it in and have him highlight the answers to the questions you have.  Tell him to explain it to you like you are a two year old.  I think on this site there is a place on here that helps you read your pathology report. Well I am having a sweet tooth and it is cold and rainy, snowy, and icy outdoors and there is nothing in my cabinets quick to fix.  So I am going to surf the net for a recipe to come up with something.  So far I found a loaf of french bread in my freezer.  Anybody have a good recipe for bread pudding?

Question?  You are already taking Tamoxifen?  I don't start taking that until after chemo.  For five years.  Isn't that for your hormones? Like I said everyones tx is so different. Well I am glad you guys are having nice weather.  Here we are still under snow.  However the sun is shining outside.  But don't let it fool ya.  We had cold and rain yesterday so everything is iced up.  I slept under two blankets last night.  Until the hot flashes started to hit again.  Those things are the pits.

Take out and get rid of anything that is not of use.  My gyn thought I was too young to get them out a few years back when he took my uterus.  Ticked me off.  Either meds for hormone's with ovaries or med's for hormones with out ovaries.  Polycystic ovaries suck.  but anyway's Glad you are doing just fine... So you are already planning your get away.  Please take me with you.  Right now I am so financially challenged that a vacation is so out of the question.  Even a shirt or pants at this point.  But that is ok.  I have never been the type to do something special for myself it's all about everybody else.  Especially my babies.  They always come first.  But I know as I bless others my blessing will soon follow. I have been following Oprah's book club selection and on live web event with Eckhart Tolle's \"A New Earth-Awakening to Your Life's Purpose.  I am really getting alot out of it.  This time around I really want to try to do things right.  I know that God has a purpose for me but still trying to find out what it is.  Especially since I am knocking down 40's door. Well for now I'm gonna keep on keepin on. Be blessed, your friend and sister Sabrina.",

One down and one to go.  I am nervous because I don't know whats next.  He did tell me he is going to be taking my port out sooner than I thought he would.  So I suppose he feels that I am ok.  I have to go back every three months for a while for pt scans and mammo's. And blood work.  And start my Tamoxifen for 5 years.  I put my life on hold for 5 months for not knowing what to expect or what to do during tx.  Now it's time to pick back up.  Finding a new job, making better decisions for my life mentally, physically and financially.  As I look back over my life I got a lot of do overs.  I am glad Gods has seen to it that I have another chance to get it right this time.  So please continue to pray for me.  I will still be here writing you guys everyday and looking for some good advice and council.  And to be here for you guys.  I love the friendships I have made on this site.  You guys are my queens.... Take care and have a blessed day Love you all Sabrina",

Am I gonna make it through the night? What's going to happen, do you even know? Do I have to stay here, when do I go home? Well their goes my hair falling to the floor Is this my body waging a war? Will it grow back or will it stay away? And how do I tell my son \u2018mommy can't play' Where did the time go, is it really that bad Everyone stares at me with faces so sad Maybe they know something that I don't Sometimes I don't want to answer the phone I want to run away, far from this place I avoid the mirror, who wants to see this face? Days go by where I just stay in bed Other days I wonder what lies ahead Feeling so alone, but surrounded by all Why did God give me this, I feel so small But then one day I see my son's face And remember I'm here by God's loving grace So I run for life, for yours and mine And I won't give up, not this time This is it, it's do or die I'm looking fear right in the eye I'm going to run till my race is through And through it all, know that I love you...\" This was a poem I read off another thread I thought it was awesome.  Just wanted to share it with you guys. sabrina",

Barb I hope you are taking it easy.  No superwoman antics.  Did you have to take the neulasta shot?  That crap hurts like heck going in so try not to squezze Eugene too hard. Hugs Sabrina",

I do have to see a physical therapist for my arm It is sore and my had is swelling.  Have to get a sleeve for it. As far as journaling I can't bring myself to do it.  I have tried but my mind be so mixed up I can't seem to write stuff down.  I still feel sort of numb through all of this.  Like I am looking from the outside in.  (This is not happening to me).  Or could be chemo brain I am not involved into any cancer groups and I want to so bad.  But no transportation in the evening to get to any.  I signed up for a Reach to Recovery person through the cancer society.  She called me one time.  I called her back to let her know that I was beginning chemo left the message and she has never returned my calls.  I am at the time working on signing up for Relay for Life.  Check out the web site.  I have also sent off for Kormens 3 day walk for the cure in Chicago.  So I am sort of on my own here except for family and friends here that hadn't been affected by this until me.  But they are a blessing.  Here fighting with me all the way.  Praying and standing in the gap. And even though you guys are not here physically I know that you all are with me too.  God Bless you all Sabrina",

Now the antibiotics I don't know about that either but I do know that my dr didn't want to give me any.  I have been fighting this sinus and chest congestion for a while now and he doesn't want to give me any antibotics for it.  Never said why though just that he doesn't want it to interfere with my chemo treatments.  Yeah religion is a hard thing to mention on this board because alot of people are not where you are at when it comes to God, Jesus or whomever there higher power is.  Or if they even have one.  I know that calling on my heavenly father through all things works best for me and I just try my best to share it with others and they can take it or leave it.  Love and hugs to ya all Sabrina",
