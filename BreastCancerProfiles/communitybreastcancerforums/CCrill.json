I also sometimes feel like that left nipple is \"wet\", but don't see any discharge on my bra or shirt, crazy, I know.  I go tomorrow for the tests.  I hate the mammograms because I am very large chested and it is very uncomfortable for me.  The density seems to get worse each mammogram.

I definitely am glad technology has improved.  How was your tumor diagnosed?  I am waiting on the ok from the doctor to proceed with the MRI.  To all the ladies who have replied, what are your thoughts on having benign cysts, fibroids, etc removed?  I have a benign lymph node growing into the side of that breast, but nobody has ever told me that it needs to be removed.  As I said before, my mother in law had very dense breasts and her tumor was hiding behind all of that. ",
