On May 20th I called my surgeon's office and was told the results on both areas were negative and that she would have the doctor read the results to advise me when I would need to do my follow up.  I was called this morning from my surgeon's office and was told an MRI is needed since the biopsy results were inconsistant with the ultrasound results.  I am completely scared.  I am also now wondering if they will need to do another biopsy.
