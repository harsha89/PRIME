It has keep me stable and doing well. I wanted to quickly share what my research has led to additional improvements. I have been taking 1tsp of Dried Ginger /day after reading research showing The active ingredient in \"Dried\" ginger kills 10,000 time more cancer stem cells than chemotherapy alone. Since adding Dried ginger to my daily diet as tea or Capsules my tumor makers went down much more than on Ibrance and Letrosole alone, and have stayed down. This is the title of one of the articles I read (or skip to the Summery if too complicated) Found articles in Google Scholar.like : 6\u2010Shogaol, an active constituent of ginger, inhibits breast cancer cell invasion by reducing matrix metalloproteinase\u20109 expression via blockade of nuclear factor\u2010ÎºB activation. I also take Curcumin (Anti inflamitory) which with the medications has decreased my pain from 10/10 in my hip to 0/10 within one month after diagnosis. A good resource i recently discovered is a DR who operates a non profit dealing nutrition for healing and fighting diseases. His site is called NutritionFacts.org. Also you should look into IP6 (inositol hexaphosphate) To reduce chemotherapy side effects (small study), it suppose to improve quality of life. Please do your own research but I thought of sharing what took us about 2 years to find out these resources. Hope this helps Pat",
