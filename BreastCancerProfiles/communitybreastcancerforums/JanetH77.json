I am 28 weeks post-chemo and still have not uncovered my head in public, though I go topless at home.  I didn't get the white fuzz until about six weeks post-chemo.  Hair in the crown is only about 1/2 inch and some scalp still shows there, but the hair in the back is probably at least 1.5 inches long.  I have noticed my hair getting thicker in the last couple of weeks.  It's straight and is the same salt and pepper color I had before. It's a test of patience, isn't it?  A bit of an adventure, too!",

Now that I have some hair peeking out around a hat, I am not using the wig much.  Try putting a knit cap on over that hair and look in the mirror, you'll enjoy seeing that frame of dark hair.  I'm having fun with hats, but expect it to be quite awhile before I will go topless outside my home. I'm using biotin, but not the nioxin. I lost my eyelashes shortly after I completed chemo (9/29), and I am just now seeing a tiny bit of new growth.  Hang in there . . .",

Hope this helps.",
