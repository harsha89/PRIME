Please help me, if it's not the right place. I live in central europe (as you see my english;) ), we don't have any oncotype yet. I wonder what would be the decision, if we had this test. If it help the treatment decision, I would go and by it myself, if it's possible. I'm 35. IDC, 1 cm, ER/PR +, HER2 + (but no amplification - onc said it means it is not positive-not treated as pos, but I don't understandit exatcly). I had lumpectomy on 27/1/11 - clean margins. Micrometastasis was found in the sentinel lymphnode (intraoperative was it ok). Now I'm waiting for axillary block dissection, then I'll have chemo, rad and hormontherapy. If I lived not here what would happen to me? Oncotype is made only with totally negative lymphnode, or with micrometastasis as well? A friend of mine, who deals with chemo drugs said, that maybe it would be useful to do the test in my case as well.  I try to think about only the mortality (cancer and chemo SE), and if the chemo gives me 1% more chance to live longer without cancer, I think I must choose chemo. thanks your help in advance.",
