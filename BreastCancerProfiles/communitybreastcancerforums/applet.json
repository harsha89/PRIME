I forgot to say that I'm neither pregnant nor breastfeeding, so this makes me all the more worried.  I'm definitely getting checked out the day after tomorrow, only I'm in Moscow, Russia so there's a bit of a language barrier, and I'm already so nervous! I actually feel almost the same kind of texture/lump on the other breast, so that lulled me into a false sense of security, I think.  ",

The reason being, that I am getting increasingly worried over these enlarged veins in one of my breasts. I've noticed them getting enlarged a few weeks ago, and this is also in the breast that is larger than my other breast. When I do the breast exam, there is this lump or tissue that I can't quite figure out.     So, my question is, how does a normal breast feel like on breast exams? I know this is really general, but if this is a lump that I feel, then it's been there since I started doing self exams , so I'm really worried. Any help/advice would be very much appreciated!  Log in to post a reply",

I just don't know what's normal and not anymore, with my breasts feeling so odd.  Well, I'm in Russia for university, so I'll be here awhile. Although, if it is anything I will definitely go back home; I'm actually from Malaysia... Fingers crossed that it's nothing! Been having nightmares about it. Thank you all for the support! ",
