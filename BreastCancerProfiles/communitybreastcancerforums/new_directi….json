I know the fear, I'm still afraid to speak of my treatment as something in the past, I'm somehow afraid to mis-judge my situation. My tumor was in a 6x7 cm area of microcalcifications and maybe smaller tumors besides the 4 cm tumor I had. I also did neoadjuvant chemo, had small children and suspect it all began when pregnant with my oldest. I had 4 positive lymph nodes (that we know of). what has helped me the most is tunnelling my energy to what gives me hope. For me that is researching and \"experimenting\" with alternative anticancer strategies, things that are in my own power.",

The only real answer to my concern would be the pathology report after surgery (which I'm having this Friday). My situation was opposite - I thought there was a change in the beginning but is was only after the 3rd/4th round onc seemed to be certain it had gone.  What about now - do you feel any channge yourself? I figure when 2 seperate persons agree it has shrunk it must have. I also had positive nodes and they didn't do a new pathology report or anything - just assume it's the same cell type as the original tumor. That being said you should stick to your own gut feeling. Is it panic or a true concern which leads you to wanting more \"proof\" with imaging? ",

The studies Ive come across all deals with positive AXILLARY nodes - where even one no matter tumor size would mean radiation (if larger than 2 mm). Your situation seems unusual, but I wonder if your positive node even though its at a different location wouldnt still mean YES go for it. Age under 40 does not in itself give an answer to that question but may point in that same direction. If I were you Id try to find out if the doctors agree this is equal to a positive axillary lymph node. If yes, then I think I would go for rads. No matter what do what feels right.",

This is about skin reactions to radiation http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/radiation/skin/reactions - the skin damage will get worse for a while but it's not permanent. maybe it will help to clarify things if you look at the section \"Radiotherapy after mastectomy for primary operable breast cancer\" in this article http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3217212/#BMJ_0102_I13 It doesnt sound like tumorsize was very big but they might put emphasis on the (one?) positive lymph node of yours and receptor status. That being said you still have a choice to say no. I thought very hard about that myself... Personally I don't think I would avoid treatment because of skin reactions however there might be other things that make you reconsider.",

Have anyone heard of this or does anyone have some more information about higher doses of Tamoxifen? I think it's very interesting.

I was actually pushing for treatment to begin as fast as possible but we had to wait for scan results before beginning. I felt sure about following the suggested treatment plan from the beginning but I understand how things may take some time if you're not completely determined on what to do. What's most important is finding a solution you feel ok with - for me it was just the fastest solution. I actually felt most comfortable with just doing what the doctors recommended because I wasn't able at the time to think rationally at all. It's hard to tell if a few months matters. In some cases it may. I believe there are stray cells in most cases and maybe it all comes down to how well you respond to the systemic treatments no matter when you begin. Good luck with everything.",
