When I had my first dx I felt like I couldn't tell people how I really felt, because they wanted good news. Everything I said had to end on a positive note. I began to HATE the question \"How are you?\" Everyone asks, even when they really don't care or listen to the answer. Even the nurses in the infusion room asked, and if I told them about any problems I had, they just said, \"Oh, you'll have to bring that up to the doctor\" so they didn't want to know either. Now that I'm starting chemo for mets, I'm getting just as ticked off as I was the first time. I know it is a courtesy, blah blah blah. But I also know that nobody wants to hear how I really feel, unless it they want to feed off it.",

He told me what happened and said \"but you're not terminal, right?\" I responded that we are all terminal at some point, but no, I likely have a good chunk of time ahead of me before I'm terminal.  He was so not ready to think about me that way! He knows that it will come, but to have someone actually refer to me as \"terminal\" really upset him. Even my onco referred to my mets as a chronic condition and never even hinted that I had  \"use by\" date. Which means I don't qualify to have my loans forgiven.

It tipped at an odd angle and it would take very experienced phlebotomists and nurses four or five tries to get the needle in the port and even when they did, there was no guarentee that it would work. Every trip to the cancer center was an exercise in torture as 3/4\" and 1\" needles were repeatedly poked into my flesh and when they missed the port, they would push on the needle and shift it around, trying to find the port. I went back to interventional radiology and the doctor had the nerve to tell me my port was fine. So I went back to the cancer center and told the nurse what the Dr. told me and we figured out a way to do it in one try, but whether or not she could get blood out of it was another question. Of course when I went for blood transfusions or into the hospital, I was stuck multiple times, as usual. One nurse even cried because she knew she was hurting me. So, after 10 months as a chemo voodoo doll, it is finally gone. The surgeon who took it out was the same one who told me it was okay so many months ago. He continued to insist that the port was fine when I was in the procedure room. I told him he was wrong and to take the damn thing out NOW. When the surgi-strips finally came off, I was left with two lovely scars, the insertion one and one below it where he removed it.  So, I've decided, enough with the chest and I'm having the replacement port put in my left arm, just above the crook of my elbow.

My next labs are on Friday the 13th, but when I was a kid it was always a lucky day for me. Be well, Sido",

I would recommend talking to others who have done the ones near you because I've heard that they are usually womderful.  I didn't think 42 was so terribly young to have cancer (though I'm very immature for my age), but I felt like I was in a room full of of disapproving maiden aunts. Re: Reconstruction:  If I don't have a bi-lateral mast based on my BRCA status (which I'm supposed to hear about any day), I'm going to have the PS \"balance me out\" from the lumpectomy ftaer radiation.  Instead of filling in the gap, I want him to make the lump side even the other side reduced to match.  I've been a D or DD my entire adult life so being smaller would be amazing for me. Has anyone else here gone smaller rather than bigger? Be well, Sido",

On the other hand, I really liked Cris Karr's Crazy, Sexy, Cancer Tips, which gives a heavy dose of vegan raw diets, but also focuses on living and fighting.  While I don't plan to become vegan, her spirit and those of her fellow \"cancer cowgirls\" have given me a lot of encouragement.  Looking back (or there now), which books do you wish you had avoided at the beginning?  Which helped you prepare for your fight?
