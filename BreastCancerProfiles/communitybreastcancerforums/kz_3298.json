Yes, LVI is for sure a big concern, along with grade 3. As a result, our doctor did not even consider ordering Oncotype test, and suggested chemo + hormonal therapy. Rads was not recommended due to mastectomy and negative nodes. The regimen suggested was FEC x 3 - D x 3. I don't see it is offered widely in US, while it is quite common in countries like Canada, UK, etc. I hope it is not under or over treatment for my mom. Thanks again.  ",

I am wondering if the drugs used in chemo by doctors there match what we have in the states, or other developed countries. If you have / had chemotherapy, can you please kindly let me know the details of drugs such as name, manufacturers, etc? For example, if you have AC-T, can you please list the detail for me? Thanks a lot!! P.S.: It has been the darkest a few weeks in my life since my mom was diagnosed, and we were scared. By reading through lots of posts on this forum, I am ready to stand with my mom to fight. I also wish everyone on this forum live a happy and long life. Log in to post a reply",
