Getting over my opp very well and back to driving the car. Start my chemo next Thursday 16th so sent my DH away to our caravan for 6 days ( he is a mad fly fisherman(trout)) as it looks like its going to be a bumper season and he will no doubt miss most of it. It's a 5 hour drive away and I didn't feel up to it.   I have an Education Session at the hospital on Monday, I'll find out then what sort of cocktail I'll be getting. ",

Because of low WBC at day 10 test, also got a Neulasta injection to take home.  The community nurse is coming day after tomorrow to give it. Does anyone not get bone pain from this injection?",

My brother in law and his wife are doing Christmas this year so all DH and I have to do is turn up and be waited on. Lovely!! I shaved my head about 2 weeks ago and now have sandpaper head. Not all that pleasant to touch but no trouble with pillows etc. What is good, is that any scarf or hat sticks like glue. Force ten gale couldn't move them. Wishing you all a gentle weekend, with no headaches or tummy aches.",

I was in the cannot category and she said it was too dangerous to continue. So I am now on 12 x weekly taxol. I have had 3 tx so far and a Picc line inserted. I waited this long to report, just in case I jinxed myself. But whoo hoo!! minimal side effects on taxol. What a relief, I can operate almost as normal and taste food. Still need lots of rests, but what the heck, thats doable. So many Sisters on this journey, so many different cocktails and side effects.  My DH didn't believe me when I told him about the problems of having no pubic hair, until all of the correspondence on the subject. Mother always taught us to assume \"The Stance\" in public toilets, but it's no longer possible.  Realised this after a couple of experiences of wetting the seat, the floor, my undies and the back of my slacks.

Got sent to hospital for a week of extensive tests. Did not even have a chance to go home to pack.  Apparently it is usual to effect the right and left hand side the same, mine has effected the left leg much more. I have a dropped foot and pain in the leg. Not walking at all well. She was checking for cancer mets and stroke. Luckily all tests of brain, bones, and blood have come back with negative results. So now I am waiting for an appointment with a neurologist. Have had 22 rads so far and going quite well, just a small red itchey area. 3 more to go and 5 boosts. I did not miss any as they wheeled me down in a wheelchair from the cancer ward to the radiation dept.",

Finally got rid of the walking stick. Still walking with a limp but there is slow improvement. Hair coming in slowly but it's no colour I've ever had before. But any hair is appreciated, whatever colour. Have been taking the Arimidex for three months now and so far the only side effect is hot flushes, mostly at night. Glad to see that most of you are now feeling much happier, but my heart goes out to those that are still waiting for good news. I send you positive thoughts. KEEP STRONG!! ",

I had a scare a few weeks ago but a biopsy found only fibrosis & microcalcification. I'm 72 now and feel 82. I have bad feet and can't walk too far. Also my hair just did not come back after chemo. Enough winging, I am cancer free, I have found a nice hair piece to wear and I have the loveliest little great grand daughter and my Mum is still alive at nearly 94. Also a great husband, married 54 years now, who I am currently nursing through MAN FLU. Never mind, he has done his share of nursing these past years. It's good to see so many doing well and my positive thoughts go to those who are not. Regards Kay",

The poor girl only asked me if I had false teeth or glasses, nothing to do with chemo. The Chemo nurse gave me the big rundown on SEs and gave me a tour of the chemo ward. I was glad it was late and no one was there. I handled that ok, just goes to show you don't know what will set you off.  Thinking of you all -- THURSDAY is 1st \"Chemo\" day",

You know perfume free moisturiser, eye drops, mouth wash, & bum wipes. Just trying my best to prepare myself.",
