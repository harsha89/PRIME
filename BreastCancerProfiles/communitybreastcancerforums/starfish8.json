    "Content": "starfish8 wrote: Hello, I have had a lump in left breast for about 2 months. Feels much different then other lumps In my breasts. I knew I should have gotten it checked sooner. I'm 39, my mom has a history of BC x3 Fast forward to last Friday, made an appt to see GP. She felt the lump and said it could be a cyst but she is very concerned about the hardness and how it doesn't move. The Doctor ordered a diagnostic mammo and US. I called the breast clinic and have an appt for next Monday. I'm very nervous. I wasn't expecting her comment. I almost wish she would have said \"yes a lump, but don't worry, sure it's nothing\" Just needed to vent. Will post outcome next week. Thanks for listening. Log in to post a reply",
