It felt firm but like hard rubbery firm, not rock or metal firm and had a smooth texture and oval shape, like a small flat worry stone. I saw my obgyn and got my first mammogram and breast ultrasound ever. They said it was a simple cyst but he referred me to a surgical oncologist anyway to get her opinion. Well she had a months long waiting list so they offered me an appointment with another Dr in the same office who had plenty of appointments available. That should have been a red flag right there. Anyway, I chose to get in faster and see the other Dr. It did not go well. He acted like I was wasting his time because didn't walk in the door with a breast cancer diagnosis. There is much more to that story but fast forward to March 2016. Went back for my screening mammogram. I got a call from the obgyn a few days later saying that I have dense breasts and they recommended an ultrasound. I was really busy with work and family so I didn't schedule it right away. As the weeks went by, the cyst started to get bigger and feel lumpier and more irregular with a bigger lumpy part on one end. I started to feel pulling sensations, internal itching, burning, wasp sting like shooting pain, the skin over the cyst hurt like a bad sunburn. The lump was now easily visible especially if I was flat on my back. Instead of hiding behind the nipple it now looked like someone slipped half of a hard boiled egg right under my skin. Constant discomfort. Two days before my US I was about to get in the shower and noticed a little crease about a centimeter above the nipple. On my way into the shower I raised up my arm to get a side view and noticed some red discoloration I had not seen before. Just on that side. I felt it. It's a bit less smooth than the rest of the skin, like it's dryer. The US went ok. I never got to see the Dr, but the tech popped her head back in the room and cheerfully said \"you're fine, see you in a year!\" on my way out, I filled out a form to request a copy of all of my imaging for my records. When I picked them up I was surprised to see I had gone from birads 2 to birads3 and on thetreport the Dr recommended follow up at six months. It went from being a simple cyst to a bigger \"lobulated cyst with mixed echogenicity and internal echoes\" with scattered benign calcification. I'm so sorry this is so long but ***I want to know if anyone has had a similar experience.*** What is more likely, that the timing of the cyst changes and the discoloration is purely coincidental or that it's related? I have an appointment with my Dr Tuesday evening but I could really use some feedback. Thank you! Log in to post a reply",
