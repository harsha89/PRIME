It wasn't yet written when my husband was my support person. Probalby it is available for under $1 on amazon by now. Good luck. Your description of the ups n downs does remind me of the roller coaster. You may have felt you were on the descent with new and not \"favorable\" info each time and may fear the descent will continue. As in roller coasters, it stops and then there is the climb/slog upward through chemo, ideally with fewer surprises and new news during that.",

My slides were seen 3x before that- each institution's oncologist wanted her own pathologist to review. Not just a report from another place. In terms of surgeon, I naively perhaps thought all would suggest and perform the same procedure. I wanted it out, out out and went with the first one someone got me. It was August and a lot were on vacation. I think I tried for another and while, medically, one can wait a couple weeks, emotionally, I couldn't.",
