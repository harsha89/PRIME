I was given the choice of Faslodex to replace the Femara, chemo in pill form or carboplatin and gemzar. My onc told me that the liver didn't usually respond to hormone therapy. After spending 4 months doing hormone therapy with no response at all I wouldn't take that chance. He said they normally saw a better response with the carbo and gemzar, but the pills would have lesser side effects. It was my choice which I wanted to go with. I chose to do the carbo and gemzar and am hoping that it'll take care of the lesions on my liver. I start this Friday with one, next Friday with the other and one week off. Sometime before tomorrow and next Friday I'll have a port put in. If anyone has done this regimen already I'd appreciate any informaition on what your experience was with them. Thanks and God Bless",

The CT in December identified some suspicious spots on my liver. I had another CT done last week but haven't gotten my results yet. From what I've read about high alk phos levels it could be a problem with the liver or rapid bone growith. I'm hoping in my case that since the Zometa is supposed to strengthen the bone that this is the cause. I guess I won't know until I get my CT results. ",
