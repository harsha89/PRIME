      "Content": "jjAriz wrote: My biopsy is scheduled for Friday, but the radiologist didn't seem optimistic. I'm mostly wondering about how disabled I will be following surgery? 1 day?3 days?5 days?10 days? You see, my husband has late-stage 6 Alzheimer's and Lewy Body Dementia. In addition, my 96-year-old Father lives with us. I think Dad will be OK without much help, but my Husband is totally dependent on me for his ADL's. I can put him in respite care while I'm in the hospital, but I need to get him home quickly to minimize the psychosis that occurs with LBD. He relies on me for eating, toileting, dressing, showering, positioning assistance, etc. How will I probably feel? Able to get out of bed? Taking lots of pain medication? How much sleep needed? How much bed rest needed? Food prep (salads & microwaving)? Lifting restrictions? Movement restrictions? Laundry? Driving? Etc., etc., etc. Any insight that you can provide will help me begin to consider alternatives and plan for what may (or may not) occur. Thank you. Jamie Log in to post a reply",

It's not unusual for the breast center to assign a navigator and send out a personalized packet to every patient. If you want more information NOW, ask your doctor what the BIRAD score is on the Radiology report for the mammograms that you already had. That will give you a probability of what you are dealing with. Look up BIRAD on this site for good information. Blessings, Jamie",
