Good luck; I'm hoping it goes fast and smooth for you! I start AC on Tuesday, port installation tomorrow, and am also nervous about both but have been compartmentalizing it into \"just what we have to do\" as well. Are you thinking like me in that every last meal could be the last time things taste 'normal?' (and others starting this month, please chime in!) -Linda",

I hear taste doesn't go right away if it does, but stuff can taste different right after starting too. I'm so glad it went ok for you! Here's to hoping for minimal SE's. Port surgery went fine, though we didn't leave the hospital until about 8pm, and chemo is at 8:30am (possibly why I keep waking up). Awesome spouse is babying me, hoping everyone has a sheepdog(or what's best for their style; he's worried and knows this isn't something we can much control) helping out during this whole ordeal. Cheryl, hello too, yeah timing seems to be rough right now around the holidays, parties, family gatherings. I hope your port goes well too. I was nervous about sedation since my mother's heart had issues when she was under general years ago, but it went fine (and of course I did mention this to the anesthetist). Care has improved so much over the 30 years since then though, shouldn't have even worried. Sounds good to have a little time between port and chemo. Maybe they can move your second dose up just a day so you can keep travel plans? My onc mentioned this possibility. I guess I need to update my sig details too, I'm getting chemo neoadjuvantly, no surgery yet till it shrinks and they can hopefully take fewer lymph nodes at that time, April/Mayish, I think, since it's in two lymph nodes but nowhere else on PET (yay for the good news we can get sometimes). Good luck to everyone. We can do this and be on the other side of treatment someday soon. <3 -Linda",

I had read your posts before and will try it for round 2. Sounds really helpful. First infusion for me was ~12hrs after we left hospital for port surgery, so didn't want to fast after that, esp. with medication for it. The nurse hadn't heard about fasting, or ice chips to protect mouth lining, so I'm glad you guys can guide us better from the patient side of things. Thanks. :) Anxiouslady, we're all in this marathon together, and there's a definite end to it where things will be better again. It's not going to be easy, but seems like every hard life experience makes us appreciate the good times better. Mariett, I was advised to get all dental work done before chemo so there's no increased chance for bacterial infections in the mouth. Bleeding gums and lining issues are common with these chemo drugs, I hear. Good luck. BC2chick71, sorry to hear about recurrence, that sucks. Did your docs watch it closely since the first case and catch this one early? Esperanza, I feel you. The doctors and nurses do seem to minimize the impending side effects, unsure if that's a placebo-effect attempt. I'm using an app to track my symptoms, as I think my memory won't be great about the first few days if they ask 2 weeks later. They didn't think I'd need nausea pills for 3 days but I started burping and feeling sick on the second half of the long drive home, at which point I tried transferring the prescription from my mail-order default pharmacy to a local CVS. They stated 1hr till ready but took 2.5. Lucky for them I didn't use the ziplock gallon bag I brought with me to pick them up. Nanette7fl, good luck to you today too. Don't know yet about Taxol, but AC was fine going in but feeling like poison afterwards in the day and night. Tired today. I hope you get good rest. ðŸ’œ Tip: Apparently if you try to fill a narcotic prescription for port surgery or similar (Norco, 5mg), CVS won't fill it prior to contacting the Dr. if you're filling it >40miles from the doctor. Since we're about 80 miles away from the cancer center, we learned the hard way after 6pm. Good morning (timezones permitting) to everyone, and onward towards treatments and recovery... ðŸ’—",
