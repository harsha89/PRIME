I went to the doctor today and she said she felt more than 1 lump and ordered a mammogram. I'm 35 and was told by the radiology scheduler that that's not common for them to order a mammogram in someone my age. She said they usually order an ultrasound first. She also said they will rush it and read the results immediately, do an ultrasound and do a biopsy if necessary. Should I be worried about this? Log in to post a reply",

I go on Tuesday so they should do the mammogram, place the markers, do an ultrasound and biopsy right then.",

      "Content": "Jenweaver wrote: I have been having changes in the skin on my nipple. It thickens and looks shrivelled up. I have a mild but persistent pain in my breast, a brownish discharge, pain in my collarbone and discoloration in my armpit all on my left side. I went to the doctor and she found several nodules. She ordered a mammogram, markers to be placed to track the size of the lumps, an ultrasound and a biopsy. When I got to radiology they would only schedule an ultrasound due to my age. I'm 35. They did the ultrasound but she only looked at my nipple. Everything was fine so they wouldn't even look anywhere else or do the mammogram or biopsy. My drs office said they should have done all the tests that were ordered and they should be calling me back soon. My question is with my symptoms should I be worried? The one lump that I can feel is pretty big and does not move. Has anyone had any issues with radiology not wanting to do a mammogram on someone my age? They say they never do them on anyone under 40 unless they see something on ultrasound. Since she was looking in the wrong place she didn't see it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm frustrated and scared and I just want to know what this is. Log in to post a reply",
