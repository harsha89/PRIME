Had hysterectomy 2 years ago and didn't know they were suppossed to help out with hotflashes. hadn't worked for me. oh well. That is a SE I can handle. my Onc said i would have about 5 weeks of radiation about 3 weeks after final TC treatment, Oct. 27. So, I should start Rads week of Nov. 17. The end is near. Yippee!!!!",

Will pick it up tomorrow for my shot. I'm doing just fine. Tomorrow evening willl start the fatigue. I had a lot of questions for the doctor. Like: Why is the radiation 3 weeks after chemo? because the chemo interferes with the radiation. Why hormone treatment? Because ER/PR + and HER-. THe adrenal glands create estrogen and the meds will counteract that. What is the hormonal therapy i will be taking? First he said Tamoxifen, but I said isn't it for women with ovaries, and he said yes. So I will be taking something starting with an \"a\", I think it is called arimadex. What are the side effects? hot flashes & bone loss. I will have to take a bone density test to get a baseline. What I can do to counteract these S/Es? Exercise and take 1500 mg of calcium. Eating a balanced diet will help as well. OK to eat soy sauce. Yeah, because I love all types of asian food. I showed him my nails and asked will they fall off. He said no. They will be fine. Finally asked what stage I truly was and if I had clean margins? Also, if/when I am in remission. He said I am a Stage 2 with clean margins. Also, remission started with the lump removal. Glad to get the confirmation re: the stage and the info re: margins and remission. I will make an appointment with the radiology oncologist tomorrow for next week. Then I will find out when and how long I will have for Rads treatment. The way I see it I am half way done. Down with the surgery and chemo and on to radiation and hormone treatments. I really appreciate everyone on this board and I hope everyone is having minimal SE's today. Take care Melissa ",

I hate needles so that tatooing was not a pleasant experience. The RAD staff seem confident but not an overly friendly bunch. And, they are not really flexible on the timing of appointments. The hours are 7:30am - 4pm. Had to change my work schedule to accommodate their schedule. Not fair. This too shall pass. Will keep you posted on how the dry run goes. Talk to you later. Missey 29",

I heard about it from this discussion board. Really was nice to get the free SWAG. All name brand stuff. Also, really appreciated meeting other women going thru this. Truth that there is strength in numbers. My next chemo is this Thursday (TC#3 out of 4). I will be almost done and move on to the next thing. Hope everyone has a SE free day. Talk to you soon.

I try not to dwell on the negative. Trust me I have my bad/sad moments. But it could always be worse. My dad went thru leukemia treatments for 4years and passed away from it on 1/29/03. That was my only experience with the Big C. So, when I was diagnosed on 6/14/11 that was my only point of reference. My DH, faith in God and my 11 yr old daughter help me to focus on beating this. Also, knowing that I am not alone helps. Let's be strong together. Keep your head up everyone. Talk to you soon! Missey29",

Can't wait to start the radiation treatment. I will definitely look to your information about that. So please keep us posted. Had a question: Do you guys consider yourselves sick? Had a conversation with an old friend yesterday, she insisted that I come to terms with being sick. I tried to tell her that I feel fine. I know I am going through cancer treatment but sick, that is not how I describe myself. Told her that I need positive comment right now. Anyone else hearing similar things from well meaning people? Thanks - Missey ",

Then I had to lie down face up. Next, clasped my hands above my had and tilted my head up and to the left. It was a weird position to be in. Had the wig off and it felt great. Side note, one of the techs said she thought it was my hair (high fiving Everyone ). There was a machine with arms that moved in from each side but they never touched me. Lights were coming from above and from the side. I have four tats. One in the middle of chest, the other below breast bone, the others are on either side of abdomen. Asked why there was a tat on my left side when the cancer was on the right. The tech said they used it to make sure I was level on the table. Has to be an easier way. Oh well. They took plenty of films and scans. Took about 30 minutes total. I tried to sleep and distract my mind so I would not move. Sometimes I wanted to sneeze, scratch my nose, or move my head but did not move so that the process wouldn't take longer. I know it was all in my head. They marked me up pretty good from the right side of my neck to below my breasts. Thankfully it can wash off. Talk to you guys later! Missey29",
