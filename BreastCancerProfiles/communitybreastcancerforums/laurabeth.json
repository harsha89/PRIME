It has covered my breasts and nipples too and every time I have gone to my GP i have tried to explain the different pain and how the rash is different to any part of my body. I have read that a eczema like rash on the nipples can be a symptom. As I turned to lie on my side during the night about 8 nights ago I had a really sharp sort of burning pain in my armpit. I got up and turned the light on and there was nothing there so I just ignored it and thought nothing else of it. 2 days ago I realised that there was a lump. I dont know. It is sore when I touch it. Do cancerous lumps hurt? Should I see my GP or give it a couple of days to see if it diseappears? Log in to post a reply",
