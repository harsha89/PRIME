At the moment I'm choosing to look on the bright side: - I'll save a bundle on hair care products & haircuts - Will be freeing up space in my bathroom cabinets by boxing up hair care products, brushes, blow dryer & curling iron until I need them again (hopefully by this time next year) - Once I get my wig(s), I'll never have to deal with another bad hair day for the next year   I'm attending a Look Good, Feel Better workshop Monday morning and then going to a salon that offers free/low-cost wigs for chemo patients for a wig consult Monday afternoon. Of course, we'll see how that attitude holds up once I actually start losing it (my hair, hopefully not my mind). But at least it gives me some sense of control for the time being.",

I did not cold cap (not available here), but I didn't lose my hair until 3 weeks after my first AC and never got completely cue ball bald. I shaved it when my scalp became too sensitive from the shedding, but still had stubble. A week later the stubble was a bit longer & the prickly-ness was annoying, so I shaved it again. Then it started coming back again, so I figured who was I to argue with it, LOL. I had sparse coverage about 1/4\" of hair throughout treatment. I did continue taking my Hair, Skin & Nails biotin supplement the whole time, so I'm sure that may have helped. It's been so hot that I've been going without hats for almost a month now. I've only worn my wig for going to job interviews. Right now the top & front is just reaching one inch while the back is nearly 2 1/2. My regrowth was coming in gray outnumbering the bit of dark hair I had retained. The gray made the coverage look much thinner than it actually was, so I did henna/indigo about a month ago before I started going hat free. I haven't used commercial coloring for over a decade because the henna/indigo blend is much healthier & gentler on my hair.",

It has 2500mcg biotin along with 15mg Vit C and 15IU Vit E. I included it on the list of meds/supplements I was taking at the start of treatment & wasn't told I couldn't take it, so I've continued taking it daily. I've had 3 of my 4 AC chemos (#4 is this Friday) and have seen no change in my nails. I don't know if nail changes are an issue on AC or if I should be more concerned about it when I start Taxol in a few weeks. Three weeks after my first chemo when my scalp became quite tender & sore and I was spending more time in the shower trying to get all the hair untangled off my hands than washing the rest of me, I chopped off all my hair & shaved my head. A week later I had to shave again because the stubble was annoying. Since then it still insists on growing, so I figure who am I to fight it if it wants to grow! Especially since I've read of others who started actually seeing regrowth while on Taxol. So I figure I just have a bit of a head start, and I credit it to the biotin.",

I'm just over 20 weeks PFC and now have full coverage, but it's still too short to tell if it's thicker than before. Thanks to my Dad's male pattern baldness, the top & crown were much slower to return. So that area is still pretty short while the sides & back are a full inch longer with a bit of curl. So if I don't comb it flat while it's wet, I end up looking like Bozo the clown. I'm hoping within the next month or so it will be at a stage where I can it to look like a more intentional haircut instead of \"recovering from chemo\" hair.",

I never got the really curly chemo curls, but it's definitely much wavier & has a bit more body than before. I hope it stays like this, as it previously took a lot of time with curling iron & styling products to achieve anything like this before. I colored with a henna/indigo blend last fall. That's the only kind of coloring I've used on my hair for at least the past 5 yrs. ",

Actually spend more time talking with his nurse (who was also one of my chemo nurses) than with him. She takes my vitals, checks my skin & chats with me about how I'm feeling, then he comes in, says I'm doing great & asks if I have any questions. So far I don't have any that haven't already been answered here. Thank you to everyone who has shared their experiences to help us feel prepared.",

My girls (rad techs, not boobs ) are so sweet, funny & easy-going. And they have good music playing, so I'm sure they'll keep it fun. Afterward I went shopping to pick up some men's cotton Ts, cotton camis, and cotton bras & just finished removing the underwires. Also picked up some 100% aloe gel. They say they have Aquaphor samples when I need them, and I've got a couple '$2 off' coupons for future purchases if needed. I also have some Alra lotion on hand, so will see what works the best for me when/if I develop any skin issues. Applied the Alra when I got home & will likely moisturize before bed too. I want to be proactive & hopefully head off any serious issues before they start. So far I have a set schedule of 1pm each day, but they said if I have any other upcoming appointments in the area, just let them know & they can reschedule to save me making multiple trips into town. I've been following the February, March & April radiation threads for a few weeks and all the tips have been so helpful to prepare me, so thank you all. One down, 29 to go!",

He said that's fine, but considering that my prescription co-pays are only $1-$2 he said he could give me a prescription for Lidex cream which would not only cost me less, but the itch relief would last longer than an OTC. Energy level is still good, so hoping that continues. Met with my PCP yesterday & she said my echocardiogram results from a couple weeks ago look great.
