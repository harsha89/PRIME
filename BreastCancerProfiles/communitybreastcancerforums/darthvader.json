      "Content": "darthvader wrote: I have: Painless lump the size of a marble, hard, doesn't move, firmly attached to the tissue underneath, located in my right underarm just at the edge of where breast tissue becomes underarm tissue, if that makes sense. It feels a little irregular shaped. I thought it might be a swollen lymph node, but I've had one of those before (infection) and that felt smoother along with being kind of squishy, and it moved whereas this one does not move. I now am not sure if it's a lymph node or a tumor. I noticed it two weeks ago, but it may have been there for longer. I have an appointment to get it checked out on Tuesday. I'm 26. No family history that I am aware of. I have a couple of other symptoms: Recurring stabbing pain around my right breast, and shoulder pain on that side. I also have a lump in that breast that was diagnosed two years ago as benign (though I had no tests beyond the OB/GYN feeling it and telling me it wasn't cancer), but is still there. It's hard to find it, but it's definitely still there. Could I really have had breast cancer for two years with no symptoms until now? Log in to post a reply",

I could just have an infection, or a cyst, or something else innocuous. I'm a scientist, and I know a fair bit about breast cancer, so this is a little challenging as I'm already thinking about receptors and different treatment options.",
