I see what she means! There is a sisterhood. There is a hope. There is a bond. It's too bad it takes a little bit of tissue to do it, but I'm glad for it. I remain positive. Although I report my HER2 status as negative, it is indeterminate (2+ out of 3), so we are awaiting the FISH results to determine if I will exchange my taxotere/cytoxan regime for taxotere/carbiplatin/herceptin/neulasta for the second cycle. I will be all right, no matter what. Glad to join you all!",
