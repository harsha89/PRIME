Now I am waiting for my body to heal a bit and have another MRI before my surgery is scheduled. I've got all the positives: ER, PR, HER2 and BRCA2. So I'm definitely having a BMX with immediate reconstruction. Hoping my surgery will be end of January. I'm only 39 and otherwise pretty healthy so I'm hoping I can keep up my positive attitude that I will heal quickly from this. It's such a relief to know that chemo is over and finished and that I can get on with the next steps to being cancer free. Wishingall you brave women courage and strength!! Xx",
