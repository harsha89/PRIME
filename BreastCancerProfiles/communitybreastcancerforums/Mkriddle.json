They found a mass about 7mo ago and my follow up it showed change and they wanted to have it biopsied. So here I am today. They said 3-5 days. I'm hoping I know something by Friday. I am also 28y and I'm scared as crap. They didn't say anything to me at all just sat quite the whole time. So that doesn't make me feel any better.  I am glad that you got good results back!",
