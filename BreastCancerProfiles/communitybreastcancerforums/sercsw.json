There's recurrances with lumpectomy, the opposite breast w/ new diagnosis down the line and then the worry and frequent mammo's. Tram flaps (most other flaps as well) have the most natural feel and less incidence if f/u surgeries needed. It's a big, long surgery but hell, if I can survive it, I can survive cancer too. We are warriors, ladies! Glad to have found this site and all you great ladies! Sue",
