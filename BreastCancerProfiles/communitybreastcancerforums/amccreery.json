I then went through 5 months of chemotherapy after which I had a PET/CT which showed suspicious sclerotic lesions on my spine. Since then I have had frequent PET/CTs and spine MRIs all showing stable inconclusive lesions. My spine surgeon feels they are not mets, but are rather post-chemo changes to the bone. My oncologist is guardedly agreeing with him at this point because they've never shown any uptake and have not progressed. Anyone else have a similar situation in any respect? I've been feeling like I've got a new lease on life. But reading this forum has me a bit concerned. Thank you.",
