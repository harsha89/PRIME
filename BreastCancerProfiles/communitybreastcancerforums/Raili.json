I'm worried that I will be too much of an emotional wreck to even be able to lie still enough for the radiation to work!!  I'm trying to be comforted by everyone's inspiring stories about how they sailed through radiation without (m)any problems, or how it wasn't nearly as bad as they thought it would be, but.... there's no way to predict how a person will react.  I'm not comforted by the rad onc telling me that the serious side effects are \"very rare,\" because I've beat the odds so many times already here.  I'm only 31, super healthy, no family history of BC - there was only a 1% chance I even had cancer in the first place... then I ended up with mucinous cancer, which accounts for less than 2% of all breast cancers... so when someone tells me \"There's only a 2% chance\" (or whatever!) of developing side effects, it really doesn't mean much to me at this point!!!",

      "Content": "Mar 1, 2010 03:57PM - edited Mar 1, 2010 04:08PM by Raili Karen, I'm glad you are seeing a BS and that your insurance covers it!  I agree with those who said that a second opinion/more investigating can't hurt, and is better than waiting and wondering/worrying. But I must admit to being biased on this topic... I had an ultrasound for a lump, and the radiologist said he was \"98% sure\" it was benign but recommended I get it biopsied \"just to be sure.\"  The breast surgeon then nearly talked me out of the biopsy, offering me the option of just monitoring the lump for 6 months to see if it changed, because he was \"99% sure\" it was benign.  As tempting as it was for me to leave his office right then and there, and thus get away from him and the needle, my gut told me to go through with the biopsy.  And much to everyone's shock, the lump WAS cancerous. Ever since, I've been so distrustful of anyone saying \"Oh, there's such a low chance that...\" or \"I wouldn't worry about...\" Edited to say: I don't mean to scare people! :(  Most of the time, when a radiologist says, \"I don't think it's anything to worry about,\" it's NOT anything to worry about!  I'm just one of those rare, freak cases, so what happened to me most likely will NOT happen to you!  But what I've realized from all of this is that there are so many questions in life we may never have answers to, so many uncertainties...so when it IS possible to get a definitive answer about something, I want that.  That is, even if the radiologist and BS were \"98% sure\" I didn't have cancer, and I went through the biopsy anyway and it was confirmed that the lump was indeed benign, I would not regret getting the biopsy... I would not be thinking, \"DUH, we KNEW it wasn't cancer, I just needlessly put myself through an uncomfortable medical procedure!\", I would be glad for the PROOF that I didn't have cancer.  Does that make sense?  Other women have different opinions of this, of course.  It becomes a matter of weighing the pros and cons for yourself, of which is worse, undergoing an invasive procedure (biopsy) when you are probably just fine, or living with uncertainty/living with the tiny tiny chance that it might not be benign.  It depends upon how much of a worrier each individual is, I suppose.",

Now that I am posting on a few BC msg boards and have found several other women with mucinous cancer, I'm surprised that it seems like we are ALL under the age of 60!  What's up with that??  Not only do we have a RARE cancer, but we are a RARE demographic even amongst those who do have this rare type.  I'm glad mucinous cancer generally has such an excellent prognosis, is usually non-aggressive and slow-growing (not always!), etc... but the difficulty is that because mucinous cancer is so rare, it hasn't been studied much.  It's hard to take the results of other BC studies and apply those findings to our situations, because the patients in those studies didn't have what we have.",

NativeMainer, I'm sorry you had to go through that. :(  But thank you for telling me that.  Sometimes it feels like I'm the only one who is bothered by male doctors touching my breasts and no one understands! I will have to interview this rad onc extensively before committing to treatment at this place... I wonder if, like Sido suggested, I could have the physical exams performed by a Nurse Practitioner instead.  Or, if the rad onc insists he himself must examine my breasts regularly, maybe there's some kind of form I can sign saying that I'm refusing that part of treatment but won't hold him/the facility liable for anything.  If there is no way around having him touch me that much, and/or if they won't honor my request for female techs only, then I'll have to decide between taking those sedatives and crying my way through it, or doing the 6 weeks of rads at the affiliated cancer center that would be a 3-hour round trip each way - there are no female oncs closer than that within this hospital network.  Neither option would be good.  But I'm at a point in my treatment where I really NEED to re-gain more control of who is touching my breasts.  I \"put up with\" having a male doctor do the initial biopsy (because the ultrasound guy lied to me and said there was no female doctor of that type within a 2-hr radius), and when I went for my lumpectomy, a male resident was the one to do the horrible wire localization/dye injection procedure, and no one had told me about him ahead of time, and I put up with it because my only other option at that point would have been to reschedule surgery and emotionally I couldn't handle putting it off any longer. But now the tumor is out of my body and I'm going to slow down and make careful decisions about who to let touch me/treat me.  It's been over 2 months and I still sometimes lie awake in bed having flashbacks of how awful and nauseating it felt to have the male doctor examining my breasts before the biopsy.  It's not even memories of the core needle that get to me - it's his hands on me.  I'm not going to go through that again.",

And I totally hear you about how it would have been much better if they had simply ASKED you ahead of time about the changes!!  That has been my biggest frustration with the hospital I've been going to - not being prepared for what's coming up next.  I have learned the hard way that I need to proactively ask questions and speak up about things, because in the beginning I made the mistake of assuming they would naturally tell me things... but they don't, unless I ask.  e.g. I thought I would automatically get copies of my pathology reports and test results, but no, I have to ask every time.  I thought I would be asked if it's okay if a resident/student/etc. is assisting with a procedure, but it's the opposite - they are there \"by default\" unless I specifically ask for them NOT to be.  I am not an assertive person, but I've had continuous opportunities to practice self-advocacy!! My experience has been that the doctors/hospitals/etc follow their standard ways of doing things because it is what's easy and efficient for them, but it doesn't mean things CANNOT be done any other way...and all it takes is asking for something to be changed.  In the beginning, I didn't really speak up about anything, and just cried my way through the hard parts.  Now, it's only been 4 months since my dx, but I'm making ALL kinds of special requests, and was happily surprised to discover my doctors are great at accomdating my needs and are respectful.  For example, I'm really uncomfortable with men touching my breasts, so I sent my surgeon a long email explaining this and requested no more men touching my breasts at any future appointments, for anything!  Next surgery, I didn't have to send the male resident away this time - he never showed up in the first place. :)  I had an all-women OR team!  Then, the only radiation oncologist within a 90-min radius of my home turned out to be male, so my surgeon literally called him up to tell him he's not allowed to touch me, and if my breasts get infected or need any procedure that involves touching and cannot be handled by one of the female assistants on staff, I am to be sent back to her (my surgeon).  And then, I was able to set up my radiation simulation session for the week when this guy is on vacation and there's a female rad onc covering for him.  Also, we're waiting for my Oncotype score to come in, and because I'm much more comfortable with my surgeon than the med. onc. at this point, I requested that my surgeon be the one to tell me my Oncotype results when I go see her for my postoperative check, beecause I'd rather she break the news to me than the onc.  Everyone's been fine with all of my unusual requests and I'm so grateful.",

I'm not comforted by the radiologist assuring me I might just have slightly burned skin and mild fatigue and that it will all be temporary and I'll be back to normal once radiation's over.  What if it's NOT temporary??  All of these cancer treatments have potentially long-term side effects, which are real, however rare the doctors insist they are... but the problem is, when a breast cancer survivor starts having weird symptoms months or years down the line, it's so easy for the oncologists to insist that surely it has nothing to do with the drugs or radiation.  Surely it must be due to something ELSE.  It seems like there's very little accountability. Okay, I'm rambling bigtime, and I think I've covered too many sub-topics for this one thread... sigh.",

I feel better now!  And NativeMainer, I totally agree with this -  \"If rads really need to be daily, then they wouldn't take weekends and holidays off.\" That's what bugs me.  The fact that radiation is Mon through Fri is more for the doctors' convenience than anything else...it's due to the fact that the center is closed on weekend, not anything to do with what our bodies need. MarieKelly and 3montsmama, your explanations help, too.  I remember when I was a young teenager and took an over-the-counter pain reliever for a headache or something, I asked my dad, how does the medicine know that it's my head that hurts and stop the pain just in my head??  He told me, it doesn't.  It numbs all the pain receptors in your body, and thus, your headache goes away by default.  I remember being mad about that, mad that my whole body was affected when all I had was a headache!  My expectations were too high, and decades later, still are.  I continue to be frustrated by the \"standard of care\" that does not/cannot take individual differences into account.  This \"one size fits all\" approach makes me distrustful of the treatments, because there's no way of knowing if I, personally, will really need and/or benefit from the treatments...and yet, I'm going through with the radiation anyway, I guess because I'm not comfortable with taking the risk of NOT doing it, not having a better option right now.  I believe that with enough time and information from other sources (e.g. my naturopath/alternative health practictioners), I could devise an effective, individualized treatment plan... but I just worry that I don't have enough time to do that.  I was dx'd 4 months ago and have just now completed the surgical phase.  Argh...

Having cancer/being treated for cancer is scary enough.  I don't think you should be expected to confront a phobia in addition to all that you're already going through!  It really should be up to your doctors to find another, acceptable way for you to take this medication, in a form other than a pill you have to swallow.  If your doctor insists that there is no other safe way to take this drug, then ask for a different treatment, is my advice. Intense psychotherapy DID enable me to eventually be able to swallow things.  But it was quite a long process.  I hope your doctor understands how serious phobias are and finds another way for you!  Good luck! Edited to add: Forgive me if this sounds like a wacko idea... feel free to ignore it!  But I was thinking, many people I know have successfully overcome phobias through hypnosis.  And I think the process might be quicker than psychotherapy.  Maybe something to look into?? I don't know anything about these medications... but if you and your doctor feel that this drug is the best or only one for you, then it comes down to the question: which fear in you is STRONGER, your fear of brain mets, or your fear of swallowing a pill?",

I was totally out for my lumpectomy.  I was wheeled into the OR with the IV already in my arm, although the only thing that had been administered through it at that point was the prophylactic antibiotic.  Once I was on the operating table, my surgeon asked what kind of music I wanted to listen to.  For some reason, this struck me as hilarious, and I blurted out, \"I'm not going to be awake to hear music!!!\" and started giggling so much that the anesthesiologist joked, \"I haven't even given her anything yet!\"  Then, I simply don't remember anything else.  I don't remember \"falling asleep\" - it must have happened really fast.  Next thing I knew, I was waking up in recovery.  Then I had two reexcisions and was conscious for both.  They gave me an IV of a drug mixture that my surgeon calls \"happy juice\" - drugs that kept me conscious but very relaxed and sleepy.  I couldn't see anything, but I think my eyes were open - I think there was just a big blue drape in front of my face so that I wouldn't be able to see anything that was going on.  One of the side effects of the drugs was supposedly amnesia, and they told me I probably wouldn't remember much from the OR, but I do!  I remember spending the first reexcision surgery chatting and laughing with my surgeon the whole time, about the most ridiculous things.  I giggled like an idiot through most of it.  I felt no pain at all, but I was vaguely aware of sensations like mild pressure and the suction of the irrigation, and I could feel the pulling sensation when she was stitching me up at the end.  But the drugs were so great, it didn't hurt, and I didn't mind any of this.  During the second reexcision, I was still super chatty but less giggly, and I don't remember as much as I remember about the previous surgery... I just remember bits and pieces of our conversations about books, TV, and food.  A few days later when my surgeon called me with my pathology results, she asked, amused, \"Do you remember what you were saying about your mom in the OR?\"  (Oh, sh*t!  Um, no? :))  Also during that 2nd reexcision, I have vague memories of saying something like, \"That kinda hurts a little\" in the middle of it, and them offering (and me accepting!) more numbing drugs through the IV.  But while I remember saying that/that happening, I don't remember the pain feeling at all.",

I didn't cry at all on my last day... I was as giddy as a teenager, so happy that it was all over.  I literally RAN out of the treatment room and out of the cancer center.  I hated that whole experience so much that I begrudgingly went to the 6-week follow-up with the rad. onc., but I'm refusing to go for any more follow-ups, despite having breast lymphedema.  I'll continue to see just my surgeon, medical oncologist, and naturopath.",

It's okay to have your appointment with your oncologist a few days after seeing your radiologist.  Your radiologist and oncologist will coordinate with each other.  Do you know yet whether or not you will be having chemotherapy?  Or is that a topic to be discussed with your onc on 4/7?  Typically, if you're having chemo, chemo is given before radiation.  So if chemo is still a possibility for you, you might want to put off making the radiation simulation appointment until after you have talked with your onc.  Good luck and hang in there!",

How likely IS lymphedema after just a SNB??  What has your experience been like?  Do you have lymphedema after a SNB, or do you know others who do?  SHOULD I be wearing the lymphedema alert bracelet, keeping my arm elevated when possible, wearing gloves for everything, not shaving under that armpit, obsessing over every scratch and bugbite, avoiding hot tubs, the whole 9 yards??

Kira, no need at all to apologize for that \"rant\" - that's all incredibly helpful information! I've bookmarked those links. And Binney, thanks for all of your info. I went to that website and found names of LE therapists in my area, but perhaps the LANA database is outdated, because when I search for those names on the website of the hospital they're supposedly affiliated with, nothing comes up! I'd like to get a referral to see a LE therapist, for baseline measurements and consultation on preventative strategies, etc., but who do I get that referral from - my regular doctor, or my surgeon? Do you think insurance would cover a visit to an LE therapist as a preventative measure, or only if I were having symptoms? Tina, doctors passing the buck is one of my biggest pet peeves... it seems to happen a lot, doesn't it? I hear so many stories on this message board about the side effects of treatments and how each doctor insists, \"Oh, it couldn't be from [insert treatment here]!\" Beaglesmom, I hope your visit to the chiro helps! That's on my to-do list as well...",
