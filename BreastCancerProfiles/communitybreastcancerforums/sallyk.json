There is one about 15 miles closer but she is private and don't know if insurance will pay.My doctor has already sent paper work. I can not wrap at work. We are union they will say if you can't do your job take medical leave. There is no ac in the summer and it gets very hot so I might do the medical leave. What will a good LE therapist do? The last one did some measurments and showed me how to massage and wrap. She did not touch my arm at all during massage. I watch her do her own then I had to do mine. Does that sound right? I will try the bike shirt  and see if that helps. I also have a glove but it is too tight. I had a root canal done today. The dentist put me on amoxil he does not want to take a chance with infection. Thanks Sallyk",

The sleeve is so tight now that it leaves indents in my arm and hand when I take it off. She said if I need anything else call her. I have not had to wear it for a year. I woke last week and the hand was swelled and hurting.  I thought I broke it but that is not the case. There is only three qualified LE therapist in Indiana that I can find. I will have to travel about 60 miles to see one. Do you think I should? Also how many times does a qualified LE therapist have you to come back?  Thank you!
