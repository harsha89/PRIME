Now my arm is swollen. The swelling seems to be intermittent. Does axillary web syndrome cause swelling or is it most likely lymphedema? Any information, suggestions, or your personal experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

I have another appointment tomorrow and plan to ask for a referral. There isn't any signs of celluitis, but I also have a seroma that they are draining every week and have a TE in place. Is there any correlation between the seroma, cording, & lymphedema?",
