I had ultrasound and 3 core biopsies (3 due to size) am waiting on biopsy result - today or tomorrow. I have done a lot of reading and it seems the most common are DCIS or LCIS. It is too far away from the nipple (about one inch from breastbone) to be ductal, so am assumingng LCIS. But everything I have read says that it is usually before menopause (I am 55 so passed) and usually has no symptoms or any palpable lump? that it isn't really cancer. All I know so far is that the ultrasound report findings were \" likely carcinoma, 3 o'clock right breast, approx 20 mm, poorly defined and fixed,. The information all says it is usually found incidentally through a mammogram or tests on the breast for another reason, and that it is not usually a palpable lump - mine is so palpable I found it by accident and with the flat palm of my hand. What I want to find out, is there anyone out there that has either DCIS or LCIS that HAD found it as had a clearly palpable lumP, I am so scared nopw that it is invasive lobular? please make me feel better and tell me yours was quite palpable! As am ia paraplegic so cant stand n a wheelchair I was told I could not have a mammogram and so my last one was 6 years ago. Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Apr 27, 2017 08:59PM - edited Apr 27, 2017 09:03PM by bevvzy numbness is perfectly normal and about 75% of wonen after a mastecomy will have it to varying degrees. About half of those will gradually regain sensation but it can taken even up to 18 months. I had a mastectomy and although only 8 days ago, i did ask and also research the numbness . Ptetty much the whole right of my chest is totally numb. My armpit and underside top half of arm is totally numb ( and yet burns intensely) and even just below ny collar bone and shoulder blade at the back are totally numb. A few parchy areas only are not numb and they hurt like crap. So enjoy the numbness cause beats the painâ˜º my armpit, while also completely numb to touch, burns severly, go figure (nerve pain i was told) I was told though as had axillary dissection (most nodes removed) that this was common. So dont worry. It is very common and normal. Likewise it may or may not go away but can take many months. Take extra care with hot water, hot drinks etc as you could scald yourself and not know",
