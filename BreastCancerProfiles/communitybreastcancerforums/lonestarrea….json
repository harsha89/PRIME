One way to think about it is that it is similar to the small cannula on insulin pumps or continuous blood glucose monitors that Type 1s wear. I think not having to go back the next day after chemo would be a wonderful thing.",

I also developed numbness in my feet ant fingers that would come and go but then stayed. I also developed the darkening of the skin on the backs of my hands an a red rash that spread across the backs of my hands and fingers. The skin was rough and sore. Due to all these side effects they stopped the Taxol therapy after round 10. I've had to pause my AC treatments halfway too because of a nail infection that will not clear. My doctor prescribed Gabapentin for the neuropathy and my feet are a bit better but I still feel the slight numbness near my mouth. I'm anxious to get my last 2 AC treatments done to see if the face numbness goes away. I will say that I do not notice it too much but I am aware of to off and on. Good luck to us!",
