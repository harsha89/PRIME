I had the normal side effects with dose 1 and 2 (nausea, constipation, fatigue, etc.). The third dose was a different story, I was so exhausted I couldn't get up, ended up my red blood cells were very low, so I had three iron infusions last week, then my white blood cells tanked (.400), so I am getting daily neupogen shots. I also received neulasta shot the day after each chemo. My question is if anyone has experienced this also, I have been mostly in bed for 7 days now. I am getting frustrated. Thanks for your help.",
