I think it started with the Taxol, but I am not sure. Twice now, I have gotten an odd foot fungus.  It presents with blisters on the feet, and itches not just between the toes, but all along the bottom of my foot, especially my arch, and also on the tips of my toes. I am wondering if it is caused or exacerbated by either edema or neuroapthy (I had both). I just got off Taxol and started Taxotere.  Both the edema and the neurapathy seem to be getting better, albeit very slowly. Anyone else ever experience something similar. Also, do I get email notifications about when someone responds or do I need to check the list directly?
