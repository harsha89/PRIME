    "Content": "Oct 31, 2007 11:54PM - edited Nov 1, 2007 12:02AM by CuriousC I have never understood the questions about storage of the prosthesis! I wear it 18 hours and then leave it sitting in my bra on a shelf for 8 hours! I treat it like part of my body when it is on, and part of my bra when it is off. I think you should make life as simple as possible and not add a \"procedure\" to your life that you don't need. Now 3 years later, without reconstruction, I almost feel that I was simply born with only one breast and it is not a big issue. I am pleased to have arrived at this point.",
