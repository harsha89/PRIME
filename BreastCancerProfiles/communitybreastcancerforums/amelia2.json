My last radiation is scheduled for 12 May and we have planned a 10 day vacation to Hawaii on 26 May. ( We booked and paid for this before I was diagnosed).   My RO has said I should be OK to go, but I am now uncertain. From your experiences I would value your advice about whether I am being naive about being ready to enjoy a beach type holiday, including swimming so soon after rads.  Will my breast skin still be raw and will I still be very tired two weeks after finishing rads?  Also my last chemo is on 14 March is it likely I will have enough hair cover to go without a scarf by 26 May?",

My gorgeous son had a day off work and came over and took the clippers to my head.

My first venture into public without my hair is still to come and am thinking about what head covering I will choose. My son thinks I should just go au natural and not worry about scarves or hats at all. I have some nice things planned for the weekend to celebrate the end of the first TCH cycle. My next tx infusion is Monday 31st, and will have Neulasta the following day. I am feeling good at the moment, but expect that there will be a few days after chemo where there will be usual SE, if they are no worse than last time I know I can manage them.  Hoping I avoid the rash this time though.  I am also interested to see how the Neulasta affects me as I did not have this with the 1st tx.  Best wishes to all as you continue with your treatments, and hope your SE are bearable. ",

I didn't win that one. With this heat a wig is not an option for me.  It is cooler today and last night was the first night I got some proper sleep in a week.

Not sure I really needed the senna but I was terrified about the constipation as I really suffered with this when I had my hysterectomy, ended up in hospital which eventually produced a result, know what you are going through, it is not nice.  I know this won't help you this round but for the future, my oncology nurse suggested I start taking softeners one or two days before the chemo as she said that constipation is more likely and more difficult to deal with than the diarhrea.   I take a fibre drink Metamucil, before chemo.  I don't know if you have that over there, it comes as a powder and you stir a spoonful into water.  I have not suffered from constipation with the chemo so it may be working.  It says on the label it is not recommended for chemical induced constipation, so I would not take it after chemo, only before as a prep. I also have lots of fluids and fruits with high water content on the days before the chemo days. BIG {{{{{{{{{ To everyone suffering SE's this week }}}}}}}}}",

The onco clinic said try claritin but that hasn't really helped.  It is mid summer here and the heat and humidity make it worse. I have been told the rash should go away in about a week, has anyone else had this experience? I got my hair cut very short in the week before chemo and this has been good as it is easy, a bonus when tired and not feeling great. I am on antibiotics to counter infections, definitely feeling better this week than last week.  Not sure if I will be able to wear a wig, have tried several but they have not felt comfortable.  My hairdresser has been very kind and loaned me two wigs and i have stocked up on scarves.  Not looking forward to losing my hair.

Before I was diagnosed my DH and I booked and paid for 10 day flight to Hawaii at the end of May, a vacation and also to attend a wedding, our dear friends son is getting married on Maui.  Now I am so undecided whether to go or not. My oncologists are also encouraging me to go, but I am worried about 2 things, I will be only one week out of radiation, so am concerned about skin issues and fatigue, and I will still have no hair and worry if this will stop me getting into and enjoying all the celebrations and activities, I will leave it to the last minute to make a decision on that one.  Maybe after I start my rads in April I will have a better idea of the SE. Kim - So happy for you that your PET results were good Steroid Advice, thank you to all of you who commented on your steroid regimes, I hadn't realised they were all so different.  After reading these, this time after chemo I reduced to the one tablet the day after chemo, now on Day 3 and feeling ok, not as knocked out, but just a little more naueous but managing.",

I am interested in the type of scarves you have ordered and where you got them from because I am still thinking about Hawaii at the end of May.  Some of the scarves I have are very hot to wear and I will need to get a few new ones if we do go. JulieH - Hope you are starting to feel better, if you are still feeling exhausted after the weekend it would be good if you could take a bit of time to rest and recuperate. Look after yourself. slcst12 - I had low vitamin D levels before BC diagnosis and had been taking Vitamin D supplements on my doctor's recommendation for over 12 months prior.  My onc told me to stay on these through out chemo, although she asked me to stop other supplements. I never thought to ask whether the vitamin D deficiency was a cause or effect of BC.",

So happy to have that behind me. Expect I will have a couple of days with SE's but as this is the last I am sure I can manage.  Tiredness has been steadily increasing as I have got to this last chemo.  I will be starting RADs on 5 April for 25 treatments daily and I have heard this also can be fatiguing.  I think they like to give you a little break after chemo before RADS to get the toxins out of your system and give you a chance to recover you blood levels. This is from my RO.  I am on Herceptin for the remainder of the year with infusion every 3 weeks but my onc has said that there is minimal SE from herceptin nothing like chemo SE. Keeping my fingers crossed that she is right. I would like to thank all the wonderful women on this thread for sharing the journey, the good and the not so good, their words of encouragement, wisdom, the companionship, just knowing that you are not alone in going through this is such a great support.  I wish you all the very best with your ongoing treatments. I am sorry I do not have the energy for personal messages at the moment.  So ... Congratulations to all who have finished chemo.  And to everyone celebrating birthdays, anniversaries and vacations enjoy and enjoy many more in the years to come. Good luck and best wishes to all.",
