How did I know--you guessed it--Cellulitis.  As the chemo ate my fingernails, infection set in, and my arm that I (idiotically) thought felt heavy from the chemo swelled like a balloon. You know the story.  Anyway, I've been lurking here ever since, soaking up the Binny/Kira, &c. expertise. Now I can at least weigh in with some of my own knowledge.  Sigvaris Advance has been the NHS sleeve of choice in my part of the UK (Northwest) and so I have been wearing a Sigvaris Advance compression class 2 sleeve w/gauntlet for the past four months.  I hated it at first and spent hours surfing online dreaming that lymphedivas, Jovi, those sweet-looking Italian sleeves or ANYTHING else would be better, but I've come to terms with it, and considering how CHEAP they are, I think they are not too bad.  Things to note: I tend to pull at the gauntlet as it bothers that area between the thumb and index finger.  This is, of course, exactly what they tell you not to do, so it is no surprise that I have wear issues in the gauntlet--but I will say that by the end of a month, my gauntlet is starting to be stretched out of shape and after three it is looking a big saggy.  My lymphoedema in the hand is only bad when I wear a sleeve by itself, so that hasn't been much of a problem for me, but is something to think about. That said, after the three months I've been wearing them, the sleeve part is still in great shape, and seems to have retained its compression very well. I like that I can order a \"long\" cause I have longish arms, and I think that may mean that some of you short-armed ladies might like the regular size.   The top band annoys some of the UK woman.  It is solid silicone (or whatever they say in their ad), rather than a diamond pattern like I've seen on the lymphediva sleeves, so there is more band-skin contact, I think.  At first it really bothered me, but I've grown used to it, and don't mind it anymore, and it does stay up beautifully even after several months.  Bearing in mind I've never worn anything else, I can say that these sleeves are pretty good and I'm not unhappy with them, and the relatively low price means I can buy several and rotate them. I am looking forward to hearing what you all think of it, since I have yet to get anything else--we get two sleeves every six months for free from the NHS, and I've bought a third and am getting ready to buy a fourth for myself (resisting the Solidea yearning). If someone wants to do a comparison with what they are currently wearing, I'd love to hear it.     ",

Do you have a cut, scrape, bite? If you suspect it might be cellulitis, don't wait to see if you get better--it won't. Boring it may be, but you should go to the ER. Meanwhile--drink, drink, drink (lots of water--some vacation!)  Elevate! Elevate! Elevate! Don't let your arm hang down to your side. And how about some deep diaphram breathing (in count three, hold count three, out count five).   Quail",
