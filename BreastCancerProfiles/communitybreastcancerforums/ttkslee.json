Dx was DCIS left breast comedo type. Lumpectomy was performed on 10/11/12 with all clear margins with the exception of the inferior. I had a rexcision on 11/1/12 and the same inferior margin was clear, but too close for comfort. So....I had another rexcision on 11/29/12 which resulted with a small foci present within 1mm of the same inferior margin. All of these surgeries have been a breeze, and during this time, my parents have been ill. That is the main reason I have chosen the rexcisions. During this time, I have had a second and a third opinion from two other well known breast surgeons as well as two MO. Both breast surgeons and one MO said from a medical view point, another rexcision would be fine, since it was DCIS. One MO was of the opinion that MX was in order. Now I am faced with deciding which route to take next. I keep thinking that since the last path report read a small foci and not multiple foci..that we are at the edge of the DCIS. And I have heard of two women this past week who have been DX with breast cancer several years post MX, in the MX side! So now I am thinking of trying one last rexcision and feel that I want the RADS to kill any of those little left over cancer cells! Either way, there is no easy answer.",

It all is still so unsettling. I will probably have less than 1/4 of my breast tissue missing if I go with another rexcision. Apparently this \"just DCIS\" DX as was quoted to me by several Dr. can be very tricky.",
