The details of all your North Africa stuff will get done. You work on getting through this next bit, one day at a time, as you have gotten through the last bit. Hang in there. Julie ",

She went on and on about the baby she had just delivered....her kids were 11 and 13 at the time. Apparently this one was a new different baby. No one has said anything to me about my babbling away during my procedures. I have another one on Thursday, so I guess anything can happen. I will try to clear my mind of all thought beforehand! As one who works in a counseling-related field, I tend to know things (I'd rather not know) about people, and some of them work at the hospital...... Of course, now that I've said that, it is probably exactly what I will be thinking about as they wheel me into the OR.... Also, I will echo leaf's advice to talk to the person in charge about pain relief BEFORE the  wire-localization. I was one who had some pain with that, and was completely unprepared for it. In my experience recovery from the sedation is way way easier than general anesthesia. I would rather have a small amount of time in which I was unaware and might say some amusing, than know I was going to have several days or longer of recovery time from general. But everyone makes their own decisions, and I have learned to trust my own gut, so listen to yours.... Julie ",
