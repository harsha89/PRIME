She was told several years ago by her primary care Dr. that she had a fatty tumor on her liver, but we can find no referance to it in her records. Her Dr. has since left the State. Is it possible for a fatty tumor to show activity on a pet scan? We are wailing for a review of the petscan by her oncologist to determine treatment. She was originally stage 2 grade 3 idc. Thank you for any help, it wll be 2-3 wks before we hear back from Oncologist, a long time to wait... Log in to post a reply",
