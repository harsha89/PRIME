IT IS ANOTHER INSURANCE POLICY FOR US. DO YOU HAVE AN INVASIVE CANCER? ANY WAY I HAD THE SAME THOUGHTS. WE ARE NOT OLD. IN FACT MY ONCOLOGIST SAID IF I WAS 85 SHE WOULDN'T EVEN RECOMMEND IT BUT HEY YOUNG CHICK WE ARE STILL YOUNG. SO I AM TAKING EVERYTHING I CAN. 8 WEEKS OF YUCK FOR WHO KNOWS HOW MANY MORE YEARS. LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU DECIDE.",

I'm sure it will feel better when the scalp is actually smooth. Let me know how you are doing? I'm meeting a friend at Hearth N Kettle tomorrow at ten am. If you are around you can't miss me. I'll be wearing a brown hat. Love Karen ",
