They are at an age when they can be of great comfort to you. Let each and everyone who offers help get in there and do something for you, so you can concentrate on yourself.

I would imagine he is made of very strong stuff, like his Mom, so let him deal with her, just be there to let him talk it thru with you if he needs to, he will have enough on his mind trying to get to terms with being back home, so will surely need his Mom.

It took about 3 years to correctly diagnose me, I was passed from doc to doc, and felt all were thinking I was laying it on !! If only ! I had to get to a rheumatologist in the end for a diagnosis, and the main way to diagnose, well, you'll know this, if you've had the test, is to find about a dozen (I think) points on my head and neck that were sore. I never realised they WERE sore until I was prodded by the doc, so I don't know.  I know I have something, and it helps to have a name, then people don't think you're mad. I even had a trip to see a psychiatrist to see 'if something was bothering me to cause the pain' what a SHOWER docs can be sometimes.  Good Luck with your scan. Isabella.",

I have a lot of dogs, and find it very hard to have a favorite, because petting one more than any of the others causes havoc. I had a family turn up at my door one day, they'd heard I loved dogs. They told me I was their last resort, if I didn't take Max, the next stop was the vet, and they wouldn't be bringing him home. Out jumps this great big Rotweiller, looking just evil ! I am used to small dogs, so this was new territory. Over the weeks we became firm friends, he made me get up and walk him, and I got to like walking!I had him 9 years. Twice he had one of my little dogs in his mouth, he hated small dogs, he just one day managed to get over the fence from 'his' garden, into where my Pekingeses were, and just got hold of one by the scruff of his neck, and had him hanging lifeless. I yelled and screamed for DH to come,I just could not open Max's jaws, luckily he heard me, and managed to prise the mouth open, release the Peke, who came to in a couple of minutes. Next time he had a Yorkie dog in the same situation, again DH managed to release, and he was Ok. Then I just dare not let Max run around again, DH concreted a pen for him,and I felt like a prison guard, but we had small g/kids, and Max didn't like kids either !! I just loved that dog, he had two goes at me growling and showing his teeth over the years,I had to hit him on the head with a coal shovel once,I can laugh now, but at the time he had me pinned up against a wall, and he weighed just over 11 stones, and in those days I was 9 stone wet thru ! Max got cancer, and I kept him at home with me, on strong drugs until the end, I was just heartbroken when he died. This was 4 years ago. I buried him in 'his' garden, and planted an Oak tree right on top of him,its about 15 feet high now, and I often walk down my garden to the Oak, and to be with Max.  Since his death I bought myself 2 more Rotweiller boys, they are18 months now, and hard work. I haven't the energy to walk them so we have extended their run, and let them out when the little dogs are all away. So I know just what you are feeling. My sister says to me 'why do you keep on keeping dogs, when they just go die on you' She had 1dog and 1 cat and said never again she couldn't stand it.I just cannot live without my dogs, so thats why I do it ! So if you're a true dog lover you'll get another one to love. Good Luck with the scans. Isabella.",

I had my second drain in 12 weeks, unbelievable I know, but it just didn't slow up. By the time it came to be pulled, it couldn't be done, it'd grown in. I made an almighty fuss in the Drs room, as 3 of them tried to pull it out, in the end I jumped out of the chair and told them to leave me alone. I had to have a general anaesthetic to get it out a week later. Deedee. The stringy blood is quite normal, its amazing what does come down these drains. You should be soon getting rid of your drain if you're 4 days post lumpectomy. Welcome to you. Isabella.",

I have tried various group, and one to one activities, but all were a waste of time, and had just nicely gotten used to living with it when bc hit ! My Fibro specialist was leaning towards Fibro being caused by chemicals I used to handle, well before we were told to wear protective clothing, and we were just getting into doing some investigations when I started bc treatment, and all these investigations went out of the window ! I have never really bothered going back and starting up investigations, have had a belly full of hospitals, and now try and avoid them if I can.

The medics have been terrible, very disbelieving, and generally unhelpful. After all there's not often anything to 'see,' just a whining woman going on and on about wanting some pain relief ! When I was dx'd with BC, after the first shock of things I almost felt some sort of relief that I would be believed, at long last,when I visited my GP.

Even when I got a 'label' put on the condition by a specialist, my GP actually wrote, in her notes, (which I asked my solicitor to request, he could make the request formally, I couldn't ) that she thought 'there was a psyche element in all this somewhere'. I could have murdered her when I saw that, as NO WAY can I have it taken from my record, it's there forever, and could have a bearing on how other doctors treat me. I think if I'd just sat down and put up with all the pain, and not asked for referrals to various specialists to try and get  to the bottom of all the pain I was in,  she would never have written this. Only good thing about that Dr is that she has retired now. I know the above isn't an autoimmune disease, but it WAS , and still can be to some extent, a chronic pain issue. Isabella.",

Don't alienate your medical team, rather educate yourself and have questions ready to fire at them, and don't take no for an answer. Make notes on what you want to know, and don't be rushed out of your appointment until you have answers. Have you been given a breast care nurse? I found mine could get into the system, and give me results long before my appointment was due, which cut down on my worrying, and got answers for me. If you have a bc nurse lean on her, she will be able to get you quickly to a psychologist, trained to help bc patients. (I was seeing a psychologist within a month of having my mastectomy, and it DID help)  Things today are much better than they were 20 years ago, we have moved on, and treatments are so much more advanced.
