I know the MRI report says the right breast demonstrates a large heterogeneous mass involving a 7.5cm area and i have an enlarged level one axillary lymph node which is necrotic and measures 4cm and an enlarged level 2 node partially deep to the pectoralis minor muscle. WHAT is this? Does anyone know who I go to so I may get this in a language I can understand?",
