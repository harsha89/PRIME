I am 53, in menopause, never had a mammogram come back badly where I had to get a 2nd one. Had a stereotactic biopsy to check the area. Diagnosed with a benign (non-cancerous) radial scar. The imaging doctor who did the biopsy said I should have the small area removed within a month and that 90% of the time the tissue comes back with nothing else to worry about. My OB/GYN I've gone to for over 10 years says I don't need another surgery to remove the area and just go back in 1 year for another mammogram, but gave me the name of a breast surgeon to consult. Need advice - i have so many questions.. What kind of surgeon should I do a consult with - one that is familiar with cancer and breast surgery (like an oncologist), should I get a 2nd opinion, will I get cancer if I don't remove this small area.. feel frustrated and scared. If the likelihood is 10% that it comes back with an issue, why are they requesting I get this removed? I don't know if I should go through this surgery if I don't need it, but also want to prevent any issues. I wonder how many women have had to go through this radial scar removal, and what % of them ended up having issues after. If any of you wonderful ladies have any input I sure would appreciate it.

I have a surgical consult on Monday. Not looking forward to possible surgery and costs, but hoping for the best and NO more to do. God bless!",
