My first prosthesis (a size 09/D) was an Amoena \"temperature controlled\" model (can't remember #).  It was heavy and by the end of the day, I just wanted it away from me.  Last January I replaced it with a somewhat lighter Amoena model, but I still don't like it.  I've gone to several stores (Nordstrom, specialty boutiques, etc.) and they tell me the fit of both the bra and prosthesis are correct, so that's not the problem.  I don't like it because: a) it's still noticeably heavy on my chest wall, b) it often migrates toward my remaining boob, and c) when I lie down while wearing it, it sits up firm while my own sags to the side.  (You wouldn't think you do much lying down in public, but you'd be surprised.  I have this horrible photo of me last year lying back to kiss the Blarney stone and all you see is this big protruding mound!)  Not the fault of the prosthesis, but I also only have cleavage on one side (kinda odd in bathing suits or certain tops). My girlfriend went through a breast reduction this summer and raves about the results, so I started thinking about a reduction on the remaining boob.  But 3 weeks ago, I had \"abnormal\" results on the mammo screening and even though they don't think there is any cancer, I've realized that I don't want to go through this \"what if\" anymore and I'm now discussing a prophylactic mast with my onc surgeon.  She totally supported my decision 3 years ago to not have recon, but she also knows that I have not been happy with the prosthesis. She recommended a consult with a PS.  I loved the guy (empathic, took lots of time to explain everything) and came away considering reconstruction on both sides.  But then I remembered all the reasons why I chose not to recon the first time around--major surgeries, and the associated risks, to implant or rearrange my healthy (accept for the cancer) body, pain, discomfort with the idea of having foreign objects in me, pain, horror stories I read on discussion boards, did I mention pain?  So here I am back in a discussion board, reading your posts, and wondering what to do.  I think I'm really ok with flat-chestedness at home, with friends, out and about in the neighborhood, but I'm not so cavalier at work.  I teach at a university and there are 20 pairs of eyes staring at me as I stand in front of the classroom.  It may be a projection, but I swear that when they are bored with the lecture, they all spend their class time judging my appearance (oh, that sounds really narcissistic!).  If I eventually get beyond this self-consciousness, then boobless it shall be, but right now I can't imagine being flat-chested at work.  If I don't opt for recon, this means TWO falsies and I already don't like the one!!!  Common sense tells me I can get smaller, lighter falsies, but are they really comfortable???  Anyone else go through this \"hate the falsies\" issue and come out happy?  Sorry for the long, long post, but I really needed to get this off my chest (haha!) today.",
