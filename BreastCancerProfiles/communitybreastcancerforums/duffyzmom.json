I bumped up my Xanax to 2 tablets and was able to get a good night sleep. Although that meant sleeping through a dose of Compazine. So I woke a little nauseous. Took the Compazine and then went ahead at the 8 hour mark and did another Zofran. Hopefully that will help. Also doing my Ginger Green tea this morning. And since mouth sores started early last round already have my baking soda ready and will try to alternate it with the Biotene all day. The good news is the headaches I'd been having are gone. I had stopped wearing my retainer and bite guard due to the dry mouth issues but started it back when they subsided. I guess I'm going to have to figure out a way to at least where the bite guard. Maybe I can get the Xylomelts situated above it. At least I can stop worrying about brain mets for a while. For my eye issues I've been just using the rehydration drops I usually use with my contacts. I may try and get into Eye Dr if it doesn't get better. I hate to be vain but I love my glasses just not on a bald person. May need to order some cute cheap ones to go with new look. Or get some daily contacts I can were on special days and just toss.",

My MO was encouraging a month between final chemo and radiation starting. Like you I have a vacation that I'm trying to work around. So as long as I finish radiation by Canadian Thanksgiving I'll be happy. Yes I'm on blood thinners Xarelto- which holy cow is expensive! I've got great insurance and my copay for 3 weeks is over $50. I don't think this will affect my treatment at all but I guess I'll have to wait and see what MO says when I see him before Round #4. I know this clot has been around for at least 4 weeks so I'm not too concerned - although now I'm concerned about being on the blood thinners long term. Neulasta pain seemed much worse this time but I'm wondering if that is also from the addition of the Xarelto.",

Funny thing is on the drive down my oncologist called to say the ER Dr had said my bloodwork was good but when he saw my results Friday he said if he knew my Neutrophils were that low he would have admitted me to the hospital. But talking to me on the phone he could tell I was feeling good so he was satisfied with the antiobotics and said I only need to go to hospital if I ran a fever again. No fever and I'm finally feeling good. I had one Neutropenic Fever during my last chemo so maybe I'll be one and done again.

Because I'm feeling good like most of us in the final days before next round, I've been what I call chemo nesting. Getting houses clean shopping done etc. I may have overdone it though. I developed a little lymphedema but what is strange it isn't in the side where my lymph nodes were removed but the opposite arm. I'll discuss it with MO this week but I'm concerned it is caused by the chemo or possible my port placement causing a blockage in the lymph system. Luckily I had a sleeve on hand and had a massage already schedule for this weekend. She did a little lymphatic drainage and arm is definitely improved from where it was.

Hubby was concerned but I reminded him last go around I also dealt with a lot of emotional issues as treatment was ending. I think it is a little more difficult due to winter here.

GAW - sorry to hear Bryce ended up with a cold on top of it all. I'm guessing the coughing is a good thing though. I know when my mom had her bypass deep breathing and coughing was encouraged. Happy New Year All! Looking forward to a better 2019. Of course starting it with a Herceptin infusion early on the 2nd. Who needs champagne? ;-) ",

Of course when I found this breast lump I was the patient who responded thank goodness when I got the BC diagnosis. For me I couldn't even fathom a benign result and BC was a better outcome than a recurrence of lymphoma because if my lymphoma had returned stem cell transplant would have been my only option. I know it sounds silly but one reason I selected lumpectomy was I felt that if I had a recurrence of BC then I'd have the option of double mastectomy and with my chemo history chemo options will be limited from here on out.",

I've also stocked up on old fashioned prunes (one of the few things that worked for me last time. Stool softeners are really important to include because if not once your bowels start moving it will be like passing cement and hemrorrhoids are a big possibility.

I swear people got tired of listening to me gripe and complain about it but seriously even with Senokot S it was like pooping cement. This time I had Senokot S, MiraLax and prunes on hand. Sometimes it takes trial and error to see what works. My follow-up with oncologist went really well. Counts almost in normal range so hopefully if CBC blood test doesn't show anything unusual I'm a go for Round #2 on Tuesday. He offered to lower my Taxotere dosage but I told him let's assume it was some funky bacterial or viral infection and hopefully it will be better this time. If not, I'll let him lower it next time. FYI finally saw Infinity War......I think I'm going to need to see it again to process all the information.",

Still able to wake for dog and me potty breaks which also allowed me to continue with my alternating nausea meds throughout the night.

But since it is on the opposite of my node removal she thought watch and wait was sufficient. Deborah - sorry you had a bad nurse. (let's face it they do exist). This time around I'm definitely more all business. I closely watch my meds and ring for a nurse as soon as bag empties.

More than likely the clot is due to port placement. Unfortunately, 8 years ago when I had cancer it was also in my right breast (not BC but lymphoma) so when I had more port then it also had to be on the left. Scar tissue was an issue this time placing the port so best guess is that is why I have a clot. Not sure how much monitoring they will do. Swelling in my arm had been coming and going last 4 weeks so I'm not too concerned. I'm sure we will reevaluate after the initial 3 week course of Xarelta. And I'm expecting to hear from my MO. Funny thing is the Oncologist on on-call last night is my least favorite at that practice. I had to see him once during my previous cancer and Hubby and I called his downer doctor because he was all doom and gloom compared to my MO who was the most optimistic guy around.

One less thing to worry about for you. As for the colonscopy did your MO agree on the timing. I can remember the last time I had chemo my MO didn't want me to have my pap during a certain timeframe following chemo for fear I get a false positive. I would assume there are risks for that with colonoscopy as well. I'm due for my 2nd colonoscopy because I had my first at 45 due to my previous cancer and in that one they found precancerous polyps. Honestly at this point I told my GP I think I need a break from cancer screenings because I'm not sure I'd agree to chemo for a third time. Maybe I'll feel differently after I'm finished with the SEs from this time. Speaking of SEs is anyone still dealing with nail issues from the Taxotere. I have 5 nails that still have about 4-6 weeks left of growth before I'm past the damaged area. It's a pain because even keeping them short and polished they break and then catch on everything. Engine - glad to hear you and Janice avoided the storm. We unfortunately didn't get to see son this year for Thanksgiving and I have my fingers crossed that winter weather cooperates so that we can all be together in Florida for Christmas.",

Fortunately or unfortunately depending on how you look at it. My implant has ruptured (probably a result of the radiation). Luckily, my office moved quickly and also during my drive I got scheduled in with my PS for not only a consult March 12th but also implant exchange surgery March 29th. I'm relieved it isn't a tumor but not looking forward to another surgery. The good news is it is a pretty easy fix and it won't affect my treatment schedule.

Hubby used to say he was buying one and would ride it to son's high school graduation but he's lost multiple friends and work acquaintances so that dream ended, thankfully. Ingerp - my apologies for the cold weather, I'm pretty sure we sent it your way. I thought it was just Mother Nature's way of taking care of me. She knew I'd be struggling with Dr's orders to take it easy following the implant exchange so she dumped a couple of inches of snow on us this weekend. Much easier to just lay around when April looks more like December. I'm hoping to get out for a walk today. If it hits 45 degrees I'm heading outside. We left my car in Michigan following surgery so I've been pretty much trapped in apartment. Although my daughter says Mom its London Ontario you have uber and public transportation you are not trapped at home. 😂 My birthday is April 13th (not a Friday this year) and I may watch Aquaman that day as a gift to myself but please post a hottie anyway. Fun factoid about my immediate family (Husband, Daughter, Son and I) in nonleap years we celebrate our birthdays on the same day of the week. Son's birthday is in Feb so that's why it doesn't work that year. Sorry that kind of stuff brings the nerd out in me. Anyone else participating in the Suncoast study? I received a giant envelope last time I was home requesting I participate in the study. It's called SCUSF 1102 \"A Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Interventions to Enhance Utilization of Genetics Services Among Breast Cancer Services\". Considering this is my 2nd cancer I'm all about the research and genetic connection. Interesting filling out the survey to see in print that Paternal Grandfather, Paternal Great Aunt and Paternal Uncle all passed from different types of cancer. Of course I've always said I was a daddy's girl but definitely looks like there is some connection. Even though I was BRCA negative one of my doctor's notes stated \"Previous genetic testing showed a variant of uncertain significance.\" Not sure if I mentioned it previously but I'm waiting on 23andMe results so it will be interesting to see what shows up. I already passed color blindness to my son , hopefully that is the worst of it.",

All shocked to see me returning after 7 years. Good news is Dr and nurses say TCH will be much easier than the RCHOP I had previously. Adriamycin is just plan awful and I send light and love to all of you enduring that evil red beast. Tuesday I had my MUGA and now I know why they don't want me to have anymore Adriamycin. 8 years ago when I had my initial MUGA my score was 75. I'm now a 65. I guess it could be aging etc but my guess is that's the permanent irreversible damage that the red devil is known for. Yesterday was port placement. All went well. I pretty much Hydrocodeined the afternoon away and woke feeling much better this morning. I'm starting to line up my chemo buddies (Saving hubby taking vacation days for only if needed). Djt-- Yes it is comforting to know we can be starting together. Glad you found some options for head covers. Me I dyed my hair rose gold Monday. I plan to be a red head by the time hubby shaves my head this time. Nothing like knowing you'll be losing your hair to give you an excuse to try a color you've always wanted to try. Those of you battling mouth issues. Ice chips can be a great relief. This time I bought a countertop ice maker that makes easily chewable ice chips. Also, see if your cancer center will call I a script for the Ann Arbor mouthwash. My brother was working at a children's cancer center last time I went through treatment and the nurses there swore by it. Different parts of the country call it different things but its a mix of ingredients that really do help with mouth sores.",

Sweet potatoes, quinoa, beans and avocado. Trying to finish up a lunch to take with my tomorrow and remembering that the food I ate during my last first treatment I avoided for a long time after it. Today I had a teeth cleaning and came home with a lot of goodies that should help with mouth issues. She gave me sample sizes Bioteen which will be great in my chemo bag, XyliMelts which are little discs that help with dry mouth issues and something called MI Paste Plus ( its a fluoride paste which I'll hold of using until my next oncologist appt).

I bought Pedialyte yesterday and have added that and chicken broth to help with electrolytes. My memory from past chemo is every round is a little different but based around a similar outline. Mainly bad days/good days but side effects may vary. Of course this time around I was prepared for awful constipation because that is what I had with my last chemo drugs. Now I\"m stocked up on all things diarrhea and maybe next round will be constipation.

Urdago - I ordered those melts on Amazon but I think you can find them at CVS. FD sorry the mouth issues have got you. Mine have thankfully subsided some although yesterday my ginger tea which had been tasting okay tasted like battery acid. If the rinses and melts don't do the trick call the oncologist for the magic mouth wash.

A PR for me at Disney since the first time I did it in 2013 it was the hottest on record. and My finish was 6:45. Disney is fun but not great for getting good results. My first marathon I did before cancer was 4:45 finish. I seriously should have just stopped then. Kudos for your daughter cheering you on in that cold weather. I love the idea of doing a Goofy or Dopey but I'd never be able to do that many early morning wake ups. I may give the band aid a try. Although I kind of like the excuse to just take it easy. Marie- I also have more dry itchy eyes than watery. But it is my main seasonal allergy season. Oncologist is letting me add my Flonase for a bit to see if that helps. I haven't been able to wear my contacts for a few weeks. Dina- sorry to hear you are having it hard. The added stress of move changing doctors is probably making everything a little worse. Chemo does have cumulative effects so that could be some of it. Are your blood counts in a decent range? I always feel the absolute worst at the low point and then it slowly gets better. ",

The shop I went to has wigs, head coverings and mastectomy bras/ swimsuits etc. Such a wonderful environment. I left feeling empowered and ready to face anything. Duffy is just stable right now. I'll be taking him back to Vet when I'm over in Michigan for my next MO appt and preinfusion blood work. My guess is the spot on his lung will still be there. Although he's eating (mostly hamburger) walks are a struggle for him. Yesterday I ended up carrying him back from our walk. GAWarrior - I'm considering trying a little baby run today. I got the itch because daughter ran another marathon over the weekend and I was having runner envy. I mainly want to see how my feet handle the impact. Right now the burning sensation isn't too bad. I've invested in good socks (bombas) and a new orthopedic pair of sandals and am trying not to barefoot much. DJT- I hope your are also enjoying this feel good week before round #3. I get so exciting thinking I\"m close to the halfway mark for chemo. I know the year of Herceptin will be more of an inconvenience than anything.

Logistics questions for those of us moving from chemo to radiation? I had assumed radiation would start after the end of the final 21 day cycle. I guess I am assuming they wouldn't start radiation when your system is still in the low point following chemo. Anyone know if that is the case?",

There are so many what ifs and research is lacking for those of us with hormone receptor negative tumors. Did your MO have any other options to alleviate the neuropathy? Udrago- I did not ring the bell following my final chemo. I just couldn't do it whenever I considered it during my final round I thought about how happy I was when I left the cancer center 8 years ago. I had vowed I'd never do chemo again but low and behold the cancer had different plans for me. Plus, I'll still be getting my targeted therapy every 21 days for the next 7 months. I haven't notice eczema but I developed a rash on my chest following the last round that hasn't gone away. It's more annoying than anything. That plus my left arm is swollen again. I'm hoping getting my port out next week will eliminate that. Count me in on the sticky eyes - I wake up every morning with my eyes stuck shut. Originally I thought it was because I quit using my claritan so I started that back up again but I haven't noticed any difference. ",

Even then there are only a few pair of shoes/sock combinations that work for longer walks. Anything too intense and my feet really start to bother me. Ingerp or any of you other ladies who have already moved onto Herceptin alone or Herceptin/Perjeta infusions....any tips for success. Tomorrow is my first Herceptin infusion. At my center there are no premeds just the targeted therapy. I'm wondering if I should take a Benadryl or Zofran before hand. Busy day here as I will be living in Michigan full time during radiation so I'm trying to get packed up and this house prepared for Hubby. We're going to try to alternate weekends back and forth. Fingers crossed the plan for radiation hasn't changed and I'll be done in only 3 or 4 weeks. Left arm has been bad again this weekend so I'm hoping my port removal Wednesday solves the edema for once and for all.",

My oncologist was such a treat he said \"Really how many eggs do you have left at this point?\" What a peach. Thankfully hot flashes only lasted 18 months or so for me. Udrago - I sure am hoping you only had a virus. Any chance your fever etc is due to the neutropenia ? GAWarrior - the cruise had booze that helped with keeping my news to myself. And yes MUGA is for heart. Like you when I had Adriamycin last time I only had the Scan before treatment. I never had a final scan. I think had I been having shortness of breath or symptoms they would have but I didn't. The Herceptin can cause heart issues as well but thankfully those are reversible. I seem to be losing between 2-3% with each scan (they scan every 3 mos). but I'm still above the 50% mark where they delay treatment so I think I'll be able to finish treatment. Last night I pulled up my scan from 2010. I was at 75.8% then I'm now down to 58.1%. ( I was at 65% at the beginning of chemo this time). My MO said the difference between 2010 and 2018 could be attributed partly to aging. Stay warm all. We're in Michigan this weekend and it is COLD.",

According to my oncologist my 1.9cm is just shy of the 2cm required for Perjeta. Or at least I thought that was the reasoning. I also was borderline HER2+ IHC came back negative but FISH was positive by a small margin so maybe that also played into the standard of care. I split my time between London, Ontario and Michigan but am receiving treatment in Michigan because I had previous cancer treatment there 7.5 years ago. All in first round went well. Slight problem with port (nurse's guess is scar tissue from previous chemo) so I had to use a pump this time. So 7 hours at cancer center yesterday added some to fatigue. I started Zofran 12 hours post premeds just to be safe. Recalling last chemo I woke in the night very ill and vomiting. Once again I woke at 2am nauseous so I added the Compazine. I plan to continue alternating the two until my Neulasta OnPro infusion this afternoon because I had it placed on my belly and worry vomiting could interfere with that.",

I'm going to definitely look into the Gas-X since I've now had two episodes of bowel incontinence and am almost afraid to leave the house. I've been on Imodium for 4 days and still diarrhea. Today I'm going to try and stick to the BART diet and see if that helps. Anyone with advice on the bowel incontinence ? I'm seriously considering getting some adult diapers or pads.",
