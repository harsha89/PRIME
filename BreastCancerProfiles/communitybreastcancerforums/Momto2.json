I am 49 years old survivor 18 years I was diagnosed in 1989 31 years old with a 1 year old and 2 1/2 old and married 4 years wow that seems crazy to say now and I had just started a new job that I had a 4 year commitment to. And needless to say ended up being 8 years because after my diagnosis (stage 2 Breast Cancer) I couldn't get insurance without selling everything we owned to pay the premiums. But your Post caught my eye because of the Zoloft - I ended up with depression problems about 10 out of Breast Cancer which seemed really weird because for many it is really a chemical imbalance - If it had anything to do with stress in my case I think I would have had it closer to my diagnosis!   But Zoloft worked for a while for me but as I had slipped some while on it- I am on Wellbutrin and Celexa combination now.  It is really working for me.  I can relate because the transition it HELL - It takes time for the medication to work for me they wanted me to wait 3 weeks before they would give up on the medicine and try something else.  3 weeks of laying around and trying to just put one foot in front of the other is a Looooong Time. Maybe you Can look into a new Doctor or sometimes just getting to see someone else in the same group can be a good transition.  You are  in my prayers.    Debbie",
