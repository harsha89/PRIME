The process is to be cast with a paper mache like substance in your bra with prosthesis and then again against your chest wall and then the prosthesis is made from the 2 casts to exactly match your chest wall. There are options for skin tone,nipple tone, raised or flat nipple, joined or unjoined,with or without flaps which can be cut down when received. They are marketed to be worn with or without adhesive. I don't use it. I am satisfied with the aesthetics and how my uneven chest walls is now evened out. It takes getting used to a rubbery feel against your skin because the material is surgical grade silicone foam and not a gel.They are much more durable than gel forms which can puncture and leak. No more skin problems at the moment. I love than I can wear non-mastectomy bras with them. Let me know if you have more questions.",

I love the way my RI's look and can wear them without the adhesive in \"bralets\" and some other seamless styles. Every now and then I get a skin reaction of little blisters, sometimes in clusters, under the flaps. I have resisted trimming the flaps because while this is an option, the flaps work to hold the forms in place under the bra band. Has anyone else info to share on this kind of skin response to Radiant Impressions? Thanks,",
