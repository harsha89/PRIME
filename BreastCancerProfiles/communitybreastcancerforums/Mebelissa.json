They called it a lumpectomy and an excision biopsy, but I think it is more often called excision biopsy when you have not been diagnosed.  Mine came back benign and just some abnormal tissue, but nothing else.  It was not quite as bad as I thought.  I am still sore but am doing much better now that I know. Good luck to you and I hope all turns out well!",
