It was the meds my doctor prescribed to prevent nausea and vomiting. It's called Zofran (generic is Ondansetron). My doctor prescribed Imitrex (generic is Sumatriptan) for the headaches. It's prescribed for migraine headaches (migraine headaches often cause vomiting). It worked well for me. By the 2nd round of chemo, my body adjusted to Zofran. I could take it without getting the headaches. You don't have to suffer. Be sure to call or email your oncologist about the headaches, and ask if Imitrex might work for you. Be sure to follow some of the chemo threads here on BCO. I know of others who have gotten headaches and nausea. They, too, will suggest remedies for you during chemo. Best of luck. Hope you feel better soon. You are not alone. Meg",

You had just discovered the study, posted it, and were very excited. You knew years ago that Toradol/Ketorolac would be of great interest to BC patients. You even said someone needs to get the word out about how well it works against recurrences if used BEFORE the incision. I'll bet the information about Toradol is being suppressed due to liability issues concerning the rare possibility of increased bleeding. Anyway, I just want to thank you for the wealth of information you provide to all of us. The studies you post along with your own knowledge from being a medical professional is more than valuable. And I must add, your writing style is quite entertaining. Keep it up. Meg",

I also chewed on ice during each infusion. The nurses appreciated the CryoMax ice packs because they don't drip and stay frozen, and they are easy to put on hands and feet. They come with velcro to wrap around your hands and feet. Just go to the Amazon website and type CryoMax Ice Packs into the search bar. The size of these particular ice packs is approx 6\" by 6\" square. This is a good size to wrap around hands and feet. As I recall they came with 2 per package so I bought 2 packages for a total of 4 ice packs to cover 2 hands and 2 feet. It cost about $20 total. Wishing you the best of luck with your infusions.

The professionalism of this team of doctors is superb. I'm in good hands with them. As for the x-ray routine that some of you discussed, I get them weekly. They line me up everyday by looking through a viewer on the radiation machine, then move me until everything lines up correctly.

The RO said we'll resume treatment (boosts) next week to give me time to heal. Yesterday I searched the boards here on BCO and found a group of women from Europe who were exchanging ideas on how to relieve the stinging and itching from rads. Several of their doctors told them to stop everything except Aloe Vera. After gently applying Aloe Vera on clean skin in the radiated area, then sprinkle corn starch on the entire area and gently pat it around. I tried it last night and it worked immediately. SUCH A RELIEF! This morning when I woke up, it was almost healed. I only had a tiny sensation of itching. I highly recommend it, and hope this helps those of you who might experience severe stinging, itching and raw areas. Feline, I'm keeping you in my prayers. Please keep us posted.

I'm so glad everything is moving along smoothly for all of you except for those dealing with saroma draining, scar lumps, rashes, etc. Regarding the saroma draining, do they biopsy the fluid to check for cancer cells? I've been walking and hiking to build strength. I'm noticing I'm less short of breath each time I take a walk. The hikes are helping with balance issues. I didn't realize how bad my balance had become until I tried to navigate a few small hillsides near my home. Each day I \"take on\" a steeper hillside just to challenge my body and build-up muscles and bones so I can better tolerate the AI. If any of you have a plan for preserving bones and muscles while taking hormonals, please post about it. I would appreciate all ideas. Maybe we should start a new thread about bone and muscle strengthening. Petey - Sorry to hear about your reaction to Taxol. I had a similar reaction to Taxotere. My MO took me off Taxotere. Apparently a rash is considered a major SE of taxanes. I moved on to AC. BTW, your new hair growth looks impressive. Lucky you! Upward and onward girls! Meg",

I now have two tatoos and a few other marks. The tatoos are about the size of a pin head. The tech immediately wiped the tatoos with rubbing alcohol so the ink wouldn't leave much of a mark. I'll be laying on my back for the rads, but I won't have to hold my breath even though the cancer was on the left breast. Apparently new technology protects the heart and lungs. At first I refused rads due to all the bad experiences I heard about from others who have been through it, and because the radiation facility was at least an hour from where I live. However, my doctor arranged for a facility closer to home, and as it turned out I felt a very good connection with my RO and the technicians. They explained every little thing they would be doing .... and why they would be doing it. As far as lotions and creams, they said they would provide everything needed as the treatment progresses. I already have pure Aloe Vera Gel and Aquaphor as a backup if needed. Next week I'll have a CT scan. After that I start treatment. So here we are girls! Let's get this party started. I'm looking forward to hearing about how each of you are doing throughout your radiotherapy. All of your tips and tricks will be much appreciated.",

Like Veeder said, the first day seems to be the worst. Today was treatment 7 of 21 for me. Still nothing to report such as discoloration and discomfort. I'm not even pink yet. It makes me wonder if the machine is working properly. Nancy, I have the State of Nevada on my chest too, along with tape and tats. Petey, I'm sorry you're already sore and tender in the treatment area. We truly are all different in the way our bodies respond to treatment. Try to stay on top of the discomfort before it gets worse. For those of you who are feeling fatigue during rads, I read on another thread that consuming 50-60g of protein per day during radiation treatment really helps. That is a lot of protein. Quinoa and Chia seeds are high in protein so I've been adding Chia seeds to everything including my morning smoothie. I add Quinoa and Chia seeds to my salads at lunch, and with anything for dinner. I searched online to figure out how to properly cook Quinoa, and found some yummy recipes. I also added a low sugar, high protein drink called \"Muscle Milk\" (from Target) to my morning smoothies. So far all this protein has actually helped to keep the fatigue away. However, the nurse at the rads facility said no one escapes fatigue by the end of treatment. I'm just waiting for it to kick in. I have felt some back pain, but I've always had that. Apparently exercise such as stretching and walking is supposed to help with fatigue, so I've been sitting at the computer stretching my arms and shoulders. Don't laugh! That's at least some movement for this ancient body. Many ladies on BCO talk about running marathons, walking everyday, lifting weights, etc. I'm just happy to be alive and awake.",

My skin went from bad to worse last week. I was miserable. The RO looked at it and immediately wrote an rx for Silverdene. The Silverdene helped, but it increased the stinging. The RO said we'll resume treatment (boosts) next week to give me time to heal. Yesterday I searched the boards here on BCO and found a group of women from Europe who were exchanging ideas on how to relieve the stinging and itching from rads. Several of their doctors told them to stop everything except Aloe Vera. After gently applying Aloe Vera on clean skin in the radiated area, then sprinkle corn starch on the entire area and gently pat it around. I tried it last night and it worked immediately. SUCH A RELIEF! This morning when I woke up, it was almost healed. I only had a tiny sensation of itching. I highly recommend it, and hope this helps those of you who might experience severe stinging, itching and raw areas. Feline, I'm keeping you in my prayers. Please keep us posted.

There are some cute tops on that site, and they are reasonably priced. I think I might purchase a few. How are you feeling today? It sounds like you have some issues with back and neck pain. Those are my weak areas too. The only thing that works for me is Advil or other anti-inflamatories. I always take them with food to prevent stomach upset. If I take more than 2 a day, I need Pepcid AC. If it's not one thing it's another. DanderRN, The techs at my rads center said there is often a small amount of \"scatter\", but it's much less than several years ago. Yesterday I read about some women who are experiencing distant nerve and muscle problems decades after radiation. I wish radiologists would warn us about these risks before we start treatment. I realize the alternative of not doing these treatments carries more risk, but it would be good to know what could happen so we can take steps to lesson the damage. The good news is most of these nerve and muscle problems can be resolved with physical therapy. I, too, will have the shorter radiation protocol with only 15 sessions of rads, and 5 boosts at the end. I was told the dose of radiation is a bit higher for each session which is why it takes fewer sessions. Apparently this protocol is common in Canada. From what I've read here on BCO, those who have the shorter protocol experience about the same amount of skin tenderness as those on the longer protocol. Petey, Most of my chemo buddies said that radiation is much easier than chemo. If we made it through chemo, rads will be a walk in the park. You and I have had a similar treatment plan and diagnosis, including lymph node involvement. The techs did not put any tape, tatoos, or marks my neck, back, or shoulders. Most marks were at the tumor site and under my arm. Your treatment site will probably depend on the location of your tumor, and the location of the nodes that tested positive. Keep us posted.  ",

I had my first of 20 sessions of radiation today. It was so easy I almost fell asleep. Before the actual radiation started, the tech drew more marks on my chest. I noticed he didn't draw anything in my armpit area so I asked him why not. He said they only draw markings in the armpit if someone had node involvement. I told him I had all lymph nodes removed because 3 nodes tested positive for cancer. He was surprised because he didn't see any scar in or near my arm pit. My scar is barely visible thanks to my excellent surgeon. Anyway, he finally found the scar and put markings in that area. Then I asked him how protect the thyroid, heart and lung. He graciously explained how they protect the heart and thyroid. However, he said the upper portion of my lung will receive radiation due to where my tumor was located within my breast. Holy crap!!! My MO, RO & BS never told me this. My point of telling you about this is to emphasize the importance of being your own advocate throughout your treatment. You must assist your medical team even if it drives them nuts. Fortunately, my tech is knowledgeable, kind, and honest. He owned-up to not knowing about the node involvement, and he was honest about the breast tumor proximity to my lung. In spite of these surprises, the radiation treatment itself was like a walk in the park. Hope you all have a restful night, and please know I appreciate reading your posts everyday. Your experiences and tips have been helpful more than you'll ever know. Peace out, Meighan ",

Maybe I read your post incorrectly. Anyway, when you start radiation it's not bad at all the first couple of weeks. Chemo is much worse than rads for the most part. I had Taxotere and Adriamycin so I cannot speak from experience about Taxol. I've heard Taxol and Taxotere are similar because they are both taxanes. Personally, Taxotere hit me harder than Adriamycin (aka Red Devil because it's a tough drug), but we all have different reactions to various drugs. Did you doctor prescribe good anti nausea meds and steroids to cope with SEs? Most of us end up dancing between diarrhea & constipation. And then there's the fatigue, brain fog, and taste buds that seem to last longer than the other SEs. Let us know more about how you're feeling on Taxol so we can give you suggestions, and of course sympathize with you. I'm sure you have seen the thread on Taxol. If not, take a look at it. Anyway, I'm glad you found this thread because you're starting the rads journey with us. Are you planning to have 33 radiation treatments or the 21 treatment protocol?",

Glad to hear all of you are doing well so far with your rads. Have any of you started hormone therapy? I haven't started yet because I want to wait until after radiation is completed.

It is wonderful for the skin, has no scent, and it moisturizes. It cost $10 for the largest size which will last a long time past rads. The only other product that most ROs seem to agree upon Aquaphor. I notice other women have had good luck with PURE AloeVera, but a few doctors warn that it may cause irritation. If you experience skin irritation, Lidocaine seems to be the way to go. Your RO will prescribe it to you if you need it. I found an AloeVera Spray with Lidocaine at Walmart, but it has inactive ingredients that could be forms of alcohol which ROs instruct against. I bought it anyway. I also bought 1% hydrocortizone cream to help with skin that itches. I have heard that Miaderm Cream is good as well as Calendula cream. Miaderm cream is a bit expensive, but it has worked very well for some ladies on BCO who just finished radiation.",

I understand how frustrating all the scans, xrays, and tests can be. In addition to being expensive (even with insurance), they are time consuming and uncomfortable, but necessary to get the right diagnosis. Please keep us posted so we can guide through these frustrations. This is a good place to vent ;-) Meg101",

I'm not Triple Negative, but I am 70 yrs old and recently finished a chemo treatment plan which is similar to your treatment plan. Mine included Adriamycin and Taxotere instead of Taxol. Taxotere & Taxol are similar because they are both Taxanes). Both are considered strong, which is a good thing, and I breezed through both chemos with few side effects. The key is to make sure you oncologist prescribes good meds, and take them as prescribed. For example, even if you don't feel nauseous, take the anti-nausea meds on time. If you wait until you feel nauseous, it will be too late. As you read through the various threads, you'll find great tips on how to keep SEs at bay. You will likely lose your hair approx 14 days after the first infusion of chemo. We are all here for you, so don't hesitate to ask questions. Wishing you the best. Oh, by the way, I like your name \"sillyoldrabbit\".",

Ask your MO to prescribe Emend for nausea for the first 3 days, then Zofran for the next few days. I never waited for nausea to hit. I took the meds before I had any symptoms. Stay ahead of the meds and you'll be fine. I had heart issues a few years ago long before I had the Red Devil, but have had no heart problems since. The Red Devil is your friend. I had some fatigue and brain fog, my eyes and nose were runny, I lost my hair, but that's about it. BTW, take the steroids as prescribed. Personally I loved the steroids because they gave me energy. I preferred the Red Devil to Taxotere, but even Taxotere wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Just make sure if you are given any Taxanes for Chemo, that you ice your toes and fingers before and during your infusion. I used CryoMax ice packs because they stay frozen for eight hours. No need to deal with melting ice. I bought them online from Amazon for about $20.00 total. I don't have any neuropathy or finger nail problems. To avoid mouth sores, chew ice during all infusions. Then when you get home, rinse your mouth several times a day with some salt and baking soda. Expect your taste buds to be \"off\" for about a week. If you still feel tired 2 weeks after chemo, increase your water and protein intake.",
