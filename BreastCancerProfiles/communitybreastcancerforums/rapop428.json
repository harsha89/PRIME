I feel really bad about complaining because I know that there are women out that there that weren't as lucky as myself but it really sucks!  I'm tired of being in pain...I'm tired of hot flashes, mood swings, hips hurting.  I'm tired of it all.  I just want my old life back.  Thanks for letting me vent.  Robin",
