So I have 2 confirmed..one peripheral and one centrally located on the same breast.  I went to a breast surgeon a couple of weeks ago and am scheduled for surgery to have these removed next Thursday.  At the time of my appt with the surgeon I told him of another much smaller nodule that I feel close to the one in the nipple area and he said he did see some slight dimpling that I have noticed too.    He said he would mark and remove both of these.  He did say they definitely needed to come out as there is still a 15% chance there may be cancer close by even though the biopsies were b9.  The dimpling thing has somewhat scared me... nowhere can I find that this is a symptom of b9 papillomas...so I was wondering if anyone else has ever heard of this or had it in association with a papilloma.  Also, for the peripheral papilloma I have to have a wire inserted the morning of the surgery at 7:30 am and the surgery is at another place at 1:30pm.  Is this process more or less along the same lines as the biopsies pain wise? Thanks ",

      "Content": "Kintexas wrote: Hello Ladies, This is my first post here but I have been lurking for about a month and would like to say thank you for the wonderful information I have found here.  I need somewhere to get this all out and try to get some of my sanity back.   I really don't have anyone to talk to IRL since it seems to weird everyone out when I mention this ordeal or how I feel about what has been going on.   I'm really scared and this has been a really long 6 weeks.  I don't think it going to be over any time soon either but I guess I will know in a couple of weeks.  This is what has been going on...any thoughts, advice or information any of you would like to give would be greatly appreciated. On 10-6-10 I had a routine mammo.  I had not had one for 6 yrs.  I remember getting the order and just never taking the time to have it done.  I'm 44 yrs old by the way.  The office called me back for a diagnostic mammo.  I wasn't worried because I had been called back 6 yrs ago for ultrasound and was told it was nothing.  This time they found some microcalcifications in my left breast that looked suspicious and wanted to do a biopsy.  They scheduled the stereotactic biopsy for 3 weeks out...the waiting was horrible.  During those 3 weeks I found a palpable lump in the same breast but close to the nipple area.  When I went in to have the biopsy I mentioned this to the radiologist and they did an ultrasound of that area.  He basically told me that if the other area came back B9 that he would want to biopsy this lump also.  Well the biopsy results came back as an B9 intraductal papilloma (peripheral).  When the radiologist called to give me the results she said she wanted to do a MRI to make sure there wasn't anything hiding because of where this was located.  She said to hold off on the biopsy of the other lump until after the MRI.  So 11-23-10 I have the MRI...they looked at it that day and stated that they found 2 more areas of concern on my RIGHT breast!  Now they want me to have an ultrasound guided biopsy on the lump in my left breast and a MRI guided biopsy for the two areas on my right breast.  I feel like a pin cushion.  Of course I have to wait 3 more weeks to get in to have these done. They are scheduled for 12-16-10.  About 3 days ago I felt another much smaller lump close to the one in my left breast that they are going to biopsy next week.  I don't know if these are appearing this fast or I am just paying more attention.  I got copies of all my reports to take to my PCP yesterday and found out that the lump on my left breast is BIRADS 4b and the areas on my right breast are BIRADS 4a.  The MRI report also stated that the known papilloma on the left breast did not look solitary.  I am just feeling like my chances of everything coming back B9 are getting slimmer the more that they find.  I also am thinking they will probably want to remove some or all of them so surgery is most likely in the future.  I am hoping they are all B9 papillomas and they very well may be but this waiting is driving me crazy.  Does anyone know if these can appear or grow this quickly?  One of the biopsies I have to have is close to the nipple..while the last one I had wasn't that bad I'm worried this one will be painful due to the location.  Does anyone know if this is true?  Sorry this is so long Thanks for listening.
