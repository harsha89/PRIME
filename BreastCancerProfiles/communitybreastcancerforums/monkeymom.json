I'm doing TCH every 3 weeks. During the last week before round 2, I felt great physically. I went to my kid's activities and ran errands and FELT LIKE A NORMAL PERSON. I wasn't worrying about reoccurence or not living to see my kids grow up. Then, I had round 2 of chemo. While it hasn't been miserable, I'm noticing how much feeling sick makes me FEEL LIKE A SICK PERSON instead of survivor. I've been on the boards looking at stats and reading about metastatic cancer etc. I find myself thinking about not being here for my kids starting kindergarten etc. Funny how when we feel good physically, our minds are good. And vice versa. Guess that's motivation to get out and take a walk!:)",

What in the world??? Is anyone else GROWING hair instead of LOSING it?? Weird.  Of course, that has me worried that chemo isn't working....",

A few days after surgery I started having shooting pains go across my chest from the port. Surgeon said they were muscle spasms and that it may take a while for my body/muscles to adjust to the foreign object. She gave me a muscle relaxer. After a few days, the pain stopped. I've had no issues with it since late March. Speedy4, I have had a ton of new hair growth. Some stranglers mixed in too that are longer but mostly a head of new peach fuzz.

My pain was minimal from the actual surgery. The tissue expanders were very uncomfortable (they have since just become a nuisance) and made it difficult to lay or sit in a comfortable position. My biggest hurdle was lifting. I couldn't lift my 1 year old into his crib, car seat etc. I also couldn't put dishes away in cabinets that required me reaching high up, vaccuum, drive (for a week), walk the dog, and other things that required a large range of motion.  As far as the drains go, I'm a wimp so I didn't want to empty them myself. It took my husband just a few seconds before and after work to drain them. I had 1 in a week and the other in 10 days. They were really no big deal. Glad you have family to help out!",

I go through phases where I let cancer in my life- some days I check this site and other days I just want to pretend I lead a normal life that cancer isn't part of. Same with my support groups- some months I go to the meetings, others I skip and spend the evening with my husband. I'm almost 3 months PFC and eagerly waiting on more hair. Since I'm continuing on Herceptin until next April, I think the hair growth will be slow:( I had my exchange surgery 2 weeks ago and really like my new \"boobs.\" I got the gummy bear implants- since I nursed 2 kids, these are much perkier than what I had before! I also started Tamoxifin about a month ago. Main SE is hot flashes. Otherwise, I'm back to my busy life as mom of two small children. I'm glad to to hear everyone is doing well and I hope everyone will continue to update occasionally as we get farther out.",

Not worried but it's annoying. Indenial, I highly recommend Ativan if you are experiencing anxiety. I know you mentioned taking medicine before. This is probably one of the hardest times in your life and if you need something to help, please consider it- no reason to suffer. It also helps with nausea:) It can be tapered to wean off it. Hope it helps! Oh and I have lots of hair lots of places still too. My bottom eye lashes thinned but started to grow back. Still have my eyebrows and upper eyelashes, hair on my arms, and need to shave my legs every few days. I have a full head of peach fuzz too. Guess everyone's hair loss is different!",

Unfortunately, my MO said no pools this summer \"unless it's in your own backyard.\" He said I could go to the neighborhood pool and not get in...my kids are too young to swim by themselves (almost 2 and 4) so this really isn't a good option either. Was anyone else told that pools are a no-no during chemo? I'm not getting Neulasta (so far) so I don't know if that's part of his concern. Since I'm getting chemo every 3 weeks, I'm wondering if he'd allow me to go during the last week before the next cycle when my counts would be the highest. What else have you been told to avoid this summer? ",

It's gotten a lot worse since I shaved my head (I know we lose the majority of our body heat through our head and feet, but this is ridiculous). It's been in the 80s here and I have to wear a sweatshirt and socks in the house- we keep our house at 75! All the local ladies with breast cancer that I spend time with are all hot. At dinner the other night, all 11 of them were having hot flashes and I was cold!  But then again, I'm the one who is growing hair instead of losing it so maybe I'm just some chemo annomaly!!! ",

I had round #1 of TCH on April 10th and have round #2 next wednesday (may 1st). Today is day 16 for me and after having NO hair loss at all, big handfulls came out in the shower tonight. I knew it was inevitable but still feels weird. I'm ok with not having hair- I'm not ok with looking \"sick\", especially since I feel good right now.  Round #1 I had very few SEs (just a little constipation and fatigue). I tried to stay active because I have a 1 year old son and 3 year old daughter. It upsets my 3 year old when I'm in bed- I think it scares her more than anything.  I didn't have the Neulasta shot the first round. One week later they did my blood counts and they were very low. The nurse told me to stay away from all germs- I had to laugh because I have 2 small kids! I'm guessing they will automatically give me the shot for round two... I'm really glad to have found this thread - I feel like I already know some of you from having read all your experiences over the past month! Hope everyone has a good weekend and is getting rest and taking care of themselves!",
