I am having my port placed on Nov 1 and will start AC on 11/3- every 2 weeks for 8 weeks then Taxol- either weekly or every 2- will see how i do with the Neulasta. I ordered my wig and had my very thick below shoulder length hair chopped into a pixie last night! I am planning on working through treatments- I am supposed to leave for a business trip the Sunday after my first treatment- not sure if that will happen but I'm going to try! Shadowcat- I was told by my MO that I have questionable (scar tissue from all of the CT scans and MRIs during diagnosis)veins on my left side so a port was needed. The chemo nurse also told me that with Adriamycin a port is recommended as it can cause a reaction if it touches your skin. Best wishes to everyone as we continue to prepare...",

I am dealing with my anxiety by shopping- our pantry now looks like Costco :) It looks like we are all on a similar schedule so it will be interesting to see how we are doing with the side effects! Pmevans50 I looked into the wig from my hair (I have a ton of it) and it was going to be over $1000 so I went synthetic (cheaper and no styling needed). Not sure how much I will wear it, my daughter is 10 and I don't want her to feel uncomfortable when I take her to school. She asked to go with me to get my hair cut into a pixie (from below my shoulders) so I took her and we made a date out of it. I found some cute caps and scarves on the TLC (ACS) site and I will check out headcovers.com. Also, I learned that the Heartland cancer foundation sells the chemo caps brand and for every cap you buy, they donate one to someone in need.  I hope everyone has a great day, Kelly",

Luckily, today was better and I made it out for lunch and shopping with my family. My buzzed hair clogged the shower drain this am- I have some sweet bald spots now :). Amw5- I am still working full time. My chemo day is Thursday and I've been able to make it the entire day in the office both fridays after treatment. I'm working from home tomorrow. I just make sure I have plenty of water, a ginger ale and some thin salted pretzels with me at work. My coworkers have been very understanding. On the headache front, my infusion nurse told me that cytoxan can also cause a nasty headache. They ran my infusion over an hour this time (instead of 30 min) and it seemed to help. I hope everyone had a great Sunday! Kelly",
