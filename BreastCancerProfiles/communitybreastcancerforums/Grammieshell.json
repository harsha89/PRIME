Mamo confirmed what I thought they were fluid-filled cysts nothing to worry about. However they did see something up above that looked suspicious so they immediately took me for an ultrasound and as soon as the radiologist read the ultrasounds he said I needed to have a biopsy. What he was seeing were constellations of calcifications and gave me a BIRAD of 4. They sent my scans to a Breast Center who looked at them and told me they didn't see anything to be concerned about and to check back in 6 months. Luckily, I didn't feel comfortable with that, and asked my local doctor if he would do a biopsy or a lumpectomy. I had my lumpectomy 2 weeks ago and found out last Monday that it was indeed cancer. The first words my doctor said to me were \"I am so glad you pushed this because we did find cancer\". So far all I know is it was HER2-, and the mass was a centimeter big, and that they got large clear margins, so they believe they got it all. I have surgery scheduled Wednesday March 8th, for node biopsy, to see if it's spread. And hope to have the estrogen / progesterone results tomorrow. I see everything from lumpectomy with radiation and meds to mastectomy with reconstruction ... How do you decide??? How do you know what's best, I'm completely overwhelmed with all the info and options. I had cancer 12 years ago in my appendix, but it was all removed with an appendectomy, and I didn't need any further treatment. That's great, no one can see my missing appendix, but missing or odd shaped breasts are another thing. I know the most important thing is my life, but I also would like to still look like a woman.
