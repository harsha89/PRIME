Getting in and out of bed was tough the first week. Like mimi32 I set the alarm on my phone so I could take my meds as needed. Don't get behind on your pain pills. The drains caught me by surprise. What a drag. We used big safety pins and pinned them to the inside of my shirts so they weren't hanging... I wore button up shirts and after a few days was able to change in/out of large t-shirts of my husbands. I wasn't sent home with a bra. I was just wrapped up and after a couple of days he took the bandages off and didn't put anything else on the incisions. I thought that was weird. As for showers... We have a bench that is the same height as our tub side. We put it perpendicular to the tub. I laid on that with my head hanging into the tub and my husband washed my hair. Afterwards he wrapped my drains up with my boobs using Saran wrap. I filled the tub a few inches and he bathed me. It was so nice to just sit in warm water and feel clean. Things got better after the drains were removed. The expanders are uncomfortable and never felt a part of me. I only went in once to have mine filled. I stopped at 160cc. That's small but what I wanted. My implants are 213cc and they feel \"more normal\". Don't over due it when it comes to doing things around the house... Baby yourself for a bit. Your chest muscle and body has been through so much. You want to just be careful. Sorry if this sounds like I'm rambling. I'm just trying to write as I remember.",

I visited with my gyno to be checked out as to why I got my period suddenly. I was worried about issues with my lady parts!! They said I can get a full hysterectomy (ovaries and all). A pelvic US indicated one of my ovaries is larger than the other. They did blood work yesterday for CA-125 and will do a endometrial biopsy next week. If all is clear I'll have the hx.  I'm scared. Can any of you share your experience with your hx? It will be robotic laproscopic so I know recovery will be easier than abdominal.  Are you having bladder issues now?

I am wondering what your routine is with yours? My morning routine is to get up and shower (unless I took one the night before), dress, and start getting breakfast made. While eating I usually have time to get some deep breathing done and the exercises before taking my daughter to school. When I get home from that I do the manual drainage. When I wake in the morning my hand is a bit swollen and am thinking I should wait to put the glove and sleeve on till after my exercises and drainage? Oy, I'm just confused as to when I should put them on, take them off, how often do you take them off throughout the day (if at all), when do you get your exercises and drainage done...???

I have one spot in my armpit area that is peeling a bit but with tomorrow being my last one/boost I think I should be ok. I've been massaging my implants here and there. They seem to be ok. Does anyone know how long radiation lasts in your body and how long we could expect side effects. I know we are all different but is there a general time? Could it cause problems with my implants months from now?  I do have some fatigue. I'm OK during the day but by 6pm I am done. I am so ready for bed. Making dinner and getting homework done is so difficult. We eat out a lot.  Wonder how long that will last?  All my best to you all. I think the worst part was having to go everyday.

I've found that I get cold more than before and I'm assuming it's because of not having hair. So, I have a hat I keep up in my room for night time. Sept. 10 was my last chemo and my hair started growing in right away. It's got a LONG way to go! I think it's maybe 1 cm now.",

Get hooked up with a physical therapist trained in it so they can show you too. I have friends who had twice the amount of nodes removed as I did and they don't have lymphedema but I do. Not sure that you can prevent it.",

You have many years still ahead of you. yes, it sucks but 6 months out our another 20-30- years is worth it. i have the choice to get radiation or not and i am going to do it because it's just one more thing to kick this thing. good luck with your decision.",
