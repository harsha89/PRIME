The affected verterbrae change shape, and all the musculature around them work hard to protect the bone, and that causes the cramping. I had it for a year before I realised that it was mets. It can also be caused by various different drugs.  What works for me is a regular massage from a specialised practitioner. Mine is a sports masseur, the type who works on athletes, and has two years training in deep tissue massage. I also take regular hot baths with epsom salts, and apply heat packs to the affected areas. Since I had radiation to the spine the level of cramping has gone down almost to zero, but I have continued the massaging every two weeks, to avoid it getting bad again. For leg cramps, I hear that drinking quinine water (tonic) is great. Exercise is also good, even if it hurts. Just 15 minutes walking a day makes a difference. ",

You can't go on the doctor \"suspecting\" something. If you have a concern, you need proof. Mammogram plus ultrasound only gives you suspicions. Biopsy proves.  Perhaps they are thinking of the cost, as well as your age, as in \"a young woman with this type of lump usually doesn't have cancer, so let's not spend the money.\" You are right to insist on the treatment you need. The rates of survival for African American women are a lot lower than they are for whites. I think from what I've read partly because the disease works differently and partly, I think, that they get different treatment from the medical profession. The bottom line is that it's nothing to them, and everything to you. Insist on what you need, don't be polite.  I hope it is just fatty tissue!  ",

The median means that half of all patients survive longer than that and half less. Which half you're in no one can say on an individual level. Also, the range of survival is huge.. between 1 month and 10 years. Where you fall on that range is impossible to say as medical science can't distinguish between different cancers very well yet, let alone how effective current treatments will be. However, you can say that with less time between diagnosis and recurrence, and spread to a vital organ like the lung, it's unlikely your mum will live 10 years. Only about 1-2% live that long. Your fear is understandable. I'd advise you to focus on making your mother's time the best quality she can. There's a tradeoff between living a longer time and living a comfortable time. Some of the treatments are easier to take than others, and it's very subjective. Your mum is the best guide for how she feels. The best thing you can do is make everything as easy as you can for her.  ",
