I'm a single parent with two children (15 & 11). I currently work two jobs, seven days a week. I know I'll need recovery time but will have to go back to work as soon as possible. I would really love to hear from people about what they expreienced. I'm not interested in implants at all. I would really like to understand the other reconstructive options and what other's experience's have been... HELP!!!!!

      "Content": "Dec 11, 2011 08:31AM - edited Dec 11, 2011 08:31AM by prncsviolet Hi Duffmom.... I more then likely will be scheduled for January. I'm meeting with my plastic surgeon on Wednesday to make my final decisions. I'm having a double MX with DIEP reconstruction. I was diagnosed with DCIS and have chosen not to have the lumpectomies and go straight to the MX. In my gutt I know I'm making the right decision, but that hasn't made it any easier. The length of the surgery scares the hell out of me. I'm 41, divorced with two children (15 & 11). I do have family who are very supportive and will help with my recovery luckily. I also have to go for a endometrial biopsy tomorrow morning to see if I have pre-cancerous cells which if I do I will need a full hysterectomy as well. This past summer I had one ovary/tube removed due to cysts and fibroids. It's been a hell of a year for me. The more stories I hear about BC the more I know my decision is the right one for me though.... Lets keep smiling right????",

I'm assuming I will know after this appointment when my surgery is. I'm hoping for the second week of January.  Duffmom I have exactly the same problem with sleeping. I usually fall asleep ok, but I find myself waking up several times throughout the night. I'm usually able to fall back to sleep but I think the broken sleep is whats getting to me the most. Constant scenerios playing on my mind!!!!  ",
