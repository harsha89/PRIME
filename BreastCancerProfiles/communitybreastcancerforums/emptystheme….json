I've decided when I go in this week to request a lumpectomy.  I want to be absolutely sure and I just don't want to have these large, sometimes painful, lumps in me anymore. I should be relieved, and I am, somewhat, but the new lump just growing so fast freaks me out.  I have a feeling I won't relax until they do the biopsy.  Ugh. Anyway, reading through these forums was and is a wonderful help to me in feeling more informed and less alone, so thank you.  <3 ",
