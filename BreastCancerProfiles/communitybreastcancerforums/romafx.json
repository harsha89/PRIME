      "Content": "romafx wrote: Hi there. I have been getting my breasts monitored for the past three years due to numerous cysts. I last went for an ultrasound in May 2016. Instead of prescribing follow up in a year, they asked me to come back in six months because my right breast was full of fluid. About a month after my May appointment (in mid-June), I noticed a small lump under my right nipple. Roughly two months later, I'm now convinced that it has grown into what feels like about an inch in diameter. Just above the nipple is red, a bit warm to the touch and sore. My next appointment for follow up is in November..... But now I'm petrified. No history of breast cancer in my family that I know of so, I'm wondering if this is yet another false alarm, as usual with me. Should I be worried? Any advice, feedback, comments would be really nice. Thank you. Log in to post a reply",

Apparently the clinic I go to has a few months of wait so I'm grateful! I get the feeling that the lump just keeps growing. It's such a bizarre sensation. Thank you for following up. It's an honor to me that you care.",

Needless to say, I'm frustrated because the pain and redness and swelling doesn't subside and I don't know what the problem is! The people at the clinic were bitchy and unaccommodating. Wouldn't give me my records either! Long story short, I think I'm going to get a second opinion elsewhere just for peace of mind. Thank you, grainne, for the concern.",

Nope, no sweats or fevers that I'm aware of, but definitely been suffering from stomachaches and diarrhea every day now. Not sure what that means; perhaps it's my nerves. I just don't feel right. I have an appointment to see the doc tomorrow evening after work to get reevaluated and to retrieve my biopsy and ultrasound results so I can seek out a specialist. I will insist on more tests (if they don't propose it first). I'm in a decent amount of pain so I can't seem to take my mind off of this. Nothing makes sense. Take care. ",

You're right about it \"hanging over my head\", can't really think of anything else at the moment.... Finding it difficult to work, and so on. In Belgium we have a three day weekend coming up and ultrasound is on Tuesday, which means I'm going to try to keep busy until then! I went to the generalist on Wednesday. She said it's either an infection or something more serious. We'll see.... I'll keep you posted! In all cases, thanks for the support.",

An update: I switched clinics because I was concerned with the lack of professionalism at the former and began seeing a new doctor in autumn 2016. The new doc prescribed me various antibiotics over the course of two months but none of them worked. As my breast continued to swell, he ordered a biopsy. The biopsy results were negative (which was enormously reassuring!) and he decided to prescribe another round of stronger antibiotics, which sort of worked = the pain went away, the redness lessened up a bit, etc. But all of a sudden, about a week ago, my breast now hurts more than ever, it's warm to the touch, the redness covers a third of the surface area and it's all swollen. Needless to say, I'm petrified once again and have an appt on Thursday evening to retrieve all of my records so I can head to another specialist for a second opinion. Does anyone know if a biopsy can be \"wrong\"? Or why several different types of antibiotics don't work to get rid of this? I am not breastfeeding, by the way, and have never had an abces on the breast... Please, your insight would be much appreciated. Thank you thank you thank you.",
