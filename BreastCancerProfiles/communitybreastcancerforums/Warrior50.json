Its not that bad to even be annoying, just more of a concern because I didn't want it to derail this treatment. Hearing that others have it through treatment is reassuring.",

So glad to hear your hair started growing again on FEC. I am so ready to have hair again. Sorry you are going through this so young! Are you going to MD Anderson? How have you found the FEC to be?",
