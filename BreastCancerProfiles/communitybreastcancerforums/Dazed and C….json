Before I ask my question I have to clear up one issue, I am not the breast cancer patient, my wife is. I have been reading these discussion bords since my wife was diagnosed with Stage 2A lobular breast cancer in March. After her diagnosis she has had a lumpectomy 2cm with an ancillary dissection (16 nodes removed one positive with cancer cells). She also had a 2nd surgery to make sure that her margings were good. She is currently going through her Chemo treatment that started in early July. She is getting 6 treatments of Cytoxan and Taxotere spaced 3 weeks apart followed by 6 weeks of radiation. This week my wife will be getting her 3rd treatment and thank God she has been doing very good so far. I have to thank you ladies for the GREAT!!!! tips, tricks and the remedies that you have posted that I and my wife attribute to her doing so well so far with her Chemo. The question we have is she is geting all these pimples on the top of her head that really hurt. We have tried Clearasil, baby powder, vasiline, and bacitracin so far with limited results. She does wear a wig during the day as my wife works in Human Resources and meets with many many people. I have tried to get her to just wear a scarf during the day at work but she is a little to vain to just wear the scarf. Under the wig she has tried a nylon skull cap and Headline It. Once my wife gets home from work she either wears just a cotton scarf or nothing on her head. Has anyone gotten these type pimples on the top of their head and what did you do for relief. Thanks from a Dazzed & Confused husband and bless all of you that are going through this.",

The only thing she really noticed is the metallic taste in her mouth came on rather quickly. For the first 2 treatments it took about a week for everything to taste metallic, this time it only took a day. She does use a good mouth wash Tea Tree Therepy and Biotene toothpaste and so far knock wood no mouth sores. If only she could get rid of that metal taste. Good luck this week ladies.",

Thanks again for the great advce.",
