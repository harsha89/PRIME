I am wondering if it was a false positive but i am 100%ER and 75% PR. I have read that even benign tissue in perimenopause can be very high during times of the month. I am so confused. I have my appointment in a couple of hours and pray for an answer then or I will get my films and move on. Thank God an old friend of mine is head of radiology at MIT so I can forward them. It is all so fishy and wrong. I am 100% questioning what is with the biopsied area....confirmation of fibro only solidified my feeling that they missed it. I berlive that is why they never told me that was in the report. Now the other BIG question is to take the tamox or not....and based on what grounds. ",

It has been seen today that no, in the lumpectomy, the punction of the prior biopsy was not seen...hence wrong spot. My new Dr then said that she will try and help me fins an answer. i was taken right away for a core needle biopsy after she, needle in the haystack, search for the remains via US. She found it after about 20 min. 3 samples were taken as well as a second sample from another spot in my breast. she said she has no idea if anything will come out of this or if she is correct in her attempt but wants to help me find an answer. interestingly enough, she had paper work from the orig. hospital that i did n't bring...again hence my feeling that there was a cover up. I cried my eyes out as i left thanking her for helping me. she said i never, ever have to go back to the hospital and that she will guide me through all my options once the biopsy (sent external to the university of zurich) comes back by next tuesday. so...she is trying to put the pieces together for me and simply couldn't deny that there is a BIG gap of info missing. she also saw the mark from under the breast for the orig biopsy.....you don't go to the 2 o'clock position from down here.....so once again, i have confirmation of my sanity and doubt,.....where it will lead only God knows. wrapped up with ponstan and  a few glasses of wine letting the biopsy pain pass once again. xoxoxo ",

I have been fighting this for over 2 months. The day i was supposed to start rads was the day i cancelled it and went for the 2nd. I have read very deep on tubular cancer aand know there is a very difficult line diagnosing it from  tubular fibrosis...but question the HR+ I will go in today with ackup knowledge and a truck full of questions and am prepared to walk out with my files again released to my hands. I just CAN'T be a medical mystery....not in this day and age. I worry about so many woman that don't do research on their bodies and just take everything in that a dr says as correct. i will get to the bottom of this....a promise to all the ladies out there that have been or on a runaround. ",
