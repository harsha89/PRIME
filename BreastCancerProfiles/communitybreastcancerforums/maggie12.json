When I do my BSE, my right breast overall feels a bit denser than the left, especially in the upper outer quadrant.   I feel like the right breast just had more breast tissue in that area than the left - it is not harder or anything, the 'texture' is the same. There are no lumps that stand out, I'm just confused about what I read about both feeling exactly the same.  I've had a couple of exams by my OB in the last few months, and she said everything feels normal.  I should also mention that I am a nursing mom.
