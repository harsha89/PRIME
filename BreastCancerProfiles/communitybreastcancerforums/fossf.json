The third infusion was when I started shedding hair, by the 5th I shaved my head as it was so patchy. I'm 3 weeks from my last infusion and see some hair growing but there are still completely bald patches. I used latisse on my eyelashes and kept most of them.",

I had my last 12xweekly taxol last week, 9 more months of herceptin and I really thought I was done until my Radiology Oncologist appointment was being made last week. I have that appointment on Friday. I think I must have just stopped listening at one of my first Oncologist appointments as I was sure I had no radiation in my future, too much information being loaded into my brain back in those days. And these days my brain is a bit frazzled from chemo. I'm not too active on the groups but do pop in to see how everyone is doing now and again. Wishing you all a great week. Fiona",

I've been reading the posts and getting prepared for my start on Jan 7th. I'll have 18 treatments I think. I've decided to not work during treatment, I did work through most of chemo and was exhausted. Luckily I can take short term disability. I'll stock up on creams before my treatments. My acupuncturist recommended coconut oil to plump up my skin before rads (not the day of). So I'm going to try that for the next two weeks. Happy New Year to all you wonderful women",
