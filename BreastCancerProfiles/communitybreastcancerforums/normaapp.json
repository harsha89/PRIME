Spine and collar bone..No problems at all till about 2 years ago, progression in the bones..sacrum, pelvis and hip bone..Lots of radiation left me much better till just a year ago when a new tumor on the upper part of my femur appeared, Just last week I had surgery to help stabalize the bone, by putting a large rod at the top of hip down through the center of the femur to the back of my knee..Ortho wanted help strengthen where the cancer has damaged..Hopefully I will soon be able to say, it was all worth it! Right now, I am in so much pain. If you have any other questions please ask.. Also day of surgery, My CAT scan results came in saying, New tumor in Liver and lungs.....All while on 4 different chemos this last year! Needless to say, I feel very overwhelmed! It's been since 1998...but I just turned 45! Good Luck to YOu, NormaÂ ",
