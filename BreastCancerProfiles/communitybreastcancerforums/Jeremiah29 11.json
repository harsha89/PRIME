Long story short, a nurse was trying to make small talk with me, (this conversation was entirely non-medical, she was not my nurse) and then she inappropriately noticed I am flat chested, ASKED me if I had a mastectomy (NONE of her freaking business, mind you), I nodded yes, and she had the GAUL to ask me if I was considering reconstruction, to which I replied I wasn't sure and she literally, I KID YOU NOT, threw her head back and LAUGHED and said \"well I know what I would do!\". Needless to say, her superiors were notified. This is just a reminder to all of my fellow warriors that just because you're in a medical office doesn't mean some fool won't say something stupid, yes, even medical staff. I will take this experience and learn to be on guard even in what I thought was a safe environment.

I have cording that won't go away, even with PT, and am starting to use the massager each morning. I think it's helping. Thanks for your input or thoughts!
