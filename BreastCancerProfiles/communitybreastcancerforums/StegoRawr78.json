I've been trying to get someone to listen to me for awhile now because I've had pain in my left breast that goes down my rib cage and into my shoulder for close to 7 months now. I had a regular screening mammogram that they said was clear, so I must be all good, right? I still have this nagging feeling that something isn't right. The other day I sat in the hot tub at the pool and the jet caused extreme pain, I had to move to keep the jet from touching it at all. The right breast has no pain at all. During my mammogram I wanted to jump out of the machine from pain when the tech did the left side, the right side I could have sat there all day long, not an ounce of pain. I'm not sure where else to go. I have a history of a pituitary tumor that messed up every single hormone in my body for years, including my formative puberty years. I know I'm at an increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer, but no one wants to listen. My diet and medication levels have not changed and I don't feel like this is hormonal or caffeine caused because the pain is there rather I drink caffeine or not and it's there through my cycle constantly. At times it's so sharp it almost takes my breath away. The rest of the time it's become my constant companion at some level. Thanks for any and all help! Log in to post a reply",

I have not had the thermography yet, the reason I was leaning towards it is because I can get it done myself, I don't have to play \"convince the doctor\" again. Have not had an MRI or Ultrasound done. I did end up calling another breast clinic and they suggested trying to get my primary care doc to order an ultrasound before I see the specialist. We'll see if we can make that happen or not. I'm highly doubtful. I'm pretty well convinced that the pain probably isn't hormonal because it doesn't change with hormone fluctuations at all. It's constant. I'd figure that if it was hormonal that it would at least stop once in awhile. Hopefully we'll get some answers eventually.",

The first one I saw was very dismissive and said the usual \"pain isn't indicative of cancer\". I'm only 36, turning 37 as well so they said no more mammos until age 40 since this one was clear. I like the idea of an ultrasound and MRI, if I have to pay out of pocket for them, I will. I also have an appointment for a breast thermography at the end of the month. That was recommended by my nautropathic doctor. That's all out of pocket too so that kind of sucks, but at least if something shows there, I might have more leverage. Why is it so hard to get doctors to pay attention?",
