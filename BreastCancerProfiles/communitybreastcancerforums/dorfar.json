My doctors feel its probably has a lot to do with the steroids. Its awful, I'm finding it really difficult to function. I just feel so uncomfortable all the time and I feel like I'm in a fog.Â Its so hard to rest I just feel so uncomfortable in my own body. I feel rather loopy like I could cry on the drop of a hat. Has anyone experienced anything like this? Please tell me this is temporary. Dorothy Dx 4/29/2008, IBC, 3cm, Stage IIIB, 1/13 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I just keep holding on to the thought that this will get better as i get closer to finishing the treatment. I still have 9 more wbr treatments but I'm getting closer. I've started to take zofran for all the nausea and I plan on taking an ambien tonight to help me get some sleep. I feel like its been days since I have really rested. I'm really hoping not to put on weight while on these steroids I feel like I have been through enough without not being able to fit into my clothes too! Oh yeah one last cute side effect, I now have thrush in my mouth too. I got the special mouthwash today to help. I tell you, the fun just doesn't end :)",
