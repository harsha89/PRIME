I also have a mri of brain scheduled Monday (my pcp ordered that). My gyne ran labs on me because I am having irregular periods and spotting, also cramping without a period. I had bilateral mx in July 2014 with tissue expander to implant reconstruction. I've had implants since March 2015. My cycle just started becoming erratic since January. Had a root canal in Feb and one in March...very stressful. If I find a cause I will let you know. Wonder if it's these implants???",
