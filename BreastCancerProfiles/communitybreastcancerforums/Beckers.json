When I met with RO and learned of the risks of radiating my entire chest, I asked for second opinion. I was very happy to get the BMX as that's really what I really wanted to begin with, but kind of felt pressured. I feel like the breasts tried to kill me and wanted them off.

Will go to dollar store for large safety pins, shoe laces for drains in shower. The drains also have loops you can lace the shoe lace through.

Sometimes talking about it awakens it and it helps to have a trained person to help you process it though. Howhm - we are having same surgery. Why are they waiting to do the DIEP portion? Okay girls. I hope tomorrow's bunch are tucked in bed sleeping peacefully. I came on here to find what Tazzy packed for surgery and I got side tracked. So much to do! Good night!",

I wanted the boobs off, new ones on and back to work in 6 weeks. Ha! I remember thinking that. 301724 and Omeggo will you lose you hair? Nbnotes, glad you got your head shaved. Do you have wig?

I work in hospital doing rehab and start my day helping patients do showers and dressing. I look like a hot mess by 10 am! Blessings, how are you feeling since the fall? I hope okay. How was the walk (or roll for you)? Sorry if you said but I'm on iPad and if I go to previous page, I will lose this. As for me, trying to adjust to Tamoxifen. Saw PS today and he is pleased. I will have stage II surgery Dec 27th. Should be much easier. Yesterday I saw dietician. I am very ER +, overweight and have fatty, enlarged liver. He is recommending largely plant based diet. Learned about different types of estrogen in environment and food. He said phytoestrogen can help bind to receptors so bad estrogens cannot. So.. Goal of 1-2 pound weight loss per week, walking 30 min 5 days a week, and nearly vegan. What is a vegan? Fancy name for vegetarian or worse? He also recommends book, \"The China Study.\" Wow...also had my first green tea sweetened with agave nectar and thought it sucked. Heavy sigh. I want 1/2 sweet tea from McDonalds. I wish I was a health nut. Like just one of those fitness freaks, but I'm just not. I'm fat and tired. Ha! Thank god I'm 5'10\" so I'm not a butterball, but I'm fat. Fat, fat, fat. Trying to get it through my head. Bear with me. Enough of my rant. It's good catching up. I had my grand daughter Annie for a couple days and she is am iPad hog! :-) gentle hugs... gnite!",

I haven't worked since last April. I remember telling them, \"See you by May I'm sure!\" I'm totally deconditioned, have 3 weeks til stage 2 surgery, have gained, gosh, almost 20 pounds since I last worked, after surgery on 27th I have 4 weeks to recover before I go back to work on my feet all day in rehab therapy/hospital type settings. It's like I sabotage myself. Now I have to cram all this exercise into the next 3 weeks??? Oh my Lord. Appreciate prayers, positive vibes, smoke signals....whatever works....Im going to need it!!

I go in for stage 2 next Thur. Pray I stay healthy. I'm having necrosis and dog ears removed from abdominal incision, lipo of stomach, lift of right, fat grafting to left, and scar revisions. Sounds like a lot, but hoping it will be a piece of cake compared to what I went through in Aug. I'm getting nervous. My Mom isn't doing so well and she needs me. Kona, your dog avatar is beautiful.

I think the hardest part is trying to care for them, make medical decisions when not a doctor. Mom is having anxiety and shortness of breath. Her oxygen level is fine. Heavy sigh. Emailed doctor. She is good to get back to me in the am. Gma Foley, I hope your church will help you come to Calif. where is your Mom located? My onc prescribed Baclofen for leg cramps. It does help. Hope you feel better soon. Tazzy, I actually moved 20+ hours away by car. I came back to care for my dying father, got diagnosed with BC and haven't been back. My husband went back in Oct. I just cant leave her. Thank you for offering the PM Blessings. I may. This is hard. Especially having gone through it with my father. My Mom is 80 but my parents were young 80's. My Dad bowled a 200 game 2 weeks before he died of bile duct cancer. I don't know if my Mom is dying but they were married 62 years. I hate for her to suffer. She misses him so much.

ChristyRN and MumtoThree I hope you both are managing to keep your wits about you and having a relaxing weekend.

My son's girlfriend made the funniest boob cake and I made boob shaped rice crispy treats. The spot on my pre op chest x ray and CT scan on Monday is giving me more anxiety than surgery now.

Honestly, I have no regrets. When the swelling is down on tummy and nipples are healed (I had nipple sparing), I will be so happy with the tummy tuck and already love the shape of the foobs. One thing to mention is my arms really hurt in recovery room from being strapped down for 12 hours. I wish they would move them so that didn't happen.

I wanted to say, \"Well I guess I'm just that fat that after a tummy tuck my stomach is still pooching out.\" I'm tired of explaining about swelling, etc.... sounds like excuses anyway. Ugh.",

Lots of chemo it seems for some. Thank you for the link Tazzy. Just researching and buying new foods. Wish green tea tasted better. I will try some others. It has chemical that impedes cancer cells from metastasizing so you all should probably drink it too. Let me know if any good ideas to make it taste better white tea is good too.",

Then when it was time for rads i am grateful the next RO was honest with me about SEs radiating entire chest and I said no way!!!

Breast cancer contained in the breast won't kill us....something about keeping them just felt wrong to me. Ommego, good for you to be going to the gym. I'm not working and have trouble get my 8 glasses of water and walking in 5 days a week. I am so tired still. Been on tamoxifen for a few weeks. I think it makes me tired. Also feeling nauseated. I don't sleep that well at night. Just not settled. So... I have been logging my food in Myfitnesspal.com and it helps increase awareness. I am also trying to not eat animal stuff due to being >95% ER +. I also haven't had ovaries since 08 and still got BC in both breasts at 45, so I feel like I need to make these lifestyle changes. Also trying not to worry so much. My life had pretty much been turned upside-down leading up to diagnosis. Still some issues but seem out of my control. Trying not to care. Maybe I will just turn into an apathetic old bitty. Might be easier for me. Changes, even the positive ones for my own good have not been easy for me. Feel like I should just become a nun or something. No cigs, alcohol, meat, milk and cookies....donuts, sex (because hubby is at OK house....not that we were whooping it up anyway. Ha!...TMI) Sorry for ranting, but dang! Hate this last year..... Love to all of you though.",

Goal was one pound weight loss per week. I'm one pound heavier! I swear. Do you work? That's the best thing for me because I work in hospital on feet all day. Jan 24th is when I'm supposed to go back. It's been awhile. I hope you are feeling better Gma Foley. Sometimes it's hard to get the upper hand on infections when our immune systems have been so busy healing surgeries, seromas, etc. My hubby slept so peacefully with the CPAP on. I hope you can get used to it. Hope everyone else is doing well. I have one more gift to buy and get my cards mailed and I will be done.",

Shabby - So glad to hear your system is working and you are more comfortable. Sweet Caroline - I had bilat DIEP flap so was probably somewhat different. You won't even feel any time pass while you are out. I woke up with sore arms but my surgery time was 12 hours. Then I went to ICU where they checked the flap hourly at first. It sounds like a baby's heartbeat when I was pregnant and they checked. Thank goodness for pain control. I was pretty sedated and they were able to keep me comfortable. Good luck Tuesday!! Mariane - congrats on making it to the healing side. I had DCIS in left breast. I'm told it is non invasive and lines the milk ducts but lacks the ability to bust through. Hope your healing goes smoothly. Hi Summer - glad things seem to be going better for you. I don't have implants so I'm not sure about your questions. 301724- my onco was a 19 so no chemo for me. 27 seems on the higher side of the mid range. Are the doctors making any recommendations? Blessings - I see you are a fellow Californian. What university did you work at? Glad you got an outing. I'm going a bit stir crazy today. Hope everyone had a good weekend and the healing is coming along. ((hugs))",

It looks like we have similar cancers except I am PR positive. I have really been blessed. Results were bad in beginning and they found cancer in both sides but it seems I've been pleasantly surprised ever since when I get my results. It is funny how now we live in this BC world.

Because my breast infection flared up again, my PS said to do warm, wet compresses to try to soften the scab on my nipple so it can come off. Get rid of the necrotic tissue. No more worry about water. 5 weeks without a shower was awful. Back on antibiotics. I'm not so sure keeping my nipples was worth all of this. They don't even look alike now. Hoping that can be improved upon somehow in stage 2. Apparently, my BS is doing something with my case. I had to sign release forms. My PS said if the nipples live, they will be famous. Ha. That's a first! Somehow, the way my surgery was done is the first time ever. I don't even understand it all. Anyway, maybe my nipple saga will come to a close here soon. Project endurance continues. Have had my 2 year old granddaughter for two days and boy am I pooped. I love disguised exercise and she is my joy. Tomorrow night I will get back to walking my 10 houses down and back. It has been baby steps for me I think. Some gals are walking miles!!! I know, stop comparing myself. It's discouraging but also motivating. You all inspire me. Hope everyone is doing well.

You'd think I'd have my head wrapped around that concept right? Ha! Stubborn. Glad you are doing well. Will always be mindful of your tumors that were hiding out in your liver. That was crazy.

Blessings, I have not seen the movie but the words to the song are so fitting. I think we all relate to them. Melmcbee, hang in there! I don't know how Shabby does it!

Do you have to work right now? I feel for you. Hang in there. I am still on project build my endurance. Went shopping tonight. Walking is getting easier but still difficult as I have the tummy tuck incision and my whole abdomen feels uncomfortable. This on top of being so deconditioned is hard.

Because I had DIEP recon I worried if I lose weight they will shrink but he said lower tummy fat is not easy to lose (as we all know) so that's in my favor. not that I'm losing weight over here! It could happen. :-) Kona, how is the puppy? I'm a puppyholic. Love them. Getting your endurance built up I'm sure. Good luck with Tamoxifen. I'm not a fan yet but my friend tells me it definitely gets better. She stopped a few times and her onc made her get back on and now she said she would be afraid to be off and considers it like a vitamin now. I will go back on this next week. Dawn, I will be faithful about lotion. I've been slacking for sure. Hope you get better soon! I guess I will get up. Suns coming up. I think part of my sleeplessness and talkativeness is that they gave me steroids in IV (I have mild MS and they do that as precaution). So...thanks for letting me yammer!",

I had nipple sparing and the source was the necrosis on my nipple. They outlined it too and it was real touch and go for a time as to whether they were going to admit me for IV antibiotics. I was on Augmentin and it was stubborn! Took about a week to show improvement and when I was done with first round it flared up again right away so they did second round. Nbnotes - I'm sorry for your set back. Why a skin infection this late in the game. Is it because the chemotherapy is weakening the immune system? How can you avoid these things? Must be so frustrating!!!! I hope you have a happy birthday and that you got to go away and celebrate in spite of the infection. Oh Blessings!!! That fall was a dangerous one.

For me, surgery and anti-hormonal meds was the lesser of the evils. My oncotype score is only 19 so no chemo. But, having quite an invasive surgery and reconstructive process that is also dangerous.

I realized today I see boobs and then feet when I look down...tummy swelling is subsiding. I may have lost a few too because I am trying to be a vegan (against my will...ha!) I have fought these changes, let me tell ya! But...is what it is. Darn it! Omeggo, sorry you are losing your hair. I hope all of my sisters on chemo are doing okay. I am so blessed I didn't have to do that. Tamoxifen makes me nauseated, tired, and may thin my hair out but I think that's as far as I can relate. Well....I need to get to sleep. Going to San Diego Zoo for grand baby's 3rd birthday tomorrow. Sleep tight!",

There are many things it could be other than cancer. Try to stop your mind from going there as much as you can help it until you see a doctor. They can examine you and have a much better idea, as well as start the diagnostics if needed. The odds are in your favor at this point. Not trying to minimize your fear because the potential of a lump being cancer is scary for sure in and of itself. Just try to relax while you make the appointment. First things first. It is definitely a drawn out process sometimes and requires us to pull patience from within. It's not easy. Hang in there and keep us posted. (hugs)",

I found the thread of women who had surgery the same month and that group of women carried each other through. Also there is a thread to help prepare you for surgery I found helpful. I personally had bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction. The type of surgery you choose is a very personal choice. Not everyone can tolerate the loss of both breasts well. For some of us, it was not as big of a deal. I had lumpectomies initially at the pressure of the surgery center but was confident I wanted bilateral mastectomy from the start. (Everyone has individual sets of circumstances.) But....that is not a guarantee you won't have a recurrence. There is no point beating yourself up for the procrastination. Thank God it is not a high grade. It's a vast world here and feels like it takes over your life, but you will get through it. Hang in there",

You may not have an aggressive form that would take you faster than the need for dialysis. You are in a horrible position for sure. Can you seek counseling to help you process each item separately? The cancer center I went to offered it free. It's a lot it sounds like. How about discussing it with your doctor? I do not know the answer as far as what it's like to die with breast cancer. Possibly different for each person depending on where it ends up, such as brain vs. liver, etc. I know hospice is wonderful and does their best to keep the patient comfortable as the body shuts down.

Mammogram found my breast cancer. I didn't even know what my breasts usually felt like and I know I never would have found it. Like fredntan said, this is a good time for reality check and you can make and learn about prevention and any life changes that may be needed. I had no ovaries, no family history and still grew bilateral breast cancers in my 40's that were highly estrogen positive. Well....I learned that my belly fat or hormones in meats or styrofoam and plastics are other sources of estrogen. Lots you can be learning about. Praying for B9 results for you.

I was only two weeks out from my father dying when I got that call. I think I went through the diagnostic process in a fog, which was probably a blessing. Just know this site is wonderful. Its hard when your family, who would normally be your support system, is grieving such a terrible loss. Im glad you are here because the people here will hold your hand and walk you through it every step of the way. Especially when you feel the people in your life don't understand what you are going through. It is life changing and a most difficult journey for sure. Just know there is so much about breast cancer and you will get all of the details about yours as time goes. There are so many treatments. Try to keep your chin up. There are a lot of wonderful 20 something's gals that I've met along the way so I know you will have support and make great friendships. Hang in there. ((hugs))",

They ended up having to take a small bit of muscle so I believe what I actually had was a free TRAM. It is a difficult recovery for sure but I have no regrets. I woke up with nice warm breasts :o). They are just now feeling like they belong to me...ha. I had to get used to them. You lose the feeling in your breasts and that is very strange. I didn't do it for the tummy tuck but that was an added plus as I had big babies and 4 abdominal surgeries previously. Now I have a smooth tummy. Swollen, sore and a very large scar from one side of my body to the other but my PS made it at the csection level, which is nice.",

There is a lot of waiting though and that is the hardest part I think. Get some rest. (hugs)",

For me, I got a call on Friday to come Monday for pre op and I could have lumpectomies on Tues or mastectomies on Wed (I had it in both breasts). I too had pain after biopsy. I think we just have to learn to live with wondering about all of the other aches and pains. I've even considered writing down how I feel in every part of my body so I have a baseline. In the beginning, my father passed away and I could not fathom inflicting pain on my family so my initial plan was to keep it secret. I don't know if that was realistic though to be honest. Therapist is a great idea! Also, ask the doctor about anti anxiety meds if you think that will help you sleep for sure. Doesn't hurt. I take melatonin now. My dietician said a study finds it even beneficial for breast cancer. See...I have thought about or experienced a lot of what you have. What I love about this site!!!",

One step at a time. I miss my father every day and realize I have gone through all of this in a bit of a fog. I wish you the best for the biopsy tomorrow and while you wait for the results.
