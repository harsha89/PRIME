Tamoxifen inflammed my uterus and after taking it on and off for two years, I had to stop. I could not take the pain anymore. Well, a few weeks ago I started having bad pain in my back left side below my ribs. My family doctor (I do not have medical insurance) found blood in my urine and figured it was kidney stones. 11 days later I was in so much pain that I went to the ER thinking these darn stones are just to big to pass. The CT showed a mass in my kidney and many in both lungs. Next was the ultrasound to see if it was solid or fluid and then the kidney biopsy that I had a week ago, yeah, it was way too much fun and yet, not as bad as I thought. Then this past Monday came the results: it is a reccurence of the breast cancer and I am now stage 4 and not curable. After beating out cancer the first time, I went back to school. I was to graduate with honors for my BA in international relations (with a focus on Iran, Hezbollah, and intelligence analysis) this coming spring. I explain that to this doctor when he told me the results and you know what he had to say? \"That is unfortunate!\" Really?? Are you serious??? They have resent my tissue samples to be tested to see if I am still hormone postive. Considering the sensitivity to Tamoifen he suggested an alternative, having my ovaries removed. Oh, so there was an alternative and no one told me? When I told my last doctors about the pain it caused and how my GYN showed it inflammed my uterus to 8 mm (maybe cm, I cannot remember), when 6 is dangerous...they treated me like I was nuts! I looked online and found threads with many women having this problem and I told my doctors and they still treated me like I was nuts. No one ever told me I could have my ovaries taken out as an alternative! Ok, yeah, I am beyond a little pissed off. I have four children. My 9 year old little girl, my 14 year old girl, my 19 year old son, and my 23 year old daughter who just got engaged to be married. They are devestated! My fiance of 8 years is devestated. I still have not told my father. Well, I figure they may have given me a death sentence, but not a date! I will find alternatives and refuse to go down without fighting and kicking (ok, and maybe cursing once in awhile!). I would love to hear from everyone and really need to hear from other women who have many in their lungs. What in the heck am I in for? My low blood pressure (norm 110) is now going up every week. From 120, 137, 148, and this last Monday was 158? What the heck is that about? I was going to ask the doctor, but forgot all about it after he so politely explained how unfortunate it was that I was so close to my diploma! To make life even more difficult, they do not want to write me enough pain medications. This doctor even told my family doctor that he does not believe it is my kidney causing me so much pain. Um, that is ignorant! That is what caused me to go to the DR and the ER and landed me at his doorstep. I am most certain if it was him that he would want to be pain free, or at least able to sleep. So, we are all stuck here. But no one can dare give us a date. One day at a time! (((((super big hugs))))) for each and everyone here. Big hugs and much love always, Dawn",

This oncologist had mentioned, after I was just hit with the news, that I should consider getting a port. I was pretty upset at the moment and just wanted to get out of that place, so I told him I did not want to talk about any ports and may not even choose to take any chemo.",
