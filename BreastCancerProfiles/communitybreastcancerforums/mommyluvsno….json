Just wanted to say that I will go in for a bilateral Mastectomy on January 8th.  I am just anxious for it to get here and get started on treatment.  Also having tissue expanders put in at same time.  I went out this weekend and bought some button down pj's and a couple of soft flannel shirts.  Have plenty of pillows handy, a recliner, stool softener and going to pick up paper plates and cups so won't have to deal with dishes.  Also planning on order a couple of Softees Two for after surgery.   Hopefully we can help each other through our recoveries. Lots of hugs going out to all of you.",

I had a needle biopsy done first to see if they were cancerous, which they were.  The needle biopsy was not bad at all and if you are nervous you can ask your Dr. to prescribe you valium before the procedure.  It helped calm my nerves and relax me.  My results came back DCIS, non-invasive, stage 0.  After the biopsy results the next step for me would have been an MRI to see if there was anything else present. However I knew I would want a bilateral Mx so that step was unecessary in my case.  The Dr. recommended treatment was lumpectomy and radiation.  If I were you I would do a biopsy so you know what you are dealing with quickly and can then start making decisions.",

We talked about the different scenarios depending upon the biopsy and I made it clear that if it was cancer I wanted a double masectomy so we talked about that a little.  Ideally I would like to have reconstruction right away but since there is a concern about the rate of change with my mammogram that may not be the best option since it would involve finding a plastic surgeon and coordinating schedules.  I am taking my Mom with me to the biopsy tomorrow and the gave me a prescription for valium plus said I could take a Darvecet for pain.  The one good thing about being told by several people that it is most likely cancer is that I won't be waiting on pins and needles for the results. Instead I will be making some decisions this weekend so when the results come in we can get moving.  And of course if by some miracle they are all wrong and it is beneign then I will feel incredibly blessed. I do know though that if it is beneign I am going to insist on an MRI on both breast to double check everything. I am actually relieved that we will be getting definite answers soon and moving forward.",
