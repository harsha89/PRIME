I had a lumpectomy and lymph node (x3) removal on July 31 and just got back my Oncotype test with a score of 34 so scheduled to start chemo on September 13, followed by radiation and hormone therapy. I'm scheduled for four cycles (every two weeks) of AC and then four cycles of Paclitaxel. What I really want to hear, from anyone who's done this kind of regimen, is whether I'm at all being realistic in the following plan. If I do my treatments on Thursday, then take Friday and the weekend to recover, I hope to be able to work the full week on non-treatment weeks. Is that overly optimistic? Several people have told me they've been able to more-or-less work through their chemo, but others have told me not a chance. I'm trying really hard not to freak out.",
