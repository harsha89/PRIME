I felt useless in the face of people I love having to go through this awful experience. So what do I do? I try to make it not seem so bad. I try to be upbeat. I try to talk about other things not just the illness, but at the end of the day IÂ  am useless. I can do nothing. What's the alternative? Do I say 'well that's life'. Or do I ignore it altogether? So I guess what I am trying to say is that it is great and important to be able to vent how you feel because it must be truly infuriating, but spare a thought for those who are useless and tumble over words, because all they are trying to say is 'I love you'. and 'I care'. xx",
