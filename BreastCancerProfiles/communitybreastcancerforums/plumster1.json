I had my biopsy Friday and will receive my results tuesday. it is a very scary process and very hard to wait. My understanding is they will biopsy anything greater than a 2% chance and the radiologist told me sometimes even the ones less than 2% -at least at the hospital i went to. The biopsy itself was not painful or stressful. I actually asked my radiologist lots of questions during the biopsy time to get more information which I figured would either help me get through the wait better or kind of mentally prepare myself. I asked him what characteristics favored a benign mass or what were the concerning characteristics. In general for me, the positive characteristics were a lot more than the small negative. That being said I'm still very nervous. I find they will tell you very little information if they can. So I would like to think the 90% statement should be comforting to you. I would focus on it and keep yourself really busy the next few days. I feel a ton better when I'm not thinking about it. I hope everything goes well!",

If you are looking for recommendations, I would chose from \"all topics\" menu whatever type of BC you were diagnosed with IDC, ILC etc... once you click on that you see a button \"start a new topic\"..... then you can start a new post.... a heading like \"need recommendations in Denver\" or \"newly diagnosed in Denver\" will help catch people's eye when scrolling through active threads who might have information.  Also, making all your diagnosis (dx) public in your profile helps when people are giving advice... similarities/differences etc...  Best, Michell",

It is given as a number score which correlates to a percentage. For example my number was 12 which gave me an 8% risk of metastic spread if I complete 5 years of tamoxifen. I believe if you do not do hormonal treatment the risk doubles. Then it shows your percent benefit from doing chemo. My benefit was very small so the risks associated with chemo were not worth it for me. However, someone with a higher Oncotype dx score which means a higher risk of metastic spread might be able to significantly reduce their percentages and chemo would be worth it. Hopefully, this helps. Fingers crossed for a low score a that I explained it correctly :",

It was solid but oval, defined edges, not vascular but was mildly hypo echoic. I receive my results this coming Tuesday. Tonight (Sunday) I felt a pain in my right breast and felt a new lump!!! I know it was not there before. What is happening? What could cause this? I am certain it was not there. I am in shock.
