First off, I'm 33, married, a 3 yr old boy and a 5 yr old girl.  I have a change in the feeling/pain level of both breasts but mostly my right and the right itches and the nipple itches too.  Two years ago while I was still nursing I had a mammogram that was clear.  I have a mammogram coming up on Monday the 16th, and I made an appointment with my CNP for Thursday to talk about where we go next because even if that is clear, there will be a next step. Wow, that seems strong a bit, but that's it, that's the reason for the subject of my post.  What scares me the most right now isn't having cancer or being diagnosed with cancer, it's the risk of finding it too late to put up a good fight, to have the best chance of beating it.  I think that's going on my list of things to mention to my CNP on Thursday.  I take duplicate copies of a typed list of things I want to cover.  No chickening out that way.  I want it clear why I'm being so concerned over this, why one green light won't satisfy me. Oh, and if the CNP concerns you, don't let it please.  I trust that this gal will refer me out, and what counts for just as much, she understands how I talk, and listens to me and my opinion, so, while I might need to see other people down the road, she's a good starting point.  Well, that's it for now, and of course I will update Thursday at the latest.   Thanks for reading.
