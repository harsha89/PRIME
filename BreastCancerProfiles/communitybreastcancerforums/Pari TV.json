One of the hospitals I consulted reported that there were some spot lighting up in spine and liver. Schedule to get ct and bone scans tomorrow. I realized this would make my stage 4 which is a lot to absorb. Doctor said could be incidental finding but I'm thinking must be related. Anyone else has had similar experience? How did you kill the the time until you hear? Just want a hear a hi from someone who's been there Log in to post a reply",
