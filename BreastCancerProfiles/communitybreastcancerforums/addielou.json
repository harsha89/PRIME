When i lay flat the bottom part of my left breast sinks in and pulls my nipple inwards. when i stand up normal its not really noticeable unless i run my fingers across it. its almost as if its empty right there. the other one feels normal and full. my dr was concerned and i too am waiting for my appt at the breast center. i just keep googling trying to find a pic that looks like mine or answers. google is not my friend. prayers to you. we are not alone.",
