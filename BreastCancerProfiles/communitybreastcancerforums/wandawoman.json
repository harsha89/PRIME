I needed them to be removed. I am glad that I did. When the final pathology report came back, there was an area in the same breast with additional \"microcalcifications\" noted. I feel in my heart of hearts those would have turned to cancer later and who knows if I would have been lucky enough to find it this early again? Good luck to you as you begin to navigate your way.",

I believe that it is hard to not be angry sometimes. Your world just tilted on its axis. Right now things are beyond your control. But this will not last. Soon you will be a part of the decision making process and will feel a little more in control.",

I am a runner and  I could not run enough to help with the overwhelming feelings of anxiety that seemed to come on out of no where. Eventually I did have to resort to an antianxiety med to help. I can not say enough good things about the benefit to my sanity the medication provided. I was back to work 5 weeks after having a bilateral mastectomy and tissue espanders placed. I do supervision so I was never really lifting/turning anyone, I think 4 weeks may be a little quick when you work in direct patient care.",
