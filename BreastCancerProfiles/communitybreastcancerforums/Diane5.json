I had a benign lumpectomy in '97, and bilateral ductal popalomas removed in 2000 & 2001. I had just gotten to the point where I wasn't embarased about the scars and dimples from that when I went for a mammogram on Dec 5th 2011. I hadn't had one in 3 years and knew better because of my high risk. I knew it wasn't good when my PA called me 20 minutes after I left from having my mamm done. The BS told me that my mamm looked like the milkeyway. She scheduled me for 5 Strerotactic Core Biopsies on Dec 15th with a follow up MRI two days latter. The result was ALH, but the MRI showed another spot. After waiting for the Post Biopsy trauma to dissipate she did another US a month ago. Seems that she did see the spot from the MRI, but decided to wait a month to do anything. Today I went in for another US and my BS ended up doing two more biopsies (US guided) today in her office. We are hopeful that it will be nothing, but I am still scared that they will find more. I find out next Monday (the day before my 39th birthday) what the results are from today. My BS is thinking that I may need an open surgical biopsy becuase of all the calcifications on my right side. That will be number 11. When do I say no more biopsies - remove the breasts? The stress of wondering is starting to get to me. Diane",
