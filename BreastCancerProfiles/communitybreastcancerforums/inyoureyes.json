      "Content": "inyoureyes wrote: I gave birth to my beautiful son in July. I breastfeed, so I was expecting some weird stuff to happen with my breasts, About a month ago, I noticed a lump in my right breast. I thought for sure I had a clogged duct so I massaged it a lot, put warm compresses on it, etc. It didn't go away so I went to the Dr. last week. She said she thought is was a galactocele, but sent me for an ultrasound for peace of mind. I went on Monday and the radiologist told me it is a solid mass. The report says it is 4.1cm and could be a fibroadenoma or a lactating adenoma but a core needle biopsy is recommended. He gave it an ACR Category of 4 (suspicious.) I just dropped the images off at the Baldwin Breast Center and am waiting for them to call. Needless to say, I am terrified. I was super emotional to begin with being 3 months postpartum. Now I am a basket case. I keep looking at my son and just bursting into tears. What if I don't get to see him grow up? I am such a mess right now and the waiting is just torture.  Log in to post a reply",

It is when my husband and son are asleep that the doubts start to creep up in my mind. But I keep telling myself 80% of these masses are benign and it is probably nursing related. I DID massage the hell out of if at first because I thought for sure it was a clogged duct and I didn't want to get an infection. I massaged it so much that I got a bruise. Maybe I made something happen...who knows. All I know is no matter what, I can't wait until friday (which happens to be my husbands birthday) to get the results. This limbo stuff is agony.",

I had a miscarriage a few years back and I joined a message board like this one, which was a godsend, so I know how important these places are!  I am trying really hard to not think the worst, but it is difficult. I feel so sad whenever I look at my son and he smiles at me.  I just wish I had answers and wasn't in limbo.",
