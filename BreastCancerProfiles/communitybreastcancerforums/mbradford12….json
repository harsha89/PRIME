If you look on the second page of the report, you will see TWO graphs.  It is the second graph, the one on the right that shows absolute benefit,  that is the one that shows whether or not chemo will change your chance of recurrence.  Although the graph on the left is not clearly labeled this way, according to my oncologist's explanation, that graph only shows relative benefit.  Here's the difference. The graph on the left looks ONLY at the people who have had a recurrence.  So, let me use my case as an example.  In my case, with a score of 28, I know from page 1 that 18 out of 100 people with breast cancer like mine get a recurrence.  According to the left hand graph on the second page, recurrence was decreased by about 6 percent by having chemo plus tamoxifen.  But here is the crucial piece of information.  This means 6 percent of the 18 who got a recurrence, not 6 percent of the original 100.  So, does that mean that my chance of recurrence would drop from 18 to 12%?  NO.  Since the 6% refers to the 18 people, not the original 100, I have to figure out what 6% of 18 is.  18 people getting recurrence times 6% is only 1 person.  That means 1 fewer out of the 18 had a recurrence by doing chemo.  So out of 100 people, instead of 18 people getting a recurrence, with chemo, it would be 17.  So my chance of recurrence went from 18% to 17%.  That's a big difference compared to thinking my chance dropped by 6%. That is what the graph on the right on page 2, absolute benefit, clarifies.  It shows that people in the low category clearly did not improve their chance of recurrence by doing chemo.  In the intermediate category, no benefit was shown, but they need to do more research, because it may be that some of this group would benefit and some would not.  That is why they are doing the TAILORx trial to see if they can figure out who, if any in this group, benefit from the addition of chemo.  Finally, people in the high category did clearly show a decrease in recurrence with the addition of chemo.  In addition, this is not part of this report, but my surgeon at the University of Chicago told me there is evidence that tamoxifen + chemo may not be any better than chemo alone for those in the high risk category, FYI.  There is a big difference between relative benefit and absolute benefit.  Please make sure your doctor explains this to you.  It could definitely impact your decision of whether or not to do chemo.",

Using current clinical protocols, \"women with node-negative, ER-positive breast tumors under 1 cm are usually treated with adjuvant therapy consisting of tamoxifen only following surgery, while those with tumors of 1 cm or larger usually receive chemotherapy and tamoxifen,\" Dr. Cobleigh says. Yet chemotherapy offers only a 25 percent relative risk reduction for these women. And \"relative\" is the catchword that most patients don't catch. For example, the NSABP study population showed just a 15 percent risk of recurrence rate among the women in 10.9 years of followup. \"So 85 percent of the patients did just fine with five years of tamoxifen only\" over that period, Dr. Cobleigh says. Adding chemotherapy to tamoxifen treatment following initial diagnosis reduces that 15 percent risk of recurrence by 25 percent, which translates into a four percent absolute risk reduction. \"In other words, four out of 100 women who take chemotherapy won't relapse-and 11 will,\" Dr. Cobleigh explains.",
