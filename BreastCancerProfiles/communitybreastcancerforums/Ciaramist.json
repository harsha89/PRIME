You struck a cord with me when you said your worried your baby will grow up not knowing you, I've cried many nights with the same fear. I want to grow old, watch my baby girl become a woman and have some granbabies to love of my own, I want to be there for her. I know you feel the same. This is hard, worrying is sooo hard. We are young , this shouldn't be happening. I am with you , i am here if u need anything! The same goes for anyone else reading this post. I had my biopsy today. It was not as easy as I had hoped. My solid tumor is quite close to my nipple, beneath it. The doc told me it hurts more there and I was not frozen very much. Felt all 8 of the core biopsies that they took, I'm pretty sore now, big purple bruise, but more then anything my spirit is feeling pretty beat up. I do not feel like me today, the tears come often and I'm tired. Trying to stay strong for my baby girl, thank god for my mom, stayed home from work to help me out, more emotionally then anything. 15 days till I hear my worst fears or my best news. The days will drag. I'm feeling like I can't handle this. I'm tired , my heart is tired.  Hoping for a better tomorrow. Goodnight all xo",

I have not allowed myself to jump.to the conclusion of it.being cancer, it of course is there floating around my mind but I'm better off just being hopeful that it is something benign. we have to hope for the best right!? I'm am very grateful for the doctor's I have seen up until now and their quick moving and attitude to my situation, I am truly lucky to have everything moving at a fast pace even if I feel as if I can't catch up emotionally to everything. Thank you for the biopsy advise and information. It's very helpful, I will have a icebag ready and some pain relief for the days to come after.(and a nice bottle of wine on hand lol) I will have my husband with me , he's been with me to every appointment, he's my rock and my ears, because like u said, I also completely check out when I'm overwhelmed. I try not to go to him too much with my feeling on this though, I know he's so worried, he broke down on me once a couple months ago, just one time, but it was enough to make me stay strong and make him proud of my strength. But sometimes it's too much for me, so I found this site in hopes to have somewhere to vent a little without being judged. I see u have been through your fair share, I hope you are doing well now? I'm curious if breast pain and discharge that is not bloody a typical sign for BC..like I said I'm staying off google, I'd rather get my knowledge from people who are more level headed and knowledgeable then all those insane sites that tell you, you have cancer off of a pimple lol  Thanks again!!!

      "Content": "Ciaramist wrote: hi all, I'm new here. I have spent months worrying in silence, I don't like speaking about it because I don't want the people in my life to worry as well. I'm 29 years old, have a daughter who is 19 months old. I love that little girl to the moon and back:) (I apologize now for any typos, I am multitasking between her and writing this) It started back when I was breastfeeding, noticed a lot of pain in the right breast from the start..even more pain from using the breast pump...I ignored it, figured it was normal, nipple eventually inverted, first was able to get it back out easily, then eventually couldn't. Pain kept getting worse, then noticed a lump. In July I went for my first ultrasound, they said bi-rad 3, come back in three months. Fast forward to this month, went back for three month check. Go in for ultrasound, the technician says she needs to get the head person(not sure what she is called, let's call her the technician queen lol) so queen tells me, oh I dont like this, I want a mammogram done on both breasts stat. Get that done same day, I was freaking out at this point, everyone was rushing and being overly nice so I obviously broke down into a blubbering mess...anyway I get the mammogram, the technician comes in and says, I advise u see your doctor sooner then later. Great...my docs on vacation.. Anyway, I get to a doctor who tells me I need to get a biopsy. So that's where I am now, tomorrow is biopsy day, a core needle ultrasound guided biopsy. I should mention I'm deathly afraid of needles. So the mass is 1.9 cm, some microcalifications were seen on ultrasound but not on mammogram. I'm trying to rack my brain but I can't seem to remember much else at this very moment. I've had discharge, not bloody, but like greenish yellow, not much of it up until three weeks ago, i had three days of intense breast pain, to relieve some pain I pushed on my breast, only to have this yellow discharge come pouring out, spent three days trying to drain it when ever it filled up again. Anyone know what the heck that is? Is that something that is associated with breast cancer at all? I don't want to start googling because I think it might make me think I'm dieing and I'm not going there lol. Again I apologize if I'm all over the place in this post, I'm a nervous wreck trying to handle a toddler , it's safe to say my brain is fried at this point. Last question...do biopsy hurt at all? I feel like a child asking that question, I just want to know what's in store for me tomorrow. Hope you all are doing well! Thanks! Log in to post a reply",
