    "Content": "Flink_Ansikt wrote: Earlier today I found a rather large bump on the side of my nipple. It didn't hurt,but when I put my finger on it I could feel a ball on the inside. The skin on top is slightly irritated,and I know for sure it's not an agitated gland. I squeezed it relatively hard,and blood came out.I've been trying to drain it for almost an hour,and the blood hasn't stopped,and the ball size hasn't decreased. I'm 21 years old with no previous breast issues. I don't know where else to go for help on this sort of thing without having to deal with rude or childish comments. Has anyone had this experience before? Should I be worried? I don't have any sort of insurance,so going to a doctor is a last resort. Log in to post a reply",
