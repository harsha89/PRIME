If not, request a referral to one - not just a PT (or OT) that claims to 'knowall about LE' but one who is a LymphEdema Therapist. Unfortunately, many/most Drs are not educated about LE. LE is not limited to just ones who have had a lot of nodes removed, it can result from any surgery (even non-invasive when nodes are not removed) or traumatic injury to any area of the body - not just after breast surgery. Rather or not you are dealing with early LE, you should see an LET to get education on 'things' you can do to lower the risk of developing it. Also, if LE is presenting - the sooner in TX the better for managing it. There are other possibilities than just LE for swelling but you (all) do need an evaluation and education sooner better than later ",

It might be a good idea to call back and ask about getting a blood test as it's been 10+ yrs since seeing a Dr. There is so much information gained from blood work that has to do with your over all health and QOL. It is not unual for diabetis (or hypoglycemia) to developed which is easier to manage when caught earlier, thyroid issues are another issue that often come on, anemia possibly, liver function, etc. - there are so many other ' things' that are checked for in the 'usual' blood work.

Unfortunately, so many today are low in Vit. D - I've dealt with LOW Vit. D for over 20 yrs even though I am a very active 'outdoor woman' but I handle it with my light box during fall/winter/spring and Vit. D pills year 'round (pre Dr's orders). It is always better to find out IF there is an issue starting and take steps to handle it/prevent form progressing/slow down progression sooner better than after it becomes a BIG issue. The old saying comes to mind - \"An ounce of prevention beats a pound of cure.\". It is important to remember - rather or not we want to developed health issue - it is eventually going to happen and being proactive early on makes for better outcomes and QOL. We also have to be our own best advocates and educate ourselves.",

So there are some 'possitives' for SEs with lasting issues from chemo - I never have to shave under arms or legs any more. I preferred to use depilatory creams/products over the years with no skin issues. I know that not all can do/want to do what I have done - but just what was 'right' for me. In my mind (for what there is of it that still 'works' ), I would never think to wax under arms (or legs for that matter). I have waxed my brows for better than 40 yrs as it was/is the easiest way, in my opinion, to keep them under control. But that is a very small area to deal with than under arms or legs. No, I do not go a salon for the procedure but actually do it myself. I am a Master Cosmetologist so I do have the knowledge/expertise to do it for myself. I am not currently working as a Master Cosmetologist - haven't worked in the field for MANY yrs but do keep my license current and take the required continuing education to stay current as a 'just in case' I might need to use it in the future. The last time I worked full time was in 1991. Just thought of something else I've been told is do not put deodorant on before going in for any surgery.

After each use (or monthly if not used), it needs to be have fluid run through it and then heparin inserted to prevent clotting.  At the next use or monthly flush, the heparin is then pushed through with fluid and then new heparin is put in.  Not all ports can be used for 'dye'.

I've been tested all my life for thyroid function (the last 17 yrs annually, before that not as often because I didn't always do anuals) because I knew there was a potential problem - I had radiation to my throat after tonsils when I was 1 1/2 yrs. This was a common practice from in the 1930 - 1960's. It was supposed to prevent tonsils from growing back - WRONG - I'm 65 1/2 and still have my second set of tonsils. So did that radiation cause my thyroid to not like working, did rads for IBC (or even the radiation used for tests/scans) cause it, also lived not to far from where above ground nuclear tests were done in early 1950's or was it the combination of all? I'll never know and I don't care! I'm alive - taking a synthroid a day is easy.

There are many different manufacturers that have a lot of different prosthesis in not only size but also shape and 'skin tone' to match you. It takes a while after a MX to be ready to get a 'good' pros. as it takes time for the effects of surgery to get to what is not affected by the surgery (swelling/etc.). Until that time, there are some very inexpensive 'fluffs' that can be used. It's not as simple as looking in catalogs and picking out 'something' - we are each unique in how we are 'built'. Nor does our 'chest' the same after surgery so not all will 'lay' the same. A Certified Fitter should be where they have different pros (and mast. bras) to try and get a good fit/match (if they don't have the right one on hand they can order in a better fit). Because I'm on the 'smaller side' (32/34 - A/B), my Fitter always has to order in what she thinks will be the best based on her KNOWLEDGE of the products and her knowledge of ME and returns what is 'wrong' for me.",

The compression (elasticity) is compromised when wet and stretched as it would be if worn wet and left on to dry. Think about it - when taken off to wash they are somewhat stretched from wear but when come out of the washer they are back to as tbe were. I've never worn mine to go swimming but I have succeeded in falling in the lake or slipping down a creek bank getting soaked while out fishing. A thought to also think about is that 'pool' water is usually highly chlorinated which will to do 'job' on basically any material. I, too, wear my day garments and night garment daily and use my FlexiTouch daily. When I go to a pool or water park, I just don't worry about it and leave sleeve and glove off for a few hours and haven't had any problems. An idea would be to take an old set and religate them to being the 'swimming sleeve/glove' and keep it with swimsuit and swim gear. I rotate my old sets when I get new ones into another 'life' when I get my 2 new sets every 6 months. I keep a 'used' set in the tool boxes in each vehicle, a set in the boat, a set in the tack boxes, a set in the horse trailer, a set in my house toolbox, a set in each of my tackle bags (fly and spinning) so that if have to do something that might ruin (stain/tear/etc.) that might be 'messy' or 'rough', (like changing a tire or 'anything') I can change to a set that doesn't really matter if they get damaged thus 'protecting' my new ones. When I get new sets, I use a permanent marker and put the month and year on the tag in them so no question which is newer. Sometimes with repeated washings, it will fade so just remark. At least that's how I deal.",

It seems though that basically no one ever reads positive experiences (or believes they exist) but prefer to dwell in the negative. I know nothing about Obama Care or dealing with insurances - my fantastic care was/is through VA. I was immediately outsourced to private care for all my TXs and surgery.",

My gloves have been the hardest to get 'right' - still working on them. (My hands are 'weird' as they are partial webbed.) I got 2 new ones in a week ago made from modified measurement but somehow they used wrong measurements from a long time ago on the finger length so they're back for corrections. For me, fingers have to stop just before the joint - if they go past the joint, fingers puff up and turn blue. Gauntlets do not give me what I need due to the webbing. I also prefer the feel of a 'pocket' on the hand, but don't use it for a pad as that makes too much compression. At least that's me - not anyone else. I prefer the silicon 'bubble' top - it stays in place nice for me - ones without roll and slip. I prefer cotton as it's hot here in the summer and they'er warmer in our nasty winter.

      "Content": "Apr 16, 2017 12:54PM - edited Apr 16, 2017 01:29PM by Kicks I too strongly disagree with staying away from friends, family and stopping living your life as usually lived at least prior to TX (treatment). There will be plenty of time for that in the future - if YOU need to. It is great to seek all the information/experiences each of us had had BUT they are what others experienced and each are unique to each of us - not what everyone will experience exactly. Also our Drs are each unique and not all TX all of us with exactly the same regime, even with the same DX. We each enter TX with/or without other health issues that can/will have effect on what is the best total TX plan from our Team. You said you have lymph node involvement so from all I've been told/read, as long as they are within the breast area (including axillary) that means Stage III, not metastatic. Metastatic means that the cancer has spread to other organ/areas. This will take future Scans (CT/MRI/Bone/PET with contrast) to check for possible spread. (DEXA tests are for checking bone density if heading into possible (or have) osteopenia or osteoporosis. Vaccination - I was told to get my flu shot while doing Chemo but was told to hold off on getting the Shingles vaccine til a while after end of TX. Some vaccines are killed virus, some are modified live and it makes a difference. Was told no multi vitamin/mineral during TX but was given approval for my Vit. D and Bs. I had to start taking K (Potassium) during adjuvant Chemo as my levels plummeted 1/2 way through and still have to take it yrs later. I had no infections at all during TX and went any and everywhere I wanted to and did a lot of 'stuff'. My blood count stayed good throughout. I have dealt with massive sinus infections all my life (every few month) but had none while on Chemo and in the 7+ yrs since end of TX, I have only had 2 minor sinus infections. As it's been explained to me, while chemo can (and does for many) 'wreck' the immune system - for a few of us it 'kicks it into a 'higher gear'. Be sure that you see/talk to all of the Drs on your Team (Surgeon, MO/Chemo Dr, RO/Rads Dr) and your case has been presented to the Tumor Board at your Facility before any TX is started. It is becoming more common for neoadjuvant chemo (pre- surgery) to be the first line of TX especially when nodes are known to be involved. The object is to shrink it, get good margins and some times a complete response pre surgery. While LE (LymphEdema) is certainly something that you do need to become well educated about - at this time there are a lot more pressing 'issues' to get answers about immediately. Get a notepad (or more) and keep it handy to write down every question you come up with to ask your Drs about. Make extra copies to hand to your Drs - they may be able to combine several questions in one answer. If you don't understand what he/she is saying, keep asking until he/she explains in words YOU understand (especially if he gets 'aggravated) as it is your right to be told in words YOU understand. Use your smart phone to record what he/she actually says so that if you have questions later as to what was actually said - you can review it as needed. Don't try to learn everything at once or before you have a more complete DX. Get all the info/experiences you can - but remember that there are no ABSOLUTES when it comes to any of the types of BC or what you (or anyone else individually) will experience.",

For me, it was a week from the node enlarging overnight til I saw my PA, had a new mammo, US and FNBs (Fine Needle Biopsies) that after noon (Thurs) with path. rreport the Radiologist at 8 the next morning (Fri). Saw my Surgeon on Mon, Rads Dr (RO/Radiological Oncologist) on Wed and Chemo Dr (MO/Medical Oncologist) on Thurs. The next week started a lot of Scans (Bone, CT, MRI, PET), a biopsy on an area that 'lit up' along my lower jaw on PET. An EKG. A port implant and 17 days after DX (diagnosis) started 4 DD A/C (Dense Dose Adriamycin/Cytoxan) neoadjuvant. So yes, for some of us there is no long term waiting but for others it can be longer. Not all questions can be answered immediately. It is a building/learning 'journey' that takes starting at the base and building knowledge from a solid base. Sort of like you can't read many books until you have learned the alphabet and small words first and build from there to being able to read 'everything' you want to. (Hope that makes sense ) Find out what your ER/PR and HER2 status are - this will have an effect on the TX plan. Depending on what family HX (history) is ask about genetic testing not just for you but for your daughter. The Surgeon will not have a lot of answers probably. The Chemo Dr will have more. While Surgeons who routinely deal with BC do have a lot of knowledge on BC - their field of expertise is surgery/cutting. The Chemo Dr's field of expertise is Chemo while the Rads Dr's field of expertise is radiation. All related for the whole TX picture working together for the best prognosis. ",

Of course, anything is posssible so you do need to see a Dr about your skin issue but it would be incredibly unlikely that any type of BC (especially IBC) is present. IBC has no 'set in stone' rules as to how it has to (or does) always present. It is true that it is rare (only between 1& - 4% of all DXd BC - DCIS/IDC/ILC/IBC), it is rapid in presentation (literally overnight), and is very aggressive - progressing daily/weekly. It is possible to present with redness/rash in some of us but not all. Some of us will never develop 'redness/rash'. My IBC presented as an enlarged lymph node under arm literally overnight and in the 24 days (7 days til DX and then 17 days til started neoadjuvant TX) it did rapidly progress - node continued to enlarge, breast enlarged, nipple inverted and peau d'orange developed BUT never any redness, pain, itchiness or heat did. No one here can tell you what is going on with your skin - only a Dr who actually sees you can DX your skin issue. So see a Dr for a correct DX and the correct meds to treat it.",

Why are you assuming that the first line of TX will be a mast.? There are different protocols for the different types that vary a lot. Surgery is not always the first to do - neoadjuvant chemo (Chemo done before surgery) is becoming more common for better surgical outcomes. Also, a lumpectomy might be the best choice for her to make. TX plan should be done by a 'Oncology Team' including not only the Surgeon but also the Medical Oncologist and Radiological Oncologist working together for the best TX plan - not 3 TXs that are not coordinated.

Winter means trying to keep my bougainvillas alive inside til it's finally warm enough for them to exist outside again next summer.

Cold means no nice long dog walks as even me bundled up in my outdoor gear, it's too cold for them to be out for anything except short periods of time. Also unsafe to be out for long walks on the frozen/icy ground. No biking either for safety reason also. No boating - frozen lakes. No fishing - frozen lakes (well unless you want to do ice fishing but to me (a flyfisher) that's not fishing just sitting on ice). No riding again for safety reasons. Cold means HURTING. Yes literally hurting everywhere. Cold means more issues with keeping LE under control as have to work at getting as much activity as I get during summer just in my daily activities. It's time spent at the gym to try to make up for just 'living'. Cold is having to be sure that you have enough kerosene for your heater/lamps (or fuel for your generator) for at least a week in case of power outages during blizzards to survive the brutally frigid actual temps and wind chills. It's being sure to have enough water and food in the house for at least a week for you/family (to include your 4 legged 'kids'). It's being one of the last people on the road (in your 4X4) making sure that your horses have enough hay out to last them until it's possible to get back to them once it's possible to even get on the roads again. YES - I HATE COLD with a lot of good/legitimate reasons! I have lived in 3 'corners' of the States (SE, SW, and NW) before being here on the northern praires and I loved winters there. Grew up primarily in SW FL, was stationed in AZ and spent 3 1/2 yrs in the norther Mojave (NWC China Lake) was stationed there when Hubby stationed there.

They do overlap to some degree but the different Specialities are just that - Specialities. Basically, Surgeons Specialize in Surgery, Chemo Drs (MOs) Specialize in Chemo and Rad Drs (ROs) Specialize in Rads. For the optimal outcome/prognosis they need to work together as your Team so that theTX plan is all encompassing. What did the Tumor Board at your Facility suggest? Many do get second (or more) opinions if they do not feel comfortable with the TX plan they have been given. (Or feel confidence with a particular Dr.). It is becoming more common for neoadjuvant (pre-surgery) chemo to be used for more than just IBC (standard TX for years). Thus it is important to get Chemo Dr involved before surgery for evaluation. For some, there will be a complete response before surgery. For me, I'm glad that my Chemo Dr did a different TX plan for me than what was/is 'usual' for my DX because it worked for me. The 'usual' fory DX is 2 different batches of neoadjuvant chemo, surgery then rads BUT I did 1 neoadjuvant chemo (4 DD A/C), UMX, 1 adjuvant Chemo (12 weekly Taxol), then 25 rads. As you had 19 nodes removed, have you had an appt. with an LET (LymphEdema Therapist) yet for a baseline evaluation and education? As you had nodes removed, you are at risk of developing LE in the future. It does take a PT or OT how has additional education/knowledge to be an LET - not some PT or OT who claims they ''know all about LE'. (Unfortunately, many Drs are woefully ignorant when it comes to LE.)",

If neoadjuvant Chemo is done, it will usually consist of 2 different 'batches' of Chemo (1 example - 4 DD A/C followed by 12 weekly Taxol or other combinations). Neoadjuvant chemo has been used for years with IBC (Inflammatory Breast Cancer) to get it to form a 'lump' as it forms as a 'nest' or in 'bands' making surgery less than optimal. It is now being used more often with other types of BC to get the lump to shrink the mass, get good margins and sometimes even gets a complete response. This allows for less invasive surgery and a better prognosis. A very few of us will do both neoadjuvant and adjuvant Chemo. I did 4 DD A/C (Dense Dose Adriacymin and Cytoxan every 2 weeks) neoadjuvant. Then 2 weeks after last A/C had UMX (had formed a 'lump', shrunk and good margins) and 3 weeks later started adjuvant. Then a week after last Taxol, started 25 rads. My Drs (Chemo and Surgeon) had never expected a complete response but wanted to get 'it' to where Surgeon had a chance of getting it out and then would do adjuvant Chemo (12 weekly Taxol) to 'mop up' any cells that might have 'escaped' surgery. There is no 'One Size Fits All' when it comes to each of us - individually. What is 'right' for one may not at all be correct for someone else. We each enter the 'battle' as different persons just as while there may be similarities for some - no one is exactly the same. Some of us have health issues that have to also be dealt with along with BC TX but some of us have no (or very small/minor) health issues to deal with, different ages, outlooks on life are but a few of the infinity of differences between us all. Our Drs are also very different in their outlook on which TX would be best for each individual.",

The 2nd Education class was before Taxol and was about 1/2 hour then to infusion. My classes were 1 on 1 with an RN but I have seen some 'here' say they had gone to a class that had several in the class and was not immediately before the infusion. I was given a notebook that had all the information to be discussed. Included was the info pn the chemo and related drugs/meds that would be used. It was intended to be a Reference Source.

But what I wanted to pass on is that it is important to be sure that meds are not out dated and are correct for the size/weight of the person. Apparently, based on what I heard from the ParaMeds was that her EpiPen was outdated and not appropriate for her weight. Talked to her this afternoon and was told that 3 more EpiPens had been used. I guess why I wanted to post this is that those of us might have even more issues with wasp srings on LE side. I have had major swelling from wasp stings but have not had an anaphaltic issue ever - jusat major localized swelling. But it since LE have I been stung. I have no idea what a wasp sting in LE arm might result in for anyone. My point is to be sure IF you have had issues - be sure your EpiPen is not out of date and correct for you (weight) personally.

Many of us had quite a few positive nodes but no mets - all 19 of the 19 nodes removed were positive - no mets and still NED (No Evidence of Disease) after 6 1/2+ years. DL not be surprised if full body MRI/CT (with contrast) and/or PET Scans are ordered. As you have positive node(s), these are often done to varify that there are no mets. After you meet with the surgeon you should have more answers (write down all your questions and take it with you to the appt.) but may come away with more questions. Will you be seeing your entire team? A TX plan should be all inclusive - not just a surgeon but also a Chemo Dr (MO) and Rads Dr (RO). Basically - a surgeon 'cuts', a chemotherapy Dr does Chemo and a Rads Dr does rads, each in their own Specialty but for best outcome for you they need to be working together for a comprehensive TX plan. Though surgery is often the first line of TX, it is becoming more common that neoadjuvant (pre- surgery) chemo is used for a better surgical outcome. Be sure to get copies of every test/scan/etc and file them away. They may be needed by you in the future. Also this allows you to actually see what is there - not just a summary. Taking notes is great but using your smart phone (or a tape recorder) what is said is good, if need to clarify later what you were told that is my h better than written notes. Is your surgeon a 'general surgeon' or one who specializes in breast surgery? ER/PR+ that your cancer 'feeds' on estrogen so will probably be on an 'estrogen blocker' for some time. HER2 - means that you will not need a yr of Herseptrin infusions. As you know you will have node(s) removed, request a referral to a LymphEdema Therapist for a pre-surgery baseline evaluation and education. Unfortunately, many Drs are 'clueless' when it comes to LE so we each need to be proactive/our own best advocate with this possible future SE. Hope that gives you some thoughts that help.",

It does not 'come and go' once it presents - antibiotics do not 'help'. There are many probabilities/possibilities for what you say is going on that have nothing to do with any type of BC. Chills would most likely indicate some type of infection. Did you check your temperature? That's always a good starting point when chills show up as that usually indicates an infection of some type - not an indication of BC. While some will present with 'redness/rash', not all of us do - I didn't. There are no 'set in stone' rules that IBC has to follow. As you say it, gets worse during the day and better at night, it is possible that you have developed an allergy/sensitivity to 'something' you are using/wearing. An appointment with a Dermatologist might be in order. Skin issues can be very stubborn to TX and returning to the 'old normal appearance'. The vast majority of those who come here having decided they are IBC after being 'DXd' by 'Dr Quack Google' because of a 'redness/rash', wind up having a skin issue that resolve with the correct meds though it can take time - not overnight will be resolved. An US is better for checking than a mammo when it comes to IBC. IBC does not form the same way that other types of BC do so it 'shows' on US better than on a mammo. As IBC is as rare as it is, most Drs have never actually seen it - GP, OB/GYN and even some Oncologist. You do need to follow up to find out what is going on as 'something' definitely is - but do not jump to the worst unfounded self DX you come up with. Find out, sooner rather than later, no matter what the final DX may be it is always better to know and handle 'it' now.",

For a VERY few of us there are issues that do not 'fit in the norm' and can be challenging for us. Me - I have to have low compression or major swelling within 1/2 hr. Others will need high compression to prevent swelling. I have syndactyly (webbed fingers) so 'normal' gloves are not an option for me - have to be custom for my 'nutsy hands'. Also they don't make OTS (Off The Shelf) sleeves in the compression I need with my measurements. It is possible to developed LE while still in TX depending on your TX plan in addition to after TX. My LE started 1/2 way through 12 weekly adjuvant Taxol (9 weeks after UMX.). Had already done 4 DD A/C neoadjuvant and had a UMX. This TX plan is not what all do but a few of us do. We EACH have to learn what 'works for us and do that for our QOL. It's definitely not the same for all of us. There is 'No One Size Fits All'. Educate yourself and LIVE!",

About 20 min. before end of infusions I would 'wake up' as abruptly (and alert) as I had been before the benadryl had been started. (The oral benadryl I had with A/C - I didn't even 'know I had taken it.) Also had to have the thermostat cranked up as high as it would go and warmed blankets piled on as my temperature was down to dangerously low levels (know I dropped to 94f but think I may have gone lower on at least one occassion). I was hooked up to the Monitoring. Machine continually so was continually being monitored by the Nurse Station.

I happen to be one of those - I have to havs low level compression to prevent major swelling. I am fortunate to have my LET guy that has been 'challenged' by me. Not only do I have compressing level issues but also syndactly (somewhat webbed fingers) which makes it impossible for OTS gloves to be wworn without the webbing being cut causing open/painful sores. He did finally get my custom gloves measurements figured out. My point is only - swelling at one level does not automatically mean that a higher level is the way to go - lighter may be the answer.",

I was told that LE was not very likely as I had no medical issues, was well within 'normal' weight, was 'fit' and very 'active' (still am). It did happen anyway. LE is not limited to only women with BC - it can happen to anyone after any surgery on any part of the body or after a traumatic injury. I have a friend who deals with worse LE in her lower leg from noninvasive knee surgery than I do in my arm with 19 pos. nodes removed. I had a quite serious riding (horse) accident 40+ years ago to my lower leg, Drs 'were sure' LE would probably developed - it never has. Honestly, though it can never be proved, I think that having developed phlebotist from a badly placed IV after 2nd son was born - kept me in hospital 4 extra days. Long story but it presented primarily in elbow and area above/below - my LE issues (other than compression levels) are in the same area. There are so many.variables with each of us.",

Day garments are designed for active time - meaning one is 'up'/moving around, hence active. Night garments are designed for passive time - meaning laying down/sleeping so very little to no movement for hours at a time - hence passive. ",

IDC is the most 'common' type while IBC is only between 1% - 5% of ALL DXd BCs so not 'common' at all. Some Drs have NEVER seen IBC or very few, while others have a lot more expertise in treating it.

It appears that some will have Scans routinely every 6 mths to a yr post TX but not all of us do. The only Scans I've had post TX have been for specific issues that came up - not thought to be IBC related but to be on the safe side and were restricted to the area of issue. Mets always ruled out. The onlytoRI that was a bit of 'routine' was the week before starting Rads was when I saw my Rads Dr immediately before schedules for my 12th adjuvant Taxol. He insisted on a new MRI with contrast so they just rescheduled my Taxol for as soon as the new MRI was done which was cor as soon as I could get there (allI I had to do was go up 2 floors and walk about 400 ft. to get there from the Cancer Center into the Regional Hospital).. I made it back to my last Taxol about an hour and a half. The only 2 'things' that showed up was my seroma which was still 6cm and the developing gall bladder sludge (yes that is a medical term). Remember - we can only give you our personal experiences - not what you (or anyone else) will automatically experience. We are each each unique and BC is not the same for all of us - so there is no 'One Size Fits All' when fighting the Monster.",

When you say you've had all the 'tests', what have you had?  None of my Drs ever questioned me being IBC.  My PA was positive it was IBC when she saw me and sent me to Radiology,  the Radiologist who did the biopsies was positive but could not DX as IBC until the next morning when he had the path report which he did call me at 8 with the report - this was all within a week of finding the enlarged  node.  My surgeon, my Rads Dr and my Chemo Dr never questioned the DX. My biopsies were not punch biopsies but FNAs as the node was very obvious and a couple of spots in breast he thought would be a good idea to check.  At that time, there was no sign of skin involvement. You might want to look into the HRT you're using for hormonal issues.  I went through natural menopause at 44 and never did HRT.  One of my friends, had a HX and she used HRT.   For some time - worked good for her.  Eventually her body 'rebelled' and 'it' caused her lots of problems which did take time to go on from.  Just thoughts. Remember - WE ARE EACH UNIQUE! ",

When I saw my Chemo Dr before the 10th infusion, I talked with him about how completely exhausted I was he told me that it had done about 85% of what it could do so he was leaving it up to me to decide - he was putting in that I could quit at any time IF I wanted to. I didn't quit - one, I'm not quite and had/have always fought harder when the 'going gets tough'. Secondly, 85% of what Taxol could do was not enough - I had entered the 'battle' intent on doing everything offered me to win and I was set on WINNING. My DX is different than yours and thus had a different prognosis. How could I have faced my Hubby (at time of DX had been married 34 yrs) and Son and told them that the IBC had come back when they had taken over everything I needed to do (house, cooking, pets and barn chores) so all I had to do was 'fight' IF I hadn't bothered to do all I could to keep it away? Time frame for me was about 7 mths from presentation to last rad (prrsentation, DX, neoadjuvant Chemo, UMX, adjuvant Chemo, Rads).",

Also, what the airline will pay you for a bag that is never found is not enough to replace a MLD machine. I have no clue as to there being a rental place for a MLD machine at your destination - you might try calling the manufacturer and ask them if they know of that as a possibility. You could try Calli g some Medical Supply businesses (or a local Cancer Facility) to ask if such is possible there. Long shots but would just take a few minutes to ask.

IDC (invasive/Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma) is the most common. The suspected Stage, ER/PR +/- status and HER2 +/-status? Will you be getting a port and what Chemo will you be doing? A lot of your questions I have no answers for as I was never told these things -others may have been it not me. My experiences with Chemo (slightly different with rads though). Before deciding what you want to take with you for infusions - find out what your facility offers. We were offered fruit, crackers, soup, hot beverages, juices. Each cubicle had a reclinner, individual cable TV in them. The glassed in cubicles/rooms had the individual TV, a hospital bed and a thermostat for that room only (Thankfully during the worst of my temperature issues).",

      "Content": "Mar 13, 2016 11:03AM - edited Mar 13, 2016 11:06AM by Kicks A Bone Scan is different than a DEXA test (bone density test). A DEXA is quite common for older women as it is to check tje density of the bones in relationship to Osteopenia/Osteoporosis, not a DX with BC. It is done yearly if/once you are Osteopenia or Osteoporsis to monitor the density and rather of not the med is working to keep the density up and possible change the med if necessary. For some of us, we already were dealing with osteopenia or osteoporosis before going on estrogen blockers which can increase the risk of either or if already there cause it to progress. A Bone Scan is done with contrast for possible bone metastases throughout the body. For me, 'thanks to a huge family HX of osteoporosis, I had been dealing with with osteopenia for many yrs before IBC DX, but did go on to osteoporosis after Chemo and going onfemara/letrozole. I keep it under control by taking Fosamax/alendronate, just had my DEXA a couple of weeks ago and 'holding constant' after almost 6 yrs. It has to be remembered that there are many issues/things that come into play as to the appropriate time frame for TX. Yes, for some of us/some types - time is of the essence but for some time is not as critical. There are many different TX protocols with surgery not always the 'best first' option. A good TX plan comes from the Team - not just the Surgeon but also the Chemo Dr and Rads Dr for a complete plan. As I said - it was 17 days for me from DX to starting neoadjuvant Chemo but I am IBC and days can be critical (some have a less time frame) but I never felt I was being 'rushed' into anything. My Drs were very 'upfront' and honest with me, being sure I understood all we discussed. I never felt 'hurried' because I asked for better explainations. Perhaps they have discussed with her Daughter more than was told to her or you heard. Because of HIPPA signed consent is necessary to discuss issues with a second party. Though they have not gone with me to any of my appts, Hubby and Son are both listed with every Dr I have IF they feel the need to ask questions I can't answer - they never have called any. You mention your friend is in \"fair health - multiple medical issues\" - this can mean a lot of different 'things' that could play hugely on the TX available or appropriate ones for QOL. For me I was a very active 'outdoor woman' when DXd at 63. My only 'health issues' were osteopenia and osteo-arthritis in upper back (both for yrs). At 69, I'm still a very active 'outdoor woman' and do any and eveything I want to do - still have osteo-arthritis in upper back, osteoporosis instead of osteopenia. You may not know 'everything' that is going on and the reasons for medical plans - which may be based on her entire DX of all issues non- BC related. Again - as it is a Center it would be good for her to see the Nutritionist for input on diet and to see the Nurse Navigator for a wealth of information. It is great for her to have your support.",

Of course anything is possible - no matter how unlikely - so a Dr needs to be seen - perhaps a Dermatologist. As rare as IBC is, there are MANY Drs who have never seen it. IBC is RARE - only between 1% - 5% of all DIAGNOSED types of BC (DCIS, IDC, ILC, IBC) are IBC. It is rapid in presentation (hours) and aggressive in progression (days). Once it presents it progresses - does not 'get better'. IBC does not have any 'set in stone' rules' it has to/does follow in how it presents to all of us. For me (and others), there was never any 'redness/rash'. It presented as an enlarged node overnight. As my PA was out of town, it took me a week to see her. She ordered new mammo, which turned into an US and biopsies. The next morning at 8, I had the expected path. report - IBC. In the next 17 days til I started neoadjuvant (pre surgery) Chemo it did progress. IBC is NOT an immediate 'death sentence' in today'sworld. I'm 7+ yrs since DX (diagnosis), saw my PA last week for my every 6 mth check-ups and am doing great/living and loving every day to the utmost - still NED (No Evidence of Disease)!

A gauntlet may not be the best answer for you either.  My Guy has always insisted on gloves even though I have very little LE issues in my hand.  He was right!  I insisted on getting 1 for riding so I had better feel than the glove gives - it does work for feel when I am really working them but have to go back to glove when not riding. The palm side of gauntlet or glove will not contour to it.  It 'cups in'.  I don't know what company you are getting from but Juzo has pads for palm if you need it.  Tthey also have pads to go in pockets on the back of your glove if you need.!  My garments are custom and I have the pockets on back or hand as it just feels the best - do not use the pads.  It took a long time to get my gloves right - never knew it but my hands are some what webbed so they really have to be different to not literally cut webbing.  Dots at top - I don't know how long they 'show' - never thought about it.   The band they are on is so much more comfy for me than the sleeve I had that did not have the band (returned).  It stays nicely in place but without it that one rolled and slipped BAD. I am in a very different situation than most are.  My fantastic care is through VA and my CLET Guy is also my fitter/orderer.  I do not understand just going to someone who is not a CLET to decide what you need (a 'fitter').  Just me and my experiences and thoughts. added - You should have gotten care (washing/drying) information with them.  Mine say can wash and dry in a machine on cool or hand wash/air dry.  No fabr4ic softener or dryer sheets.",

There are many who have surgery without ever seeing a Chemo or Rads Dr because the Surgeon never suggested they seek a complete TX Plan before surgery. Remember - they are all Specialist in their field - very basically, Surgeons cut, Chemo Drs do Chemo and Rads Drs do radiation individually but they should be a team working together, not individually, for the TX Plan. Not only will you see them individually but they will undoubtably take your case to the Board for input from other Drs at the Facility or if one (or more) is on the Board at other Facilities it may be taken to them too (mine was).",

Have you researched information about it? If you do you will find that the 'symptons' you are having sound like they are more closely associated with yours than with IBC (or other types of BC) which did not present in the biopsies. The only way to DX IBC is via a biopsy of a possibly suspicious area. As you are experiencing a skin issue that is known to be present (biopsy) and not resolving on it's own - then an appt with a Dermatologist (skin specialist) would be called for to address the present perrivascular dermatitis. I am not an expert at all but all I have found about perivascular dermitis - 'it' is more similar to what you say you are experiencing than IBC would likely be. Of course, 'anything' is possible, but work to get the KNOWN to be present issue under control before obsessing on 'something' that is not showing (via US, mammo, MRI and biopsies) to be present. 'Something' is going on and the sooner it is taken care of the better - especially with breastfeeding. The 'symptoms' you are having are not exclusive to IBC but common with many other issues that are much more common than IBC which is rare and rapid in progression. The weight loss could be from MANY reasons - and totally unrelated to 'anything' else going on with you now. It is important to get appropriate TX for all the issues - sooner better than later. No one here can tell you what is going on, only your Drs can and different issues require different Specialist to deal with it.  Lovelife - sgarr said that she has had an US and an MRI in addition to a mammo - nothing showed on any of them plus skin punch biopsies. The biopsies showed perivascular dermitis which apparently presents usually like her 'symptons'. Didn't see where you reported what your DX was - thinking/hoping it was good. ",

Little kids on tall horses do look strange.  I had gotten the Boys a little pony to share when they were 3 and 4.  A couple of years later I found a fantastic older 'babysitter' that was being starved (police were involved).  The Boys looked hilarious out riding together - older one on his 16.2hh TB and younger one on the 10hh pony.  (A hand/hh is 4\" so one was on a horse that was 66\" to withers and the other on a pony that was 40'.)  There are more than one discipline that go over jumps - the 2 most common are jumpers and hunters.  Very basically jumpers only deal with rather or not the fences remain up - height, spped and clean are what mattters and for hunters form/correctness is what matters.  Internationally only jumpers matter.  Of course there are also field hunters which follow the hounds.  There is 'dressage' and 'Dressage'.   'dressage' is simply a French word meaning training so any time you work your horse you are doing dressage BUT Dressage is so much more - it can be equated to an Equine Ballet.  There are many different levels in competion starting with VERY basic going up to VERY complex that require YEARS of training to attain.  Combined Training/Eventing/3 day encompass Dressage, Jumping and Cross Country (jumps over a several mile long course). BIRDS - A hat will not protect me!  Wild birds do not bother me at all (well the geese at the parks do - they definately ATTACK) - it is 'barnyard' birds and house birds (canaries, finches, parakeets, parrots, etc.) that are going to attack me and bite/peck me - HORRIBLE.    Big Boats - Thanks to happenings when I was a child I can not go on one even tied to the pier - it is going to SINK.  Hubby spent 20 yrs in the USN and in all thosse years I only went on a carrier twice and had to stand at the open hangar bay door so I could see out.  I love 'little' boats - yacht size and smaller - we have a 16' boat.  It's just huge boats (ocean liner and air craft carriers) that petrify me.

I will be doing a 10k  'climb' at the Crazy Horse Memorial VolksMarch (Custer, SD).  It is rather strenous as you start in the parking lot and then go up to the arm of the carving before walking back down.  Sorry for rambling but I refuse to not live every day to the utmost - none of us know what tomorrow holds anyway.  With each step of our journey throughout life, we can learn something positive from the darkest times if we but 'listen' and learn.  Just my thoughts.

I was gotten in immediately to see my LET as the sooner appropriate TX is started - the better. He is not a PT but an OT who is also a LET. Fit AND compression level of day garments is critical. We are each unique - not all of us 'fit' into OTS (Off The Shelf) garments. Also some of us need different levels of compression. All of my day garments HAVE to be 'custom' (as in made to my measurements). My hand is very pressure sensitive and has to have low level compression or it puffs up majorly rapidly. My hands are also somewhat 'webbed' (Syndactyly) so any OTS glove literally cuts into skin between fingers (read make open sores that HURT). My night garment is a Solaris Tribute. With it, I use a medical 'opera length' Isotoner glove under it per my LET guy's recommendations. I also have 2 Solaris 'over sleeves' that I can use over it if needed. I do not wrap (though I could if needed) or do MLD myself. What works best for me is wearing my day garments, my night garment and using my FlexiTouch daily.

There are many possibilities/probabilities to account for your ongoing issues that have nothing to do with IBC (or DCIS/IDC/ILC). IBC is rare - only between 1% - 4% of all DXd types of BC. It is rapid in presentation and aggressive in progression. It usually appears literally overnight (within hours) and progresses quickly. It does not 'come and go', it does not always present the same in all of us that are actually IBC. It has no 'set in stone rules' it has to (or does) follow exactly the same in all of us. I can only say how it presented in me. I never had a 'rash/redness'. One night there was an enlarged lymph node under my arm that had not been enlarged the night before. I saw my PA a week later, had a mammo, an US and FNB biopsies that afternoon, had path. report the next morning - IBC. During the next 17 days, saw Surgeon, Chemo Dr, Rads Dr, Bone, CT & MRI with contrast, PET Scans, port implanted and started neoadjuvant (pre surgery) chemo. During those 24 days from first presentation to starting TX, the node continued to enlarge, breast enlarged, nipple inverted, and peau d'orange developed. I did not have any pain, 'itchiness' or rash/redness in that time. I do not know anything about possible issues with breast feeding as I did not bf either of my sons.

Of course there were some other SEs but it's all in the past and I'm still here as active as ever. BTW - I was 63 when DXd - now 70, living and loving life everyday.",

It involves injesting and or injection of nuclear 'stuff' that will cause it to 'light up' on mets. It is more commonly used with some types of BC than other types and for different Stages or Grades. Does not automatically mean \"We think there's mets\" - but to be on the safe side. It is also not unusual to have full body CT/MRI with contrast or PET Scan before TX for the Drs (Surgeon/Chemo Dr/Rads Dr) to have a more complete idea of what is needed in the TX plan. A Bone Density Test (DEXA) is a 'test' not a Scan'. They are very different and used for different reasons. A DEXA is used to check the density of bone dealing with potential Osteopenia and Osteoporosis. It simply involves x-rays and is not associated with a BC DX. There is no nuclear 'stuff' - just X-rays of the hip area to check how dense the bone is. I've been getting them for MANY years (long before IBC) because of a huge family HX of osteoporosis. They are commonly done for post menopausal women and ones on estrogen blockers (ER+ BC). Sounds like they are just being thorough. If you are concerned - call your Dr(s) and ask for an explaination that only your Dr(s) can give you personally knowing all the mammos/US and biopsies reports. No one here can tell you why the decision was made - we can only give our personal TX plans which is absolutely not the same for each of us.

Once the correct DX is know and the correct TX being done - it may require a lot longer to return to the look/feel before the issue presented. See an actual DR who SEES you and your skin.

At 63, I definitely was not breast feeding when DXd.

No one here can tell you what is going on - so.ething is BUT only a Dr who actually sees you can DX you! If you are concerned and want to find out what is the issue(s) and get the appropriate TX (treatment) if any is needed -see you DR for a DX (diagnosis) sooner rather than later.",

Until you have the path. report, do not decide that it will be the 'worse' you can think of.  Being in the medical field, you already know that infection or inflammation can be present without \"fever, chills, etc.\".   There are many possibilities as to what is going on with you but imparative to find out what it is sooner rather than later. Basal Cell Carcinoma can present as a reddened area.  About a year ago, I found a small reddened area on my upper outer arm on IBC side.  My first thought was IBC mets as skin is one place they like to go.  Saw my PA, she thought it was not mets and got me an appt with Dermatology.  Biopsy was done and no signs of IBC mets but was positive for BCC so it was removed with good margins. We are all so different in how we handle our Life's Journey.  I can only speak for myself - I refuse to dwell in the darkness of assuming the worst immediately.  It only drains the strenght we will need for whatever fight we MIGHT be facing once we actually know 'something'.  I will live every day, minute, I have to the best of my ability in light/'sunshine' - not the darkness of fear.  There are absolutely no guarantees for 'tomorrow' in anything/anyway.  Just my thoughts/beliefs - not necessarily anyone else's.",

Though IBC has no 'set in stone rules' it follows, it did not present with your 'issues' of 'tenderness' and a dimple' (or progress to them) for me. It was 7 days from presentation to DX and another 17 days til started neoadjuvant chemo. Stay away from 'Dr Quack Google'! There is fantastic info/resources to be found there - BUT - there is also a bunch of bogus 'junk' there.  Added: At this time you have nothing going on that is in the realm of 'Urgent/Emergency Care' facilities. If there are changes that present - possibly depending on what they are. UC/ER are no for DXing a possiblity of some BC.",

It has 3 sections to the garment - 1 does upper leg and lower abdomen , 1 does upper body/chest and an arm sleeve does the entire arm. The arm portion is attached to the the chest portion. When started air pressure is programmed to start massaging the leg/lower abdomen, then no es to the chest and then to the arm in sections for 1/2 hr.

Talk to your LET about it. If you google flexitouch, you can find the website for them. (It's www.tactilemedical.com . There are many different garments that are available for different parts of the body depending on what area is affected. I don't know the price for them but not cheap at all. It is my understanding that most insurance companies will cover at least a portion of the cost. VA got mine for me so I don't have personal knowledge of it's price - it was ordered and I got it.",

On a side note - as you had note as you had nodes removed.  Request a referral to see a LymphEdema Therapist for an evaluation now.  (Not just a PT but someone with education specificallly in dealing with LE - my LET guy is also an OT.)  Any time nodes are removed, LE is a possibility - even years later - so should get evaluation AND education, before it becomes an issue.  Unfortunately, not all Drs are as knowledgeable about the potential for LE.  You might want to come to the LE Forum here.

I can't begin to comprehend what you've been put through. I did have an area (about 1\") open up about 2 1/2 weeks after 2nd C-section. Called my Dr and was told to get in as fast as I could safely. Within a 1/2 hr of getting to the hospital I was up in a room and TX starting. Spent 2 nights there and went home with instructions to flush it 3 times a day with hydrogen peroxide and then flush with saline and to call immediately if any negative changes or if after hours - go straight to ER. Also told he wanted to see me in 2 weeks but it was Christmas time and Hubby had leave and we were going home so was told to be sure I saw a Dr there - I did see the GP who I'd seen for many yrs. It did heal fine with no more issues. My other suggestion is to - document, Document, DOCUMENT everything. Use your Smart Phone to get pictures now and as 'it' progresses (even as healing developes when it does). This will prove exactly how/what it 'looks like' factually. Not just your words but visual proof that is undeniable. Have you seen an LET (LymphEdema Therapist) yet? This is a good idea to do after an surgery to get a baseline evaluation and education. With all the issues you are having it would definitely be a good idea. I understand not swimming with an open wound but do not understand why you can't fish.

We are each so unique and there is no one 'right way'. Talk with the BC Nurse Navigator at your facility - they are a wealth of information in all things dealing with any 'stuff' and can give you input on so many 'things' BC related. She should be able to give you information about any local Mastectomy Salons that specialize in mastectomy supplies and have a Certified Fitter there. It is vitally important to get the correct prosthesis - there are a multitude of different sizes, shapes, shades - there is no 'one sizes fit all'. Where I live there is no Mast. Salon in over 300 miles but one of the local Medical Supply stores has a Certified Fitter and a small supply on hand. If the do not have what is best/works best for you, they will order in and then you go in for a fitting and get what is best for you/what you like - they send the rest back. Where I go, they do not keep a supply of smaller 'anything' (32/34; A/B) so mine have to be ordered in. What I did after my UMX, was just keep wearing the bras I already had and used a soft puff that the local ACS sent me in the Care Package they sent me. It was cold so I always wear my 'winter uniform' anyway - a turtleneck or flannel shirt under a baggy sweatshirt. UMX was Oct 21 and I got my 'good' pros in Feb. I was told to wait a little while so surgical swelling had gone away making a better fit possible. I have always liked/worn underside bras - still do. There are many really cute/sexy mast. bras if that is what 'you' like (I do). Do not have to have 'granny bras' unless that is what you like/want. Get what YOU like and are comfortable with. I do occasionally see a bra I really like in a store - I buy it and then sew a pocket in for pros. What is your Chemo Dr telling you about your TX plan? It is a team effort between Chemo, rads and surgeon - not just one. I can't give any input on insurance. My care is through VA and what I need is covered.",

What was the type - IDC/ILC/IBC? Makes a difference in initial TX plan - surgery first is not always the first TX plan. Neoadjuvant Chemo ( help pre- surgery) is the SOP for one type and becoming more common with others that are advanced to attack and shrink the mass(es) hopefully for a complete response,, but at least to make surgery less invasive and with good margins. How well is she healed from mast.? How long ago was it? 1). My time frame was a week from 'it' first presented to having the DX at 8 the next morning (Fri) had the path. report - IBC. Saw my Surgeon on Mon, Rads Dr on Wed., Chemo Dr on Thurs and then 17 days after DX started neoadjuvant A/C after a lot of Scans, tests and port implant. 2) Only her Drs can have the information to suggest the possible TX plans. Her health issues come into playing, also depending on what they are as to possible options. I found the weekly adjuvant Taxol 'not nice' at all as I was completely EXHAUSTED the entire 12 weeks. The 4 neoadjuvant DD A/C (every 2 week Adriamycin/Cytoxan) was easy. For others - it's reversed. If she has heart issues then Adriamycin would not be an option as it can be be hard on the heart. But her Drs should have more information that is pertinent to her. 3) An appointment the the Nutritionist at the Facility can give a lot of input on nutrition/food for support. There are many 'things' that can/do give the body support in fighting the 'Monster' when added to medical TX - but not replace with unfounded 'folklore' claims.(Remember that Laetrile was going to end all cancers - WRONG!) 4) If it were me (or a loved one), I would have already gotten a second opinion before just jumping straight into surgery. Suggest to her before her next appt, to get a note pad and write down all the questions she comes up with to ask the Dr, make a second copy to hand to the Dr. She could take her smart phone or a tape recorder to the appt and record exactly what the Dr actually says - not TRY to remember later from notes what might have been taken.

It is important, early on, to see a LymphEdema Therapist ( not some PT who claims to 'know all about' LE but has never had formal education) for an evaluation, measurements, education. njmae - please get a referral to a specialist so you can be educated.  I can only speak for myself.  Even IF you ever develope LE - not everyone does - it does not keep you from living/doing what you want to unless you allow it to.  I do deal with LE but to me it's basically just a small 'incovience' that is handlable and does not slow me down at all.  Actually the more physical 'stuff' I do the better it is. Yesterday I mowed my yard and the neighbor's with my push mower, I have approx. 4 acres to mow (again with my push mower) in the next few days for a company I made a deal with - I keep the area mowed and then in Oct, he makes a healthy donation to the BC  section of the Center I went to.  (I case you haven't figursed out I LOVE to mow grass.)    I garden, I ride my bicycle and my horses, we have a boat, we  fish.  Since  LE I have a few new other hobbies - I flyfish, tie my own flies, have learned how to built rods (have built 5), do flint knapping (making arrow points/blades) and my latest is carving Woodfellows (taking a tree knot and carving a face on it). I know that much of what I like doing is not what many women would want to do, BUT LE does not prevent you from doing what you want and living.  As I said I do deal with LE - wear day garments, night garments, use my FlexiTouch (MLD machine) daily so slight inconviences but doesn't stop me from doing anything I want/need to do.  We are each different so need education and do what works for us, individually, not anyone else.

Any area of the body areas can be effected by LE - not just those of us after breast cancer surgery.  LE in legs is a SE for men after prostrate surgery.  One friend had minor non-invasive knee surgery which resulted in fairly significant lower LE.  She has more issues than I have to deal with even though I had 19 positive nodes removed.  There are others I know who deal with it (LE) at lower levels due to injuries but won't go into all.  I had to deal with LE with a high level competetive horse after a serious trauma injury.

I was a bit suprized that garments would be allowed in OR as they are not 'sterile'.  But then after more thought - in most situtations - no OR is really totally 100% sterile or getting there or away.  I did take a 'clean' set (a freshly washed set) with me to change into when I put my 'gown' on when getting ready. There is a world of difference between taking a nap (or just sitting at a meeting or on the couch for some prolonged time with little movement) and sleeping the entire night.  Day garments are designed to be 'active' as in no really prolonged times of little to no movement over and over (as in all night every night).  Night garments are 'passive, designed for extended periods with very little, to no, movents over long time. Forgot to add - when  had my retina surgery last Sept, the private Surgical Hospital had 'Pink Sleeves' to go on arm even if you weren't wearing your garments.t",

Well, other than with the first sleeve and glove because they were too high compression for me and caused swelling. Unfortunately, many Drs are woefully uneducated when it comes to LE - even ones who should be more knowledgeable. I was fortunate in that both my Chemo Dr and Surgeon noticed mine before I did while still minimal.

Such is life and I'll take life over the alternative. Putting my pros. in my bra (or swimsuit) is not a 'necessity' to LIVE. It is what I believe if 'right' for me. I put it in it's pocket, put on bra and that's it - nothing to think about as far as I'm concerned. Others are different as to what is 'right' for them. There is no one best way to handle anything in life for all because ALL are not the same. We have to do what is best for us individually - not what anyone else says is 'the way to go'. \"To thine own self be true.\"",

As others have mentioned,with several of your symptoms, thyroid could be causing them. If you haven't had a thyroid test it would be a good idea to be sure and either rule it out or rule it in, so can move on to checking other possibilities. Have you been checked for diabetes?

Unfortunately very few Drs know 'diddly-squat' about LE or how to handle it/deal with it individually. An LET will either be a PT (Physical Therapist) or OT (Occupational Therapist) with additional education. if you haven't already seen an LET - do so for a baseline and education about it. 'It' is not as simple as just walking into a supply house and 'somebody' selling/ordering garments to you. Besides the size/measurements, there is also the compression level. The wrong compression level can do more harm than good. Weird me - I have to have low compression or I puff up huge quickly - especially hand. There is no one way for all to handle their LE as we are each so unique but there is a lot of information that applies pretty much the same but needs 'tweeking' for different ones of us. For me, it's day garments all the time I am 'up' and my garments have to be custom as OTS (Off The Shelf) are impossible for me to wear (gloves especially as I have webbed fingers - syndactyly). I also have a night garment to wear while sleeping. And a FlexiTouch MLD that I use daily. But not all need what I do. I am very active and I find the more I do the better my LE is. My LET guy (who is an OT) tells me to do any and everything I want to which includes riding (our horses and my bicycle), mowing yards with my push mower, flyfishing (he's a fly fisher too), boating/canoeing, among other 'things'. For hiking, I have a hiking stick that I like to use and it also deters loose dogs that want to run up. I find warm/hot weather is better than cold but for many it's the other way around. Where we live, winters are brutal so it's the Base Gym for keeping active but doesn't add up to as much as I do when it's nice and warm/hot out. Remember that not all ever have to deal with LE but it makes sense to get information to try to protect yourself. Unfortunately, for some we still developed LE. Has you Dr told you to not allow BP or blood draws on the surgery arm?",

It does not always present with a 'redness/rash'. There are many skin infections that do and it takes the correct antibiotic to TX it - not every antibiotic will work on every infection. Find out with the appropriate Dr (specialist) what is going on - sooner rather than waiting a couple more months.

Competent Drs do not order what they consider unnecessary invasive test(s) - 'just because' someone is obsessed with wanting it. The Derm. may order one IF they deem is medically necessary. Skin issues do present first to some - but not all! Mine was DXd via FNBs (lymph node and mass in breast). There were no skin issues present at the time (never had redness). Skin issues on the breast are quite common and seldom have any relationship to any type of BC. Skin is the largest organ of the body, covering the entire body so it's only logical that issues will present with it - then it's time to see the Dermatologist who is the Specialist whose expertize is skin.

Our bodies do not all react the same to the same TX. Hasn't you Medical Oncologist taken your case to the Board/Team at your Facility for the best of their combined knowledge? I know that neoadjuvant A/C was considered,to be the first best TX choice for me but if it hadn't 'worked' - there were other options. When I started adjuvant Taxol, again my TX plan had been discussed and I was given 3 options to choose from with 1 being their best recommendation - weekly Taxol whichh is what I chose. (They are,the experts - not me!) I do not know the differences between Taxol and Taxotere or the reason for using one instead of the other. They are both within the same 'group' - Taxane. Taxol ( Paclitaxel) is from the Pacific Yew tree in the Pacific NW - Taxotere (Ducetaxel) is from European Yew trees. Why do you want Taxotere instead of Taxol other than someone with an 'App' who has never seen you or has any of your records tells you to? If you do not believe/have trust in the Dr that is going to actually be treating you - get a 2nd opinion from a Dr that actually sees you personally/physicallly - not somebody found through \"Dr Quack Google\" or an 'App' that may not have any reliability. Get more information but be sure of the authenticity of it and IF it applies to you.",

'Hormone Replacement Therapy' is not used after BC TX.  For those of us who are ER+, estrogen blockers (Hormone Therapy) are used to keep our estrogen from feeding any cancer cells that may come back.  There are different types used that work somewhat differently - some for pre-menopausal and some for post menopausal.  I've been on Femara/letrozole for 4 yrs and will be forever as it stands now.  Herceptin is used for a year for those who are HER2+ and is an IV. What chemo is the Dr suggesting?  You Profile says you've already done XYZ -  edit - the Profile no longer has any info in it.. Different types of BC have different protocol but there can be different ones used based on how different we each are and our Drs thoughts as to what is best for us.  I have no personal knowledge of ILC so I don't know the usual SOP is with it.    I'm IBC and my TX plan was a bit different than most other IBCers.   The usual is to do 2 different 'batches' of chemo, then surgery and then rads.  I did 4 DD A/C, followed by UMX, followed by 12 weekly Taxol and then rads.  There is no \"One Size Fits All\"! Again - in my opinion - if you are uncomfortable with your Dr and he/she does not explain everything to you in words/ways you can understand - get a second opinion. ",

Sooner is better than waiting til LE developed (IF IT DOES). Be sure that the PT or OT does have the additional education in LE - my LET guy is an OT.",

There are many possibilities as to what has been going on for quite a long time for IBC. Besides the fact that IBC is rare - only between 1% - 5% of all types of DXd BC, it is aggressive and rapid in presentation and progression - literally can present over night and progress in days. It doesn't just 'hang around' for months on months. Yes ; it is possible to be IBC and not present with 'redness/rash' or pain/itchiness - there are no 'set in stone' 'rules' that IBC (or any type of cancer HAS to follow exactly with everyone - we are each so unique. In my case (others have had different presentations), I never had any ' redness/rash' or pain/itchiness. In the 24 days (7 days to see my PA, DX the next day and 16 more days) from it presenting literally overnight in a lymph node under arm to starting neoadjuvant Chemo. In that time, the node continued to enlarge, breast enlarged, nipple inverted and peau d'orange developed BUT there was never any 'redness/rash', pain, itchiness or heat. This presentation is not what all experience - but it is what I experienced 6 1/2 yrs ago and I am still here and still NED. (My annual mammo had been done less than 6 weeks before and had been as all previous yrs with no changes.). I have not heard the term \"not the biopsy floated\". What is that supposed to mean? No one here can tell you what is going on (of course, anything is possible no matter how unlikely) as we are not medical professions who are actually seeing you (or any of your reports/scans/tests/etc.). Do not jump to unfounded conclusions before you have the facts. The vast majority who come here having decided on IBC as a DX never get that DX.",

Another point - there will be some 'pebbles' who will say lots of totally 'stupid things to our loved ones.

It takes it an hour to run through the entire cycle.  It has 3 sections to the garments it uses - one is for the upper leg and lower body, another section is the upper body and the other is the arm.  When it runs it starts with the lower body/leg section to drain the nodes in that area first so that the other areas can then drain into them easier. It then moves up to the upper body area then to shoulder, upper arm, elbow, forearm, wrist, hand.  It focuses for about 5 min in each of these areas then it reverses and starts at the fingers then up over and down ending on the leg, going directly from one section immediately, not working in isolated areas but continual movement for the last 30 mins of the cycle.  (I've never been told by my LE guy or the manufacturer to do 'self MLD' before using the machine.) You mention that you have a sleeve but not a glove - I've been told to always wear a glove (or gauntlet) when you wear a sleeve.   The compression level can make a difference in rather they work right or not - for me heavy compression makes mine much worse but light works better.   Also not all of us are built to fit the Off The Shelf sizes so some have to have custom made (like me.)  At night I wear a night garment with an 'opera lenth' Isotoner glove under it. Remember that we are each unique in how our body reacts.  For me, the more activities I do, the less issues I have.  Actually when I do have some issues going on I find that tatting will pull the swelliing down.  The same is true with fly tying and fishing rod building (my newest passion that I was able to start/learn to do thanks to the Healing Waters program for Veterans [www.projecthealingwaters.org]).   I also have less problems during the summer when I can get out and mow my yard and several others who need help.  Certainly what works for me may not work for all but I do what works for me because it does work FOR ME.",

Would you rather see them 'freaking out'? Neoadjuvant Chemo (Chemo before surgery) is not unusual. It is the standard for some BCs and is becoming more common for others. The idea is to get the cancer to form 'better' (get clear margins, etc), shrink, etc. Some of us will do both neoadjuvant and adjuvant (post surgery) chemo followed by rads. Are you having a CT, MRI or PET to check rest of body? If you are doing Chemo, will you be getting a port implanted? (Makes Chemo a lot easier on veins.) Time frame for starting neoadjuvant Chemo can vary quite a bit based on many 'things'. For me, it was 17 days after DX but I'm a different type that is very aggressive and rapid.",

I had no skin issues during rads just a very slight pink after number 24. Unfortunately, though, the day after last (25th) rad, the entire area (mid-chest around to back and up side of neck). that had been irradiated was blistered - from then on it got worse. (Have the scars to prove it .). What finally healed it was Domeboro soaks. Last Rad was in early March and last scab finally came off on June 29. If you don't trust your Dr find another one!

They come in different compression levels (and fit) and not all levels work the same for all of us. I have to have low level compression for my hand especially or it blows up HUGE within an hour. They also only come in certain measurement sizes and not all of us fit into those sizes or that go with different compression levels. If you are having hand AND finger isssues, a gauntlet will probably not help you as there is no finger support. For some of us, we HAVE TO HAVE custom garments to even be able to wear them. I have issues with fingers being somewhat webbed and OTS (Off The Shelf) gloves literally cut into the webbing making very painful open sores. I also can not get OTS sleeves that fit me either so my sleeves also have to be custom. There are night sleeves that are 'pull on' for night wear so you don't have to wrap every night (some do choose to wrap anyway but I don't). Day garments work as 'active' meaning that you need to be 'active' (durning the day/moving around); night garments work as 'passive' meaning they work while you are not being active (sleeping). I'm not familiar with the term \"reduction kit\". I am a very active 'outdoor woman' and what works for me (for 6 yrs) is wearing my day garments daily, my night garments nightly and running my FlexiTouch (MLD machine) for a cycle daily which keeps my LE under control and has for 6 yrs.

My Solaris Tribute night sleeve has a gauntlet hand - with my 'wacadoodle' hands, it would be almost impossible to get a gloved hand I could tolerate so mine is a gauntlet hand and to give my fingers the light support they need, I use a medical opera length Isotoner glove under it (my LET guy's idea) which works great for me. I also have 2 Solaris over sleeves I can use IF needed. Kinesio tape does work great for some - it didn't for for me at all. We are so unique - what 'works' for o e does not for all so have to get as much information as possible and figure out what works for us individually. That does take finding an LET with knowledge/education who is working with YOU. No 2 of us are the same and it is a learning time to find out what works (individually) for each of us which can be very different.

The 'radiologist' did a biopsy on an area that be/she suspected to be a cyst. IF he/she had known for a fact that it was a cyst then no reason to biopsy it. Perhaps the Radiologist did miss the 'benign cyst' but the path. report was not \"consistent with cyst tissue\". Biopsy takes tissue - pathology determines what the tissue is. Until the path. report is available - a biopsy can not DX.",

I am a firm believer in getting vaccinations as for almost all they work. I get all my shots and stay current with them. IF not gotten there is no way that they can work.

I now my yard (and a couple of other yards to help out others) with my push mower, ride (our horses and my bicycle), garden, fish/flyfish, anything I decide I want to do. The first Sat of June, I'll be doing the Crazy Horse Memorial Volksmarch which is 10k (6.2 miles). It starts in the parking lot at the building and winds through the woods at the base of the carving and then up to the arm in front of the face. Then the route back down to parking lot. The only time that people are allowed to go up on the carving is on the Volksmarch. Quite a spectacular view from up there. Since DX, I have always fished but after DX I took up fly fishing. Hubby bought me a rod and reel and got me some lessons from the local Fly Fishing store. I then took a few fly tying classes at Canellas.(Hubby got me the needed tools). Then I got in Project Healing Waters (a nationwide private program for Veterans) and learned how to build rods. So far I have built several fly rods and some spinning rods - working on a very customized spinning rod Son. I have also learned how to do Flint Knapping (making arrow points and blades) and how to carve Woodfellow. Trying to teach my bunny to do Rabbit Agility (basically it is same thing as Dog Agility but for rabbits). If it ever gets warm enough this summer, we are going to try kayaking. (We are under a Blizzard Warning as I write this.) So yeah I stay busy having fun. By the way, I'll be 69 years young next month.",

His office has a voucher good until next June for my eye care and will be extended. I do have to say that for me (and Hubby), could not ask for better or more prompt care through VA - be it at VA Facilities or immediately outsourced/referred when the needed care was not available at the local Facility.",

The objective is to get the cancer to shrink and get good margins to get a better surgical outcome. It has been SOP for years with IBC {Inflammatory Breast Cancer) but is being done more today other types also. In some cases, a complete response is possible but not with all. Many who do neoadjuvant will do 2 different batches of Chemo but for some of us we will do both neoadjuvant Chemo and adjuvant Chemo (after surgery). Radiation may also follow for some. For some there will also be Estrogen Blockers for years if ER/PR+. If she is HER2+, then she will be getting Herceptrin infusions for a year. Do you know which Chemo she is doing? Or if she will be doing another Chemo also neoadjuvant? If you go with her to her infusions, ask the Chemo RNs about her TX plan. Also if she has you listed with her Drs as approved to be given HIPPA info, you could call and talk with her Dr or his/her PA/NP/RN for explanation of what is being done and why it is considered to be the best TX for her so you will have a better understanding and can possibly help her better understand. Remember - not all different Chemo 'work' the same on every cancer or in everyone's individual body. There is no one TX option that is correct for each unique person - we are each so unique (even if it seems that DXs are the same); our Drs are also unique and (thankfully) do not all treat us exactly the same. In my case, my TX plan was quite different than most other IBCers here. Most will do 2 different Chemo neoadjuvant - I did A/C (Adriamycin and Cytoxan) neoadjuvant and then Taxol adjuvant. Did not get a complete response to A/C, never expected to - just to get it to shrink and have get good margins for surgery which it did give. Then hit 'anything' that might still be 'hiding' with the adjuvant Taxol. As I said, it was a different TX plan than most but it worked for me - Aug will be 7 yrs post DX and still NED (No Evidence of Disease). It would be a good idea to get your Mom to come here and 'talk' about her concerns. Bottom line - no one here can tell her (and you) what is best for her - we can only give our personal experiences which are all different.

Is it basically just 'hemmed' or does it have a a band of slightly different material with little clear dots on it? Makes a lot of difference on the sleeve staying up. I had one sleeve early on that did not have the band and it would not stay up at all but with the band - it stays up no matter how active I am or what I am doing. For me - it wasn't an issue of size but the 'stability' (for lack of a better word) to keep the top where it should stay but didn't. Could also be an issue with length. Last summer while at the local Fair, a Lady came up to me and asked how did I keep my sleeve up (I had a tank top on so of course my sleeve/glove was visible) as she couldn't keep hers up above her elbow. She did not have the band on hers and when she pulled it up as high as it would go, it only went between 2/3 - 3/4 of where mine goes. Do have to say that me being 'leaner' than she was might come into play but - a good fit is a good fit no matter the size of the person. The OTS (Off The Shelf) garments, while they do cover a range of sizes/differences will not always be suitable/fitable for all of us in the compression level we have to have. They do not make OTSs in the size/measurements and compression level that are possible for me to wear. So mine have to be Custom made to my measurements. When you get the 'smallest' garment, if it doesn't fit then you will have to go with Custom garments which are made for your measurements/needs. They are 'pricier' but what is needed can be gotten. You didn't mention your glove/gauntlet - how does it fit? Sleeves should not be worn without glove or gauntlet. Again for me- gloves are a huge issue and took a while even with Custom ones to get them 'right' as I deal with Syndactyli (webbing between fingers) so what will fit someone with normal hands will not fit me and will literally cut into the webbing (PAINFUL). My LET guy is fantastic - the more perplexing I was, the more he researched and sought out others knowledge to give me the best. Do not wear day garments (sleeve/glove) overnight. Day garments are designed for active time (being up and about); night garments are designed for passive time (sleeping/not moving around).",

It was my Dr who first noticed it and quickly got me into my OT LET guy. I was not given a sleeve and glove until LE developed - from what I've read of other's experiences, getting garments that quickly after surgery is very uncommon. For everyone, it is not as simple as pulling a sleeve and glove off the shelf and it be a good fit or the correct compression level for each of us individually, so just going with the 'middle of the road' levels can actually do harm to some of us. Not all will fit into the OTS garment measurements either. Were you taught MLD or told of what can potentially bring on LE to avoid? Once LE developes (IF it does) - it has to be dealt with life long. Others will be along with their experiences.",

It does not bother me at all - the only time I notice it at all is when putting on deodorant - can't feel it being put on. My Dr told me that it was quite possible/probable that there would be at least some numbness as any surgery will cut some nerves. I already knew this was true - I have a small area of numbness from my C-sections. The numbness I experience(d) is not anywhere as large an area as I had been told was possible. Actually - when I burned so bad after rads - the deepest of the burns were where the nerve damage is so I didn't have to deal with the worst of the burn pain - for that I'm thankful as the rest of the entire irradiated area was bad enough. For all who are having issues, if you aren't already seeing an LET (LymphEdema Therapist), it would be a good idea to see one for an evaluation and education about LE. LE is a possibility after any surgery (rather or not lymph nodes are removed) or traumatic injury. I was fortunate when my LE started 9 weeks post UMX (1/2 way through 12 weekly Taxol) to have Drs who were very knowledgeable about LE and they got me in to see my LET guy. Unfortunately, many/most Drs are not well educated when it comes to LE.",

It may not be the Dr's decision to not do a mammo first but what your insurance is willing to approve. I'm no expert when it comes to insurance issues as my care is through VA - either at my local VA facility or when they 'out source' me to local non-VA facilities. The non -VA facilities have to,get approval if something more needs to be done than the original order, it can be (and is if needed) approved within minutes. When I was DXd the initial approval was just for a mammo, but Dr D. wanted to also do an US and biopsies after the new mammo - he had the approval within 5 -10 mins and I had the path. report the next morning. All of my IBC was 'out sourced' to the local Cancer Center and a private surgeon. If you believe you should have a mammo - fight for it but if it's the insurance company that's denying it - it may take a while to fight them. Keep your cool - but sometimes do have to be very assertive (I had to once at the local Eye Institute but that's another story and raising Hades did get me the care I needed ASAP at another eye speciality office. Have to learn to be your own best advocate but sometimes the way is to take a few steps back to ultimately win the battle but some times the battle has to be waged immediately. Just my thoughts. [Has nothing to do with what you are going through now but I do want to add - so much negative 'stuff' has been said about how 'horrible VA is. I have had fantastic time appropriate care at VA and rapidly out-sourced when the local VA did not have what was needed. Hubby also gets great care at our VA (he's retired USN, I was USA). I am sure there have been problems for some but it's not true at for all. Our Facility is a small one so perhaps that might play a point. Bottom line - many Veterans do get good care through.

Write a list of all the questions you come up with in a little note pad with room for answers (I like using a steno pad) to take with you to Dr appts and to your Chemo Education Class.  I don't know how all Centers work but at mine the Chemo Education Class is a 1 on 1 with one of the Chemo RNs and basically 'everything' is gone over and you will get printed info about the drugs being used and other general chemo info.  Mine took an hour and was immediately before the first infusion.  You will be give oral meds to take before and after infusions.  These are to prevent nausea and allergic reactions.  You will be given meds before each infusion also.  I always had a blood draw before each infusion.  I saw Dr T. before each A/C infusion and every 3rd Taxol.  I had Neulasta injection the day after each A/C (but not with Taxol).  This is to encourage white cell production.  Brief time line for me - 2 weeks, 5 days after DX started A/C, 2 weeks after last A/C had a UMX, 3 weeks later started 12 weekly Taxol, a week after last Taxol started 25 rads, a week into rads started Femara/letrozole (estrogen blocker) which I will be on forever as it stands now. Did your Dr talk about having a port (portacath) implanted for your infusions?  If he/she didn't, ask.   You will be doing 16 infusions and they are very hard on the veins.  As you've had your surgery, they can only use the veins in your non surgery arm for IV.  I don't know what sort of veins you have - many women have ones that are not easy to access so that can be a big issue with infusions.  If you are one who has problems with blood draws etc - a port can easily be accessed for them.  On the other hand, I have great veins, easy to access and I wanted to keep them that way so if Dr T hadn't insisted on a port - I would have.  So Dr G. (my surgeon) implanted my port the day before first infusion.  A PICC line is another option.  Only you can know what is 'right' for you but ask, ask, ASK, educate yourself.  You are your best advocate!",

All 3 are involved in the total TX (treatment) plan. It only makes sense for the TX plan to be together before jumping into one section. I did see my Surgeon first on Mon (Thurs before I had had a new mammo [last one was less than 2 mths old - clear] and immediately had US and biopsies that afternoon. Next morning [Fri] at 8 the Radiologist called me with the path. report - IBC.). I saw my Rads Dr on Wed and my Chemo Dr on Thurs. I did not see my Surgeon again until at the hospital before he put my port in. Did not see him again until a week after end of neoadjuvant A/C - a week before UMX. Basically - Surgeons 'cut'/operate, Chemo Drs do Chemo, Rads Dr do radiation - each Specialist in their field. Also there is also the possibility that both neoadjuvant and adjuvant may be the best TX plan. This does not seem to be all that common but it definitely worked for me. There are so many variables with each of us as to what is the best TX plan. Not all types of BC are the same in how they need to be TXd, we come to TX in different levels of health which can effect the options, we have different beliefs, our Drs are all different, are but a few of the things that come into play. It is great to give what we have experienced - but it was unique to each of us individually, though many can be very similar no one can say (in honesty) what anyone else will experience even with similar DXs. There is no \"One Size Fits All\".",

So, after UMX, I'd just lay on the couch, usually fell asleep before Hubby went to bed so he'd just leave me there when he went to bed. I'd wake up 'whenever' and then go to bed. After my 3 detached retinas, I had to stay and sleep on one side only so I sleep on the couch with my back against the back of the couch so I couldn't accidentally roll to other side.",

That keeps the new ones looking nice - not stained up though clean. I have to have low compression custom gloves for my hand. Higher level compression makes it puff up like a balloon rapidly (1/2 hr). I do not find my gloves/sleeeves 'restrictive' - don't think about them but they are the right compression level for me and fit me right.

As I understand the goal is to get a CPR (Complete Pathological Response) so that ideally there will be no BC remaining when surgery is done. For me, it was 4 DD A/C neoadjuvant and 12 weekly Taxol adjuvant. For me, the idea was to get the mass (IBC forms as a 'nest' or 'bands') to form into a 'lump' with good margins and to shrink. It did. Then the 12 weekly Taxol adjuvant was to 'mop up' and 'hiding' cells. My time line was 4 DD A/C (8 weeks), 2 weeks after last A/C had UMX, 3 weeks after UMX started 12 weekly Taxol. A week after last Taxol, I started 25 rads and a week after starting rads (2 weeks after last Taxol) I started Femara (was not available then in generic form letrozole). Don't know if that answers any of your questions. For me, doing 1 neoadjuvant Chemo surgery and 1 adjuvant Chemo worked great.

Dodge) or take to the ditch - only logical thing to me was to do was go into the ditch.  My truck was not hurt at all, however all the bouncing did more damage to wrist making surgery absolutely necessary.  (added - I drove my 3/4t 4X4 Dodge not just because of the weather instead instead of my little 2X4 S10.  Could not drive S10 it is a stick shift and no power steering so even small was not an option with a broken wrist while Dodge is an automatic with power steering.) Back to your question(s).  If there is a break it isn't the end of the world even with LE. With the pain, there was no way I could have gotten my sleeves on.  Could CAREFULLY wrap though.  My Surgeon and my LET guy talked and the decision was the best idea was to do a short arm splint/cast and then wrap above so I came out of surgery in a splint and 'Guy' had been there and wrapped me above.  As I was told the splint/cast will limit swelling in its area and wrapping above (and/or fingers also if needed) would handle the other areas.  Worked for me - fingers were not an issue and were not wrapped but then the only time fingers are is with the wrong compression level.  Basically my elbow area is the worst. Taking off the splint does not make sense, TO ME, just to pull on a sleeve - the splint is to stablize to bones. Hope I made sense - if not ask.",

IBC is rare (only between 1% - 5% of all DIAGNOSED types of BC). If all who come here having decided they are IBC because they get a skin issue were, IBC would probably be the most common type instead of being so rare. Of course anything is possible so getting a medical diagnosis and appropriate treatment sooner rather that later is important. It is also a misconception by many that IBC always presents first with 'redness/rash\" - it often does not. Mine never presented with 'redness/rash' at all. The vast probability is that you are dealing with a skin issue which might require an appt with a Dermatologist for treatment. added: \"Rash Awaiting Biopsy Results -Scared\" thread by LN3girl is a thread in this section that you might want to read.",

Think of it as the hand is the last part of/the end of the arm. There may still be certain lymph nodes that do work for the hand to keep swelling down but they are not the ones that drain other areas of the arm. When a compression sleeve is put on the arm, it compresses the arm tissue to move lymphatic fluid. Fluid flows to areas of least resistance - upper arm areas where there are functioning nodes to move it on but it will also go to the lower end (hand) which may be overwhelmed by the additional fluid 'pouring in' thus nothing to keep it from 'pooling' without a compression glove to prevent fluid from flowing into that area of less pressure. Also hands are usually 'hanging' lower than upper arms physically. In other words - a sleeve puts pressure on arm to move fluid- - up or down. A glove is pressure to prevent fluid from moving down (hand) from the sleeve pressure. That's very simplistic but might make sense why it takes both working together and hope it makes sense.",

There are SO many causes of skin conditions that appear on the breast with IBC being one of the least likely.  It is less likely in younger people also.  Is it possible that IBC is present - sure - anything is possible but not likely.   I am IBC.  In my case, I never developed reddened skin or had any pain.  Mine presented literally overnight with a lymph node enlarging to the size of an almond.  I was DXd a week later and in the 17 days til I started neoadjuvant chemo, the node did enlarge a lot, breast enlarged, nipple inverted and peau d'orange showed up.  No redness, lesions or pain though.  We are all different so there is no 'One Size Fits All' and anything can present somewhat differently with each of us. See a Specialist - be it a Dermatologist or a breast specialist.  As a student with no income (you wrote that before) you should be eligible for either Medicaide or ObamaCare 'money' to pay for insurance.

Sometimes there will be 2 different chemos done both neoadjuvant, sometimes both neoadjuvant and adjuvant (post surgery) Chemo are done. If you are not looking at surgery til June, the TX plan is quite probably 2/different neoadjuvant. Write down all your question to take to your Chemo Dr (and Surgeon) and make a copy to give to each of them as they may be able to include several questions in 1 answer. While they are answering - if a question comes up - not it down quickly so you don't forget to ask it. Do not be intimated - IF you don't understand what they are saying, keep asking and ask for it to be explained in words YOU understand. Take your smart phone (or tape recorder) and record what is said so if you need to to review/understand what was said you will have exactly what was said - not what you (or someone else) wrote down/heard.

Even with arthritis in spine and osteoporosis, chiro care is still a very viable option (for me at least).

Didn't believe her but got him out anyawy just to be sure. Turned out that he did have some issues - poll and withers - and there was an almost immediate improvement in his work attitude (especially over fenses). Then I decided to have Dr Max look at Kicks' dam as she could be a bit 'grouchy' at times under saddle. Her hips were REALLY out - as a broodmare Kicks had been her 5th foal (was carrying him when we bought her from an estate sale) and had always (before Kicks) had always just foaled out on the prairie in a several hundred acre pasture - so no care. Bottom line of telling this story - as animals - they had no preconceived ideas of what a Chiro was or what to hope for but there was very obvious very positive results from Chiro care for them.",

I have much less issues with my LE during summer/heat than with cold/winter.

It will be hard but she needs to be armed with the truth to be able to put rumors in their place. Be sure to give her the best information you can so she doesn't feel 'left in the dark' (not knowing what is going) but also do not overwhelm her initially. Be sure she knows she can come to you at anytime to talk (about anything important or just 'yack'). You are the only one who can know her and what she can handle at one time. Perhaps her Dad could also have some positive input for her. It is very important that she is given accurate information no matter what it is - not be 'blindsided' from others who do not have her best interest in mind.

Has she asked about a port for infusions? What Scans/tests (MRI/CT, PET, Bone, MUGA/EKG, etc.) are scheduled before Chemo? Neoadjuvant chemo has been SOP for IBC (Inflammatory Breast Cancer) but is becoming more common for other types. The idea is that it will 'atttack' the cancer to get it to shrink and form 'good' margins for better surgical outcome. My experience with neoadjuvant Chemo was for IBC, not IDC. IBC developes differently as it forms in 'nests' or 'bands' so neoadjuvant is needed to get 'it' to form into a 'lump with margins. Most who do neoadjuvant Chemo will do 2 different types of Chemo before surgery but not all - some of us do both neoadjuvant and adjuvant. For me, my surgeon flattly stated that he would not do surgery without neoadjuvant Chemo first. I started getting response with DD A/C (Dense Dose Adriamycin/Cytoxan done every other week) almost immediately. When I had finished my 4 A/C, my Drs wanted to do surgery - so 2 weeks after last A/C I had a UMX and 3 weeks after UMX, I started 12/weekly Taxol. That was 6 1/2+ years ago and I'm still NED (No Evidence of Disease). I can speak about the experiences of those who are IDC and do neoadjuvant Chemo but there will be those who come and can. There is no way to know how she will react to Chemo - rather it is neoadjuvant or adjuvant. We are each so unique and our bodies react differently. For me, A/C did not slow me down at all but Taxol completely EXHAUSTED me. But that is all in the past, I do it again in a heartbeat IF needed. For others, it is the other way around, A/C nasty and Taxol not nasty. There are other Chemo that I do not know anything about other than what I have read.

The only eye issue I had during Chemo was my eyes (and nose) poured like a faucet turned on. Since chemo, I've developed 2 cataracts (removed), 3 detached retinas, macular issues and just yesterday I had to have a lazer procedure done on one eye because a film was forming over the implant from cataract surgery. Would these issues have happened without chemo ever having been done - no way to know as we do get older. Sight is so precious and delicate - it should be protected rhe best we can. Knowing what has transpired visually, would I have done chemo - you betcha! Without chemo, I would not still be alive to deal with the eye issues today. I'd much rather have eye issues to deal with than not being here at all IF I hadn't done chemo - I'm alive, living/loving every second I have. An appt. with an Eye Dr can't hurt - especially one who has experience with BC women and their eye issues post TX.",

There are many posts here at this site from differemt women who say that for them Taxol was worse than A/C. I'm one who had a much worse time on adjuvant weekly Taxol than on neoadjuvant DD A/C. I've written about my experiences in many Threads. Neoadjuvant A/C did not slow me down at all. Hair did go 'bye-bye', did loose appetite, sense of taste and smell. Loss of appetite - eating was not a problem - I just never thought about eating/never hungry. Hubby would call me every few hours during the day to remind me to eat 'something'. (This was probably what was the hardest on him throughout my DX/TX. The first 4+ yrs we were married, he had seen what the ravages of anorexia nervosa does to the person living it and what it does to the entire family - Mom was anorexic and had been for many years.) As far as taste - nothing tasted 'bad', it just had not taste at all (or smell). (We went to Deadwood, with some others, for prime rib. I love hot horseraddish in moderation but I was basically 'ladleing' it on but couldn't taste it. The others who were with us started stareing at me, Hubby noticed before I did. Explained to them - waiter too who was a bit concerned about how much of the hot horseraddish I was 'chowing down' on - that I could not taste it. Adjuvant Taxol was not 'nice' - I basically was utterly and completely EXHAUSTED the entire time - basically existing in bed or on the couch most of the time. The loss of appetite, taste and smell continued but 1/2 way through the 12 weekly Taxol, my K (potassium) levels plummeted and had to go on mega doses of K (still 7+ yrs later, I still have to take K to keep my level in the 'normal' range.). I also had 'big issues' with low temperature. I had to be in one of the glasses in cubicles with it's own thermostat turned up as high as it would go and layers of warmed blankets piled on just to stay 94f or a bit higher. Still am seldom above 97. The other 'issue' (if you can call it,that) on Taxol I was given IV benadryl (had oral on A/C) and within seconds of it starting I would go 'nighty night' until 20 min. before end of infusing. As quick as I went to sleep, I'd wake up as if nothing had 'happened'. Good thing though was that I started feeling less EXHAUSTED the week after last Taxol when I started Rads and felt better every day/week. Other than the low K, all of my blood work stayed great throughout all TX. I did do Neulasta with A/C as a 'precaution' (according to Dr T.) but not with Taxol. I only know that Dr T. (and those he had consulted with) suggested the 12 weekly Taxol as being the best option for me (was given other options), so I chose it. As I remember, he said the 12 weekly will maintain a more constant level - guess it worked for me. Most will do either Neoadjuvant or Adjuvant - weird me did both neoadjuvant (A/C) and adjuvant (Taxol). None of us can tell anyone else what 'they' will or will not experience. There is no \"One Size Fits All\" as we are each so unique. ",

I did some 'looking up' after pain meds did absolutely nothing and found that dexamethazone can sometimes work on headaches and as I happened to have a couple left over from Chemo I took one - it worked pain gone for a while. I was going to a weekend Retreat the next day and knew my PA would be there so I could see her. She had a few more dexamethazones sent over to Retreat from the pharmacy and had me into the Eye Clinic Mon to be sure nothing was going on with eye and Tues in for a brain MRI. It was decided that for some unknown reason that a nerve had gotten irritated/aggravated for no known reason and to take the Dex for 2 weeks to calm it down. It worked - that was 6+ yrs ago and no problems with head pain since. You are being sent for a bone scan and a \"cheat\" (whatever that is) CT - why not include a head/brain MRI?

Unfortunately I learned this first hand - MMR shots do not work at all for either of my sons. Unfortunately, both Sons, even though they were more than current on MMRs during the 1991 Measles Epidemic in SW FL, did get measles after younger son was exposed while in the waiting room for a 'well kid' appt.at MacDill AFB. Long story a bit shorter - younger Son came down with measles, older Son also and was not expected to live - he did. (Their Dad was deployed and on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf/Desert Storm.). Bottom line - they did get immunity from the measles they had - however even after many MMR shots (including the newer versions), titres show neither has gotten any immunity to mumps. With that said - I am a firm believer in getting vaccines - it is true that for an infintestimonal few it may not work, but for the vast majority it works. If one doesn't get a vaccination - there is no way that it can work as does for the vast majority of people.",

In a way, it is a bit of a 'turkey shoot'. It is possible for LE to develope in any part of the body after ANY surgery or traumatic injury. I have a friend who had minor noninvasive knee surgery who has to deal with fairly severe lower leg LE. When I was in my mid 20's, I had a traumatic lower leg injury (horse riding) that did a lot of deep tissue damage and 'peeled off' the skin basically from an inch or 2 below knee to an inch or 2 above ankle on the outer 1/3rd of leg. It took close to 9 months for the skin to heal. I was told that due to the severeity of the damage done I would probably developed LE in lower leg.

I have always liked frozen jello and it does give fluid and if worried about loosing weight, it helps. Part of why I are frozen jello was that I lost all sense of taste and appetite during Chemo - just could not taste anything or ever got hungery/thought about eating. The frozen jello gave texture that I did feel. To make frozen jello is real easy - just make it and then freeze it. I like it best just before it freezes solid as when solid, it's almost as hard as ice. If you make it ahead and freeze it solid, I used the real small ice cube trays and then when I'd eat them pop them out a few minutes before eating and they would have thawed enough to be easy to eat but still have the texture. Frozen of not - there is still fluid/liquid in it. Also in popsicles or frozen fruit bars. I also kept hard boiled eggs in the 'frig for the protein in them. I did not use nail polish - for some bizarre reason - nail polish (cheap or expensive) will not stay on my nails. It peels off in sheets a couple of hours after putting it on. The OPI Nail Envy sample I was given surprised the heck out of me - it stayed on. It is a nail hardener/strengthener that is not cheap (about $30 a bottle) but one lasts me close to a yr. It can be gotten at good salons. The only problem I had with my nails during/after Chemo was I did get a black/bruised area on one big toe but it was from a bruise I got driving a Mud Bog. Just my thoughts and what worked for me.  ",

Another thought - some of us are very sensitive to compression levels. For most, the mid level works great but not for all. Some need a lower level compression and some need a higher level. For me, I have to have low compression as higher/mid level causes swelling quickly. For some, a higher level is necessary. Can't give any idea of dealing with insurances.

I do have to have custom garments as my arm measurements do not come close to what is OTS (Off The Shelf) and my hand is somewhat 'webbed' so OTS gloves cut into the webbing making open sores and very painful.

As day garments are designed to 'work' when active and night garments to 'work' when passive - makes sense to me. Any thoughts or experiences.

Very basically it comes down to - surgeons do surgery/cut, Medical Oncologist/MO (Chemo Dr) do Chemo, Radiocologic Oncologist/RO (Rads Dr) do radiation. They are each specialist in their field. It is becoming much more common for neoadjuvant (pre-surgery) to get better results with surgery. - it is imperative with some. There are many different potential Chemo to be used and different time frames. Some can be done weekly, every 2 weeks or every 3 weeks and for varying lengths of time. Our overall health can also come into play with the choice of chemos. In my case, I did 4 DD A/C ( Dense Dose Adriamycin/Cytoxan every 2 weeks) neoadjuvant. 2weeks after last A/C, I had surgery (UMX) and 3 weeks later started 12 weekly Taxol. A week after last Taxol started 25 rads. A week after starting rads, I started Femara. Others have had different TX (treatment) plans as we are each unique.

My LE started when I was about 1/2 way through adjuvant Chemo and I was immediately started with wrapping to get it down so could get the correct day garments. Not all are able to use OTS (Off The Shelf) garments as we are all built differently and the OTS are generic sized. I have to have custom - especially for my hand as it is somewhat 'webbed' so standard gloves make PAINFUL nasty sores between my fingers. Infection is always a possibility with LE. Some have more issues with it than others - in almost 6 yrs of dealing with LE (many cuts/scrapes/punctures) I have not had any infections but many others have bad ones from much less.",

My night garment is a Solaris Tribute. I have had my Flexi-Touch for 5 yrs and use it daily. It is designed to simulate MLD (Mannial Lymphatic Drainage) that is done 'mechanically'. It is computerized and runs for an hour. There are 3 parts - lower body and upper leg, chest and shoulder and arm sections. The first 1/2 hr works in each of 5 areas for 6 mins each to clear the areas. The first section is the lower body and upper leg, then chest and shoulder, then upper arm, then elbow area and finally lower arm and hand. It then reverses for the last 1/2 hour continually going from hand up around and down to upper leg as a MLD massage does. We are each very different and what works for one is not correct for all others so we have to learn what works for us individually. For me it's low level compression day garments, night garment and my Flexi-Touch. AND being very active.",

There are supposed to be approx. 1 out of 5,000 who have syndactly to some degree - some milder and some severe. For me, fingers are moderate but toes are worse. There is a small amount of 'webbing' between fingers for everyone - that's not syndactly. For me, the webbing between fingers goes more than 1/2 way to the first finger joint.",

Nodes - it can be known pre-surgery - IF suspicious nodes have been biopsies with the path. report showing positive or negative results. It is true that the post surgery path. report may not show the same results as pre-surgery biopsies did. Enlarged nodes can be caused by other reasons than BC. They can be biopsies to check if suspected. For me, my IBC first presented with an enlarged node which was biopsied (FNB - Fine Needle Biopsy) with the path. report the next morning - IBC. In the years since, I have had 2 limited area MRIs but have never had a breast only MRI. Others have had breast only MRI and in some contexts it is logical to infer that breast only MRIs are being meant but definitely can not be assumed every time 'someone' mentions MRIs. It is great to get all the info/experiences you can but it must remembered that there are so MANY variables that make it impossible to know exactly what you will experience in your journey down this road because of what someone else says they did. It is quite possible to be very similar but no way to know for sure what you will until you actually do - be prepared with input as to what might present - but do not decide that all that has happened to 'one' will automatically be what you experience.",

It's been almost 30 yrs that all of our dogs have been mature when gotten and in need of a home (there was one puppy that I kept from being drowned in Puget Sound). Some have come from shelters, some were found other ways. Currently Hubby has a Shelter B&T Coonhound. He lost his little Girl to cancer shortly after I started chemo. The day before my surgery, I stopped at the Shelter and there was a B&T there. He got her and though she won't hunt, she's his Baby and everything he wants. My Gordon (reg. - from the Shelter) was getting quite old and Hubby found a Corgi in a snow bank on the Rez and brought her home for me. Would I have looked for a Corgi - Nope but she's my girl now. I've had Guinea pigs and never been bit by them. Hamptsers bite a lot until they realized biting my leather gloves didn't work. Birds I HATE - they bite! When I was about 10 or 11, my G-Mom's parakeet bit me on the nose. Ferrets can be fun but some will bite. The first ferret I was near bit me on the toe. Long story short - wound up with a ferret when Hubby's friend was moving to CA (illegal to have them there) and she was a sweetie. Since then have have several and only 1 would bite - til she realized it didn't matter as I always had leather gloves on. We are all so different. When time allows me to, I like to have my new one to help me through the loss of the the older one. Not everyone feels that way but I do. When you are ready - look for one who needs you as much (or more) than you need. Local shelters, local trianers/breeders, online, so many ways to find one who needs the home and love you have to give and will return 10 fold.",

Neoadjuvant chemo is becoming more common in today's world for other types of BC. IBC is different than other types of BC - it forms in 'nests' or 'bands' with no clean/clear margins. Neoadjuvant chemo has to be used to get the mass to form into 'lump' with margins and to shrink so that the surgeon has a chance of getting it all. Because of it's rapid and aggressive presentation it is seldom (if ever) found before it is at least Stage III. Most will do 2 different batches of chemo neoadjuvant but some of us will do 1 neoadjuvant and 1 adjuvant. It is becoming more common now for neoadjuvant chemo to be used for other types for some. The idea is to get 'it' to shrink and get good margins for better surgical outcome and prognosis. Some will get a complete pathological response. For me, it did start forming into a 'lump' after the first DD A/C and did continue to form better, get margins and shrink during those 4 DD A/C. For me, a complete response was never expected - just to get it to form, shrink and get good margins for surgery - it worked. Then did 12 weekly aadjuvant Taxol as 'insurance'. That was 7+ yrs ago and I'm still NED (No Evidence of Disease).",

I only have arm LE (primarily elbow area)  but there was never any question about me having the 3 sections/garments needed to simulate MLD.  As explained to me by my CLET (and the company rep), to properly do MLD you have to 'empty' (not the greatest word but the best I can think of right now) the 'healthy' nodes on body to be 'ready' for the fluid being moved manually/mechanically from the effected areas (has to have somewhere to go).    Thus the upper leg/lower body are massaged first, then the chest/upper body, and moving to upper arm, mid arm and lower arm/hand.    Doing these isolated areas takes 1/2 hr of the program.   The next 1/2 hr, it runs in a continual massage from hand, up arm, over chest and down to lower body/upper leg.  This is continual and as soon as it moves to lower body it starts at hand immediately again, over and over til it shuts off. (I never counted how many times it does the cycle but it's a lot.)  My FlexiTouch was delivered to me at  an appt with my CLET guy.  You might want to check with your CLET and see what was written on the request.  Also check with your insurance company on their poli.  You also might want to call FlexiTouch and talk with a specialist there - I've called several times and they are great to deal with. ",

You might try calling some local Medical Supply stores to ask about rather or not they deal with LE garments.  BC survivors are not the only ones who deal with LE.

We are each unique and do not all enter TX at the same health level (other pre-existing conditions or no pre-existing conditions) or issues that moght develope during TX that would/might impact BC TX plans. Also not all Drs follow the exact same TX plan for each of us. In my case, my TX plan was different than most other IBCers (but it worked for me). I did neoadjuvant 4 DD (done every 2 weeks) A/C. 2 weeks after 4th A/C, I had a UMX. My understanding of the 2 week period was basically to allow the A/C to be out of my body before surgery. It was 3 weeks post UMX that I started adjuvant 12 weekly Taxol, started Rads a week after last Taxol. I know my DX is very different than yours, but no two of us are the same, nor are we experts/Drs. So it is your Drs who can answer your individual. If you don't understand their explanation initially, keep asking for it to be explained using words/phrases that you do understand. Use your smart phone to record what is actually told you so you can review exactly what was said later if you need to - not just what you remember from the time of answers. Have a note pad with all the questions you have written on it (add any that come up while talking to the Dr so you don't forget them). Make a second copy of all questions to hand to the Dr so he/she can see where your questions are and can probably answer several individual question together. Hope that gives you some ideas that might help you get the answers you need.",

I'd worry about how competent they were to do an infusion if they didn't know to not use an arm that has had surgery with even 1 node removed. Didn't they know who/what 'me' was being treated for? LE (lymphedema) can develope after ANY surgery, even when a node(s) aren't removed. Chemo and or Rads can also contribute to it. Have you yet seen an LymphEdema Therapist? One with documentable education - not some PT who 'claims to know ALL about LE'? ANY surgery or traumatic injury can result in LE ppresenting - even when nodes (or 'only 1 removed') are not removed. The potential for LE raising it's Ugly Head is not limited to only those who have had 'axillary dissection'. BP/IVs/blood draws/vaccines should not be done because the potential is always there. Also seeing an LET is important to get education and measurements. Ports - I have a Bard Power Port. It is a purple triangle. Thescar from when it was implanted is about an inch long and is a 'hairline' that I have to really search for to see. I had no external sutures - internal with surgical glue externally and 2 butterflys. What your Dr may say to you is not necessarily appropriate for all! We are all unique, no 2 of us are the same - even within out BC type. My TX plan was different than almost all other IBCers - it was my Drs TX plan and it worked for me - Aug will be still NED at 6 yrs Dx.",

The Stage (which can only be accurately assessed post surgery), the Grade, ER/PR +/- status, HER2 +/- status all come into play. Also if there is a genetic possibility based on family HX, other tests will be needed. If the full body MRI shows any metastis that also changes things a lot. Possibly Oncotype test also? IDC is the most common type of BC and has a good prognosis. It is good that your Mom will be seen by the other 2 Drs on her Team on Monday. It is a Team Effort for the best outcome. Each are specialists in their individual 'fields' - Surgeons - do surgery/cut, Chemo Drs (Medical Oncologists/ MO) do chemo, Rads Drs (Radiological Oncologists/ROs) do radiation. Her DX should also be presented to the Tumor Board at her faculty for input/evaluation. Neoadjuvant (pre-surgery) chemo has been the SOP for IBC (inflammatory Breast Cancer) for a long time but neoadjuvant chemo is being used more often now for IDC for some. This is to shrink, get better margins, and can, for some, get CPR. Contrary to what some 'think' - surgery is not always the first/best line of treatment! Those who are ER/PR+ will probably be on a 'estrogen blocker' for years. There are several different ones available. If HER2+, then herceptin will probably be part of TX plan for a year. It would be good for your Mom (and Dad) to get a notepad and write down every question they have (and make other copies to hand to each Dr) so the questions can be dealt with by the medical personnel who actually have pertinent knowledge for her issues. It was harder (at least in my situation) for Hubby and adult Son when I was DXd. They had a lot HARDER time dealing with it than I did.",

Or could use one of the 'over sleeves' you can get for when heading into surgery (IF time allows or plan ahead and get one for the future). On your other arm, write your SS number and a phone number for a contact person out of the area so that if you become injured, you can be identified and someone can be contacted for any further needed info can be gotten from them and to let them know you are accounted for and the location. If you are afraid of some unscrouples person seeing your SS # (and yoir contact person's phone #) on your arm, then write it across your stomach where the only time it might be seen is by appropriate personnel. In your first aid kit it is very good to have H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide) and betadine. I have a Dog Tag in my 'Bug Out Bag' (survival bag that is always packed just 'in case') to put on when/if problems present. No matter where 'you' live there can be issues that can cause problems.

It had done a lot of damage in the Caribbean and was forecasted to go right up Charlotte Harbor to do major damage to Punta Gorda. It totally 'fizzled out' while still in the Gulf between Naples and Ft. Myers so there is always hope that might happen again!",

Not all prosthesis have the same shape exactly either. My second one is more designed to be a better fit to the outside where it's a bit more 'sunk in'. Did you see a Certified Fitter for your prosthesis? It might not be the bras that are the problem but the wrong pros. There are so many different ones and a certified fitter will (at least should) know the products and how they fit different builds, sizes and the result of surgery. My fitter always orders in several bras of the type I like (underwire) for me to try on and pick the ones that fit the best. Some do not fit at all right. She also orders some in 32 or 34, some A, some B as she knows how they are cut and how I'm built. I have actually found some very inexpensive ($5), really cute, pretty colored bras at Walmart that work. They are ones that are designed as push ups and have little pads in pockets that can be taken out and pros. put in. When I'm out doing sports I prefer the mast. bras as they feel better to me when riding, fishing, mowing, etc. but for less active times the cheap are fine - and they are bright colors and cute though they don't seem to last/hold up as long either but as cheap as they are - so what. Don't know if they would work as good for someone who is larger. Just had an idea that might help - can you sew? If you can, taking a tuck or 2 in the material that creates the back of the pocket it is snugger so that it would be harder for the pros to move over.",

My PA was on vacation so it took me a week to get in to see her (didn't want to see anyone else). The node had confinued to enlarge. I saw her at 11 that Thurs morn - she had me at the Radiology Clinic at 1 that afternoon for a new mammo which immediately turned into an US and biopsies. At 8 the next morning (Fri), the Radiologist called me with the path. report - IBC. 17 days after DX I started neoadjuvant chemo (A/C). In those 17 days, the node continued to enlarge, breast enlarged, nipple inverted, peau d'orange developed but never any redness/rash, pain or itchiness. We are each unique and there are no 'set in stone' rules that IBC has to follow. Of course, 'anything' is possible but the vast majority who come here with skin issues (discoloration/etc) on the breast are just that - skin issues - not any type of BC. I was 63 when DXd, 19 yrs post natural menopause, next month will be 6 yrs since DX and I'm still here, still NED, as active as ever and loving every day and living every day to the max.",

There will probably be a Board at the Facility where your individual info will presented for discussion on possible TX plans/options. In some cases, other Facilities may also be questioned for input on best/other possible TX plans. In today's world, there are many possible options for different types of BC and with existing other health issues. Surgery is often not the best first TX. Not to forget getting the Plastic Surgeon involved if you're thinking about Recon which can be effected by Rads. For me, I got my DX (IBC) on Fri (morning after FNBs), met my Surgeon on Mon, Rads Dr on Wed and Chemo Dr on Thurs. Timeframe can be different for others. Your Team should be 'working' together for your optiminual outcome. Just my thoughts and experiences.",

I started rads that week after last Taxol, so as energy level increased continually throughout rads though for some rads can cause fatigue (according to what I've 'heard'/read). I had done 4 DD A/C neoadjuvant and had had no issues with fatigue at all. My suggestions for \"getting back to normal activities\" if you are having a problem is to sit down and make a chart of where you feel you are today and where you want to get to (back to your 'normal'). Basically a 'start point' and the goal. Set realistic goals but have a plan that increases what you want to do gradually towards the goal. Gradual increases that are quite doable but never overdoing which will be a major setback. Small positive 'steps' will get you a lot further quicker than trying to do too much too quick which will cause setbacks. Only you can know how hard you can push yourself and what was your 'normal' pre-TX. For some we can push harder/for some not as hard - the end is more important than how 'fast' (or what anyone else did) is what matters. Remember too that what is 'normal' for one is not 'normal' for another. Having short term and long term goals written down (and documented the progress) no matter how small, wrritten down is a very positive even if the plan has to be 'tweeked' - it still shows the progress ACCOMPLISHED. For each of us, our 'normals' were very different than most others - do not self 'judge' yourself against what anyone else's 'normal' was. For some, training for and running a marathon is 'normal' - definitely not 'normal' for me. We are each so unique - getting back in shape/normal can take time and work - gradually so that progress may be slow but does progress. Hair - I finished Chemo in late Jan - it was May before I had about 1/4\" of hair back. Mine came back exactly as it had been pre- TX - unfortunately. I had been told hair comes back greyer than it had been so I was hoping mine would come back with some very - it didn't. I am 'cursed' by genetics to not have grey hair. Daddy's side of the family did not get very (even into their 90's), Mom's side all got grey young (she had started getting grey in high school) - most went on to gorgeous white hair in 40's -50's. Me - I was 63 when DXd/did Chemo and hair was still naturally as dark as it had been all my life - VERY dark brown (almost black but not quite when next to someone that actually has black). It came back as dark as ever with still no grey. Now at 69, it is still naturally as dark as ever with no grey. It gets tiresome/annoying when strangers will comment that I'd look younger if I didn't dye my hair 'black'/so dark - I DO NOT DYE MY HAIR - IT'S HOW IT GROWS! Sorry for rambling so but hope 'you' can get 'something' (no matter how small) from it.",

'Something' is going on and you do need to have it checked out by your PCP to start. A Dermatologist may be recommended. There are many possibilities/probabilities for skin redness that can easily be addressed with the correct medication. Of course, anything is possible even if highly unlikely.

There is no way of possibly knowing rather or not you might develope LE. LE can develope after any surgery (or traumatic injury) no matter how non- invasive the surgery is. Nodes do not have to be removed for it to happen -IF it does ever. While the more nodes removed does put one at a higher risk to developing LE - not an absolute predictor of rather or not it will ever develope. I have a friend who had non-invasive minor knee surgery and developed quite severe LE in her leg. About 45 yrs ago, I had a severe (no broken bone but severe tissue and skin damage) lower leg riding injury that the Drs expected LE to develope from but never has. For me, my LE started 9 weeks post UMX. I was 6 weeks into 12 weekly Taxol when LE showed up. So that was 7 weeks before starting Rads. I do agree with muska- \"In my personal opinion, fears of LE are often over 'hyped' on this board- \". IF (and that is a huge IF) LE does ever develope - it can be handled/dealt with. I've been dealing with LE for 7+ yrs now and in no way has it slowed me down/limited my activities in the least. (Spent a lot of the weekend out flyfishing, riding and some hiking. Mowed my yard and another one yesterday with my push mower. . For me, dealing with LE is just a minor inconvience (day garments, night sleeve and FlexiToouch) are quite doable. Of course, my DX is different than yours so my TX plan was also different (neoadjuvant Chemo, surgery, adjuvant Chemo, rads in that order).",

General Surgeons are just that - surgeons that do not specialize in any particular type of surgery but do general (all sorts of) surgery. With that said, my Surgeon was not strictly a Breast Surgeon but a 'Woman's Surgeon' - meaning he only did surgery on women for breast AND reproductive surgery. His reputation is outstanding and he is the one my PA said she would want IF she ever needs surgery for any female issue. He was fantastic. I have no idea how any individual Dr would react if told that a 2nd (or 3rd or more) opinions are sought. I would assume that different ones would react differently. I did not seek 2nd opinions on any of my Drs or TX plan - it all made sense to me and I really liked all my Drs. If you are questioning and feel you want/NEED a 2nd opinion - get it. Being IBC, recon at time of UMX was not an option so I had not seen any Plastic Surgeon at the time. By the time, it was an option (a yr later), I had decided that I was fine with being able to do everything I wanted to do (very active outdoor woman) and did not want to take a chance that more surgery could have an effect on that - you can never be sure how any surgery will turn out. We are each so unique - what is 'right' for me may not be for someone else and visa versa. Have you had a DEXA Test before? If not, it is a lot quicker/easier than any of the Scans. It is basically just X-rays of hip area which will show the density of bones that will show if the density is lowering (as in osteopenia or osteoporosis). I did not have a DEXA test before starting TX as I'd been having them cor yrs so it was already known I was osteopenia (huge family HX).",

I did, unfortunately, have to deal with my Mom.who was an anoertic which was slow suicide that Dad and I (Hubby too once we married) had to watch her commit slow suicide in for t of our eyes and there was nothing g we could do.

For me, the procedures were a little different between the 4 DD A/C and 12 weekly Taxol but only in that I saw Dr T. before each A/C and every other time on Taxol. How I reacted to them in as very different though. Would check in at the Check In desk. They would notify the 'Blood Tech' and in about 5 minutes she would come out to get me. Would go back to Lobby and sit down and on Dr Days' in about 5 minutes, Dr. T's RN would come get me to go back and get vital's/weight/any things you wanted to talk to him about and shortly he'd be in - sometimes he'd be in before she left. After seeing him, back to the Lobby and sometimes one of the Chemo RN's would be waiting for me, sometimes would have to wait a couple/few minutes before she came for me. Then back to either a recliner cubicle or glassed in bed d cubicle. Would get the BP/HRP/temp machine hooked up and establish the IV line and flush it (I have a port so no issues getting IV established). Would also get me warmed blanket(s) and soup, fruit, cracker, beverage, whatever I wanted then. By then another RN would come to the cubicle with the meds and they would both varify that everything matched me and that the meds ordered matched what they had. With A/C, some of the pre-meds were oral and some IV but with Taxol all were IV. I always run below 'normal' temperature wise so warmed blankets were needed. For Taxol, I had to have one of the glassed in bed cubicles as they each have their own thermostat so the temperature can be controlled so mine was raised a lot plus the warmed blankets. The bed was necessary also as soon as the IV benadryl started, I'd go 'nighty-night' til 20 minutes before the end of the infusion and wake up as alert as I had been before. On the weeks on Taxol that I didn't see Dr T I would be weighed on the way back to cubicle. A/C was very easy - did not slow me down at all. Scalp hair and 1/2 of brows/lashes did fall out, lost appetite, lost senses of taste and smell. Taxol left me completely and utterly exhausted to the point I basically existed either in bed or on couch in front to TV but started going away a week after last infusion. 1/2 way through Taxol my K (potassium) level plummeted and had to go on mega doses of K to keep it up to normal - today even after 5+ yrs, I still have to take K to keep it up to normal. We all have to remember that there is no 'One Size Fits All'! We are each unique in so many ways. No two of us have exactly the same DX though some are similar. We all come to this battle in different health and that can effect what TX plans can be done. (Other than some arthritis in upper back and osteopenia, I was and still am VERY healthy.) Our journey down Life's Road has been different and our Faith, or non-Faith, play upon how we deal with this (or any) battle for our Life. Our Drs are also different and the TX is not always the same. (Mine was different than most other IBCers - I did neoadjuvant and adjuvant Chemo while most do 2 neoadjuvant and no adjuvant.). Point is - our experiences are ours - no one else will have exactly the same experiences though there may or may not be similarities with others.",

Unfortunately, PTSD is still not well understood within the medical world yet or by most people who do not deal with it (or have loved ones who do). No, I am not any kind of what could be called an 'expert' in any way but have gained a bit of knowledge on PTSD over the years. My Hubby is PTSD - has nothing to do with his 20 yrs Navy but to what he experienced when he was 9 yrs old and his Mother died. The last time he saw her alive was on Christmas Day when she was taken to the hospital via ambulance. - he never saw her again and his Father never told him anything - he found out that she had died from his school teacher the day after she died. I have several women friends who deal with PTSD also and some whose Hubby's deal with it. We used to have weekend Retreat here for those who are Veterans or spouse of Veterans to deal with PTSD (I fall in both groups) and I was fortunate to be able to go to more than 20 of them so learned a lot. Unfortunately, the Retreats are not done anymore. I have no DX but have been told by my Dr that I probably but I learned how to handle the issues a long time ago - I can not get on a 'big boat' (think ocean liner/cruise ship/aircraft carrier size - small boats are fine) even when tied to the pier because it will sink and I will be trapped in it. Goes back to issues that happened on am ocean liner when I was 6. So easy to handle - just never get on a 'big boat' again- that's easy to do as I will never have to. Please contact your 'people' or if they aren't available find 'someone' who is really knowledgeable about PTSD.",

The pharmacy told me to file a Police Report which I did. When I got the copy basically it says that I 'claimed' I was in another state, I 'claimed' what the meds are and 'claimed' how many I would get.

I did obviously loose hair, we had a 'head shaving party' at the barn when I had just a few hairs left (think the picture of Dorian Gray at the end) when Son and my other 'sons' all used the horse clippers on heads (but not all - about 1/2 of lashes and brows stayed). I lost appetite (just never thought about eating so Hubby had to call be several times a day to remind me to eat something. Lost all sense of taste and smell (nothing tasted 'bad' - just no taste at all). Never had a problem with drinking enough water though - habit just took over. I'm a 'waterholic' and always have ice water close at hand. About the only difference with my 12 weekly adjuvant Taxol was that I was completely and utterly EXHAUSTED all the time. Never any nausea with either. What did a great job with my nails was OPI Nail Envy. I have never had decent nails but with using Nail Envy throughout A/C and Taxol my nails were better than had ever been. I was given a sample of it at the 'Look Good - Feel Better' class. If you haven't done a 'Look Ggod - Feel Better' class check with you facility when they will have one or with your local ACS for their next one. It is a great class designed to teach about makeup, skin care, wigs/scarfs/hats/etc. and meet others in the same situation.",

Many years ago I tore off an area about 6\" X 15\" on the side of my lower leg in a riding accident. It took about 9 mths to heal but with cocoa butter today it is not visiable. Once Chemo burns were finally closed, I used it on them. I believe that it helped on the somewhat minor burns but the deepest definately scared - would they have been worse scars if I hadn't used Cocoa Butter once they were healed - perhaps, can never know.",

As my Dr told me even leaning/bending over to tie shoes can cause pain. Is the pain/burning only shortly after taking it weekly or continues throughout the week? Just 'stuff' to be sure to tell the Dr about I been on alendronate/Fosamax for several years with no problems from it.

It attacks the cancer in other types to get it to shrink, get good margins for better surgical prognosis. In some cases, a complete response may occur, meaning that all signs of the cancer no longer are present. In some though there won't be a complete response but will have gotten 'it' to a point where surgery will have a better outcome, be less invasive than it would have been if no neoadjuvant Chemo had been done.

Some chemo are done weekly, some every 2 weeks and some every 3 weeks. The time between surgery and chemo varies also. Rads. (radiation) is usually daily (week days) for different time periods but usually at least 25. While doing TX, the immune system is compromised so being in large groups of people can be not the best idea. Vaccinations (if any needed for international travel that are not current) are not recommended during TX. As lymph nodes were removed (under arm), she needs to see a LymphEdema Therapist for baseline measurements and education about trying to prevent it from developing. Air travel is potentially one of the 'triggers' for it. Her Drs are the ones that can address her possible issues. Added: What type of BC is she dealing with - IBC/IDC/ILC/DCIS? TX and time frames make a difference with different types. The protocols for TX also differ in countries.",

It's always been in mind since then, how bad would it have been to deal with the burns if I had had recon first? Certainly extensive burns do not happen to all but they can. For me, the entire irradiated area burned, not a 'bad sunburn' but open and weeping. Some areas were much deeper but for the most part the deepest were where there is nerve damage from surgery so thankfully I didn't 'feel' the worst of the pain (well up the side of my neck I did). I was 'lucky' that no infections developed as I'm allergic to Sulfa so Silvadene/Sulfadene could not be used - Domebro soaks are what finally healed it. Not trying to scare you, most only get a 'sunburn' if that but there is the possibility of really significant burning.",

One or more of these low/not in balance, can effect pain in legs. During Taxol, my potassium level dropped drastically and had to go on mega doses of it to stay in 'normal' range. I still have to take it and do occasionally get leg/ankle pain when it slips low so have to increase for a few days. It is not something to just do without checking with Dr/blood work as too much potassium can also cause bad problems. Also possibly low on Vit D - many women are and also cancer women. As you are in Aust. heading into autumn/winter with less sunshine - S.A.D. (Seasonal Affective Disorder) is a possibility. It can cause depression/lack of energy because of lack of sunshine/Vit D. It's easy to handle with Vit D pills and a light box. Low Vit B can also effect energy level. Just some ideas to think about and ask your Dr about.",

Besides the measurements - there are other important issues. We are all dfferent. Was the 'fitter' an LE Therapist? Some of us are more sensative to pressure than others. For me, heavy compression makes my LE horrendous but light compression works great. That's why there are different levels of compression. Even with correctly measured custom garments, there can be mistakes made by the sewer at the factory. That happened once for me - sent back immediately. There is no way I can use/fit in OTS garments. They do make OTS in the compression level that will work for me and my hand is slightly 'webbed' so no OTS glove is a possibility.

My gloves have a pocket on them as it feels better to me but I do not use a spot in it. Do you put your glove over or under the sleeve? It does make a difference. It takes a few seconds more to roll the wrist end of sleeve back to put glove under it but (for me anyway) does make a difference. If the sleeve is under the glove, the edge of it is pushed in and thus can limit flow like a dam. If glove top is under tbe sleeve it doesn't. It does take a second or 2 more but - - -. It works. Being 'too tight' is not necessarily the compression level but can be the fit. You may have been sold a sleeve that is too small. In my case I do know that the compression level was the problem as when I got the low level replacements on the same measurements - was good. I do have custom garments as I can not wear OTS. It took a while for my LET guy to get my glove down good because I have Weird hands. I never knew it but my fingers are somewhat webbed so there is no way I can wear gloves that are designed for a 'normal' hand. My arm does not fit into the 'standard' either. I am fortunate to have a fantastic LET guy who gets my garments for me and if there is a problem - he addresses it. There have been a few times that garments had to be returned because there were mistakes in them. (Oh yeah - my care is through VA and has always been all I could ask for.)

In my case it took several sets of Custom day garments to get the measurements 'tweeked' enough. I never realized it though all my life I had had big problems with getting winter gloves to fit right. Turns out that my hands are so what 'webbed' (always knew my toes are quite webbed but never thought about hands) so standard measurements used for the OTS gloves CUT into the webbing between fingers - yes literally cut. Over a few reorders every 6 mths for 2 new sets, my LET guy kept 'tweeking' the measurements to 'accomadate' my weird hand. My suggestion to try to keep irritation down would be to carefully pull on glove and not pull it really tight between fingers. As soon as you feel any discomfort, take glove off for a few minutes and massage, then put it back on but not pulled up tight. A gauntlet, instead of a glove, might be a good option for you.",

In my case, my 3 middle toes are joined by skin to the first joint.

It is usual to go with/use the same level compression for both sleeves and gloves but for some different levels may work better. My hand has to have low compression or it blows up like a balloon quickly while it does great with low. Currently am using a mid level sleeve with the low level glove and doing good. Some might need a high level for hand but lower level for sleeve. With the last order for new garments, I got a mid level glove and hand puffed up quickly but with the low level glove and mid level leeve is doing good.

Getting an OTS glove I could possibly wear is totally impossible without it being custom. I am syndactyly - meaning that my fingers are somewhat webbed. (Not as bad as some can be but still an issue.) So a 'normal' glove will literally cut the flesh between my fingers - very painful and makes open sores. Just seeing \"a PT\" does not mean you will get actual, correct information about LE. It takes additional educatation for a PT or OT to also be an LET (LymphEdema Therapist).

I would 'wake up' 20 minutes before the end of infusion as rapidly as I went 'nighty-night'. I also developed very low temperature so I was given a cubicle that was glassed in across the 4th side that had it's own thermostat to control the temperature in it. It also had a 'hospital bed' in it and it took cranking up the heat to as high as it would go and continually adding/changing the warmed blankets - I did drop below 94f one time (that I know or).

Wearing garments 'all day' has protected you'd skin from the sun daily so it would be very easy to burn quickly and don't want to get a burn. Also not only when in 'natural' waters (lake/creek/stream/saltwater/etc.) but also in 'chlorinated' water (pool/water park/etc.) be vary vigilante for the possibility of infection with even the smallest scrape, cut. Can only speak for myself - I've had several scrapes/cuts for swimming but never had any hint of infection. I do not use antibiotics but am very diligent with using H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide) liberally. It works for me but some have to use antibiotics from the 'gitgo'.",

As you know there really are some who do not grey up and remain dark haired naturally basically forever. Mom's side of the family all greyed young - she started greying significantly in high school (at least according to Daddy who had know her then). My brother took after her side and greyed relatively early. Daddy was 68 when he died and did not have a grey/white hair on his head. After Mom died, Daddy lived with us and as far as I know no one ever told him he shouldn't dye it but some 'Peebles' would tell me I should not dye his hair for him - I didn't dye it. His Mom lived to 95 and though her hair was a much lighter brown, it stayed it's natural color but she did get a few white hairs (maybe 15) as with your Mom you had to search for them to see them. Again with her, I was asked why did I dye her hair and how did I keep her 'roots' from ever showing. Back then I owned a beauty shop and was a Master Cosmetologist, did do her hair weekly but absolutely never colored it but I don't think anyone ever believed me. Both of my G-grandmothers on that side also lived into mid 90's and both retained their natural color (1 very dark brown, 1 lighter brown). So I'm 'stuck' with very dark brown hair and the only thing I could do to make it what 'Peebles' think it should be would be would be to frost or bleach it which I'm not going to do. But then, if I did I would have dark roots coming in. I actually had a Dr (a Dermatologist) about 3 yrs ago ask me what color my hair had been naturally. At the time I didn't think a lot about it as I was seeing him about some skin issues and I am very light skinned and have light green eyes which don't usually go with as dark as my hair is. Butl later I thought about it and think he was thinking/inferring that my hair was not it's natural color. ",

Did you try a 'athletes foot' cream or power for it? Skin issues are quite common, IBC is not ; only 1 to 4 out of every 100 who actually get a DX of any type of BC will be IBC. Nothing you wrote sounds anything like how my IBC presented (or your time frame). I don't know where you came up with IBC \"doesn't present in\" mammos or USs. Mine did. Mammo are less likely than USs to show a possibility of it but it definitely can show. I did not have a Skin Punch biopsy but FNBs that did confirm. You stated that the 'rash' moves around and \"sometimes nothing\" - that's not how IBC presents. Once it presents - it aggressively progresses within hours/days. Nor does it always present as a 'rash' under breast. Mine never was a 'rash' in the 24 days from presenting (7days til DX, 17 days to starting TX). See your Drs who actually see you, follow their TX plans and do not self DX or go by \"Dr Quack Google's\" DX. ",

Mine were immediately before first neoadjuvant A/C was an hour long. The one before first adjuvant Taxol was about a 1/2 hour. A lot of great info is given then and I was given a notebook that had so much 'general' Chemo info but also info on each of the drugs used during Chemo. There will be more than just the Chemo. It would probably be a good idea to ask the Nurse Navigator about the \"Look Good - Feel Better\" class if they have it at the facility or at the local ACS. It is a class (through ACS) designed for those going through Chemo to give info on dealing with makeup, skin care, wigs, etc. There are a lot of 'things' that are taught (one thing comes to mind is how to use an eyebrow pencil to make eyebrows appear 'usual' once hair 'leaves' after starting Chemo. I don't know your situtation , but if needed her facility may have wigs available. My Nurse Navigator gave me a really cute wig but when Hub y and Son (adult) saw it on me, they broke out laughing - I have to agree - as cute as it was it wasn't 'me' at all. So I took it back to the Look Good Feel Better class and there was a lady there who it was perfect for so she went home with it. At that class, I still had my hair but the Hairdresser who was doing it told me that she had a wig that a name manufacturer had sent to her that she thought would be great for me and to come to her salon the next day. She was right - I went home with with it. I also got another wig that VA got for me - so I could go with my longer wig or my short wig depending on my mood at the time.",

I can call her or her RN and tell what is going on and not nedcessarily have to go in to get meds for it if needed (I get a lot of sinus infections so when one starts I call her and get the meds I need for it - she's been my PA for 16 yrs). There have been some times since that I had to wait a bit for a referral appt. for something that needed to be checked but wasn't an acute issue and there were others who needed them ASAP for acute/critical issues.

The closest I can come up with is the gloves are a bit thicker than my opaque tights/legging and a maybe a bit thinner than my light thinsilate winter underwear (not to be confused with the heavy waffle-weave thermies).  Hope that gives you an idea of how thin they are. They are made by Isotoner - the Isotoner tag is attached.  The seams are made to the outside - not just turned inside out - so the inside is smoother. They come individually wrapped - not as a pair.  I don't know what all they are used for (never asked) but my Guy already had boxes of them when he gave me my first ones.  So they do have other uses than just with BC LE.   Though he'd been a CLET for several years, I was only the 2nd BC LE he'd dealt with so I know that there has to be other uses for the gloves or he would't have had so many.   No - that's not all that strange - He's with VA so there are a lot more men seen there than us women.",

It can be toes or fingers or both and in varing degrees. Mine is not extreme and I never really noticed it other than finding gardening, work, winter gloves was always hard to find that would fit. Always just thought that I had short fingers as the fingers of gloves were almost always too long and end 'folded over'. (Always knew that my toes were really weird as the 4 are really shorter than big toes and are 'stuck' together (webbed) more than 1/2 way but 'just toes' so no worry other than laughing at 'my silly toes' 😏.) So with custom gloves, it takes different measuring points to get the area that goes across between fingers with syndactyly to not cut into the webbing as a 'standard' measurement points do. Of course, there are so many variables, in all ways, with each of us. I am blessed with a Fantastic LET OT guy who really sought out 'answers' for me.",

The longer you wait - the more it can/will spread - metastasize.   Your question - how long between DX and starting TX.  For me, it was 17 days between DX and starting neoadjuvant A/C.  But then I'm not IDC.",

When I was DXd in Aug '09, I do not remember seeing anyone (maybe a few) who were not IBC doing neoadjuvant. In the years since it is becoming more common for other types also. For some - TX needs to start almost immediately as days make a difference. For others - there can be a longer time frame to get into active TX (be it surgery or Chemo or ?). All BC is not the same, TX plans are not the same for all types, the prognosis is not the same for all types. There are IDC, DCIS, ILC, LCIS, IBC and other types that are rarer than IBC. They all do not form in the same way - IBC forms a 'nest' or in 'bands' so neoadjuvant is needed to get it to form a 'lump' with margins before surgery. It is not common (only between 1% - 5% of all DXd BC) so there are a lot fewer who deal with it and thus less research has been done.",

I don't know any of what is involved in the process as I was 19 yrs post menopause when DXd. There have been some young women who have come here that have though so hopefully they will check in with you. Don't just see the Surgeon but also Medical Oncologist (chemo) and Radiology Oncologist (rads) so have an idea of what your entire TX plan will be - Surgeon does not determine the entire TX plan - they do surgery. Take your Smart Phone with you and record what all Drs tell you so you can review exactly what you were told - not reading the quickly written notes you, or someone else, tried to write down correctly. Write down all the questions you have and make a second copy to hand to the Dr so he/she knows what you want addressed in addition to what he/she is already planning on discussing. If you do not understand his/her words - tell them to explain so you can understand, even if it takes several times. You have to be your own best advocate. My belief - God does listen to us and cares about each of his children. We have to listen to Him. We are each unique and all have struggles on this journey through life to return to Heavenly Father. Our 'struggles' are for us to grow and learn from. Added: You might want to come to the 'Prayers and Spiritual Inspiration' forum. (Just scroll down.)",

I, too, did not gain weight - I lost weight.  I was within appropriate weight range though slightly on the higher side for my height and age (63 at the tiime) when I started chemo and was very glad I had that weight I could lose without becoming emaciated /damaging my body.   I, too, was in very good physical shape - riding/training 4 horses daily and doing all their care myself and some bicycling thrown in.   I also went into chemo in very good health, just some arthritis in my upper back.  I think this helped in getting through 4 DD A/C neoadjuvant and 12 Taxol adjuvant with no health issues, (no infections or low blood counts, etc.). We are each so different in what our life's experiences have been which makes us who/what we are.  We each have to do what we will but at times it can be good to listen to others and perhaps get a new perspective that had not occured to us.  Just my thoughts.",

It is important that all Drs we see knows all our individual body is dealing with for the best TX. I haven't seen all the many 'horror stories' about IBC not being DXd after multiple biopsies that you say you find. I've been dealing with IBC for 8 yrs and doing a lot of reading in regards to the subject. There just aren't many of us to begin with who are IBC as only between 1 - 4 out of every 100 who actually get a DX of any type of BC will be IBC. The couple of ones who did get an IBC DX after a missed DX had been initially DXd as mastitis - not missed by biopsies. On the other hand, there are so many (100's) who come here with a skin issue having decided on IBC and \"been DXd by Dr Quack Google\" that never come back once they get the correct DX - a skin issue that has nothing to do with any type of BC. Instead of looking for the negative - try seeing the positive in life. There are no guarantees in life about what the next minute, day, or even yr will bring. If we choose to dwell in darkness/negativity - we only rob ourselves (and our beloved ones) of all the joys/happiness that is there to be enjoyed and cherished in light/positivity. You've had a mammo, US (no issues of BC showed) and biopsy -all were negative for IBC. Be happy! And get on with living life!

Doing a blood draw is invasive as the skin is compromised by a puncture, potentially causing an infection/cellulitis. BP cuffs (especially the machines) can be quite over inflated/high pressure which logically (to me anyway) could cause more issues. Injection are putting 'something' into the body that could cause a nasty reaction - so why take a chance. I have only had 1 issue with a 'stupid RN (hae nissues ver seen him before) who insisted he had to do my BP in LE (right) arm because he \"had his office set up to use right arm only for BPs\". I got up and walked out of his 'office', meeting one of the RNs I knew. We went back in and she 'instructed' him that he would use my left arm and stayed there. When I left to go to see the Orthopedic PA, she stayed behind to have a 'discussion' with him. Never saw him there again. Blood draws - never had anyone want to use my LE arm. I do have great veins so not a problem (anyone who can't hit my veins should go back to school for more education. But there are many veins that can be used throughout the body. I have not had any issues with infections/cellulitis though have had many cuts, scrapes, and punctures in my activities but for some a small paper cut can cause BIG issues - not worth taking a chance. (All I use on them is hydrogen peroxide.) Injections - an allergic reaction can happen anytime - even from previously gotten injection. Why take a chance when there is already lymphatic compromise in the LE arm. There is no reason that a particular arm has to be used by some lazy RN or Phlebotamist who will not have to deal with any issue personally IF anything does happen. There are other options - use other arm or legs for BP, use other arm or legs for blood draws, use other arm or other parts of body for injections. Other than that 1 'stupid RN, no one has ever suggested using LE arm. Does not make sense to me to take any chance of possibly causing more/potentially serious issues - when it's easy to not take a chance.",

The last time he saw his Mom alive was on Christmas Day afternoon when an ambulance took her to the hospital. His Father never told him anything. Roughly 2 weeks later, when he got to school the morning after she died, heblearned that she had died when his teacher told him how sad she was that he had lost his Mom. Hades of a way to find out!

In my case, I believe it was a combinnation of many 'things' in my life that the effects of finally combined to form as IBC.  I have always been a very active person (still am more active than many 1/2 my age at 68), never over weight or under weight, never smoked anything, have an occasional 'adult beverage' on special occasions.  Drink lots of water.  I have always eatten a very well rounded diet that includes a lot of veggies and fruit (no canned veggies or fruit - only fresh or frozen).   I stay away from 'prepared foods' full of chemicals the vast majority of the time.  I do not take Multi Vit/Min but take ones that I need individually (Vit D3  for SAD, Potassium because during chemo I started having issues with it being very low and still is if I don't take).  I have no family HX of any type of cancer on both sides of my family for at least 4 generations - 1 Grandmother and 3 Great Gradmothers lived into their mid-late 99's..  However, I have lived in places/had jobs most of my life that could have had cumulative effects.  I was a Master Cosmetologist (lots of chemicals there) for more than 10 yrs, I did Screen Printing (in the days before the 'kinder' inks and solvents of today), I did Uphostery (again chemicals involved).  I was a 'Military Brat', was Army myself, married a USN 'airdale' (worked on planes, not boats except while deployed) for his 20 yrs AD, and live very near an AFB now.  So I grew up around aircraft exhaust, and have lived as an adult also around it, along with the jobs I've had - lots of possibilities. My point of saying all this is do not obsess on what is past and thus cannot be changed - IF there could ever be an exact answer for anything in LIFE.  I did focus on fighting the Monster - rather than focusing on 'Why Me?'  No one has any guarantee for what 'tomorrow' brings anyway. Is that SOO cute Lop (Holland Lop?) yours?  I had Holland Lops for YEARS but after I lost Funday (solid black), I got Bugs a bit over a yr ago who is a broken black/white Mini Rex.  I had hopes of doing 'Rabbit Agility' with him this past summer but it didn't work out so planning on next yr.",

Even if you do have a DX of ADD, do not try to make statements of what it is for all of us who are/do bave a DX of ADD and deal with it positionly. ADD is very complex and no 2 of us are exactly the same in how it presents to us individually.

The only thing is it takes me a little more time to type than using a keyboard. I do agree with nihahi - until you have understanding about what your issues actually are - it is inappropriate for you to be giving others advise - which clearly is based only on what others have posted who do have a BC DX and knowledge gained over years of living (yes -living) with their DX and TX. There are so many variables between the different types of BC (DCIS, IDC, ILC, IBC) and with each iunderstand You might want to talk with your psychiatrist for a possible change in your meds as you are having issues that are not being handled at this time. I do wish you the best at your aappt. tomorrow.

Another option is to use you phone to record what is said so you can review the exact words later if you feel you need to hear them again.

The Master Cosmetologist who was doing the class had a few weeks before gotten in a box of new wigs donated from manufacturer and there was one she didn't think she would ever find the 'right woman' for it - it is a frosted gypsy shag. I went to her Salon the next day and left with a great wig that was great for me. I was cut in a gypsy shag at the time (not frosted though) as I decided to go from my naturally dark almost waist length hair at DX to a shag as a step - so frosted wasn't a big jump. The other wig I got during TX was also a frosted but it was a really cute pixie. Hey - what the hey - everyone already knew for me, it was a wig or scarfs so I did whatever made me feel good at any particular time. Scarves are very easy to make. To match any outfit or for different temperatures. Hubby (and Son) would go to fabric stores and wander around looking for material they thought 'looked like me' for 'dress' scarves or 'warm' scarves. Sorry for getting so far off of eyebrows - but it's all part of what we go through.",

Mine started 9 weeks post UMX (3 post surgery and 6 weeks into 12 weekly Taxol) so I didn't yet have my FlexiTouch during rads but was dealing with LE in elbow area. Talk to your Rads Dr but to me (non-professioal medical person) it would seem logical that ,unless issues develope, FlexiTouch could be used as it is is systematic massage done gently by consistantly by a machine instead of your hands. You might also want to call FlexiTouch and talk with one of their Staff with your questions/concerns. I've called them a couple of times and got good answers to my question(s) by very polite, courteous and apparently knowledgeable Staff. (Hint - I always have a light cotton (or mostly cotton) long sleeved T- shirt on when I use mine. Even in cooler weather (or with a 'cranked up' A/C), I tend to 'get damp' (read sweat) some and without the long sleeved T-shirt on, the garment sections, arm especially, tend to get a bit 'sticky' when removing. Also the garment sections can not be washed so a long sleeve T-shirt on under allows to easily wash what is actually touching your skin.)",

I, too, heard her say that. He laughed at her and informed that he knew a lot more than she did.

Everyone should be referred to an LET immediately - before tbere is an issue. It is important to get an evaluation/measurements 'base line' and gain education from one who has actual credentials/education in LE. There are very few Drs/MDs who have any real clue about LE. Of course, not all LETs are the same so may tell you something a bit different than another tells someone else - also we are each unique. What 'works' for me is not exactly what 'works' for others as can be seen by my posts. It works for me but obviously not for all - just as what 'works' for others - isn't 'right' for me. For me, 1 drain was removed 10 days post UMX - no problem. 2nd drain removed a month post UMX and developed a large seroma. I had done 4 DD A/C neoadjuvant, UMX 2 weeks later, 3 weeks UMX started 12 weekly Taxol. 6 weeks into Taxol, LE started showing it's 'ugly head'. Thankfully, my Chemo Dr was a lot more knowledgeable than most and I was quickly sent to my LET guy.",

Unfortunately, that's not true for all so not all will have your experiences with rads. We are each so unique. Unfortunately it is true that some of us do burn badly - there is no exact way to predict who will and who will not burn. I felt good throughout the 25 rads with just getting very slightly pinkish after no. 24 & 25. Unfortunately though the morning after the 25th/last rad, the entire irradiated area was blistered. Long story shorter - that was early March and it was June 29 when the last scab finally ame off. (Have the scars to prove it. . The only sort of regret I have is that it took so long to find what finally healed it. The Dr's RN did not come up with it for close to 2 months - Domeboro soaks to dry it. With what I went through with the huge burn (some areas very deep) - I'd do it again in a heartbeat if rads were needed but I'd start with Domeboro soaks at first sign of an open burn. This is not meant to scare anyone but to show that while there are those who do have little to no problems with rads just as there are some of us who do have 'issues' - and 'everywhere' in between.",

I did 4 DD A/C neoadjuvant with no issues of concern. The 12 weekly Taxol adjuvant were not as nice. When I saw my Dr before my 10th Taxol, I complained about how completely and utterly EXHAUSTED I was - just existing either laying in bed or on the couch in front of the TV. He told me that the Chemo had done about 85% of what it could do, so it was up to me and he was putting in a order saying IF I wanted to quit - he was 'approving' it. Well - as I had done the 4 A/C and 9 Taxol already with only 3 more Taxol to get the max. of what it could do, how could I quit so close to the 'finish line'? If I didn't finish and mets happened, how could I tell my Husband (of 34 yrs at the time) and Son (31) that I quit and did not do all I could have? They had done everything they could (Hubby - all house/cooking chores and 'house critters', Son all barn/horse chores) so all I had to be fight the Monster. Only you can decide what if best for you - not what anyone else has done or not done. Seek advice/input from your Dr - he/she is the one who can give you info based on your DX.",
