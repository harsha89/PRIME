He wants her to see the oncologist he works with to see feasibility of chemo b4 surgery, but why? Thought that was for shrinkage b4 lumectomy. Wife not totally happy so called for another opinion referall, this doc says 1-2 weeks to decide is ok, but this is Triple-Neg and came out of nowhere so not very sure here. He says will try and not do lymph node dissection since she got lymphedema on her other side, and we're not sure about a needle biopsy not being conclusive on the node being negative, and he said we don't know if it's the sentinel node, we can take out a few later. He wants to get his oncologist involved and the MRI is needed in the event she decides on another doctor anyway, but we both agree only 2 opinions now and move on because this is a more aggressive tumor. thanks all.",

A cyst is obvious on an ultrasound, the ultrasound also shows if there is vascular activity, using the blood system, tumors, like my wife's are vascular and NOT liquid, but solid, they can tell that from ultrasound, the suspicious ones are solid/vascular , if liquid center, it's most likely benign, and you'll be alright...generally.

      "Content": "May 6, 2015 07:43AM - edited May 6, 2015 08:29AM by art15 I was reading when my wife had biopsy, they had library of books.
