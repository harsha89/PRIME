Then in summer 2011 I noticed in my opposite breast a raised area - a ridge. It was not there before - and it was painful (which is what drew me to the area in the first place). I decided to monitor it for a couple of months and it was definately changing / growing - moving quickly. I hesitated going back to the surgeon because this wasn't a definate lump as my last experience with BC. So by September 2011 I visited the surgeon. They could feel 'something' but I had a clean mammo and ultrasound. I couldn't believe it because I KNEW something was different. As I had already had BC they decided to biopsy the area. The result was another high grade BC which turned out to be 4cm. Fortunately it was not invasive so I did not have to go through chemo again. I had a bilateral matectomy and I am doing fine now. Like you I had dense breasts and remember that mammos do not pick up 20% of BC. BUT keep a close check on your lump / raised area and push for a biopsy if you are worried / notice any changes. Good luck to you!",

I have to live with this tumour in situ until I have completed chemo (six months on treatment). I just hope that it becomes less painful! I would definately mention your pain to the specialist - but if they are like my specialists here they just think it's 'one of those things'. Some people get pain and others don't.

I have had mammograms etc before and I have a problem with cysts (had one large one drained a few years ago). After visiting my doctor a few weeks ago about something else) I just mentioned the lump in my breast. Within two days I had an appointment at the hospital. My scan showed a solid mass (tumour) and the radiographer held my hand and told me that this was no cyst. She said it was solid and irregular - about 5cm's.It was like a thunderbolt - this was not a cyst! That's not what I expected to hear!! My core biopsy was booked for Friday and went O.K. The 'mass' is not deep in my breast so maybe that helps - they got three good samples. The nurses told me that my results would have been ready for the next week (this week) but the consultant who I am with is not in so the ealiest I can get my results is Tuesday 8th September. This waiting is so cruel!! Trying to go abourt normal life and wondering if I've got cancer.....it's hard isn't it?

I understood that if the lump is SMOOTH it is MORE LIKELY to be fibrocystic. These changes are aggrevated by your periods so fibocystic changes happen more often in the time leading up to your period. So, this could be good news! Cancer lumps CAN be shown to be uneven and asymmetrical on a scan. The waiting is very hard but sending you benign wishes XXX. Not long to wait for your results now!

When I was diagnosed with BC I had all the usual blood tests - one being what we in England call the Liver Function Test (LFT). It was highly elevated and they couldn't explain why - although all other blood tests were fine. When I was in hospital one of the ladies was telling me that her LFT was also elevated after taking meds for depression / anxiety. I was on these meds for three weeks prior to diagnosis but to be honest they just seemed to make me worse and so I stopped them. That's at the point I had my LFT showing elevated levels. Blood tests two weeks after that showed that LFT test was falling and much better. The lady in the hospital said that some tablets have a  'coating' around them which can affect the liver in some people. It seems to me then that the liver is sensitive to all sorts of things I have been told that my fluctuating LFT results should not be a worry to me. As I said, don't know if this helps! I am not sure how my liver is coping with chemo - I will have a blood test in another week or so to check that XXX.",

First was 8th Sep 2009, basal triple negative grade 3. I had neoadjuvant chemo and the treatment was withdrawn after 4 rounds and the tumour did not respond. I had the tumour removed by WLE on 4th Jan 2010. My Oncologist thought I should consider bilateral mast then but my BS disagreed. In hindsight my Ocologist was of course right. Less than two years after treatment for my first BC and it is now back in my other breast. It is another grade 3 triple neg. I did have genetic testing and they found a mutation in  BRCA 1 of 'unknown significance' but my Onc thinks I should regard myself as being BRCA 1+ due to the type of cancer I have, the fact it's back so early and of course a very strong family history. So, just waiting for the operation now and just hoping that afterwards cancer will be a thing of the past. I decided not to have reconstruction. A personal decision really - I was down to have implants etc BUT I changed my mind. The least time I spend in the operating theatre the better. I have always been a busty (34 E) so it will take time to adjust I guess but there are some lovely prosthesis bras and undergarmets out there :) Karen XX",

I had aches and pains everywhere leading up to my diagnosis to the extent that I and the doctors were pretty much convinced the cancer had spead. It had not and I am still here. Take a day at a time and don't let your mind jump ahead too quickly. Try to deal with one thing at a time. traci is right - anxiety medication might help you right now. I took medication to help me sleep and at the time it was a godsend. The core needle biopsy is a simple procedure (I had one last year). A hollow needle is 'fired' into the centre of the tumour and 'grabs' a tissue sample. You will have a localised pain killer so you wont feel anything. There is nothing to worry about the procedure Pam. I do wish for B9 results for you - but if the results are not good, you will find lots of support on these boards. A step at a time Pam.

This is following my second diagnosis of TN breast cancer within two years. First diagnosed 8th Sep 2009. Had neoadjuvant chemo but stopped after four cycles as tumour didn't respond. My tumour was removed using WLE on 4th Jan 2010 then had rads. Now the cancer is back in my left breast this time and was diagnosed with that on 17th Oct 2011. They will not know the extent of the cancer until my breasts are removed as the new cancer does not show up on mammograms (I felt a new lump in August). Anyway, just waiting for the surgery and I am feeling a bit apprehensive. Good to hang out with you all X",

I noticed quickly that a raised area appeared - it felt different to the tumour I found in my other breast a year or so previously but nontheless I knew this was not right for me. After a couple of months I notified the hospital and was called in for a mammogram / ultrasound. They were both negative. Thankfully they performed a biopsy. They found high grade cancer but this time in situ - 4cm of it. I found this early because I was vigilent and I was drawn to this area by PAIN. I found this latest cancer before it became visible to mammorams / ultrasound. The moral of the story is: listen to your body, monitor the area and remain vigilent. If you are still in some pain in weeks / month from now then flag it up and get it checked out. All the best to you! Karen.",

In England under the NHS we are 'told' where to go by the GP and the team we end up with is a matter of luck / where you live and under some circumstances who you know! You were so 'fortunate' to get your tests results the next day but I suspect that you had a very stressful 24 hours! This time of waiting is so much of a strain because I am just expected to 'get on with life' - I am a mum and partner and a full time teacher. I need to begin planning my lessons, cleaning and ironing and staying 'upbeat' for my son but inside I am so scared. I keep thinking that a positive result will change everything and if I have got cancer how bad / invasive is it? etc etc...... I lay awake at night thinking about it and then try to put a smile on my face for the world when I wake up. This waiting game is just a torment.I suppose that's why these blogs are so good - WE ARE NOT ALONE. Wishing you all the best CoolBreeze. There is so much positive stuff on here really and I think that is the key. Stay positive. Thinking of you. Karen XXX.",
