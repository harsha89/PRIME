Just got back from the grocery store and even got the car washed. The food all looks so good in the store, but when I taste it at home it tastes crappy. Next week things will begin to taste better, tho. My teeth hurt today too. Eileen - glad to hear you've made it thru the first few days. You \"sound\" strong and in control. :) Hope everyone has a lovely weekend!",

My main gripe right now is the watery eyes. They are always tearing and I wake up with crusty eyes. I'll see what my Onc says tomorrow. I'm not sure if it's from the taxotere or the Herceptin. Eileen - Great to hear that you are doing well, although you have to have that colonoscopy. My guess is that your bathroom issues are from the chemo. Hopefully your doctors will figure it out and help you control those nasty side effects. Good luck.",

Wish I could celebrate with a gourmet meal and some fine wine, but will postpone that celebration for a few weeks ( when the food and drink will actually taste normal.) Good luck to all Buckeye ladies, whether you are currently receiving treatment or are done. The chemo WAS doable. (but I certainly don't want to do it again!!)",

(i was so busy reading other threads that I forgot to check back on the Ohio thread.). Anyway, the 4th treatment was not too bad. So far my 3rd was the worst for fatigue and aches. Not sure why. As a side note, I think I made a huge mistake last week when I decided to get a little natural Vitamin D. As you Ohio ladies know, we've seen the sun a lot this winter. Because my Vitamin D level is low, I sat outside on my porch to get some sun on my face and arms. not long - just 15 minutes. I'm assuming the ugly, nasty rash I got all over my face was a result of the sun. After the skin peeled and flaked off (and using a ton of lotion) the rash has finally cleared up after a week. I guess I won't do that again! :(",
