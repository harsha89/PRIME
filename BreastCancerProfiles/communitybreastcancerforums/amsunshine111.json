On Friday. My surgeon tells me that I'm going to have a drain, the same kind as I did with the lumpectomy. Where should I tell him to put the drain so it's most comfortable for me? I have big boobs and it really hurt to have that tube smack-dab against me under the bra. I would really like to have it so it didn't go under the bra. Please tell me your experience and where you found the drain to be most comfortable after this biopsy. I'm dreading having another drain. Thank you in advance. Log in to post a reply",
