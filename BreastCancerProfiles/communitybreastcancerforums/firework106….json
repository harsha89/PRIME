I decided to have a Bi-lat Masectomy for a few reasons....first of all, my tumor was es+as well as HER2+. Secondly, I wanted to avoid radiation at all costs! and finally, it was important to me to have symmetry once I had reconstructive surgery. I was given the research from my onc and surgeon but the decision was mine. With my dense breast and history of cyst, aspirations blah blah.....I knew having them both removed was the right decission for me. Good luck with the surgery. Keep us posted. Blessings, Lorraine",

Sounds like she's a very smart woman, probably needs the stimulus! I hope by now she's decided to opt for pain meds......it's true that the stress of pain affects healing. I'm just hopeful you both will be able to enjoy the Holidays.",
