I don't think I've had a solid night since June :( Just in case you need to hear some good stories, I had a lumpectomy 2 years ago that went really really smoothly, was not too bad to recover from (I had it on a Friday and went back to work Tuesday) and my scar is invisible now so I had a really good experience overall. I'm hoping the mastectomy goes as complication free as well though I'm scared of the pain and unknown cosmetic results. I'm going this route now since DCIS recurred on the other side. I'm 39 with a husband and small furbaby (dog) at home, no kids. I fortunately have not had to have chemo for breast cancer but I am a Hodgkin Disease (lymphoma) survivor as well - when I was 19 I went through it all, a bone marrow transplant etc. which was the end of Hodgkins. I do have the option to do another lumpectomy with radiation and tamoxifen, but, after all the treatment I went through 20 years ago I feel like I've scrambled my insides enough and my BS seemed more comfortable with me going the mastectomy route as it's so rare to have this happen twice in 2 years at my age, etc. Wishing you the best!!

My bigger surprise is that apparently I don\u2019t see my PS again anytime soon. I was direct to implant under the muscle and they don\u2019t see the \u201cpoint\u201d since the next meeting would be to evaluate things they could continue to improve, and things are still settling now. I see my BS tomorrow though. What would the \u201cpoint\u201d of that be since you could make the argument we already know the biopsy results? They all work together at City of Hope. Honestly I\u2019m feeling a little grr. Yes things are settling but i do have questions/concerns. Is it normal not to see your PS after surgery",

For some reason when I imagine the surgery I picture weeks of torment. Did you do under the muscle? TEs or direct? @Linda2119 you are my surgery twin!! 9/10 is the day, also doing direct to implant also (are you under the muscle too?). Where are you having your surgery? I'm so sorry you have to continue on with radiation. I've had a really hard week of flipping back and forth between doctors and methods (after a summer of research and tortuous indecision). Has this happened to anyone else? The mastectomy decision was easy. I'm 39 and I've had bilateral DCIS now with a history of other cancer so they think it's likely to recur even if i go through radiation etc... The reconstruction method and team, not so much. I ended up sticking with 9/10 only because I couldn't get my old date/team back before October and I'd already made all the arrangements at work (is this a dumb reason? I guess I couldn't have fixed it...). Totally different methods. Never have I felt so indecisive and neurotic. My mantra right now is letting go / giving up control.... But it's kindof taken a toll on my heart :( Best wishes to everyone on here!!",

I managed to see mine as well Wednesday and he basically said everything was fine, we could address any potential changes/a 2nd surgery once things are fully healed and settled (he prefers 4-6 months, but I'm pushing for 3 so I can get it in this year for insurance reasons) and I'll see him again in a month. I'm pretty happy with my right boob but the left one is a bit misshapen... the nipple is a bit off, lumps, and implant is sitting very high so we'll see. I keep hearing about women who have to wear bras or compression garments which makes sense to me but my PS didn't have me wear anything - I had an uncomfortable one in the hospital and it felt better not to have it on, they told me that was fine and the bra was only for my comfort. Hmm. Does everyone else who had a mastectomy have to wear one? Any recommends? Wondering if it might feel better to have something now that I'm a bit more mobile around the house. @Palimom and anyone looking for a way to sleep, this wedge product has been a lifesaver for me: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JMN5GWI/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Expensive yes, and I don't use that weird head bolster, but my husband can adjust how much wedge/incline I want with this (more during the day for reading, slightly less for sleeping) and the knee wedge keeps me in place and we put a regular pillow behind my head when I sleep and honestly I have little trouble sleeping through the night with this thing.",

I spent 2 nights in hospital only due to being a bit lightheaded/nauseous and my house is at the top of 3 flights of stairs so better safe than sorry, but really no complications (knock on wood). I was expecting an elephant to land on my chest based on what I\u2019ve read, but he never showed up, just some bearable tightness around the upper pole and obviously some pain but well managed with percoset, gabapentin (for nerves) and baclafin (sp? Muscle relaxer). This combo is really great! The drain sites hurt if I move but are not on \u201cfire\u201d as some have experienced. I did direct to implant under the muscle nipple sparing. I think my right nipple might be a bit off grr and the left implant is riding a bit \u201chigh\u201d, but have been told it really takes 3 months to figure out where things will land so I will try to be patient!! I really can\u2019t complain as it looks like they did a good job overalland it was nice waking up with boobs. Hard to believe it\u2019s already Friday! Positive healing vibes and hugs sent to all.
