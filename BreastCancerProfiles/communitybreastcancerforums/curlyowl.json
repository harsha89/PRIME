I went because my right arm, armpit and right breast are sore and aching into my rib cage that started in October, I had felt a very tiny lump and then it seemed to have gone away. My mamogram has shown a \"dominant 8mm nodule at the nipple line at 6 o'clock. Scattered benign nodularity is also seen bilaterally in the lateral aspects. These are likely cysts or certainly intramamary lymph node on the left.\" I am now waiting the results of the spot compression and ultrasound. I also now noticed the left breast is larger and the veins are really prominent.",
