I was doing so well after my SNB several weeks ago, then because two of three nodes sampled proved positive I underwent ALND this past week. My doc called with a very happy \"all the rest of your nodes were clear\" and I felt relief, then grief at the loss of 29 healthy nodes. I am so much sorer than the first surgery, and feeling lots of neoropathy, tired of the drain already (tho I too am lucky to have a great DH who wants to take care of the task)....so I am taking it a bit harder than I anticipated. I know it is a good thing to not have the cancer be worse than it is......and I know intellectually that I don't really have all that much to whine about.......but at the same time I am emotionally upset that they traumatized my axillary, left me bruised and injured,Â and removed 29 healthy, hard-working lymph nodes that I will never get back. Think I am done with my whine now.......",
