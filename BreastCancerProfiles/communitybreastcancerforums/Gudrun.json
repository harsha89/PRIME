This was exactly 3 years ago. I see your worries and I won't give any advice. But here is what my daughter has done so far: After dx she started chemo with antibodies right away without egg preservation nor ovary suppression. Thereafter, she started Tam+Zoladex adjuvantly. Now, after 2.5 years of antihormone tx, she stopped to get pregnant. And guess what: in less than 3 months she has got her period back! Best wishes for you, Gudrun",

Maybe I missed that, but was the remaining tissue rediagnosed as to percentage of ER and PR, or if it was still HER2, or if Ki67 has changed ... My daughter also had residual tumor tissues. But HER2 had disappeared, Ki had decreased considerably, and HR status had nearly remained the same. She was told by her oncologists that TP didn't usually get pcr since driven by estrogene, which didn't mean a worse prognosis than HER2+, HR-, together with a pcr. Best wishes Gudrun",
