I'm just curious if there is any at home remedies to help the swelling or completely get rid of it. I just have the strangest feeling about this and want it gone. And so if I try to naturally heal it and it doesn't go away, then I could feel better about going in...I know sounds a little wacky.",

Very strange feeling, being that it was coming from my boob. When self examining further it feels like thumb sitting on top of my implant...yes there are implants from 10+ years ago. Is this something that should really be looked at in the first place, do I need to be worried?

I put the emphasis on suggesting, because I don't want to do this at all.  I was aggressive enough by having a mastectomy so why do they want to do radiation on me now? Should I get a second opinion? Also what does this mean as far as my chemo plan.  We were only going to do the 2 drugs v. 3 only 9 weeks instead of 5 months.  But after having my drain out the other day my surgeon said that the whole treatment plan may change now because of the margins...Also, with it being on my left the radiation oncologist said that I will have to learn a breathing trick that brings my heart down and to the right.  This is why I chose to do the mast instead of lumpectomy. Am I now going to be subjected to heart issues. UGGGHHHH!!! Really need some advice here.",
