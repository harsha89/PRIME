I was diagnosed with breast cancer in both (go figure...:) last month, planning lumpectomy surgeries and then found cancer in lymphnode --treatment changed and getting chemo first for 5 months, every two weeks (AC-T as it seems some of you are getting, too) I got my first treatment on Monday and Tuesday-Thursday was pretty brutal. Does anyone else end up in bed for three days after treatment? I felt pretty good on Friday, and good this Saturday morning. I suppose everyone is different, Also I live alone, my children in college and close by in another town. I am finally reaching out for help from friends and will get people to check in on me during those tough three days. We're going to fight this, ladies -- my cousin calls me \"The Warrior\"--I didn't feel like one a few days ago, but I'm back!! Shaving my head on Monday since I'm told I will lose it by the next session--don't feel like waking up each morning with another clump falling out! There are some really cute scarves, and friends have already bought some for me. My daughter is excited to do my make-up :) Sending love and strength, and I'm sure I'll be on often. BC",

I googled the topic since I couldn't find it by typing in \"Crying and radiation\" in this search box. :) It's my last week of radiation (6 1/2 weeks after 3 months of bi-weekly chemo--Stage III, cancer in most lymphnodes on left side, cancer in both breasts. Sorry, I never figured out how to do my profile at the bottom.... I had to tell myself to \"toughen up\" before going in for my boost today. I think it's exactly as one woman just wrote that it's a combination of so many things. For me, too, it's letting go of trying so hard to be a good patient and do everything they told me to do for 9 months... But I am an emotional person anyway, and I cried sometimes on chemo. I remember my oncologist (who I switched to one at Dana Farber who had a heart...) saying that she never heard of crying or being emotional as a side affect of chemo--REALLY?? I doubted that one, and just quietly replied that she did now. I have learned to accept that my body has gone through hell, including the hormonal havic, the estrogen sucked out of me, and that my facial hair did return (the first to return) I have to add humor or I'll go mad. Anyway, ladies, I'm going to try to stop when beating myself up for crying. It's a great outlet, too, and can be very therapeutic -- Here Here for showing emotions!!",

I just wanted to ask ll your wonderful \"old timer Stage III ladies\" if you have a routine to keep positive and in the day like meditation, etc. I strted listening to Bernie Segal (some of you will remember this Dr from the 70's and 80's) who is a true believer how being positive helps recovery. I was aastounded at how negative my ONCOLOGIST and SURGEON were about my Stage III diagnosis. I still have to fill out the hospital questionnaires and will mention this -- Of course I thought of all of these comments/replies I could have given afger leaving my appt. I would be the one to say \"Well, I have heard a lot of success stories about women with my same diagnosis\" and would here things such as \"Yes, but there's also a good chance it will spread, too....\" or \"Well....anything can happen though....\" My blood pressure is rising just by thinking about it. I LOVE that this forum has started so I can come on here and get another shot/whif of hope, joy, and positvity!! Thank you all to post here!! Barbara Cornwall Log in to post a reply",
