My scalp is sore/itchy and I still have a strange feeling in my mouth. Thankfully no mouth sores yet. How's my other ladies doing after getting the Neulasta injection?",

Now I'm almost 2 weeks post treatment and I feel great and didn't miss a day of work this time around. It was a breeze with minimal side effects. So I hope yours goes better next time too.

I told my husband I'm not going back to the E.R. no matter what. I was so nervous for my second infusion. I did change from getting the Neulasta shot to giving myself Neupogen instead and didn't have the killer headache or bone pain. And ironically I now have a sore in my lady parts too. What the heck is that all about? Hope you feel better soon.",

My MO isn't very attentive or caring either Katie. She spends literally 3 minutes with you. And that's after waiting almost 2 hours in the waiting room. I haven't liked her from day one but I just wanted to get treatment going and sucked it up. I actually told my husband the other day after an appointment with her that if my cancer came back I would not have her treat me again. I seriously would like to find a new oncologist. I am only taking 1 Biotin tablet daily (2500 mcg). Should I be taking more Katie? I started taking it about a month after my last chemo. I'm sure you can start it earlier though.",

They did a CT scan on my head that came out negative. My white blood cell count was elevated more than double what it should be so they did a chest xray thinking an infection. But that came back negative as well. So they thought maybe meningitis and I had a lumbar puncture. Guess what negative too. So after 11 hours and few different pain killers later I was sent home with no answers. My oncologist thought maybe the Zofran was causing my headaches so she had me stop them on Sunday but it didn't help. Now I'm thinking it may have been the steroids. Who knows. So here I lay with a stiff neck and sore back from lumbar puncture. I sure hope my second treatment doesn't end this way too.",

I'll report back on how that went.  I've heard that once you go through chemo, radiation is a walk in the park, we'll see. ",

Well today marks 1 year since my first doctors appointment after I found my lump.  I am feeling pretty good.  I don't think I'm completely back to normal but getting stronger every day.  I am 7 months PFC and it's been 4 1/2 months since my last RAD treatment.  My hair is growing great.  It's about down to my ears on the sides but it doesn't look as long in the back because it is so curly.  It's finally long enough to get a small round brush around it so I can blow dry it some and I bought a micro mini straightener to help tame the curls.  I can't complain though, I have hair.  My skin has a slight tan on it from RADS and I can still feel twinges once in awhile from the skin regenerating.  It did take a while to get my energy back though.  Chemo and RADS kicked my ass and I didn't really feel it until active treatment was actually done.  The hot flashes are obnoxious and only made worse since starting Tamoxifen.  I haven't slept a full night since I can't remember.  My MO prescribed Gabapentin but I had to stop taking it after 3 weeks cause it made my anxiety/depression go through the roof.  I'm not sure if I'm going to pursue something else or not.  I've also had a lot of joint pain.  Anyone else?  I quit working right before the holidays.   I owned my own cleaning company for 7 years and I just wasn't happy doing that anymore and physically was wiped out.  I just needed a break, so I'll be on the hunt for a new career soon. I hope you all had great holidays and are mending well.   ",

You'll change into a gown and then be brought into a room where the CT machine is. Unfortunately I had to remove my hat because you'll probably not be wearing the same head covering every time since they make a mold for you to lay in during each treatment. I didn't really mind because frankly I'm sick of wearing hats everyday, especially in this heat. You lay down on a hard table with a \"bean bag\" type pillow under your shoulders and head area with your arm up. My feet were rubber banded together so that you don't cross your feet. After positioning me the way she wanted she then inflated the bag and then sucked all the air out of it and it molded right to me. Next she took some measurements and put some tape on me. Then she left the room and CT began. After coming back in she took some pictures of my position so that it will be exactly the same every time. Not the most pleasant thing since you are exposed but at this point I've flashed my boobs so much I almost don't even care anymore. LOL I was then given 3 tattoos. One on each side like by your love handles and one in my cleavage. Barely noticeable and only stung for a second. All said and done was maybe 45 minutes. I go back next Tuesday to go over the exact planning then start Rads the following week. Met with my MO yesterday and was told I won't start Tamoxifen until Rads are done. I asked her about the hot flashes I've had and she said taking vitamin E can help. Especially since they probably will get worse once on Tamoxifen. I'm gonna start taking that tonight. I'll report back if that helps since I know others have the same issue. I hope everyone is handling their last rounds of chemo with minimal side effects. You're in the home stretch.",
