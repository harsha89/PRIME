For several months I have been having pain under my my armpit and have notice a white to reddish discharge from my nipples. Although the discharge is my regular it still scares me because it's been over 5 years since I breast fed. Both my grandmothers had breast cancer (neither survived). I know I have to go have this checked out but I have no medical insurance(work does not provide). I am wondering if anyone knows of resources out the that can help with funding for a mammogram. I can't afford to pay for one. I'm scared out of my mind. Don't know what to really do. Log in to post a reply",
