It has been a long day already, I have literally been on the phone almost all day trying to fiquere out what to do.   I finally got a call back from the cancer center I really felt comfortable with & they are squeezing me in, so I felt a little peace wash over me & felt God at work. So the plan right now is I am going back to the doctor I've been with so far at 1pm tomorrow. (This doctor will be moving away next month.)  So meanwhile, the center set me up for an MRI tomorrow morning , as long as my insurance precertifies it! SO if you could pray for it all to go through ok so I can have this done tomorrow morning, that would be great! Then I will start with the new doctor at the center on tues. 8am. The lady on the phone at the center was so nice & she said don't worry we are going to take care of you! She really put my mind at ease. Thank you all for praying, at least I feel I have a direction.",

I opted for a masectomy after the doctor showed me another small spot that showed up on my MRI. They have me in Stage 1. I am having the MX & then Chemo.  I would appreciate prayers as I navigate this journey. We serve a great God & he is going to shine through this!!!",

My girls are 13 & 14 , they are the ones who really took it hard. I told them that I want them to do something for me , I want them to continue to do all the things they are in & not let satan get them down. SO they are gearing up to leave for soccer here soon. They will be a support to me, as they already want to know everything. I don't want to burden them with too much though, as I want them to stay active in all their events.     The \"invasive\" of the idc scares me a little. So that means it is already spreading right? Also, is there any like questions I should be asking up front? I have been looking at these boards, but what should I absolutely know?     Thank you for your prayers for me, God is good",

I saw on some of the boards that some recommend going to a cancer center, has anyone else moved over to that? My friend told me last night, (she had a lump that was benign) that she went to one & they did ALL the tests in 1 day, she knew that day what it was as they did the mammo, then ultra, then, the biopsy. I am going to look into the one near us today, it might be nice to maybe be able to get faster results & treatment.",

I didn't even have the surgery date yet & doctor already said I will be having chemo when I recover from surgery.     I have the same up & down feeling too, one minute I'm like yes I can do this because everyone around me is telling me so, then the next minute I'm sitting there bawling. This morning I had to meet with the anesthesia people & she is asking me questions & I start crying. It is just an emotional roller coaster.     If you feel like crying , then do it. Take a day for yourself & do what you want to do. I took a day & stayed in bed, I just couldn't deal with anymore information.       I (like the lady above) also think TOO much, so I know the chemo will be a must. I've already read too much about it recurring from one little spot they must have missed. So for my peace of mind I will be getting it, even though my whole mind & body is reeling from even the thought of trying to handle it & take care of my family & try to work.    God is my strength right now, I have to continually lean on him each day, sometimes each minute. Feel free to message me.... ",
