One is papillary apocrine metaplasia, another focal columnar cell change and the last one is PASH. Plus I have dense breast tissue. I will see the breast specialist in a few days... I am thinking she will either say lets wait and see, or have lumpectomies, or remove all of the tissue. Anyone else have a similar experience/advice? Log in to post a reply",

I am going to have a MRI soon and am trying to pinpoint the best time to have it done. Usually there about 27 or so days in my cycle but this time it was only 20 days. Log in to post a reply",
