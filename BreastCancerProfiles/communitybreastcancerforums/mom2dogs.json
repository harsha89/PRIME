    "Content": "mom2dogs wrote: Hello, I'm 48 years, 4.5 years out from a hysterectomy but I kept my ovaries. My mother had estrogen-positive BC at 62, still in remission and I had a clear mammogram about 6 months ago. The last 6 weeks, I noticed some pain in my left breast, under the arm. I thought it was the usual cyclical breast pain I get but then noticed that it remained when the other pain went away, pretty much there all the time. I can't tell when I get periods because of the hysterectomy. Yesterday morning, I noticed a swelling in that location and last night went \"hunting\" for a lump, which I found. The hard part is about the size of a pea and it feels spongy and painful around that. There is nothing on the other side. I can't tell if the hard part hurts on its own. I've never had cysts in the past and don't know if they'd suddenly pop up at my age. I also don't have a regular gyno since moving a few years ago and have an appointment in about a month. Any thoughts? Log in to post a reply",
