I was dx with high grace DCIS 12/26/218 & had nipple/areola/skin sparing BMX with TEs 2/13/19. My PS (at Stanford) did a new procedure called a hybrid where half of the TE is inside the pecs & half is hanging held up by the matrix. I have 2 maternal aunts with metastatic breast cancer & my grandmother had one breast removed at my age. I also didn't want to deal with radiation, HRT for 5 years, & every 6 months monitoring had I chosen to have lumpectomy. I keep reading about breast implant illness & it makes a lot of sense because it is still a foreign body engaging the systems 24H a day for the lifetime of the implant. Anyway, I asked my PS to just take out my TEs, then put autologous fat over the pecs, then close me up. He says he doesn't do that. He wants to proceed with the silicones, but I do not want to anymore. I am 32A to begin with so I am basically flat chested plus my husband says he doesn't care either way. He is just worried it might affect my psyche later as I am a little vain :) Anyway, do you mind sharing who your surgeon is? If he/she is not local, perhaps someone he/she knows from CA? I am also curious on how it looks & how long was your recovery from the surgery? Thank you.",
