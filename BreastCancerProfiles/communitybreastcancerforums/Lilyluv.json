(poor thing looks pretty mangled)   But at this point it looks like I had a boob lift, except for it's a bit flatter on one side of it where the lump was removed.  If I put my arm up you can tell it's quite a bit smaller.   For me it's subjective though...I can't tell if it was this size after healing up from surgery, or if it got smaller after rads. If you have insurance, some insurance companies will pay for reconstruction  if, after all is said and done, your breast isn't cosmetically acceptable to you.  That could be an option for you.",

Yay! Only minor stuff happening so far with regard to rads.    Question for you pros...have any of you had deep aching underneath your breast  deep inside like it's your chest muscle or rib? (tumor was very close to chest wall and surgeon couldn't get a good margin there).   Also, right after rads, it feels like I have a heating pack implanted in there - handy in this cold weather! But it feels like it's coming from within and not from my skin.  Skin is just a faint pink until the next morning and I had that last week with none of this internal burning sensation.   Is it also common to get some minor chills on and off, once you start to feel some of the burn?   This is day 8.  ",

Rlsteadman, another new adventure with the boosts, hey? All the marks OK now?     On dieting - the nutritionist at the hospital told me that while they don't recommend dieting during rads, she said that 1300 cal was OK if the loss is only 1/2-1lb. a week.   Maybe you can ask if they'd let you do a diet if it isn't too restrictive?  I'm not overweight, but after getting off ERT, it's hard to know if the pounds are going to come packing on.   The nutrition aspect is confusing.  A lot of things on the Internet say eat lots of protein.  Some say antioxidants interfere with rads.  Some say they help.  My onc says doesn't matter - eat whatever you want - no special nutrients or supplements necessary.   So I'm just mainly limiting cake, cookies, Dairy Queen (not too hard in the winter anyhow), and chips and cheese for the next few weeks and not plopping down in front of the tv at nite - danger zone because out comes the snacking when the tv goes on. ",

The nurse had looked at my breast a couple of weeks ago and said it looked good when I first mentioned burning. Since I have light olive skin, I burn with a pinkish/tan so it's not easy to see unless you're in certain lighting, so of course it doesn't look that bad but it burns quite a bit especially in the evening.  Back then that nurse said to use cornstarch. So I used it.  No one has examined my breast since treatment started other than when I asked the nurse a couple of weeks ago to take a look. I also have had a red slightly raised rash on my upper chest - looks like pink freckles and is itchy.   Is there any OTC stuff that helps with itching and burning like Lanocaine that's OK to use at least in the evening?  The other stuff doesn't seem to be helping. Last nite my nipple itched and it looked like there was just a tiny bit of skin flaking off and there is clear fluid inside it.  Is that anything to be concerned about? ",

Who was the person that gave you the report? A doctor shouldn't release a report before explaining them to you first. A diagnostic mammogram is like a regular one, but they take more images to get a better view.  Ultrasounds don't give a lot of information. Getting a diagnostic mammogram doesn't imply that a lump is suspicious of being malignant.  It means they need more detail to determine what they're seeing.  They're just getting a better look at this point.  A lot of the terms on those reports sound scary, but many of them are just ways the doctors describe benign features in medical terminology.   Only your doctor/radiologist can explain your particular report to you.  If you start doing Google searches, it's not going to tell you much about your own personal exam because there are so many variations of what one medical term can mean.  There are so many lumps and bumps in breasts that are described with the same wording, and the words used can needlessly scare the heck out of you :-).  The birads explanation below may help you out. Category 0 -- Incomplete Your mammogram or ultrasound didn't give the radiologist enough information to make a clear diagnosis. Don't worry, this may mean that scar tissue from a previous surgery or biopsy may have shown up, or that a breast lump that is big enough to be easily felt isn't imaging clearly. You will need to have a follow-up image done.  Hope this helps.",

I hate to see what they find on breast exams after having biopsies and surgery!  I only had full breast rads on the right, so it surprises me that there would be any side effect involving the heart.  You've got a good point that some of these side effects could be causing the fatigue to linger.  I have to take thyroid meds for an underactive thyroid, so I'm also going to call the endocrinologist to run a blood test to see where it stands after all this.  Wouldn't be surprised if being off estrogen and rads could affect thyroid function. ",

No samples though.  My surgery was mid December.  Three weeks or so after surgery I developed a bad rash and itching covering about 2/3 of my breast and running up towards my shoulder (looked I had a demi bra made out of pink itchy skin).  Surgeon didn't know what it was. (she looked at me and literally said \"I've never seen anything like this before - I don't know WHAT that is!\"  So she just stood there not knowing what to do).  Well that was comforting.  :-(       So she brought in another surgeon and his best guess was that it was a reaction to steri strips.  She prescribed cortisone lotion and double Benedryl 3x day.  Why a pharmaceutical co. puts floral scent in something that treats allergies is anyone's guess, but it didn't help.  Benedryl didn't do anything either.  So then it was a course of pred for 6 days.  It's hard to describe how badly it itched.  Like having your boob sunk in a bucket of mosquitos.    I had my setup a couple of weeks ago when it finally stopped itching and was looking almost flesh toned again.  What a relief not having that itching!  My breast has never gone back to pre-rash appearance though.  It's pink and puffed up under my nipple with big pores in that area, my nipple turns yellow when it's cold and inverts and crinkles.  My breast was still almost imperceptibly  pink when I started rads this week but the itching has been long gone until yesterday.  So it's unknown what caused the rash that wouldn't leave - steri strips, internal stitches or whatever.  I had steri strips for the vaccuum core biopsy incision and didn't have a problem, so go figure.   I'd rather get pain than than go through that 24/7 itching torture again. I didn't scratch - just sort of tucked my arm next to it and brushed my arm against it now and then.   Doc and nurse always meet with you on Mondays, so I'll ask about what to do for it. Just didn't know that you could get side effects so soon. ",

In this cold weather I'm not going to walk around with no top on in here.  How do you keep gauze over a wound under your boob?  I tried cutting a strip of tshirt and tying it around my chest underneath, but it either was too tight or fell off.   Nurse said call back Monday if it's not better.   Mammogram and seeing the RO is 6 mo. for me.",

That radiologist sounds like he could use a course in communication.  Don't let your imagination run away with what he said, and most of all don't google.  Some of the terminology can be very confusing to us laypersons.    ",
