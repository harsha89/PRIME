Immediately, \"my team\" pushed to have me do aggressive chemotherapy...only they told me that they didn't call it \"aggressive chemotherapy\". I asked, \"So, what do you call it when you are using two strong chemotherapy drugs through a port?\" (The drugs had to be used through a port because if a drop accidentally spilled on your skin through intravenous injection it would cause necrosis of the skin. Also, the nurses who help administer the chemo drugs also end up getting cancer because they are just around the drugs.) The answer was, \"Well, we use the strongest drugs, so we can kill the cancer, but we don't call it \"aggressive chemo\". The first thing my doctor said to me was, \"Your body is out of alignment, that is why you have cancer.\" I had been doing research, aggressively, after being diagnosed. I had some answers. I said, \"I know my body is out of alignment. So, what can we do to get it back into alignment, without resorting to chemotherapy?\" She said, \"This is the only protocol we use for cancer.\" I switched doctors. The new doctor said, \"I hear you have chosen not to do chemotherapy.\" Then he looked at my chart on his computer, turned to me and said, \"I can see why.\" I was given a special X-ray to test my bones and see if I could take medication. (At no time was I ever told that our body ALWAYS REMEMBERS how much radiation it can take - and there is a finite amount before it destroys your body. I learned this on my own through extensive, exhausting research. I told the doctor of what I had found out - I am not sure if he already knew, or if he decided to look into it on his own.) I am taking the generic Anastrazole of Arimidex. My body is starting to hurt all over and I am not sure if this is even the right thing for me to take. Doing the right thing for your body does NOT make it feel bad, it makes it feel good. The doctors are not really to blame for the lack of knowledge - and neither is \"your team\". They are NEVER taught this at university because Big Pharma controls what the universities are teaching - and it goes on MUCH further than that. Go to YouTube and type in The Truth About Cancer. It will open your eyes!! There will be people that you will be drawn to - look at their websites. A nutritionist, exceptionally brilliant, David Getoff, used to teach accredited classes at Grossmont Hospital in La Mesa - until Sharp Hospital took it over and put in a Cancer Center. David Getoff was telling us how to keep healthy, using over the counter supplements and vitamins, eating organically, cookware to use (only that made in USA, Italy, Japan, Germany, and Switzerland - because the other countries use \"pot metals\" with their stainless steel and it leaches poison into your food. No one should be using aluminum.) David Getoff now teaches in Lemon Grove and lectures all over. Eating organic foods and taking the right supplements, etc. does NOT sell drugs. Cancer sells drugs. It's makes billions of dollars in profit every year. There will be over 280,000 NEW breast cancer diagnosis this year...MORE next year is predicted. That is JUST breast cancer!! Monsanto had an extensive research study done in England in the 80s. It was to test gmo products (genetically modified organisms) to see if they would harm people. It was discovered that it caused cancer and a whole slew of diseases. The doctor in charge of the research talked about this amazing discovery at a conference where he was speaking. On his way home, his wife called him to tell him that people from his work had people come to their home and had confiscated their computers and all of his research - and that he had been fired! He did not know that it was a SECRET RESEARCH PROJECT. He thought that Monsanto wanted to know so that they would not harm anyone...but that is NOT why Monsanto wanted to know... Monsanto then started planting gmo crops everywhere...claiming that they needed to grow food fast because they could not grow food fast enough the way it was being done and we were running out of food!! And people BELIEVED THE LIES!!! Only in America - where capitalism is king - can crops be grown to poison the people so that pharmaceutical companies can make billions of dollars in profits every year!! They are growing crops that they KNEW would poison us!!! What makes a gmo crop different than a regular (organic) crop? There are two sugar molecules in the plant that are fine, unless they are spliced together - which makes the plant poison. Insects will not eat poison plants. That is why those crops were grown without all the harm from insects destroying them. 95% of the wheat in this country is gmo (flour for bread, cakes, etc. - it's in everything!) 95% of the corn in this country is gmo (corn, corn syrup, etc. - it's in everything!) 90% of the cotton in this country is gmo (this is why some people have allergies to clothing - it is not always because it is synthetic.) PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE find a nutritionist near you - talk to people who have seen a nutritionist - go to Sprouts, Jimbo's, Whole Foods, etc. and see if you can talk to someone in the vitamin department that might know of one in your area. None of my team knows anything about nutrition - and almost bragged about it - saying that it was NOT their specialty. I said, \"But it should be! The first thing that my doctor told me was that my body was out of alignment.\" They never learned it in school. They were never taught - and that is the way Big Pharma wants it!!! Everyone has cancer in their body. It's in the air we breathe, the water we bathe in (chlorine and flouride are both poisons), it's leached in through cooking utensils, it is in our food. However, MOST younger people have a decent immune system that fights off the cancer. People like you and me don't have such a good immune system. I don't know about you, but I have had an EXTREMELY stressful life - and STRESS is the main cause of MOST diseases. Also, inflammatory foods: wheat, sugar, dairy. Does that sound familiar? Ha Ha. Okay, I am writing a lengthy page . . . and I hope you read it to here. Go to YouTube: The Truth About Cancer Go to David Getoff's website. Chris Beat Cancer, Dr. Josh Axe, Dr. Veronique DeSaulnier, etc. There are MANY natural ways to BEAT CANCER!!! Black paste, Rick Simpson Oil, Hyperthermia in conjuction with low dose radiation. And there are SO MANY, MANY other ways - but . . . Big Pharma does NOT want them in business and has been doing all kinds of harassment things to the clinics . . . you can read the HORRIBLE things that BIG PHARMA has been getting away with doing!!! While health insurance won't cover most of these - Medicare will. Here's the rub. Once diagnosed with cancer, or some other \"catastrophic\" disease - you go to Social Security and, even if you are not 65, you will be put onto Medicare, only it takes two years for it to be processed. (However, there are attorneys who also work these kind of cases - you can find their advertisements everywhere, including The Reader.) Medicare is usually for people aged 65 and older. Medicare is NOT selling drugs. Medicare has to BUY THE DRUGS for you, which are costly. Medicare has a budget. Medicare wants you to get better - so they WILL PAY for hyperthermia with the low dose radiation. It was a hyperthermia clinic in the Los Angeles area that told me about Medicare. I am six months away from 65, so they told me it would actually be better for me to wait. It has taken over 10-15 years for this cancer to metastasize into what it is now. It is not going anywhere fast, thank God! I hope this has helped you - and any other reader that is reading this. jk P.S. Please post this and talk to other people about this . . . it is only through us that the word will be spread. Monsanto and the other chemical companies DEFEATED Prop 13, which was to make food ingredients mandatory. But the people have DEMANDED better foods - and now even companies like Heinz, Doritos, Best Foods, General Mills, etc. are making foods that are organic - you may have to look for them - but we demanded good food and the farmers are giving it to us!! And we are buying it!! That means that the organic farms are getting BIGGER and can give us BETTER PRICES on ORGANIC foods!!!",
