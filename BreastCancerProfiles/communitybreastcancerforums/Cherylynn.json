ON A MONDAY, TUESDAY HAD A MAMAGRAM, ECHOGRAM, & NEEDLE BIOPSY. WEDNESDAY THE PATHOLIGIST CALLED ME AND TOLD ME I HAD BREAST CANCER.  THURSDAY I TALKED TO THE SURGEON.  FRIDAY I HAD A MRI.  THE FOLLOWING TUESDAY I SAW THE SURGEON TO DISCUSS SURGERY.  THURSDAY I MET WITH THE ONCOLOGIST & WENT TO THE HOSPITAL FOR CHEST XRAYS & TO PREADMIT.  WEDNESDAY OF THE NEXT WEEK I HAD SURGERY.  SINCE  AUGUST THE 18, I HAVE BEEN TO SEE A DOCTOR 26 TIMES.  ONCE IN A WHILE I COME OUT OF THAT WHIRLWIND AND GET SCARED.   THE MORE I LEARN SEEMS TO SUBSIDE THE FEAR. THANK YOU AGAIN,  CHERYL",
