The dosage does depend upon height and weight to a certain extent, but you seem to be on a very high dose. When I started the Xeloda, I had 12  bone mets and lymph node involvement over the heart. Until a few months ago, I was basically in remission. I was very fortunate to respond so well to Xeloda for so long. If any Doctor or RN indicate bad  side effects indicate the drug \"is working\" find a new Doctor. This is completely false info. Negative side effects have nothing to do with efficacy. Hopefully, your Dr. will work with you and perhaps lower the dose to a tolerable level. Memorial Sloane Kettering Doctors are recommending one week on, one week off for those who have bad side effects from Xeloda, and their research indicates that schedule is just as effective. Best of luck to you. When Xeloda works and is tolerable, it is a miracle drug, most especially since it does not lower the immune system like IV Chemo. Linda",
