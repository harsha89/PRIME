A complex cyst can show, density etc, many things can warrant a radiologist to make a decision to check a little deeper. The waiting stinks, try to keep busy.  HOPING FOR ONLY GOOD RESULTS FOR YOU!",

I was DX in May 06 (left breast) I have also had two excisional biopsies in my right breast and had 5 other lesions biopsied w/core or FNA all B9. My last biopsy was 9/11 on the right .   I have finally decided to go with the bilat (I am now 48) because of ADH and Low Grade DCIS - and because I am just simply over living in a world of constant testing and waiting every few months and although I am BRAC negative, according to my doctors very high risk for recurrance. It took me a good year to finally be comfortable and ok with this decision -  I am not having reconstruction as I had radation and not willing to chance possible complications. I have raised my children as well and am married to the most perfect and supportive man ever. Of coarse even this is not 100% as some tissue remains,  but I am happy with the better odds and am hoping my final pathology report after surgery will yielsd good news.  You don't have to rush your decision, think it through, as I said I am comfortable with my decision, but I also realize that I will for sure have a crying break down before surgery and proably the first time I see my new self,  but I will remind myself of why I made the decision and how TRULY GREAT THE REST OF MY LIFE WILL BE!!! I wish you well.",

I was DX in 06 in L breast,  fearful for my life, a total mess, I just completely listened to DR.'s (did not know about this site then). I had Lumpectomy and rads.  Iff I knew then what I know now I would have opted for Bilat w/reconstruction in 06.  I am now scheduled for a bilat on 10/17 because of R breast now (no recon - I do not want to take a risk of complications) . I am fine with this choice and wearing a prosthesis (still sad at times it had to be a decision I needed to make). The reports all say that Survival is the same with either choice - my reason for this choice is not so much based on Survival stats  -but recurrance stats -  You do have time to make an informed decision that will be best for you now and in the future. Such a hard choice you are faced with -I wish you the best.",

My venture started one month after getting married (me 46 Ed 52) we had already reached a great deal of maturity in our lives  - but the DX certinely did put an end to the honeymoon quite quickly. We were both knocked for a loop, I was certian I would die by Xmas,  he was \"strong and brave for me\" What else can one do -  but he was and is my rock as I face a bilat mastectomy in just a few weeks. Kevin as others have already said just \"be there\" emotionally, physically -mentally.  We are not an easy lot to understand \"woman in general\" that is -  i'll be the first to admit \"mood swings\" and when this BC happens to us -  WOW . Swing your mood with hers,  remember you can not fix this, do not beat yourself up thinking you can.   I wish you both love and peace with all.

But....................... now over the past several weeks my mind is starting to race again.  I guess I already know you all will say see the DR. now, but I am also so hoping someone will just say \"oh it is nothing\" don't worry go on with life. I was DX in 6/06 with ILC (46 years old) - left breast, lumpectomy and radiation -Tamoxifen for a few months off and on - side effects terrible so have been taking nothing for the last year. Stage one  -no nodes positive.  I felt the lump (or what I describe as a pencil point feeling thing just out of the blue one day) it never showed on mamo, US showed it,  biopsy to confirm. My last set of tests, Mamo, MRI & US was seven months ago,  all said to be fine.  But - heres the but!!!!!! I think, I am pretty sure I feel that same weird little pointy thing I felt 2 years ago, my left breast is swelling quite a bit some days, I have been experiencing \"burning\" in the breast and back area of left side,  and also pain and/or nagging  ache in the same shoulder and down to the elbow.  I do my best for the past couple weeks to explain away the feelings, oh I have been exercising more, I have been doing more work( on a computer all day) , maybe I am getting my period.  So as I said I know you all will suggest going to the DR ASAP,  but please tell me if it were to be a recurrence does the pain and burring indicate any thing  as far as spread??? Worried, scared and trying to stay blind to the whole possibility of another BC. Cancer may cause my death.

I can not begin to imagine how you have dealt with all you have gone through, I had the BRAC test done - negative for both.  I had considered a double mastectomy, but my original surgeon and radiologist and Onc all said not necessary, but it never sat well with me,  I have had over 8 biopsy's between both breast in the past 2 years and this past Jan when I had all my tests done and for once I was told 'NO CHANGES\" I just kinda  put the whole BC issue on the back burner, well at least 95% so.  I had switched to a new breast surgeon who is top dog here in Clearwater/Tampa,  does much research for Moffit Cancer Center, I really like him,  but I just put the whole mastectomy thing out of my head -because finally I didn't need a biopsy again, and just wanted to go back to normal again.

Even if I am not experiencing sharp jabbing pain, there is now always a ache and feeling of heavyness or something weird.  I have noticed when I wear my seatbelt, I must pull it off my collar, and if I apply pressure to elbow or shoulder the \"pain\" will shoot - if I even wear a loose strap over my shoulder it tends to aggrivate, and movement to intenseify it as well.  My left breast (outer quadrant feels full, burns and aches as well) my ILC was found in this area, and what I really believe to be a small lump is only a few inches away from my lumpectomy - it is diffrent than cyst feelings I have, it is new - noticed a few weeks ago, it feels the same as 2yrs ago -as I describe as what felt like a tip of a pencil point.

It takes several weeks of healing before you will want anything rubbing at your incisions anyway. If you were small chested to start (I was hardly a good B) the change for me when I was dressed was not all that dramatic, my daughter and a few friends actually told me I looked quite slim and athletic. You should be fitted for the bra's and prosthesis, I went to a specaility shop \"boutique\" but many department stores also offer the service. Before having my prosthesis, I did alot of layering, little cotton/silk T's and a sweater or blazer and I felt fine in public.  Good wishes  - Cathi",

I began thinking about the bilat a year ago , it took much reading, research and speaking with other woman to make the decision.  I opted out of recon based on what I learned of possible failure/complications with my rads to my left breast.  While I am just a month out of surgery I am doing what I am my BS say is \"GREAT' a few healing issues on L, I had a few teary moments,  but very short lived,  for the first time in 2 years I feel as though I HAVE FINALLY WON THIS BATTLE-  nothing is 100% but I am darn close.  This is not an easy choice -do not just JUMP into it -  it is a decison you can not reverse once it is done.  For me it was completely the RIGHT choice on all accounts.

I really can't explain my state of mind -except to say weird.

Even with my lumpectomy I had basically no indentation (very small boobs -hardly noticed it) just in the last week it is like a crevous is creeping across my breast.  I even called Surgeon/Onco today to see about an earlier appointment than 8/5 - but nothing available. So it is just wait it out I guess.  The strange thing is,  sure I have been a bit panic stricken, and cried already, buttttttt, it is like I am so prepared, I know what they are gonna say - It's back, of coarse hoping for the best and it is just local, but God I just know!!!!!!!!!  I know the lump I am feeling is so like my first one that was BC and so way diffrent from all the other 6 cystic ones that were asperated/sent for biopsy.and B9  They tell us to know our bodies to know our breasts, I know I do,  I know every darn inch -every darn lump,  It is like I am just wanting to get this whole thing started so I can get on with things again -does that make sence? My first go around and DX, I thought for sure it was the end,  while I know if my feelings are right, this will be diffrent and I know harder, I also know there will be real crappy days but I know I can do it, and just want to get it all going. Maybe I am going nuts????  My hubby and just a very close frien know what is happening, and as much as I love them both -I got so mad at them as we were talking and I was explaing my feelings and thoughts, they both said \"oh you have to stay positive\" well dam I am not being \"not positive\" I am just being realistic and prepared,  do they really think I am sitting there saying \"oh boy I hope my BC has returned?\" \"Yippie I can't wait!!!!\"  Anyway I told them that that \"positive attitude\" statement really pisses me off -I don't think they will bring it up again.

And I guess I understand that. Oh well I still love him bunches, and I know he will be with me every step of the way -  XOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXO -TO ALL!!!!",

So sorry you have these worries espically at this time in your life.  I know from experience there is not much anyone can say or do thats going to keep you from worrying, the internet is a wonderful resource for knowledge, but sometimes it can be a double edged sword - we can pre-diagnois ourselfs to death if we search long enough.  Is your OB the one who has arranged for the ultra sound? Does he/she not think the symptoms you have are pregency related? I am hoping for you they are and this scare will soon be over. A cyst can cause pain, swelling all of what you have mentioned and the fact that you are pregnant may very well have triggered a cystic problem,  if that were the case the Dr. may want to  asperate to relieve your discomfort and your nightmare will be very well over..  If you can (and I know how hard it is) come here and chat or ramble on as much as you want with all of us, but try not to surf the net to much in an attempt to DX yourself riight now, you will just continue to make your self worry more, not good for you, your little one at home and the one on the way.

They are both at 3:00, one more medial the other more lateral.  For the past 1.5yrs I have always had something show up on MRI or US in 3:00, 2 previous B9 results there,  I was assured by radiologist and surgeon these are very new and very concerning lesions, what I considered to be the good boob is turning out to be a bigger pain then the one with the CA DX in 06.  I just keep wondering if something is there that they haven't found yet - I have read some stories on here where malignant areas were hiding beneath cystic areas, I just don't know if I am doing the right things,  the doctors always give you survival % - they hardly ever talk about recurrance % -  I think this may be a bad thing to say because I have so though about the double mastectomy over the past 2 years, I almost some how wish I would not get B9 results, then it seems like my decision would be made for me. I am sorry for saying that I know it is awful,  But I can't help but wonder what good surviving is if all you do is worry every 6 months.",

I come to the boards because I do get wonderful advise and inspiration,  please forgive me though today when I say I think being \"at piece with all of this\" is a bunch of crap!!!!!  Oh I believe in GOD and I pray and I know his plan is far bigger and better than mine or any doctors -  BUT -  I am still PO'ed some days,  I wallow in my own sorrow I through huge pity parties - I have 2 daughters (26&28) 4 beautiful grandchildren and the man of my dreams finally (who by the way I maried a month before DX - great honeymoon)  and I can't stand the thought of maybe not being able to become a really old lady with them.  I know I can't go back -but I so wish I could, May of 06 was so wonderful  -then.............. Anyway so sorry for all this down talk,  I KNOW I SHOULD BE POSITIVE -  Well I guess I am \"I AM POSITIVE I AM REALLY MAD TODAY!\" Thanks to all -",

I really can't explain my state of mind -except to say weird. I know  for sure I definetly have a small bead sized hard single lump in my upper outer left breast, a swollen node, and now I am pretty sure I know what thickening means, and also my breast seems to be like splitting in half,  I guess thats the \"dimpling\" I have read of. Even with my lumpectomy I had basically no indentation (very small boobs -hardly noticed it) just in the last week it is like a crevous is creeping across my breast.  I even called Surgeon/Onco today to see about an earlier appointment than 8/5 - but nothing available. So it is just wait it out I guess.  The strange thing is,  sure I have been a bit panic stricken, and cried already, buttttttt, it is like I am so prepared, I know what they are gonna say - It's back, of coarse hoping for the best and it is just local, but God I just know!!!!!!!!!  I know the lump I am feeling is so like my first one that was BC and so way diffrent from all the other 6 cystic ones that were asperated/sent for biopsy.and B9  They tell us to know our bodies to know our breasts, I know I do,  I know every darn inch -every darn lump,  It is like I am just wanting to get this whole thing started so I can get on with things again -does that make sence? My first go around and DX, I thought for sure it was the end,  while I know if my feelings are right, this will be diffrent and I know harder, I also know there will be real crappy days but I know I can do it, and just want to get it all going. Maybe I am going nuts????  My hubby and just a very close frien know what is happening, and as much as I love them both -I got so mad at them as we were talking and I was explaing my feelings and thoughts, they both said \"oh you have to stay positive\" well dam I am not being \"not positive\" I am just being realistic and prepared,  do they really think I am sitting there saying \"oh boy I hope my BC has returned?\" \"Yippie I can't wait!!!!\"  Anyway I told them that that \"positive attitude\" statement really pisses me off -I don't think they will bring it up again.

My Onco/breast surgeon are one in the same, of coarse his first question -why are we here today, all of your tests in Feb were unchanged, so I explained the arm/shoulder pain, I explained the diffrence in the way my cloths are fitting, what I believe to be dimpling in the breast ETC and went on to show him the lump I and hubby feel. He felt around said  -hum it is very small- clinaclly he could not and would not do a biopsy at this point because knowing now or watching and waitiing would not change the outcome????? And the part that really PO'ed me \" woman who have been DX' with BC tend to have a phobia about it coming back!\"  He said that BC evolves slowly and because I had only felt the lump 4 weeks ago it was not long enough to worry about - well I felt my first lump 2 years ago just mysteriously one day -  I waited yes  several months to go and have it checked -but if I had gone at 4 weeks  -it still would have been BC - just like it was months later. My first mass was only 1CM!!!!   I became very agitated and ANGRY, asked him to explain what  was going on then, he could not,  he asked my husband then to stand up and point out the lump -he instantly did, DR rolled his eyes and said well then what do you want to do???? My hubby describes the lump as a \"bee-bee\" it is just like my first DX felt,, it does not have the same feel/texture as my many B9 cysts,  and I want it to be nothing, and I pray everyday it is, BUT because at this point it is small - he refuses to even check?????? IDON'T UNDERSTAND. We are told to examine -examine -examine, report anything diffrent/strange/unusual, and when we do -  we are told we have a \"PHOBIA!!!!!\"  We are told to report things ASAP- then when we do -  we are told, it makes no diffrence now or later???!!!!!!

The best part and most uplifting part of the whole 3hour AM was that my mammo tech was actually a BC Survivor - 3 times - 3 diffrent BC DX, finally she had bilat -first diagnosed at 34 now 55 - her mom died at 51 w/BC  she and her daughte carry the BRAC1&2 -  It almost felt like I was being sent a message - SEE IT SUCKS  -BUT IT IS POSSIBLE.

Anyway wasn't that bad as you all explained  - THANK YOU.  They did 2 lesions, the first @ 3:00 right close to the nipple, radiologist got a small tissue sample there, then he actually asperated the thing and it totally disappeared - I know thats a good sign. The second one has me a bit worried,  until today I did not realize it was actually on my chest wall @ 3:00, he got a very good tissue sample from that one, no asperation though.  So now it is just wait until 9/16 for results. I am kinda weirded out by how far over the second area is - like almost totally off the boob???? Thank you all for your helping to explain this newest biopsy procedure to me - it helped so much to know some of what I was in for -   My hubby thinks he should build something like that -  I wonder for what - HA! Have any of you had lesions so far off the boob on the chest wall, what were your results???? THANKS",

Just plan on taking it easy for a few weeks,  NO LIFTING,  its not a cake walk but if you follow DR's orders and don't push yourself and over due it you will bounce back and be up and about before you realize.  Wishing you a speedy and uneventful surgery and recovery...

Honestly - I am not quite sure HOW I came to mental grips with all of this,  except to say that I HAD HAD ENOUGH, in 2 years I had had 4 big surgeries, many-many biopsies, tests, treatments, etc,etc.  It took me a year to finally decide on the bilat W/No recon, last yer when I started leaning towards mastectomy, I was actually very seriously considering recon. But much study and talk helped me to come to the choice of no recon, and with the healing issues I have had on the rads side, I most certienly made the right choice. Was I worried and scared about my \"new look\", would my husband (of only 2 yrs ) still love and want me, oh I was worried for awhile.  But his endless support and my endless need to be healthy, out weighed having BOOBS. I have always been quite a judgemental person of myself -to fat, to skinny, hair is bad -what ever. Well now, as often as I can I just look in the mirror - and see something nice about me! As far as the cloths thing - IT is trial and error -  I wear my prosthesis, and sometimes I don't.  I have found I have had to make a few adjustments, but not many. I agree with the dartless/seamless tops as much as possible - easy to wear those tops with and without foobs. I am not kidding myself in thinking that everyday  will be a perfect day,  I have looked and missed -but only for a second - because the reality of being alive and happy is bigger. Femme as with anything  - try your best not to concentrate on what you \"DON'T\" have concentrate on what you do -  my  motto so to speak is - if the boobs are no more -then work on the ASSATUDE Good wishes to you all.

But I am not going to bore you with that, I have been reading this thread and I so   hope some how some way you are able to find some sort of peace with this whole BC DX.  The thing about coming to the site that is most helpful for me  other than the knowledge that I acheive from everyone is the freedom to be able to feel my feelings and know that who I am sharing them with truly understand - there is always someone here who has felt the same way -  If I come on mad, sad, angry and yes even happy  - It is ok.  No matter how wonderful a spouse or how great our family and friends are -  they just don't get the whole picture. This site and all of its members are truly sent from above. Now - for 2 years I have been trying to fiqure out the reason behind this whole stupid DX - why after finally getting out of a 20+ year rotten marriage, after meeting prince charming (for real), being only 46 at the time why would God dump this crap on me -  and just one month after being married.  I had truly never been happier in my life -  but there it was the big C - and like you many times I just wanted to give up and die -   I had a 2 year old granddaughter at DX - I seriously choose who I wanted to be her replacement ME-MA and instructed her on all the things I wanted her to do and teach her. (I was bonkers for awhile). Well I have come to realize that God isn't ready for me yet  -  I think I might be to \"out there\" for heaven yet (I can still sport a good mini skirt- LOL).  Someday he might be -sooner than I think it should be,  but before that happens I am going to do my best to enjoy what it is I have today and tomorrow.  Oh I still have my days when I hate this SH_T, I cry, rant and get sad,  but I move as best as I can past it. I have also decided that the reason for this all is - my daughters (26&28) while in that 20+ yr rotten marriage I did not give them all I could, I did not teach them all I should,  with this DX and all the crap that comes with it, I hope to teach them strength, self respect inside and out (we are beautiful with or without boobs) and they can perservere no matter what junk is put on their plate. Sue I am sorry for rambling - I just truly feel your pain and hope that some how we all can help you be just a bit at peace. MUCH LOVE AND SUPPORT-  CATHI XOXOXOXOXO",

He is down a salesman at the lot, for about the past 3/months now, the guy left to find a job that \"paid\" not just comission,  Ed has not looked to replace him, says sales are slow because of the economy and the1 others he has and the lot person can get things done. Well thats not happening, Mr Ed is getting \"everything\" done,  he is there from 9AM to ??????? many many days, just called to say still there - he was sorry and he would see me later, he felt bad and he knew I was upset, I could tell by the way he was talking to me,  I have told him he is working to hard and that it PO's me that the 1 salesman he has take advantage of him,  always in late for one reason or another,  3 hour lunches,  leave early,  doesn't do paper work correctly, etc, etc. He used to be home at least half days on Tuesday and Thursday, went in every other Saturday to do end of week stuff, and hardly never did he go on Sunday even though the lot is open. Well all thats changed,  and I don't like it, guess I am being some whinny little teenager, I should be greatful I guess, but the truth of the matter is I miss him,  I could go in anytime to see him, but have always thought his work is his work and he doesn't need some sappy wife hanging around. I am frustrated.",

She and I have had a bit of a \"strained\" relationship *much better now) when her dad and I divorced,  although she was already living on her own, I was the \"bad\" one who walked out on the family,  I didn't just the nasty mean SOB -  but Amanda listened to all his  negative talk for a few years and she and I had some up's and downs.  Her dad lives close to her in NY, she has come to see some off his \"ways\"  and we are doing much better.  So life goes on. Excited to see them, hope she doesn't change her mind again, as she has a few times.",

He passed away at about 5/mo after DX,  and Ed's bro and friends have said Ed was not good for a while, always would say he could never ever watch anyone he loved so dearly suffer such a horrible death again in his life.  So I understand his averting the subject.

Ella had a DR Visit yesturday,  she still sports a bit of a rash on her face and from time to time runs a bit of a low grade temp,  but DR's say not to worry -  Of coarse I NEVER DO THAT -LOL I had my PET on Wednesday - of coarse no results yet,  I asked the tech if he saw anything - a fine looking young man (for once) he said he of coarse was not the DR so could not give me any answers,  but he did ad that if he saw anything TERRIBLE WRONG he would tell me -  he told me nothing. So we'll wait and see. I read all the posts from my visit,  please forgive me if I forget to mention anyone - I LOVE YOU ALL. Shelia hoping your DH is 100% and that your hot flashes stay away,  mine had really been quite well for awhile,  but they have gone all crazy again, I am thinking that one of the meds I am taking is causing it,  like you Jane I layer,  in bed is crazy,  we have all the bedroom windows open,  plus the ceiling fan and I have a small rotating fan on my side,  and I still sweat,  throw all the covers on Ed and then when it passes I am freezing because of sweating and try getting mine plus his back to cover with. Doesn't make for a good nights sleep for either. Judie gosh I hope you are feeling much better as well.  XOXOXOXOXOXOXOXO So happy you are going to see Conner Nettie congrats on Amy, a precious new little one.  Babies are so wonderful. Lisa my friend never think you have a purpose in the world,  family and personal relationships aside look at the lifes you have touched and helped just here on BC.org,  I for one and so very happy to have you here in the world and for you to be a dear dear friend.  HUGS my friend.  Remember - If you love something set it free - if it comes back to you it's yours.

Thursday is our 4 year wedding anniversary - so happy for that yet  for me always a touch of sadness it was amonth later that my BC Journey began and a top of all that I have received some very very sd news from a very dear friend. You have heard me talk about Jo-ann well we have a wonderful  mutual friend named Blaire - some of you FB'ers may see her on my page from time to time - (although this subject is not talked about on there) ,  it was her DD's wedding we went to in January, anyway she called me last Thursday - I knew by her voice something was wrong,  but I never expected in a million years hearing the words \"I HAVE THROAT CANCER\" I am at a loss, we have cried together,  we have talked but truthfully I am a mess over this.  It is in her R tonsil and her palate that they know now, she is having surgery next Wednesday to remove the tonsil,  tissue from the palate and some lymph nodes. She will be in the hospital at least 3 days,  she will come home with a feeding tube as she will not be able to eat for awhile,  her DR told her yesturday she needs to gain weight between now and surgery (she is 148) I guess the norm after this is to loose quite a bit of weight. No matter what she will be having 6 weeks of rads and chemo,  the chemo cocktail will depend on the surgery results. To try and give you a small idea of how close we are,  sense my bone journey has begun on bad days I have often thought who would I nominate to be SURROGATE MOM to Amanda nad Jaclyn,  (someone they could talk to - what ever us mom's do) it would have been Blaire. She has 2  DD's right around the same age ,  I AM SO SAD - SO SCARED, she is so much more than just a FRIEND.  We were destin to meet  - we had so many things in common before and dam it now we both share a Cancer DX, I don't know what to do,  or say sometimes,  I thought it would come easy or natural after all my shit - but it does not when it is someone so very very close in my heart -  she knows all my details so of coarse what help,  assistance I have offerd she has refused ,  says you just stay home and take care of yourself. Anyway  I am kinda beside myself these days,  once again finding myself question God's big plan -  lots of whys and how comes. XOXOXOXOXOXO",

Leesa ,  WOW as always you have a plate full,  I know the feeling only too well.  DD & SIL go to court on Tuesday for the criminal charges (posession and him battery) Amanda has spoke with her appointed attprney who along with the states attorney have offered to move her charge from criminal to drug court,  this would be a 12/mo-24mo program,  strict ffollowing and much more intense DRUG CLASSES ,  however if she completes this she would have a completely CLEAN RECORD as far as FELONY DRUG POSESSION goes,  SIL don't know if he will get same offer as you must be a first time offender  non violent (honestly I could care less what they do to him) he just continues to make my skin crawl. Jaclyn and I had to have a long talk,  she gets upset that Ed and I still show or feel concern for Amanda,  I guess somehow she thinks we should be DONE WITH HER ,  I know Jaclyn is just concerned and worried for us,  but had to explain that n matter what a mother does not stop caring,  loving,  and praying that their child will be OK, On 10/4 we all go back to DCF court for a review,  the case worker is not very happy at all,  they have not paid on penny either by court order or just our of being parents to the children,  they are not keeping a lot of their visits with Ella and Landen,  she is kinda pissed and said that she hopes they don't think they can just go through the motions - with these classes and then get the kids back - THAT WON'T HAPPEN.   Having Ella in daycare has been such a huge help,  mot feeling quite so tired.  But I did have an Onco visit and he is pissed at me  - really read me the riot act - and I guess I deserved it,  have stopped taking my pain meds and taking mega doses of Tylenol again to avoid being loopy and groggy,  he point blank told me  -  well then CANCER is not going to kill you if you keep this up - your kidneys are going to fail -  I guess my blood work was pretty bad.   Gonna go back this week,  he's trying me on lower dose and see how it works for a week.

And poor Ella her little sneakers  worn through in the toes, I told them when they went home she would need a new paur soon for school (thats all they can wear) pretty obvious she hasn't  gotten any news ones yet.  SIL didn't say anything except a few mumbles to Amanda when they came in , something about what they were going to make for dinner and neither Ed or I had anything to say to him.  My hubby is the kindest most forgiving understanding person in the world,   but he has reached his end with both of them. Well we are going to have an almost 90 degree weekend,  we are planning on some beach time. YEAH. Next weekend is the city wide garage sale - yeah he's getting rid of some stuff. Alexcis is going to make and sell cupcakes, she has STUFF she wants to buy. HAPPY WEEKEND - LOVE YOU ALL. Hey Shelia how is your sinus infection you mentioned on FB. XOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXO",

Barbe you are exactly right about taking the focus off the kids, it is VERY HARD but thats what we have to do.  Spent several hours with case worker today (Amanda was here too)  at this point DD & SIL still have SUPERVISED CUSTODY by DCF,  on Tuesday we are all meeting with Bill @ 6PM, While the caseworker can't SUGGEST we help to sink his battle ship, she is well aware of his past behavior when we had them full time last year, so as hard as it is to allow this with smiles on our face we agreed on a VISITATION schedule,  Monday nght through Friday night the children will have to sleep here Amanda works overnights,  Bill can not have the children ovenight until he has his own place and a state homestudy is done (YIPPIE FOR THAT) ,  So on Monday, Wed & Friday he is to be here at our house by 6PM (he will HATE coming here, ) and he can see the children from 6-7:30PM  alone at the beach, the park any public place.  On Saturdays he must pick the children up here by 8AM (get his lazy drunk ass out of bed) and return them by 1PM (this allows Amanda to sleep a few hours) she will have them the rest of the weekend until school on Monday,  on Tuesday & Thursday she will have them from school @ 4PM -7PM. Bill told the ccasw worker on the phone today HE IS MORE THAN HAPPY  to pay for school ($128/mo  - which he has told school on several ocassions isn't HIS responsibility) he said he would provide diapers every Monday + groceries. RIGHT -  We know and the case worker knows this won't happen or last but a week,  and thats what she needs to do her job legally.  Amanda will be able to file for sole custody and support also - that is if she keeps her nose clean. Like I said not making any bets right now that she will do right this time.  But they are both treading on very thin water right now. Anyway gonna try and get some sleep.  Thank you all.  Lessa  love yeah!!!!!  Nettie & Barbe you guys ROCK  - XOXXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXO And Nettie I promise as soon as all the LEGAL STUFF is taken care of you can tounge lash Bill (or both if need be) Looking forward to that day.",

I'll see my FAMILY on FB- XOXOXOXOXOXOXO",

As most of you know I have been having some issues with the whole flat bathing suit look (still don't have one), but I did  get a cute  pair of shorts, tank top and light matching jacket.  So we all went to the beach, I was covered with the jacket, but after 2 glasses of wine, dancing some and sitting around the fire - I was warm, and feeling pretty good, so I took off the jacket,  within minutes she said \"WoW my chest is bigger than yours now\" without even a minute passing, I just out of the blue said \"so's your A$$\",  we were all sitting there, everyone pretty much heard the comments, I know Ed was starting to comment to her, I just gave him the eye roll thing \" don't say anything\" (and he didn't) his brother got up and told Carol they were going for a walk, they did for about 15 minutes,  came back and they decided they were going home.  Anyway nothing more was said the rest of the night by anyone, I didn't even cry -  WINE IS GOOD- LOL Sunday my cell rang it was her, I didn't answer,  she left a \"I am sorry message\" and I have not called her back.  So my question is should I and acknowledge her apology -  I am kinda sorry for saying what I did, but then again not - she was STUPID first,  she doesn't know my feelings  not someone I would share them with,  I am sure Ed has talked to his brother.  Like I said I love his brother to death,  and I don't want him to think he can't come around with \"trail park\" girl friend.  And her A$$ is WAY BIGGER THAN MINE BY FAR!!!!",

Nettie glad to here from you again, yes Margo steals the show every chance she gets, I'll post a picture for you from this weekend.  My granddaughter Alexcis was over we just had a blast,  we took 2 great bike rides, Saturday we spent most of the day at the beach, it was the first time I went in the water with the new suit, I was so nervous about getting wet and having the suit shift around, but all was perfect it stayed in place -YEAH , it actually clings tighter when wet. The water temp is now 84 degrees  - just perfect for us natives,  we hate cold water.  Alexcis is so proud of herself now because she rides with out the training wheels so it was our first ROAD TRIP.  She road a long way,  we of coarse had to stop for ice cream though. Linda I don't know how to describe what I felt about the Farrah story (I didn't know about Ryan either or that her sister died from CA).  I wish as she said that her story WOULD MAKE A DIFFRENCE in CA research and treatments, but it won't.  I am not sure if admire is a good word, but for her to open up and share her journey with the world is something, I cried  a lot , and when she showed her bald head, all that hair she used to have WOW!!!!  The thing I felt so sad about for her was the stupid reporters, all well and good if your in the lime light and healthy - but for gosh sake the woman is dieing, LEAVE HER ALONE!!!  Anyway I though it was very moving and like I said never a real big fan, but I applaud her and appreciate & commend  her sharing such a terrible time in her life. And I hope and pray she finds peace. Wishing everyone a WONDERFUL EVENING!!! XOXOXOXOX -Cathi",

My very first Oncologist was that exact way, he would never listen to any concerns or answer any questions with out refering back to his 25 years of practice and \"case studies have shown\"  I hated just being a statistic to him,  all the statistics in the world based on what is known about my family history says I should never have been DX with invasive BC in the first place.  Jaclyn's DR is the same way I guess,  and to a certian degree she might be right,  yes I am very close to the the matter - this is my DD,  as I am sure your mom's heart was breaking inside and she wished she could FIX it for you, so do I ,  but I do my very - very best to stay objective, and listen and support ( and give my opinion   - when asked).",

Yes Linda I really am on a very narrow island,  one of our draw bridges to get over to this side from the mainland was just taken down it was a small little narrow thing, and they have just finished a new one (no draw) so it is much higher,  the view now coming across is breath taking, because you can really see how narrow of an island it is. Indian Rocks Beach is one of the very few remaing mostly residentila beach communities,  the beaches north and south of us (espically Clearwater) are all condos and so commercial for the tourists.  Indian Rocks beach has some very grand and elegant new lavish homes, but lots of old time beach cottages that are so full of character.  I truly love it here so much.",

They normally wanna hold off on stuff as long as possible I guess,  but apparently I could have repeat rads in the future if I am just given a low dose and it helps - something like that on Monday I'll sit up take notice and make good choices. I have read so much here on BC.org the past months about bone mets and it seems that if the pain is gotten under control and the nasty rotten BC stays where it is,  I can do very well for VERY LONG.  I PRAY.

Thus far today her fever has stayed at 100.2 but except for the few ounces of pedialite in hospital she has only drank 6ounces of formula in 2.5 days - she see's DR again in the AM,  she does a half hearted little smile and grin,  but you can tell she does not feel well,  UGH - Hopefully she will just bounce back and its just a little scare tactic.

Social Services will give me an immediate referal for daycare where Landen is they offered when this all began 4 weeks ago but I said no -  just seems like she is so small.  and other than daycare there really is no other assistance I can think of,  there are no other family/friends,  and the kids can't go anywhere to be cared for (other than daycare) without a background check, we could hire a nanny in,  but I don't see that as much help - I WOULD BE LURKING- LOL and that would completely be at our expense -  HONEST OPINIONS, even if you think daycare is not good at such a young age - xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxo",

I am not sure if Amanda went to work Friday night leaving SIL with kids, I think not by the way she spoke -",

So I have had a make over this week,  well not really, went Monday AM for mani ^ pedi,  it has been months,  and yesturday a young lady Jaclyn  is friends with came here and did my hair, color, highlights and a major cut, I was looking pretty nasty.  I was kinda nervous at first but I have seen her work on other people,  she is between salons right now.  I LOVE IT,  Ed didn't know I was getting it down, surprised him too,  I think he was hoping it was the weekend - LOL",

Maybe thats my anxiety,  that behavior is not acceptable by me & PA-PA  thinking that maybe if we speak to it if it happens here  SIL will take issue -  now that he's in CONTROL again.  Oh well we shall see.  Amanda's B'day is actually tomorrow, a few weeks ago sge said I don't know if anyone is getting me anything for my B'day - they don't have to, but if they do, please get gift cards to the grocery store.  I wasn't even comfortable with the gift card thing this year,  I know how they buy groceries, Steak, Sushi, expensive stuff they can't afford. So we went shopping and bought  stuff,  pasta, sauces, soups, PBJ,tuna, eggs etc, etc,  We have even wrapped it.  When she is at an appointment tomorrow going to take it to her apartment and with a B'day balloon and cake I made decorate her table with it. I don't think I have ever bought anyone food for a gift before.  Ed even bought a can of SPAM,  in every poor mans cupboard he said- LOL  HAPPY SUNDAY ALL - XOXOXOXOXOXOX",

Now we are being even more careful,  the auction has  not completely cut off $$$$ for the dealers, but they have downsized the amount which cuts back the # of cars that can be purchased,  which in turn cuts profit,  Shelia that was a wonderful gift.

XOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOX I am sitting here trying not to type the weekend events,, you all must just be getting so sick of my SOAP-OPERA life. But you all and some close friends here  (and Ed) are all I have to relieve my sadness, frustration and worry.  But if or when you all wanna say enough is enough I completely understand after all this is a BC site. Saturday night I got on FB about 8PM Ed was watching something with Nascar,  I saw pictures on Amanda's wall of her & Bill in their car and on the beach,  to myself & Then to Ed I said they look drunk and or high in those pictures, and in the car one you could see behind Bill (who was driving NO CAR SEAT NO LANDEN OR ELLA) But all it was was my GUESSING at something. Sunday AM I see posted on his page the same pictures and comments about having a great time out at Cusos Beach bar all night until his wife and another girl started playing SHOW me your boobies (hey is wall isn't private you all can check it out WILLIAM MELLOTT) ,  so then I am starting to think,  out at a bar,  drinking , where the heck where the kids -  other than us an Jaclyn they are to be left with NO ONE without a background check. After a couple hours Amanda called ,  she says I don't think Ella feels well,  I do not say anything about anything I have seen or read on FB,  she continues to say yeah she didn't sleep well last night the neighbor girl (who is 16) watched them while we went to the beach (never mentioned the bar -she doesn't know I can see SIL page),  I let her talk a little more then just said  - HEY did you say you left the kids with a neighbor, has she been background checked?  NO MOM- we have a right to go out,  and I am not gonna have people background checked, it's not like anyone is gonna show up and check us out on the weekend anyway -  I said ok if your willing to take that risk, so be it. So for the last 2 weeknds dad has been drunk and mom this past Saturday,  and now they are leaving the kids with God only knows who. They both posted tons of pics Sunday - showing what a HAPPY FAMILY they are. I have left a call for the new case worker ,  no call back yet. This AM Jaclyn goes up to Landen & Ella's school,  Brandt starts there next Monday as it's closer to her house.  And she gets an ear full.  Landen is acting out,  hitting  A LOT,  they are both exhausted all the time. Ellas teacher said she is not HAPPY at all anymore and she was sent to school again this AM with the sneaker with hardly a sole left on them,  the right one actually flaps up an down at the toe.  The brought lunch boxes out to show Jaclyn that lunches/snacks are getting smaller & Landen is coming to school quite dirty most of the time - they are going to mention these things to dad today when he picks them up and if they do not improve within a week, or worse happens they are REQUIRED & WILL CALL case worker & DCF. Ed says we are headed for a TRAIN WRECK.  We sure are.",

Having had the bilat I no longer have to do the mammo/US thing,  I am very, very, very happy I made that choice, but I will be honest and say for a few brief seconds a few times, I have thought to myself,  now that I am not having these tets 'what if\" there is that stray cell they missed that could be floating around inside me that \"might have been\" caught early with the regular screening tests.  Then I slap myself silly and stop the \"what if's\" A sad reality I have come to except that I will never live with out the fear (even if minamil) the rest of my life.

I don't want to sound rude/crude,  but after 20+ years married to Mr. %$#$#@# and this whole BC thing,  if Ed were ever to change , if he were to get boring, rude ,  lazy, uncaring , self centered etc -  it would be TA-TA.  Time to move on.  I don't have time to waste.  Lisa I hope and pray everything works out the best for YOU!!!!!!

Until you girls started speaking about hands I didn't realizw how well I can recall my moms,  she had strong slender hands and Oh her nails, her pride and joy, she grew them so perfect and long, she was a Union Leader in NY for the Seamstresses so she would break one ocassionally and have to start over,  but I remember holding her hands as the liver CA became worse and how I could feel the strength slipping away, she hated her finger tips though, being a bad diabetic, they were so sore and red from all the finger pricks for testing daily. ",

So like you right now, I had both parents in  diffrent hospitals, the hospitals were about 10 minutes from each other but about 45 minutes from my home, I went back and forth everyday for over 2 weeks. My parents had to give up there home after that, they lived in a 2 story with bedrooms upstairs and only a half bath downstairs,  my dad never got a prosthesis for his leg, he was just to weak to support himself on one.  Sometimes we do get alot dumped on us, but I don't regret one minute of assisting/helping/loving my parents . I sure do miss them.",

LOL Pink plates, napkins, flowers, cutlery,  and I think I got every PINK AWARENESS item on the market, keychains, lotion,  plastic storage containers, etc, etc, etc.  I am laughing now thinking about it - and I forsure graciously excepted and said my thank you's.  As my honey reminded me, people don't know what to do or say (and I actually have some very close friends there) they just want to find a way somehow to show there love and support.  Sooo as they opened up the can of worms I did do a bit of a speech/lecture to everyone about having their mamo's, and doing BSE, because I know for a fact that there are a few ladies who are in the \"I don't wanna know \" \"what ever happens happens\" club -  IDIOTS! LOL So AE - Lakeland,  Lakeland is in POLK County just slightly East of Tampa (I have been out that way a few times) It is very rural - not big city -the trafic is pretty good. Close enough to Tampa to find better shopping, eating etc.  If you are looking for a more \"countryish\" area Lakeland would be a good place for that. It is not nearly as populated as Tampa, Orlando, the beaches, you can still drive and see open fields, livestock etc. You are a considerable distance from either coast (water however). Here in FLA,  distance is not so much judged by the miles as it is the time it takes you to get there. For instance my office is about 20 miles from my house -however in rush hour that is a good 1.5HR drive. When you ask some one here how far away they are they hardly ever say 10 miles  -they say oh about 30 minutes. Weird.  Do you have family in Lakeland,  if at some time, you wanted me to send you some newspapers, realestate mags, just let me know, i'll dig up what you need. Hope everyone is having a groovy night! XOXOXOXOXOXO",

If you are looking for a place in  more North Fla, try googling info on Spring Hill,  Dunedin,  New Port Richey,  those are also nice places, on the rural side. I love Fla,  I would never move back North, it is hot as heck in June-Sept, but  I hated snow and cold for months on end. Melody I think your right PINK is all together the wrong color, and I do thank my friends for their gifts and try as much as I can to overlook the STUPID remarks or questions -  they just don't know. I had lunch today with a very close family friend and she nicely informed me that she and her husband will be over to see me at the hospital the night of my surgery - I kindly said \"oh you don't have to do that\" (I was thinking are you nuts) - but she said oh you know we will be worried sick until we see you for ourselves.  I just dropped it,  her husband and mine have been friends since they were 4 -  we spend lots of time together and they really are special and wonderful,  my honey will handle it and be sure that doesn't happen.  Strannge how anyone might think I will want to visit after a major surgery,  I am not going to be showing my boobless chest to anyone -  I need my time to take the changes all in - UGH!!!! Just keep saying people mean well. Hope everyone has a great weekend. ",

SAM HILL - \"If someone could locate any historical record of a Col. Samuel Hill of Guilford, Connecticut, we might find the origin of the phrase 'go like Sam Hill' or 'run like Sam Hill.' Edwin V. Mitchell makes mention of the man in the 'Encyclopedia of American Politics (1946). It seems that Colonel Hill perpetually ran for office - but no other evidence of his existence can be found. Since no one knows 'who in the Sam Hill' he was, Sam Hill must remain 'a personified euphemism our puritan ancestors used for 'hell.'\" From \"Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins\" by Robert Hendrickson (Facts on File, New York, 1997) : A second reference states: \"Sam Hill is one of many euphemisms for 'hell' like 'blazes,' 'Halifax,' 'heck,' 'Hoboken' and many more. This one was very popular with frontiersmen, especially when they needed to clean up their language in the presence of ladies. Will James records the comment of a cowboy who felt he had been insulted by an Eastern dude: 'What the Sam Hill do you think we are out here, servants?' The first record appearance in print of 'Sam Hill' was in 1839. Elmer Roessner, an editor friend, reported that turn-of-the-century Seattle newspapers made regular use of this expression. Jim Hill, the legendary 'empire builder,' whose railroads, including the Great Northern, remained his last monument, was a man given to notable rages when anyone dared to oppose one of his grandiose schemes. So frequent were these tirades, according to Roessner, that the papers carried as a standing head: 'Jim Hill is as mad as Sam Hill.'\" From \"Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins\" by William and Mary Morris (HarperCollins, New York, 1977, 1988). In the rural US decades past \"Sam Hill\" would have been, as someone posted above \"...one of many euphemisms for 'hell'...\" and was to clean up the language. \"Nice\" boys and and almost all girls would have been admonished to not even use \"Sam Hill\".",

As it looks now Bill maybe going to jail on 7/25 his next court appearance, judge was not happy with him last month because of his facebook bragging about drinking and apparently he had a DIRTY URINE test on 7/8 she had the results from the probation officer and said WE'LL GIVE MOM A SECOND CHANCE BUT LOOKS LIKE DAD IS DONE\" All that is well and good, except that CPS feels that Amanda is homeless so to speak so Bill has the children everyweek night (we get to pick them up on Tuesday & Thursday from school) and take them home @ 7:30PM, Sunday we pick them up at 10AM and they spend the night. I have had little to no sleep worrying about them in his bachelor pad -  hoping he gets thrown in the slammer on 7/25.  I told the judge I was NOT going to put up with any crap from Amanda and I really didn't want her in my home, she completely agreed (kinda cool that was) judge said to her if I receive one complaint from your mother YOU WILL GO TO JAIL, Unfortunetly at this point in time even though she has BEHAVED for a week,  I am still not holding out much hope,  as always we are still in limbo -  if SIL goes to jail then he won't have children any longer and if he gets out we will be able to request only supervised visits in Family Court.  Oh our legal system.",

It is really not in their best intrest to have them excited about something just to wisk them away at a moments notice. If you plan on sending messages on FB at 10:30at night please follow up with a phone call, and Amanda I was on the phone with you at 6:30PM on Saturday when you called about your dress you made NO mention of plans for the day.

Ed wasn't home at the time so told her I would get back to here,  then I e-mailed the child advocate place we are talking with,  they suggested that schedule was NOT WISE,  that left us with a HUGE PORTION of responsibility and no legal recourse,  suggest perhaps mom & dad looking for an easy out ,  and it sure does.  So we decided that we will pick them up from daycare tomorrow take them home by 7:30PM,  next week we will start doing that every Wednesday.  Every other week will will have an over night on Sunday and everyother week on Saturday will have them from 10AM-6PM. For now it is a good plan I think, get to see them ,  my heart was breaking twondering when we would see them again,  and with that schedule mom & dad don't get a huge amount of free time to run around and do what ever where ever.  DD is the one who asked if we could bring them home because WITH ONLY ONE INCOME (she got fired) they don't have any money -  has the CHO-CHO begun again. I don't even care, just so happy I get to see them.  Ran out and got stuff for spaghetti (Landens fav) and lots of fresh fruit -  YIPPIE.",

I love -love -love  your hair, my hair is so darn straight , I just hate it so sometimes,  absolutely not one curl, my daughters tell me staright is in - but I still like a bit of \"POOF\" I can hardly wait until Saturday AM,  it's like waiting for Christmas.  LOVE TO ALL. XOXOXOXOXOXO",

Well ASAP means next Wednesday, and Jaclyn asked more questions but the nurse said they could not discuss the findings over the phone,  she even went as far as to ask \"do I have an STD\" and the nurse did say No nothing like that. 5 years agao after Alexcis was born she had an abnormal PAP and they also did a biopsy on her ovary for a lump it was B9 then,  she is doing better than me -I am  a basket case. ",

Nancy if I ever for a minute start to think about where Landen & Ella would be if we weren't here,  it makes me ill,  they would have Jaclyn and I can't even begin to express what a GREAT help she has been,  my Jaclyn is VERY OUTSPOKEN,  and has had her share of DAD issues, but not for a single moment have I ever had to worry about her children their safety & well being,  she is a WONDERFUL mom. Ed & Landen went  out to get their STUFF this AM at garage Sales, they used to do that all the time,  came back with some NEAT STUFF, as Landen says.  We had a wonderful Saturday, looking forward to Sunday as well,  then back to the grind stone Monday saving our babies.",

These are just my personal feelings regarding why I have had such extensive testing from top to bottome. But understand you must do what is right for you.  I had no 'documented\" family history of BC, however my mom passed from liver CA (unknown primary) and her mom died of Lukemia -  so a cancer history in the family.  I was DX pre-menopause before the age of 50.  Because of chronic stomach problems over the past few years and my history and my moms it was recommended I have a colonscopy this past March -  I did (no big deal on that if your nervous the prep is the worst and thats not all that bad) I did have 2 B9 Polyps found -YEAH Like your daughter mine realize the risk factors they now have , and not a week goes by that I do not ask them about BSE, etc. I believe once I was DX  - they were at increased risk. THE BRAC testing for me was just another way for them to have more knowledge - and be more proactive in their lifetime.   If I had been BRAC positive I would have oped for Ooph/hysterectomy, at this point I have not. I do worry if I have passed this disease on to my daughters, but knowledge is POWER, and I want to enpower them with as much information they possibly can have  - if God forbid this rotten disese ever crosses their path, it would be so wonderful to put it all on the back buner and forget it ever happened but as a mom I have a responsibility to teach them no matter how old they are-  while  your dad might be upset if he does have such a mutation in his genes as to effect you or anyone  else - I would bet he would also want you to have the KNOWLEDEG AND POWER to make proactive good decisions TO SAVE YOUR LIFE!  We can inherit alot of illness, both my parents were insulin dependant diabetics, my dad lost a leg and his life to renal failure -  they could have passed that on -  my mom also had very bad heart problems (open heart surgery x2) and she was also receiving diaylis before her liver CA was detected.  All I am trying to say Leesa - is \"LIFE HAPPENS\"  no matter what we do or don't do sometimes. I am for sure your dad wants you around for a good long time - I am for sure he wants you to do all in your power to fight anything that might come your way -  XOXOXOXOXOXO -Cathi",

I am not having reconstruction, I weighed the decision very heavily, did alot of reading (here and online),  visited a PS, and decided against it because of possible complications from my rads. The PS thought my skin would be ok with expanders but of coarse no guarantees. I don't have much belly for that procedure and he was not at all confident I would be happy with those results (might be smaller than I am now @ a very small B). So I will get fitted for prosthesis when healed enough. Lisa it is like you said you know who you can and want to visit you at the start,  actually had a long talk with my daughter today (she is 28) I didn't realize she was feeling bad the past 2 years  -feeling like I keep her in the dark over all this, I guess I was thinking I was sparing her worry  NOT! She has been more worried,  the strange thing is I am so worried about my 4yr old grand daughter , we paly dress up and stuff all the time and we are so close  - what I do or have she does or has. I broke my toe -  she was limping also for a week,  I have a cold -she begins to cough.  I don't know what to say when she asks questions and she will,  I am afraid if I say ME-MA had sick boobies - she will think hers are bad, or something like that - I guess that sounds kinda weird. When I get home from hospital, my BS has a nurse comiing in the first 2 weeks a couple times,  my husband will have no problem helping with drains, dressings etc (I just wonder if I will be able to let him for a bit), and my daughter is actually a CNA so she will also help. We are very fortunante in that Ed is in business with a partner in auto sales and his work is most flexible - and he will be a great gatekeeper, And I will want some friends around I have a most wonderful G/F (her husband have kidney CA) so we have been a great asset to each other, I can tell her things about my feelings she can relate to her husbands and she tells me things about her worries and fears I can relate to my husband. She will visit often. I am confident and at peace with my decisions - but I will admit scared to death and sad at times, and I anticipate as the day draws nearer I will experience more emotion.

I have had 3 colds over the past 6/MO (bad ones) In 10 years or more I haven't had that many,  makes me wonder what has changed my resistance to them -  anyway just stoping by to say hi -it is back to laying on the couch, coughing and sneezing.

The entire lung is not effected so thats a really good thing, and it was explained to me this can be a common effect of rads when a large area is treated while my actual BC tumor was small I did have a large area treated for extensive ILCS, Sooooooooooooooooooooo way to go BC - the saga continues.  Stupid stuff anyway!!!!!!!!!!!!

I am truly blessed to have a husband who loves me, who finds me attarctive boobless and hooked to a machine  to help in breathing, buttttttttttttttttttt I HATE it,  I cry,pleed, pray and beg for this all to stop and that God will give me sometime to just feel \"NORMAL\" again.

I told him I was gonna leave, but in one last effort suggested counseling or anything that might help -  he said try and \"F-IN\" leave,  so for a few weeks I planned my escape and it had to be an escape-  On a Monday AM when he left for work I loaded up my Blazer with all that was dear to my heart (things I could not replace) and headed out.  I left behind everything - house everything.  I didn't even have a dish to my name.  Anyway I got an apartment - and there was no looking back,  I started from scratch but I didn't care, it was just stuff,  WOW I just realized something,  Iw as so weak back then, and finally got the strength to do what was right and good for me -  and these years later BC and I just got rid of \"STUFF\" again to do the right thing.  I HAVE GOT NEW STUFF AND NEW BOOBS! By the way I have named them Marilyn and Raquel -  Ed came home last night I said I took the girls out for a ride today, he is looking at me like ???????????  then I pointed to my chest. HAVE A GREAT NIGHT -  XOXOXOXOXOXO",

I have wanted another for such a long time,  Ed has always promised for my 50th B'day we would get one.  But my bosses daughters Chi had puppies, so we are doing it early as all we will need to pay is for her shots.  Her name is Margo after the rude neighbor in Christmas Vacation (Chevy Chase) thats the first silly holiday movie we ever watched together and that name has always stuck in Ed's head.  Anyway I am so excited can't wait until she is big enough to bring home, I have held her and she is so tiny.  This is a picture of her when she is just waking up.

Oh I know this too will pass, but then whats next???? I want to go back to our dating days, to our wedding plans  to our honeymoon -  not once since June of 06 does it seems like there has been any span of thim that 'SOMETHING\" has not been wrong,  how can a man possibly stay content playing \"NURSE\"   instead of \"HUSBAND\". Does he complain, does he ever say a mean or cross thing - No for sure not, but I hate this for him,  there has been no marriage for better -JUST WORSE! No marriage for health - just SICKNESS. And I am tired and exhausted of it all too,  Bootface has ruined my life!!!!.",

LOL Congrats.  I kind of think the same way as you, not so much about the DX date but the day I actually found the lump, ILC many many times does not present as a lump, I was lucky mine did and it did not show on my mammo , if it were not for my GP insisting on a US the same day, who knows ??????????????????",

I just spoke with my daughter she had her GYN appointment today and while her DR is doing a great thing, I feel so bad/weird about it all.  She has given her script to have mammo/ US and base line MRI (Jaclyn is 28), she is kind of freaking out over it.  I tried to explain it is just precaution, but I know she is just thinking about the crap I have had the past few years, I feel so bad that I have had to pass this \"fear\" onto them. She has never had any of these tests, I have offered to go with her once she has her confirmed appointment.",

So I call her a bit ago,  she answered,  I said Hi, got your VM from Sunday \"THANK YOU\",  she proceeded to say \"yeah Jim said I better call and apologize\" ,  so I was starting to have skin crawling sensations from the start,  so being nice wonderful me I just said well I appreciate it and from now on WE should be more respectful and not comment on either of our bodies and I proceeded to apologize for my comment, I quickly mentioned that I am sensitive right now about the MX and my 'summer appearance\"  BIMBO- IDIOT DUMB ASS says --------  Well thats kind of strange that you would feel that way  'you wanted to have them cut off\"  Sooooooooooooo I responded NO Carol I did not WANT to have my BREAST AMPUTATED, I wanted to stay alive and save my life- she said OH?????????

Just gonna leave it at that,  I feel ok, I did the mature thing,  I know Ed has made it very clear to Jim she really should not talk to much EVER AGAIN (HA-HA) and I am afraid if she does Ed may just pick her up and remove her -  anyway I am ok,  kind of empowered me, If that makes sense - What a dumb ass,  Just don't get what he see's in her,  WHY he stays with her, no one does.

I hate it. I asked the DR about why he said it all has to do with brain chemistry and the way we metabolize them through our bodies,  and I did say well then why would anyone WANT TO FEEL like this,  he said the majority of people who steal the drugs for a high have HAPPY HIGHS, they feel good and don't experience the bad dreams etc.  He said thats why on meds like Prozac, efforex etc,  they warn of possible suicide thoughts,  because there are those  (like me) who commonly have NEGATIVE dreams, images, feelings.  Makes sense,  I think I would like one of those HAPPY DREAMS though -LOL",

And now all those things I HATED THEN, I Cherish in my wonderful memory bank. So my best advise for you right now is have a regular supply of hair dye or set up regular appointments with a hair dresser if you want to keep those gray hairs covered that will no doubt be popping out more and more everyday for the next few years.

I have 4 beautiful grandchildren, my bucket list is still pretty long - but we shall see.  Ok I know I sound morbid, my dear friend told me that the other day - but sadly enough my mortality has been on my mind lately, I guess because of Jaclyn, maybe because of my aches and pains, I don't know, I hate CANCER - it does change your life forever.

Linda the breast MRI I thought was more loud than anything, thats the part that got to me, even with head phones and music it gave me a head ache, as everyone has described, the boobies hang down through 2 holes, I actually had my knees bent up on some sort of pillow but I was able to keep my own pants on.  Where I go they have this kind of hole in the machine that you can look out into the room even though you are laying face down.  It wasn't all that bad, no pain or anything, did get to be a bit uncomfortable.  Anyway I am off to the store see yeah later -  My grandson is picking me up.

I don't mean thats whats happening, I am just ranting,  Cancer just sucks and so what if \"FEMALE CANCERS\" have come a long way -  we aren't cured are we -  just in LIMBO. So why is it that you can see a cardiologist and he can say if you don't have this heart surgery you have a 50-50 chance of dieing in 5yeras - they do the surgery. But you have abnormal crazy pre-cancer cells floating through your body and you have a 30-40-50% chance of getting an invasive cancer and you have to plead and beg to get a DR to listen to your concerns,  and then maybe they might try and prevent it from happening, but would much rather wait and pump you full of toxic chemicals when the demon has started to run rampant $#$#@!@##$",

But of coarse ubtil the biopsy results come bak we no nothing for sure (they won't be back until 5/27 -UGH!!!!!!!!!) So I asked what happens next if there are not all clear margins,  her DR said they go back and do it again, same procedure - Well I personally find that crazy, I guess thats because I have done the whole BC thing, I realize all CA is diffrent, but if I had 9 suspicious/malignat/abnormal lumps in my breast at any one time -  what would I do.  This was the first time I actually saw Jaclyn \"freaked\" out. I wish I could find a good forum for Cervical CA for her and me, I am completely oblivious as to what to ask DR's even with all the reading I have been doing, it seems the \"protocal\" is to keep cutting/burning away until all bad areas are gone, then they treat/monitor.",

I am still a bundle of nerves - anxiety overwhelmed. I was having a crappy AM really hurting wasn't even dressed when my phone rang about 11AM, it was from Amanda's phone but it was the lady from the leasing office calling, Landen was having a seizure and was not breathing -  OK HOLY F-------------------- talk about adrelanin - I through on cloths put Margo in her bed and off I went Amanda lives 3.9 miles away.  By the time I got there they were already on the wy to the hospital,  the leasing lady was with Ella.  It took Ed and Jaclyn about 20 minutes to get there,  Bill was called and went directly to hospital.  Landen had another seizure in ambulance and one at hospital,  Ed and I got there he was passed out sleeping -  he looked so beat up. After a bit Amanda and Bill went out to do the paper work,   then in comes Bill,  Amanda passed out in the lobby they now have her in ER - WTF. Long story short they have both had a nasty stomach bug the past few days, while Landen never ran an actual temp when she took it or the hospital either it was just at 99 -  they say it must have spiked causing the seizures - fiberal seizure (sp) they did blood work,  urine test,  chest x-ray all was ok.  Gave him large dose on antibiotic and saline water IV (oh he was just tortured yesturday - poor guy).  They both were home about 8PM last night, Jaclyn kept Ella overnight,  I have her now as Amanda and Landen have to see their Doc's today.  I can't even tell you how freakin scared I was/AM,  the whole not breathing part about stopped my heart.  I am still not normal from it. SIL did great,  he stayed with me and Landed once Amanda was in ER helping through the IV and X-Ray (Ed was with Amanda) Landen crashed after that slept through the whole IV drip so Bill went to Amanda's room.  Again credit when credit is due - he did great.  He said to me at one point \"I guess this is one of these times that you realize you just live today - don't worry about anything else\"  I was amazed.  So anyway.  Hope all this is over,  I held it together when I had too, but when we got back home last night - boy  did the tears fall, complete exhaustion and fear. ",

Not sure that makes sense,  and I am not there yet,  but I have said it before if I die from Cancer no one had better ever say or write in an obituary that I Lost My Battle  -   I always think when I read that about someone who has fought a disease how sad and awful -  just me I guess,  I won't go dowm=n being a looser.

Jaclyn and my mom and dad were so close. When my dad was in his final days from kidney failure (Jaclyn was 12) she would stay with them (my dad was unable to get out of bed) she learned to give him his insulin shots (from the hospice nurse) she would bathe him, and the biggest surprise of all,  she helped with his cath for urine and the bedpan,  I was amazed, everyone was,  the hospice people said they had never seen anything like it from such a young one.  ",

Well Bimbo (AKA TP Trailer Park) started out by being rather quiet, (which was great).  The weather was fantastic, so everyone was back and forth all day to the beach.  She (her real name in Carol) decided finally to walk over with me, Alexcis and a few of my girl friends,  we are all sitting and talking  - just BS (Alexcis is in the sand playing),  a few of the girls go in the water,  sooooooooooooo (here it comes) Carol says to me she is sorry about the comment last time (WOW I am thinking - thats nice),  so I say Thank you,  \" your welcome -  because you really should not worry about anything -  how you look and all  - because you look PRETTY NORMAL in that suit\"  Now I am thinking at this point -  ok just take into account \"who and what she is \" she doesn't know any better.  Then she says \" I didn't think you could get decent looking suits if you had breast surgery - was it hard????\" Ugh -  I am still giving her the \"your stupid\" benefit of the doubt.  But my VERY DEAR FRIEND Jo is not, I could just see her fuming and Jo is a good old NY City born and raised gal, who says what she thinks and feels (LOVE her to death) Jo Speaking now  - \" She got the dam suit at a dam department store!!!!\" Right off the rack, she didn't have to have it specialty made,  nobody else gives a dam how she looks, why the hell do you always bring it up???\" She looks better than any of us sitting here,  her A$$  isn't dragging on the ground and her TITS are flapping in the breeze - God just leave it alone!!!\" So things are a bit tense at this moment,  so Carol again says she is sorry for asking questions, but breast cancer is all new to her??????  Well anyway Alexcis is still around the are playing, and I guess listening, cause out of the mouths of babes  she says  \" My Me-Ma told me her boobies aren't growing back and thats ok because they aren't sick anymore\"  and she goes off playing. It was crazy for a bit,  but Carol didn't say anything more,  they didn't spend the night,  I didn't cry I have just chalked it up to STUPIDITY.  But oh my friend says if she is ever around her again and she brings anything up  - she will pop her (Jo was around for the other comment), she didn't like her before  - she really doesn't now. Oh well thats is it-  She is just a STUPID woman and I pity her and pray she never has to deal with anything like this.",

All but 2  areas came back clean,  and they came back with instu cells at this time. So as her DR stated  - protocol states she will be refereed to a Onco (there are great meds that help to abolish the instu cells) Not actually chemo but a combo of meds???? Still not sure about all that,  she will have another PAP in 3/MO.  Constant follow-up is the norm. So after we get info, Jaclyn is the first to bring up questions like how often does the malignant cells come back,  how good are the meds, you know normal questions we all ask,  then she brought up \"would hysterectomy be better\" Now I have not said a word yet, just listening being \"supportive\".  Her Dr ( a female mind you) looks me square in the eyes and says \" you will be hard pressed to find a DR who will do such a radical surgery on such a young woman\" ,  she continues to say \" perhaps you are to close to this situation , being her mom and a cancer patient yourself your thoughts are probably not very objective\"  WTF I AM THINKING,  I have never told Jaclyn she MUST have a hysterectomy.  Now she is looking at both of us \" do either of you realize the side effects of a hysterectomy, the effect it has on your body your life is completely altered, sex is never the same,  you will most likely experience all menopausal symptoms, hot flashes, pain,  mood swings etc, it is not fun!!!\" She continues to talk about the advancements in \"FEMALE CANCERS\" and why invasive radical surgeries are not deemed as necessary as in the past,  a close careful watchful eye will catch something early.  We (especially me I think) have been throughly scolded and I was totally feeling like this B-OCH was completely against my BC decisions.  F-Her.  We left with onco appointment in hand (3wks) I could hardly even speak on the ride home, just wanted to cry. ",

Jule - praying for all good results on the mammo , happy the family is doing better XOXOXOXOXOXOXOX",

Her self asteem is very high and that makes me so happy as her dad really damaged her over the years with all his mean nasty comments to her,  I get so mad at myself when I think how as a mother I let that happen to them.",

She sent me a link last night that stated that CA  found in the tonsil area has a high percentage (I think it was 65%) of already being very advanced. I hated reading that - but I told her for every bad she googled  - she could also google a good. I even was able to find a support forum like this one for her,   I have always told her about this one, but she didn't really realize how wonderful it is. At first she was a bit standoffish about joining,  but she did,  and has found so good folks to chat with. I guess I am doing all that I can do,  I just feel like I need or want to do more.

A few days later she called asked if I received it,  weren't they pretty etc,  etc,  then asked if I could help pay for the cake & flowers.  I was floored,  but as Barbe always says I put on my Big girl panties,  didn't say a word about how hurt I was and sent a check for help - but that was their wedding gift also.   Her dad on the other hand,  did not even pay for his own tux,  Amanda payed for it ,  he did nothing except show up and get drunk and had a few choice words about me not being a good mom,  anyway,  theres always that one child who tends to make us crazy and create sadness and tears beyond control.  Amanda has grown-up sense then,  but not to sure how much,  she did just say the other day,  her dad won't miss her at all  the only time he comes around is when he NEEDS something,  I didn't ever want the girls to HATE their dad or take sides,  but it did happen  in Amanda's case for quite some time.  I hope now at 27 and a mom herself,  she realizes  how hard it is sometimes to just be MOM.  This may sound really bad,  but my secret name for Amanda the past years  - with her crazy mood swings has been PROZAC,  it helped me to laugh a little and not cry so much when she was at her MOUTHY WORST.

When I stand I fell way better than if I walk or sit,  also mets to the spine can cause spinal cord compression,  which effects the hips.  But like anything else with CA, it all varies. Some people have no symptoms (pain) for years,  others right away,  some on both sides of their body some not,  I guess thats why  sometimes it takes so long for a DR to take it serious.  I don't mean to scare/upset anyone,  but I have read many many articles lately and even asked my onco about these stats and he agreed,  30% of woman DX with invasive BC that is node negative will go on to develop bone mets,  and bone mets from BC is more often spread through the blood stream rather than lymphatic system,  my question to Onco -  then why the hell aren't all woman who are DX with invasive BC treated more aggressively right from the start,  the typical answer,  the advancements in surveillance make it easier to catch and manage early -  WTF ,  its all a big crap shoot and science experiment.",

But get this when we were outside playing after school Monday,  Ella is still a bit wabbly so she falls a bit,  Landen kept saying \"DAM-IT ELLA STOP THAT\" Tonight  he is at the sand box,  Ella falls he says  \"GD IT\" Now that did not come from school.  And he didn't say it before he left Friday - we are not perfect, but we try to watch what we say.  I am waiting for th \"F\" word   as SIL  has always used that a lot.",

Need I say UGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGH.  Of coarse we have other company at this time,  Landen & Ellla look like they have been crying as well.  I cuddle them up a bit, hugs & kisses and then they are ready to go play with everyone else out in the back yard. So I get to listen to Amanda for awhile,  apparently he has been telling her for the last week, this life isn't for him,  She says they haven't been fighting,  not sure that I believe that one bit.  I have picked Landen & Ella up from school this week,  everyone was telling me I was just being  WORRIED ME-MA, but I kept saying they are diffrent - they look so sad. Anyway today SIL is down at Shepards it's a big crazy wild drinking beach bar and it's spring break now,  I don't think I need to explain more.  He actually called her a couple times today, she went inside and of coarse I followed through and ease dropped, apparently he took the last of  their money with them,  I could here him screaming at her over the phone - etc, etc.  And I am unable to fix any of this. I knew this jerk was not going to change. She wanted to go home against my better judgement,  she went Jaclyn took her and the children up a little while ago -  and I am freaking out. Ed and I are beside ourselfs, do we call the case worker and tell her,  this is a time bomb waiting to explode.  Amanda told Jaclyn she was ready to give up and just kill herself,  even if he comes home all I AM SORRY HONEY-  its a ticking bomb.

Thank goodness we have had common sense enough to copy FB and other things and check this out this is my son-in-law actively on this web-site as of today - note he is single w/no children (don't even ask how we found this)  http://www.plentyoffish.com/viewprofile.aspx?profile_id=28388084 Learned from a mutual friend Amanda has not deleted from FB (like I and her sister) a few new things Amanda called Kristie this AM PLEASE CAN YOU COME OVER NOW, she did, Amanda was crying like a fool, she called Bill at work and the chic he left for last weekend answered his phone, Bill was changing her brakes he couldn't come to the phone, Amanda also told her that Monday night when Bill returned how the girl showed up at the apartment and Amanda called the cops to have her removed -  now we have a phys co girlfriend in the mix - Des just to briefly answer,  I know of my granddaughter (Abygael) in NY, visted her several times before she turned the age of 2,  then something happened- BILL,  and before I knew it Abygael was living with her dad ,  I was told  by Amanda that it was better cause Amanda was between jobs, NO MONEY and her dad (Jason) could do better by her and he has,  Amanda was having her for visits as I got to speak to her a few times-  then that all ended (now I know why)  Amanda used to tell me Jason was being an ass, and was keeping Abygael from her,  I used to ask her for his tele #,  she would either not have it didn't remember it,  and etc etc,  anyway thats the short version, I have talked to Jason several times this past week, and he has soooooo enlightened me,  he has just been protecting Abygael from Amanda coming in and out of her life, he is VERY WILLING to assist us with reports (which he has sent) and is also willing to talk to CPS, anyway - KEEP THE PRAYERS COMING-  FOR THE ULTIMATE IN DIS FUNCTIONAL FAMILY EVER - Ed and I are Ill with worry",

THey take a strecher in - 20minutes or so passes, rescue comes out with noone and leaves???????? WTF, Shortly after that,  Amanda opens the door and Landen & Ella come running out to us -  OMG so ,  another 30 or so minutes passes cops come out,  yeah they are fighting,  but noone saying anything,  can you guys talk to them - NO-NO-NO,  well we are gonna leave theres nothing we can do here right now, maybe you can take the children with you-  I am trying to keep calm - explaining these children have an open DCF case,  this is the 3rd time in 2 weeks you have been here etc, ect.  Ed says \"you think these children are safe\"  pushing them to call Child Protective Services-  They say YUP, we aren't worried about the kids, but maybe you should take them with you- AGAIN WTF So Ed scoops up Ella, I head into the apartment to just get diapers and some shoes for them,  they are still fighting back and forth,  the apartment is discusting, I could not walk without stepping on furniture, food, cloths what ever,  can not locate one thing of the kids, I finally just said CAN YOU TOO STOP and get me some stuff for these kids so I can get them out of here,  what really pisses me off is if we had not been there those cops would have left those kids there with them still fighting -  anyway their child protective case worker is actually on duty today, called her as soon as we got back -  of coarse NOTHING we can really do right now- THE FAMOUS WORDS, Ed talked to her cause I am afraid I would not be very nice, but she did say first thing Tuesday she is going to state attorneys office -  I don't knw what else to do,  SIL is apparently moving for real Tuesday -  I can hear DCF now, that will solve the problems it will not,  they will still see each other they will still fight,  from what I have learned through the day from Amanda's friend in NY who is so fed up and keeping me posted on things, he did hit Amanda,  but apparently after she had kicked in one of the car doors cause he was trying to leave - so they apparently both covered for each other,  she apparently told ambulance she fell and got bruises.  I don't know, Landen & Ella are supposedly here until Tuesday for school because CPS did call each of them and chew them out and made that suggestion - HOWEVER they could come and get them if they change their minds-   Ed talked to Amanda and said he was coming up to get some stuff for the kids, she had stuff sitting outside her door in bags and Bill and car were gone??? We don't know what else to do where else to YELL for help - something so bad is going to happen.",

Ed took him and the children back to his BACHELOR PAD, I went this AM to pick them up and If I was a betting person I would bet his little 20 year old crack smoking girlfriend was there,  I was about 20 minutes early, I know , I just know it was her car in the drive,  I swear I heard a girls voice when I knowked,  and to top it all off, Landen had this shirt on with a racecar on it (loves cars) I said nice shirt Landen , he said daddy put it on me & Kelsey dressed Ella,  this evening he is playing with Ella doll, pretending to feed her ,  talking to her etc, etc, and I just go Landen whats the babbies name  - he says Kelsey -  thats our crack smoker.  But of coarse I can't prove anything, CPS \"THATS JUST SPECULATION & HEAR SAY\"  UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH Now for idiot #2,  Amanda leaves the house Saturday bever to return until 8AM  Sunday -  I was spitting bullets when she got here,  I wanted to rip her apart -  however my husband would not let me- UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH Amanda-  this is not a hotel,  WHAT???????????  I had to refrain myself,  we had a very large B'bq planned today and wasn't going to ruin the day completely -  she spends little to no quality time with the kids,  who are such a mess lately,  their moods are just awful and who can blame them.  And here it is Sunday night and I am already sick to my stomach knowing they go back to SIL's again Monday and I don't see them again until Tuesday,  I have no clue how he will get them to or from school,  I can't wait until next Monday and hopefully he will be oot of the picture, And tomorrow we have to address Amanda,  she is on that stupid dating site too -  their concerns are so GREAT, it makes me sick -  Sorry if my spelling is really bad,  I am emotional, anger, sadness you name it I/WE have it. I guess it sounds bad t say that I just wish Ed & I could go back in time to those wonderful first years, I so miss the calm & happiness, holding hands,  romance,  all of that stuff, how did our lifes get so crazy,  I mean this is really just insane, and I just don't see it getting better with either Amanda or SIL in the picture,  and as I have said before CPS, just stands by and waits for disaster. ",

Judie I cared for both my parents as well,  my dad passed from Kidney failure (diabetes) your right it was a gift to be there with/for them.  But yet,  my dad passed so peacefully -  just went to sleep from all the toxins in his body.  My moms death (she was in my house) I have never seen as peacful the actually process of it anyway, her last few days were horrible she died in 98 it haunts me still.   I loved caring for her,  but my last last memory of her was helping the hospice nurse change her she had soiled,  she was so skinny and sore as we rolled her to my side she just looked up at me and was crying and saying Ouch,  she just hurt so bad even with all the meds if you just touched the bed.  I knew she was dieing that day - I just knew it.  I have wonderful wonderful memories of her as mom -  but that one I hate and it never ever leaves me.  I don't want my family to have that -  but then I know my mom didn't want that for me either,  it was my choice to bring her home with me,  she was still alert when I made that decision and I will say she was pretty PO'ed at me too -  (now I smile) she said I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE TO DO ALL THIS. In her day my mom was a very out spoken woman - right to the point (I don't have that quality from her) .  I know it hurt her pride to dwindle down.  OH I LOVE YOU MOM and miss you soooooooooooooooo MUCH XOXOXOXOXOXO",

Karen you sure are busy with the house,  don't worry I would not have been mad if you had slipped,  Well I started the Gabapertin yesturday so far so good,  of coarse I have only taken three,  he has me taking 300mg's 3 times a day along with the other pain meds.  I do think this AM the nasty leg sensations (like a weird kind of ache and numbness) is better. HOPING HOPING, no word on PET yet,  when I had my first one after DX in 06 it took BCBS almost 2.5wks to send the approval. Idiots. Leeze thank you,  poor Landen is really hating DR's now,  when Amanda took him yesturday she said he is fine in the waiting room,  but as soon has he has to start walking down the hall to exam room -  well lets just say it is loud.  On Monday @ the neuroligist office guess they will be doing an EEG,  thta should be fun,  I am going with her then,  she is nervous to go alone,  scared. The peds Dr yesturday mentione to her that he might be having Absence Seizures used to be called Petit Mal,  he does this funny little quiver thing with his upper body for just a few seconds,  like he is having a cold chill,  anywway we all have thought he was doing it himself, like trying to be silly,  frankly always brought a chuckle to everyone,  sooooooooooo who knows. Leeza yes breast cancer does commonly spread to the bones,  but again try not to worry,  I guess one of the scariest things I have learned this year and again not wanting to worry anyone is that bone mets most commonly is caused (spread) through the blood not lymphatic system,  that was my first reaction to Onco  -  I HAD CLEAN NODES,  for me it didn't matter.  But I have also learned while it will/has effected my daily living to a certian degree (mainly the pain) and while I will need to make some adjustments if it stays contained and we can get pain control I very well can be around a good long while. I would much rather at this point control pain with meds (as long as I can function on them) than doing rads now,  but gotta get the stupid PET and see about the stupid enlarged nodes and we'll take it from there. I will share with the girls soon,  I just have to get the thoughts and words in order,  I recall after my MX, Jaclyn saying to Ed now shes is ok all the cancer is gone.

Jane none of us had any clue some of Landens little movements or quivers were actually possibly seizures either until his Peds DR Pointed them out as that possibility.  Today I had him out grocery shopping with me and he was sitting in the cart (it's built like a big race car,  kinda hard to maneuver but he loves it) anyway he just lays back in the cart at first I don't think to much,  then I look at his little hand holding the cookie from the bakery and it is just lightly shaking I bend around an stare at him right smack in his face -  NOTHING,   the PEDS DR told us if we see him tremble his hand or leg to grap it in ours  - if it stops its just normal if it keeps trembling it is a seizure, it kept moving,  like you said Jane only a few seconds a minute or so tops.  Amanda has to keep a journal of all this stuff for Neurologist. Of coarse as ME-MA I have been reading up and seeing what questions we might need to answer,  I have noted in a ton of articles that speech can be delayed with these,  Landen is a month younger than Brandt and is no where near talking as Brandt, Landen understands perfectly and can make you understand his needs by taking you to what he wants but it si mostly pointing and a grunting sound he makes,  they talk to him all the time as we all do about the only word he really says and thats not clear is BALL (he loves balls) so I do have some questions about that. My older brother used to have epilepy seizures when he was very young, he out grew them as a teen ager also.  Yes Karen PAIN CONTROL is a wonderful thing,  yup not a single extra Tylenol with the 2 scripts, best combo yet.  I mean I  still have discomfort  - but totally tolerable,  I suppose if I did take a tylenol or two it might be 100% gone for a few hours,  but I really don't see the need. The one that I was a bit scared to take is every 8 hours so far by about 7 hours I can really start to feel the ache creeping back in,  but then I can take the other pain med which I can tak every 12 hours,  I have it scheduled pretty well now.  Again so far so good-  SO HAPPY.",

Lisa the FOOD has stopped at least for now,  I will be DARNED if we feed them while they are here too  for fun time. Landen is doing much better,  he is adjusting well,  doing great in daycare, I have been able to remove the bottle, and he now has a great bedtime routine ,  most nights asleep by 8:15,  I can't really fault Amanda for those things,  SIL was of NO HELP in the evening  - HE WORKED ALL DAY- SHE WAS AT HOME ALL DAY HAVING FUN,   I almost spit nails though  today when I read a post from Amanda on FB how she spent 3 hours relaxing at the pool -  OMG if I didn't have to be careful with what I say,  and surley not put anything in writing-  you might imagine what I COULD HAVE SAID, in almost 4 weeks,  I have not had a moment of time to myself pretty much except sleeping and even thta is minimal,  the kids sleep great through the night,  but my mind does not stop thinking about what I have to do TOMORROW -  I so want Amanda to wake up -  I am so praying the start of this Domestic couseling will help her -  I had started to believe that if God was near getting ready for me to come visit him all would be ok,  the DD's were grown and I thought they had their lifes in order as much as one could - well not so,  and now I worry soo about two little ones, there is NO WHERE ELSE for them to go, no other family except Jaclyn and she has her own. SUCH WORRY",

Landen my little man has been a TERROR this weekend,  he has had a bad cold and has not been in daycare sense Wednesday,  he started yesturday during  daddy visit-  TANTRUMS ,  kicking screamiing,  just CRAZY AWFUL BEHAVIOR,  I have not had issue with putting him to bed in weeks,  tonight he actually slapped me across the face,  we have a great bedtime routine and he goes without issue -  he threw himself off the bed several times,  screaming just crazyness,  I don't know if it's just being sick,  being out of school,  the visits,  gonna pay close attention to see if they continue.  He hardly has a voice,  not sure if it's the cold or seriously from all the screaming he has done the past 2 days. How can you really know what an almost 2yr olds emotions are.  Hoping to get him over thos cold,  back to daycare and our good routines and it all passes. SLEEP TIGHT ALL. XOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXO",

I was pretty much spending 24/7 at the hospital anyway and thats what I explained to her,  that having her home with me was actually physically easier on me. And physically it was.  My dad had hospice but he was in their house,  very close to where I lived,  between hospice and some wonderful neighbors and my nephew it worked 9he passed first),  mind you there are 5 of us kids,  I am over being UPSET but all the others would always say call me if you need anything,  they would pop in and visit but that was pretty much it.  I don't have a regret in the world,  just hate that one awful memory. When my mom did pass it was a nice day 9/21 in NY I had my windows all open and was sitting on the sofa (crying of coarse) this huge huge wind blew through the living room and I know that was my dad taking my mom with him,  that is my most wonderful memory of that day and most peaceful feeling also.  Then and still now I just saw them hand in hand moving towards heaven.I the wind/breeze went directly over me touching me on purpose,  so with the sad memory I also have a good one.  Gosh am I full of emotion today or what.

We have sunshine back finally,  still about 10 degrees colder than our normal high temp of 73 for this time of year,  but the harsh winds have stopped so it's pretty nice,  thinking with some warm cloths I might be able to even get Margo out for a walk later today she needs to expell some energy she has kinda just been laying around with her sick keepers the past few days and none of the kiddies have been over to give her a back yard work out either for a week now. Landen continues to have extreme Pooh,  he see's Peds Dr on Tuesday and has his neurologist visit on 3/8,  so far other than the bad pooh,  many many times a day he is doing ok.  Little guy has lost some weight ,  I stopped in Saturday,  can see it in his face and when you hold him. I hate to think about all the germs my family is sharing. HAPPY SUNDAY EVERYONE. XOXOXOXOXOXOXO",

Even  simple things like getting him a drink,  food,  changing his diaper,  ME-NA must do it.  I try and do what I am SUPPOSED TO DO and encourage him to let mo or dad,  but he gets so upset,  I am a little annoyed with DCF, they tell you all these things you MUST DO for possible reunification,  but give you NO support or help in how to do them so the kids don't hurt.  I was completely wrong,  I thought Ella would be the hard one for them,  thinking oh Landen he's 2  he will just love having mom and dad around more,  while he is happy to play with them,  it's seems like he has no faith/trust in them for the other stuff, if that makes sense. And Landen is a VERY routined child ,  any disruption to his routines he does not do well emotionally-  OH it's breaking my heart to watch him regress and become upset again.",

Getting more nervous about tomorrow night with the children,  I learned that Amanda and Bill have not been doing some of their criminal court requirements, aside from the 4 day a week classes they are each supposed to go to at least 1 NA (AA) meeting per week, they have gone to NONE. They were told Wednesday they each must have 3 in by Monday or they will be in violation ,  not sure what that means,  but guessing it can't be good.  And get this they got a NEW USED CAR, they had a 2004 Mountineer ( free & clear),  but it is a gas hog,  but out of the blue they decide to up and sell it and get a car, they did this all in 2 days,  now mind you instead of going through Ed who could have gotten them a car through the auctions at his cost ,  they could have owned it free and clear with what they sold the truck for,  they went to a buy-here- pay-here lot,  gave a small down payment and now have $300+ /mo payments  -  They are always crying BROKE  without a car payment -  and where they got it,  isn't a nice lot, its a DIRT LOT- BUY HERE - PAY HERE,  Oh well,  their burden to carry I guess,  and Amanda still has no DL. Anyway Ed and I are planning dinner out Saturday,  his cold is better, still a bit of a cough from time to time,  I have a slight touch,  but mine is staying in my head,  sniffles, sneezing,  but I don't really feel bad with it. Well HAPPY THURSDAY NIGHT ALL.  XOXOXOXOXOXXO ",

A loaf of bread and some PB&J. I just can't deal with thinking of them not eating,  or even having a snack - UGH- I am keeping track of all this though for the case worker,  makes me ill to my stomach. I just got a call from the school saying Landens lips are chapped to the point of bleeding,  he is a lip licker (Amanda always was)  the owner of the school wanted to know why he wasn't brought in with lip balm/chap stick,  DD & SIL do Monday AM drop off.  Its a littl thing under normal circmstances but they don't get how under the microscope they are. ",

Well sisters I had another major scare yesturday - this time it was all me -  All week long actually about the last 2  weeks,  I had been having some weird pains,  at first it started on both sides of my chest -  like rigt where the drain tubes went in from MX,  it was both sides,  it hurt to touch,  but kinda brushed it off to just that left over surgery aches and pains, that lasted a couple days then subsided  but the pain moved to the bottom of my rib cage  - bilateral again, still brushed it off,  hurt worse if I sat a long time, but nothing I could not tolerate  -   Thursday the pain just went to bottom of rib cage on R (mets is on left) was increasing in intensity -  but still I felt tolerable if I just took it easy.  Friday I woke up it was even worse, Ed could tell he says YOUR MAKING YOUR SCRUNCHY FACE ,  I told him it was alright and sent him off to work,  well within 2 hours - I honestly thought I was having a heartattack,  my bottom rib was jabbing knife pain and my chest was crushioing together - could hardly breath -  I WAS TOTALLY FREAKED OUT. Long story short ,  because I really did think it was my heart went to the ER, it is where I needed to go because of symptoms,  but they really had no clue after they ruled out heartattack.  The druged me up with something  - OMG , the needle was not even out of the IV before I was on cloud nine - some  darn good $hit. LOL  ER DR said it was COSTOCHONDRITIS- and in my case ????? it is caused by thickness and irritatiion/swelling of the rib/sternum/breast bone ,  and it does kind make sense except my surgery was well over a year ago and have had no issues. So anyway he gave me a script for an antiinflammatory and vicaden for the weekend and guess it's off to Onco on Monday or tuesday. It feels better today,,  the crushing feeling is way better, I guess the pain pills help that,  like I need more of those - LOL So anyway - just another day in the life of me -  LOL HAPPY SUNDAY ALL.

Ed said he can't imagine being a judge having to listen to those horror stories day in and day out, he was really taken aback by the little one in foster care for 4 yrs and burned & bruised.  It really bothered him all evening.",

She is going to give SIL's probation officer a call as well.  As far as other stuff, she is going to try and speak to Amanda alone,  but she knows Amanda well, and expects her to say ALL IS WELL,  she is also going to speak with the counselor they see bi-wwekly on Fridays now.  CW said she knows it's hard and she  believes that the home could possibly be a bad place for Landen & Ella, however at this point her hands are legally tied,  without Amanda speaking up, or an INCIDENT happening or a failed drug test, stuff like that they can't just waltz in and remove the children from one or both of them.  She is recommending CLOSER TABS on them from the new case worker and reunification team.  And as hard as it's going to be,  we have to STEP BACK,  I know you all have been saying that, but she even means as far as picking the kids up from daycare ' they have to fiqure these things out\"  and fail if they are going to fail. That part even bothered Ed,  he wants to be able to see  Landen & Ella,,  we know them better than anyone.  So her suggestion is not 5 days a week.  As far as Amanda making suicide threats, apparently they have a way of addressing that as well .  So thats that, Because it was already planned, I'll be picking Landen & Ella up today,  guess I'll see them again Friday if they go to the counselor as they are supposed to.  This is gonna be so hard.",

Mind you if you look at his FB page Friday night he went out, Saturday he went to the beach, Saturday night he went out,  not once did he care or ask to see his children over the weekend, he is playing a game because DCF is coming Tuesday just like he did last year. Anyway,  Ed finished up with the kids and I took her aside and laid into her,  and I told her WE ARE DONE, Bill in his replies to her is telling her he is never coming back all that stuff he's happy, she sucks, etc etc.  I was YOU two fiqure this out,  meaning I was not coming up in the AM to take kids to school,  I will not be watching them over night,  basically telling her let their LOVING MISSINF DAD do it,  you obviosly have NO REGARD for your children , and we know that $%$#@#$%^&* (I said many words) does not.  It was way deep,  just too much to type. Anyway DCF tells us their hands are tied at this point, what I did not realize until today was CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES is  not the same as DCF (Dept of Children & Families),  so I am pretty much unable to function today, Ed is a wreck,  but after talking we called Child protective Services ,  thus opening a new case against them,  at any moment they will receive knocks on their doors, I have every single FB post everything from yesturday and weeks and months before, school is aware.  And heres a topper for you,  hold onto your hats Amanda has a 7 year old daughter in NY whom she lost custody of for the same thing,  Jaclyn has been doing a lot of investigating on stuff she suspected and I was to blind to see,  I was just faxed papers from NY where Bill was in trouble for the same things even putting a gun to Amanda's face while she was holding that daughter -  this I NEVER KNEW, I almost passed out reading that stuff,  and in 4/09,  4 months before they moved here,   Landen was placed in protective custody in NY, none of us ever knew that,   I can't believe these papers I am reading, we are expecting to hear from Protective Services sometime, poor Ed I have seen him cry twice before today, when I was told I had cancer, when his dad died, but as he was making this report he lost it.  We have to save these babies",

Well that depends on what it is Amanda -  can you pay my cell bill on line ($50.00) and I'll pay you back tomorrow when I get paid.  I just simply said NO I can't do that .  And I didn't say this of coarse but she gets paid bi-weekly and she gets paid next week,  also I am thinking are you F-in nuts, your husband goes out all Saturday , drinking and what ever spending money and you want me to pay your bill.  I was good I didn't go there, just stuck to the NO,  somehow though they managed to pay it , was back on Wednesday night. She asks me today if we are cooking this weekend,  I said no again,  Ed and I discussed it,  we just can't take the drama again every weekend. And I sorta told her that calmly, we spent all last Friday cooking and cleaning and what ever for Saturday,  some didn't show up (meaning SIL)  and others were to emotionally devestated to enjoy, eat or anything.  So no Amanda for awhile we are gonna kinda limit the Bb'q's to once a month or so,  Then I said but if you guys would like to cook and invite us up,  THANK YOU. It's hard doing the tough love, when I think about Landen & Ella,  but I  am finally REALLY starting to get it,  and it has to be done.
