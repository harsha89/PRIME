Guess what I am trying to say is do whatever you are comfortable with and what is right for you so that you can start to mend.   I cherish having you on this discussion board and am cheering you on in your struggle.  Deb",

Happy to report that after 4 months, the nerve pain is starting to improve.  Until you can meet with the LE therapist, you might try elevating your arm above your heart and opening and closing your hand to let the fluid drain from your arm.  Also suggest keeping up with range of motion exercises which will help your shoulder. Check out http://www.stepup-speakout.org/ for suggestions on bras.  Binney, Otter, Kira and others have done a wonderful job in putting together this site.  I'm sure they will be along soon to offer their suggestions.  Gentle hugs to you",

And just a clarification for anyone else reading this thread.  I had to switch from the oral NSAIDS (naproxyn, ibuprofen, etc) to the cream because of my LE.  The voltaren cream is also an NSAID.

I saw a PT when the arm pain & swelling started and she gave me exercises and taught me MLD.  Got very limited relief and then swelling in breast & chest became a problem.  As I learned more about LE (thank you Binney, Otter, Kira & others) I realized that the first PT was not LANA certified and had actually only taken a weekend course.  Long story short, this last month I located a LANA certified therapist who is about 300 miles away and saw her three times.  She was just so much more knowledgeable about LE, and the MLD & exercise program is much more comprehsive.  The LE is mild enough that I do not need to wrap the arm.  Good news is that the aching in the arm is finally getting better.  She refitted me for the proper sized sleeve and glove and recommended that I wear them pretty much throughout the day.  I do MLD & exercise program once a day for a total of about 2 hours. If I think about it, I get pissed about the LE intruding on my life.  The good news is that with much better treatment I finally feel like I am getting control of this monster and hope that I will be able to return to cross country skiing next winter.  I would encourage anyone dealing with LE to seek out the best possible care by a LANA certified therapist.  It really does make a difference. I am in need of a compression bra or compression shirt that I can sew in the compression padding for breast & back.  Any suggestions? Hope you are able to find relief soon!",

You are already taking positive steps to find out as much as you can before reaching a decision, so good for you. As someone who has been dealing with lymphedema as a result of a lumpectomy & SNB, I would strongly encourage anyone considering radiation to the axilla to seek a referral from their onc to a well-qualified lymphedema therapist prior to radiation so that baseline measurements can be taken and you can learn about risk reduction measures you can take to minimize the risk of lymphedema, and to learn what to look out for should you develop lymphedema.  Prevention, or in the alternative, early diagnosis and treatment of lymphedema can make a world of difference.  Check out the lymphedema thread on these boards and www.stepup-speakout.org website for for information on how to find a well-qualified therapist. As challenging as lymphedema is, it can be managed.  With cancer, I think it's important to fight the best fight possible, taking into account your personal situation and preferences.

If you haven't checked it out yet, there is a thread over on Fundraising Opportunities called \"broke and heading to a tent in the woods\".  Looks like there is some good information from others who have dealt with having limited resources. You deserve to get good medical care and to get treatment that is right for you and right for your situation. I hope you can find your way through the financial quagmire so you can get on the road to recovery. Hang in there and let us know how you are doing. Deb",

Additions to Binney's flare care techniques: Distraction.  Read a good book or magazine or listen to music, anything to distract you from how you are feeling.  Meditation or prayer.  There are some great guided meditation tapes out there.  Comfort.  Whatever is most comforting to you.  I wrap myself up in the quilts my sisters made.  Know it won't last forever, and remind yourself of that frequently.  And the best, chocolate! I do hope you will contact your dr about your pain, as it will also make it easier to deal with everything else you have on your plate.  Hope you are feeling better soon and are back to being your usual spunky self! Gentle hugs, Deb",
