I started getting a dull ache in my left breast, sometimes it would last the whole day and other times it would stop for a few days at a time but its never left completely. I then noticed i started getting the same sort of pain in my left arm pit, sometimes dull and sometimes an odd sharp pain. From there things have just gotten worse! My breast seems to have increased in size slightly and sometimes feels heavy. My breast, armpit and upper arm are all hot to the touch. The rib directly under my breast aches on and off. My whole left arm aches and has gone numb from time to time. My arm also seems to be swollen. I'm also experiencing upper back and neck pain. I have been extremely concerned so ive seen quite a few different doctors! (probably over 10 different doctors) I have had two ultrasounds on my breast and armpit both showed nothing. Ive had an xray on my upper back that also showed nothing. My hormones have been tested they came back normal. I have had numerous blood tests for a variety of things and the only thing that was found was extremely low iron levels. The only thing the doctors have found is an inflamed bursa in my shoulder so they diagnosed me with burstitis. Burstitis would explain some of my arm pain but none of the other symptoms ive been having. My concern is that i have inflammatory breast cancer. None of the doctors i have seen seem to think i have it, but i'm not sure what to think. These symptoms have been going on for over five months now and i seem to be no closer to getting any answers! I feel so frustrated, its taking such a huge emotional toll on me. Ive had so many doctors tell me its nothing or my burstitis is causing my breast pain or im just over-thinking the whole situation! i feel so lost! I finally convinced a Doctor to refer me to a breast clinic ( after bawling my eyes out) and i will be begging them for an MRI! Has anyone else had the same type of experience?

I went to my doctor and they recommend I go and get an ultrasound. They found no lump or anything on the ultrasound that could be causing my pain. My doctor then recommended I get a mammogram, here's where I get confused. I'm only 22 and I've read multiple different things saying a mammogram at such a young age is basically pointless because the breast tissue is so dense and is likely to show nothing. I went to three other doctors explaining my concern about a mammogram at such a young age but they all said the same thing- go get a mammogram. Finally I found a doctor who agreed with me and said it would be silly to get one. But he has no idea what is causing me this pain. What I want to know is where do I go from here? Clearly something isn't right with my breast and underarm but in unsure of what other tests I can do? Am I just meant to sit by and wait to see if it gets worse? The idea of doing nothing makes me feel I'll! I'm so frustrated and confused! Log in to post a reply",
