When I got mine, which I did simply because insurance covered them and I had an hour at the hospital to fill between appointments, we had to work hard to find a model that would withstand cat claws. The fitter was also careful to remind me that dogs love to use them as chew toys. Interesting visual there. Anyway, mine remain in my sock drawer. I'm glad yours will be having an adventure.",

At the time I felt like I was keeping up with normal life, not missing work, doing some things for fun, but now that it's in the rearview mirror the impact it made is more apparent. I think \"emergency mode\" describes it well.",

It initially made me realize our privilege and all the comforts we are able to afford ourselves throughout treatment including an unlimited number of OTC drugs, lotions, natural products and foods just to name a few. Seeing the simplicity of that ward made me thankful for that privilege. Then I couldn't help noticing the pink ribbons in both photos, they really are everywhere. And lastly i thought about how, if those beds were typically full with patients undergoing treatment, there must be some close bonds that develop between the women in that ward, and hoped that there was some comfort for them in that, kind of like these groups and the bonds that form in our virtual \"ward.\"",
