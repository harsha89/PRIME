This week I have a lot of itching, but it also seems deep in the breast and not the topical Skin. It is not just the site of the lumpectomy, but rather under the breast, and to the side towards my lymph scar. It is driving me crazy! Don't go back to any dr. until April and that is with oncologist, not the Radiation Onc. ????",
