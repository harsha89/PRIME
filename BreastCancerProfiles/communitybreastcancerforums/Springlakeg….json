I didn't have any periods after my first round of chemo.  So . . . the effects of instant menopause was not that bad for me.  I was expecting worse.  I take Anastrozole each day (which is an aromatase inhibitor), to take care of the remaining estrogen in my body. After a lot of research and speaking with several doctors, getting a hysterectomy/oopherectomy seemed like the best way to deal with estrogen when you are pre-menopausal.   Your case seems similar to mine, and I want you to know that I have been in a full remission (totally clear PET scans) for almost 2 years now.  I believe we may have gotten it all, but only time will tell, of course.  If you want to read my story, please feel free.  My website is deniseneish.com  and you can just go to the journal tab and read from the beginning if you would like.  I made my site so that people like you would be able to find some success stories when you receive such a scary diagnosis.  Please read it if you feel it would help you.   There are many other women on this site who have positive stories to share as well.  Some have been NED for many years, and some still have cancer, but have been able to successfully hold it at bay for a long time.  I am praying that you will be comforted during this difficult time.  You aren't alone, and we are all here for you!!",

(traditional proven approaches).  If he does, he may be causing some women harm by convincing them that they don't need proper treatment.  (He may sort of be trying to indicate that Tamoxefin is not traditional, but it is definitely a powerful first line of treatment for many).  I do, however appreciate the idea that we can benefit from learning and practicing better diets, etc..  Thanks for sharing your positive story Janice, and I'm happy that Tamoxefin is working well for you.  Many women use that as a first approach and it can be very effective.  Hopefully you are done with cancer forever, but if not, there are many chemo drugs or other drugs or treatments out there that have been shown time and time again to have great outcomes for many women.   deniseneish.com",

And thanks to all of you who said I didn't sound like a kid. \"My story\" was definitely lacking a lot of the details, but it just went by way too fast for me to really share it all. I think whenever it is your own story, you could really go on about it for a long time, but that wasn't necessarily the goal. ;)  Since \"my story\" is different than all of yours, I feel the need to let doctors know that they should give more hope to many mbc patients, and I don't want newly diagnosed women to think they need to just lay down and let it take them.  I didn't like the little description that the news station wrote under my podcast on their site though. It basically said that I said cancer patients could beat it if they are \"willing to fight\". That is not what I said at all. I have always maintained that each case is unique, and each woman should do what she feels is right in her specific situation.  When I feel it's my time to go, I will admire those who have gone before me with grace and dignity, and I will try to remember their courageous examples to me. It's not always time to fight, but my message was more for those who are trying to win a battle. Hopefully that message came through as well.

I really do appreciate hearing what you all think and how you feel about your approach to treatment, etc.. I am more comfortable with the idea of treating this more chronically than I was before. And even though I said that I had a \"change in thinking\", it wasn't really a drastic change. I have always been cautiously hopeful, but not unrealistically so, . . . I don't think. My hope was based on much more than just the small percentage that are cured for no apparent reason. My hope was always more along the lines of categorizing myself as an \"oligomet\", which statistically does leave reasonable hope for a cure in my mind. And even now, I do think it's possible that there will be treatments down the road that could do the trick. But if there is just a line up of drugs that can keep me feeling decent for many years while I raise my kids, that is acceptable too. And I think I needed to hear Dr. Valero's \"pep talk\". He put a good perspective on it for me. Hearing all the wisdom each of you has to share is helpful too.  As for diet, I think it can be quite helpful to be pretty thoughtful about what we take into our bodies. It may not cure cancer, but it can sure help us to feel better each day, and with all the treatment our poor bodies are dealing with, I'll take any advantage I can get! I'm not extreme, and I will indulge once in a while, but mostly I feel better mentally and physically if I'm pretty strict with my diet. But everyone has to do what feels right for them. And sometimes we all need something that just makes us happy in that moment! :) Thanks again for your thoughtfulness all of you! Heidihill, stories like yours are so hopeful! I hope you will continue NED for many more years to come! Ex, you too! Brandall, thank you for sharing your experience with your trial. I hope it will continue to work well for you, and I am very hopeful about starting mine too. Musiclover, I think it's so interesting that some have done so well with such minimal treatment, and change in diet. All of this stuff gives me hope, and I think it's great to share with each other. You all are doing your best to handle things well, and I commend each of you, whatever your personal style may be! ",

LuAnnh, many good points in your comments! Heidihill, Thank you for sharing your article.  It really is promising!  I think the reason they never give stats for overall survival rates it just because it's hard to calculate.  They would need to wait until all those subjects died cancer-free of something else before they could count them.  But I think it only makes sense that if the numbers are way better for a certain subcategory of MBC patients who treat it a certain way, then the overall survival rates must be higher too. And thank you JillThut for your comment.  I think that's very true.  I have noticed that the comments on this board are almost always so supportive and kind-hearted that I think the women who post here are understanding enough to see some posts that might not be right for them, and just move on without feeling hurt.  That's my hope anyway!   NewportCB, I'm so sorry that you have to be searching for answers right now.  I am sorry for your diagnosis, and I truly wish you the best!  I made a personal website sharing my story and some personal thoughts on dealing with stage 4 breast cancer.  Please feel free to peruse it if it seems like something that would help right now.  You are exactly who I made it for!  The first part of my journal is long and hard to get through because I had so much on my mind as I wrote, but it gets better as it goes along because there is a happy ending!!  :)  I'm still here and NED, and hope to be that way for a long long time!!  Love and hugs to you and your husband!!  This is my site:  deniseneish.com Ladies, I hope you will keep posting your positive stories and more optimistic studies that you find.  The mind is powerful, and hope is not misplaced if there are some valid reasons for it!!  Thank you so much for sharing!!",

I will let you know what my oncologist says about insurance. A friend of mine with MBC ER+ HER2-, but HAS also had endocrine therapy, met with her oncologist in Michigan today and her doc seems to think she will be eligible, but I have my doubts.

I was eager to try out my brand new running shoes. The sky was brilliant as the sun rose over the mountains. I breathed in the fresh crisp air as I laced on my shoes. I was ready for this run! It was hard to contain my energy and strength as I bounded out onto the pavement. I smiled at the little flowers I saw blooming on the side of the hill. It was almost effortless to glide forward at a nimble pace. Sometimes I accelerated without even noticing. Other times I stopped and dawdled at the side of the road. Frequently there were others around me. We ran together for a while and compared running shoes. We gleefully splashed through puddles, and trudged up steep hills together. We held our arms up in the air as we recklessly sprinted down the hills and into the valleys. Soon one was running beside me. He made my heart pound deeper. My steps grew in rhythm with his. We turned onto a new path together. It felt familiar. It was our own. Our new path was narrower. It was a lovely winding path with playful white flowers freckled along the side. We splashed in the cool mountain stream that bordered our path. We climbed a tree to get a better view and chartered our course. Our shoes were slightly worn now, but we had taken good care of them, and knew that we could run many more miles on them. We loved our new path. We vowed to run on it together forever. We decided to share our path with four new runners. We were so excited to show them everything. We laughed as they marveled at their new shoes. We taught them to lace up their shoes, stretch, and run, run, RUN!!!!! If they fell, we picked them up and brushed the dirt from their knees. \u201cYour wound will heal\u201d we said, \u201cIt is not so bad. Now get back up and run!\u201c It was hard to keep up with them sometimes! But other times they lay peacefully in our arms as we reverently watched them sleep. They were amazing. We held hands and ran slower so that we could all stay together. A steady pace forward and side by side was our goal. The radiant sun was still high in the sky. Suddenly a thorn shot through my shoe and tore deeply into my foot. I was stunned at first and stumbled. I could not get the bleeding to stop. I fell and cried. The wound was too deep to heal, I was told. I could see the wound, but I couldn\u2019t feel the pain. Someone cries beside me. He takes my hand again. We are wounded together. We are lost from our course. How could we lose our beautiful path? This was not what we planned. We tell our little runners that it will be okay. It will heal. Then we continue to run on our new path as the sun begins to hide behind the mountain. We quicken our pace to beat the setting sun. We hold each other\u2019s hands. Our little runners can feel our grips tighten. When I am too weak to run, he carries me for a while. I try to smile and I run when I can. Our path gets steeper and darker. I try to move forward on my own, and our hands lose contact briefly. I can feel the pain now. Our little runners cling to us and stumble when we do. We reach out to find one another again and turn the corner. The path is unfamiliar ahead. If we cannot get back onto our beautiful path, can we make this one ours? We decide to recharter our course. First we must stop and remove the thorn, we decide. It will hurt, but it must come out if there is any chance for it to heal. We let ourselves believe that it can heal. We cannot remove my shoe completely or I will have to go home right away. We know that we will both end our run at home, but we want to enjoy the path together as long as we can. We try to remove all of the thorn. We don\u2019t want to leave any part behind. I sob with pain as it being removed. Sometimes I stop and take a deep breath. \u201cWe have to continue\u201c, I say. My will to be rid of the thorn is increasing. I want to believe that my shoe can be as good as new. Our little ones play alongside the path, unaware of the thorn. I want to watch them grow into strong runners. There is so much for me to teach them before we go on separate paths. They come over to us when they see the clouds darkening, and we tickle them and tell them to go play by the stream for a while. This will just take a moment longer. We struggle to get rid of the thorn. Feeling weak, we cry out to God. \u201cPlease heal this wound!!\u201d Others encircle us and lift me to my feet. \u201cIf you do your best to repair your shoe, I will take care of your foot\u201d comes the answer. We summon all our strength and pull as hard as we can on the thorn. It comes out but leaves a wound in my foot and a hole in the shoe. We ask others for help to repair the shoe. We want to do the very best job we can so that the shoe will last a long time. We have to use what is around us to repair it. The repair job seems solid, but the shoe will never be completely the same. I look at all who have gathered around me on our path. They are telling me that it will be okay. They encourage me to keep running. I don\u2019t like this path as much as the one I started on, but I am not alone like I was at the beginning of my run. I decide that my foot needs to be stronger if my shoe is weakened. I did not start this run only to go home early. I will run better than I have ever run before! I take his hand again with renewed energy. I can feel my foot healing already. We take our four little runners and begin again. The path takes us around another corner, and the sun is still shining. We only thought the sun was setting because of our place on the path. My shoe is working well, but we know that all of our shoes will wear out eventually. Then we will go to our beautiful home and rejoice at the new shoes that await us there that will never wear out. But in the meantime, we look around and notice that the path is much more interesting than we thought. The shadows only make the sunlit parts look brighter. There is still a long way to go on the path before we reach our home. We will never be the same as we were before the thorn. In many ways we are stronger. We are more aware that our run cannot last forever, but we are not afraid. We vow to run our best, to splash in the stream, to raise our hands in the air and run recklessly down the hills, to lift those we see who have fallen on the path, to tickle our little runners, to teach them all we know, and to hold hands all the way home.    Thanks for reading :) deniseneish.com",

I was in remission for 2 years on Anastrozole, then it failed me in July 2014, and I had a recurrence in my right iliac bone. At that time, we explored all the options out there, and with my oncologist, came to the conclusion that it would be great if I could get on a trial of Palbociclib (or another CDK inhibitor). I then went to MD Anderson in Houston for a second opinion, and without telling him what my oncologist said, he recommended the exact same thing. At that time I really came to feel at peace with that decision for my next treatment, but quickly found out it was harder to get on than I realized. I decided to stick with my decision to get on Palbociclib, but didn't want to go untreated for too long, and decided to take Tamoxifen in the interim. When Pfizer started the expanded access program last October, I met all the requirements to get into that trial, but my hospital did not have the trial, and so they began the process of getting approved for it. According to my doctor it was the longest process, with the most hoops to jump through, that she has ever experienced, and they were still in the process of getting approved for the trial when Pfizer announced that Palbociclib was FDA approved. They would not open any new sites for the expanded access program, yet they redefined the eligibility for Palbociclib as those who had not been on any prior endocrine therapy. This seemingly excluded me. I am a person who does a lot of research, thinking, and praying about my treatment, and then after that, I really rely on my gut feeling. So, after a recent PET scan which showed that the Tamoxifen seems to be keeping my cancer stable, I could definitely continue with Tamoxefin, but I just don't want to! That's the long answer to your short question! On paper, continuing on Tamoxifen is a reasonable option, but it's not what I feel right about, and not what I want to do. I only have one little spot of cancer right now, and I want to be on the most effective treatment that will hopefully get me back to NED, or at least keep me stable, for many years to come, and I think (and hope) Palbociclib is what will do that for me. I was getting discouraged that my \"gut feeling\" was off because Palbo didn't seem to be available to me, but now I feel much more comfortable, and at peace, that I will be able to follow the treatment I feel best about.",

Further prospective studies to better characterize OMBC are warranted to improve prognosis in MBC. OMBC for those of you who don't know is \"oligomets metastatic breast cancer\", in other words, only one spot where the cancer has metastasized.  I would assume results would be similar for those with just a few spots, especially if those spots were locally treated as well as systemically treated.   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22532161 Some of the stats in this article are so much more promising than what many of our oncologists told us to begin with, and that is why many women under-treat metastatic breast cancer, because they are given the impression that their is no hope at all for them.  I think that some women would choose more aggressive treatment if they fit into certain criteria, and if they knew that their odds for long-term survival, or even cure, were a lot higher than the whole big category of 'Stage 4 breast cancer'.   I mean, we talk about doctors being straight with us, but that doesn't always mean that they need to be more negative about our odds for survival.  Sometimes that means they need to be more optimistic.  Especially if they are saying you are \"incurable\" like they said to me.  I didn't buy it, and I'm glad I didn't and that I treated it aggressively, because in my particular case, I had a real chance to knock it down, and I'm hoping that's what we did!   I just want other women in similar situations to know that they may have every reason to insist on aggressive treatment if that feels right for them.  I feel passionately about it, and hope that more research and effort goes into cure for metastatic breast cancer so that the odds will continue to improve!!  I love all you ladies who are struggling with this disease, and I want all the information to be shared so that everyone can make their best decisions.  Sometimes there is really no reason to \"accept\" something as inevitable if you think you have a chance to kick it's a$$!!!  ;)   (I continue to worry about posting these types of messages if it is discouraging for those who do not fit into this category.  Please accept my apologies if I offended anyone, but I do feel it's an important topic for some of us.) deniseneish.com",

The sooner she can get on the correct antibiotics, the sooner she will be able to fight off the infections. It may not be too bad if she gets it taken care of quickly.
