Try not to read into it. It is wonderful you're getting checked out, keep up with appointments, I think Susan Komen has a helpline that can refer you to places for free screening or sliding scale fees, I called it years ago and they told me Bellvue Hospital in NYC offers it. I have the NY state of health insurance, I wonder if the market place is still open? Double check because in NY I'm sure I saw a billboard saying the length of time to sign up had extended since last year, failing that can you turn in the paper work for medicaid! I believe in NY you can apply online now check it out. I just had to delay a colonoscopy because I haven't paid my insurances premium, its struggle out there sometimes hang in there. Ps my local hospital is private and I've used their charitable funds before drastically reducing medical bills to under $100.",

Are you happy with the Breast Center you're currently at? Where do you live? I'd say now is the time to give that some serious thought and research. I was considering adjusting my insurance to go to New York Presbyerians Breast Center which is known for research including being one if the first places to use cold caps for chemotherapy preserving hair..not that that's a top priority but a nice plus. I have read these boards extensively recently and been looking at stats also, they are all so promising. On the boards the overwhelming majority of women seem to be living their lives and doing well, despite it being a tough road at times. I got my results today and they were negative. I am obviously very happy about that. I have to say during my ultrasound the tech was acting like she felt sooo sorry for me, which scared the living day lights out of me. I'd also asked the radiologist \"if it's cancer can you tell what stage it is? I mean it's pretty small\" he said no we can't tell anything until be get biopsy results, no reassurance offered at all. He also said \"just because it's small doesn't mean early stage\". They're not giving any reassurance about anything until that pathology report comes in. I got my result from the Physicisns Assistant at my Breast a Surgeons office over the phone, I knew if it was bad news I felt more comfortable dealing with them, the radiologist just seemed curt and busy. My pathology report says its just normal Breast tissue apparently, but it was referred to as a nodule with indiscriminate margins. The pathology report will tell you exactly what you're dealing with. Unfortunately the wait is excruciating. I took my son to the Central Park Zoo today, I'd just finished watching the sea lion show and was in a happy place when my results call came in. I recommend doing things you enjoy, getting out and about. I ate lots of yummy salad from the salad bar at Wholefoods so I didn't get indigestion then get paranoid something else was wrong with me. Shortly before my breast lump was found I had been to ER with really bad pain in my rib on the same side, my PCP had been testing my heart, pancreas etc. So when I found out about the Breast lump needing to be biopsied you can imagine where my mind went. I also noticed I felt less pain today and my muscles were a lot looser. Don't underestimate the pain anxiety can cause. About a week ago I woke up with my gland under my chin swollen and pain in my jaw so bad... I think it was caused by teeth grinding from stress. Although not knowing the status of my breast lump I began to get very fearful. Thinking good thoughts, make yourself do that and please check in here to let me know how you're getting on. I am your supporter during this horrible waiting period.",

I loved the look of them but now I'm waiting for a biopsy result I regret getting them and wish I'd so only had an uplift without implants. Fat transfer is also a way to augment breasts these days. With implants things can be obscured on ultrasound and you have to have a combo of ultra and MRI, neither one screening method is fool proof though MRI is pretty sensitive. I say give yourself peace of mind and go for fat transfer if possible.",

Now I had an MRI recently, because you have to, to see under implants. They found a \"nodule.. Suspicious abnormality\", it was BIRADS 4 and they did the biopsy and it came back as normal Breast tissue, the radiologist concurred and the Breast surgeon said surgeries can cause changes in Breast tissues that will be picked up on screenings. Also statistically your chances of getting Breast cancer is raised after having breast surgery. However, the basis of that statistic may come from women having excisional biopsies..and risks for Breast cancer is also greater in those who have had previous biopsies. This may not be due to the surgery itself but due to simply being prone to abnormalities. I do not think the link between previous Breast surgery and cancer is significant by the way",

I also read these boards but avoided Google,mtheres a lot of info hear and good energy. Think good thoughts, force yourself to. I had birads 0 on MRI, then onto diagnostic ultrasound, tech looked so concerned... Then failed core biopsy, then fine needle biopsy, it was BIRADS 4 they don't do a b c at my mammography place, results came back benign, normal breast tissue. It was described as a nodule, indiscriminate margins, suspicious abnormality... I've seen women say calcification and have come back benign on these boards I read so many posts on here during that wait period. I was told 2-4 working days for pathology, on the second business day I called them, called them morning of third business day saying how anxious I was and physians assistant called me back later that afternoon to say results were in and they were benign.",

The key as you said is to move forward and rest in the knowledge a gang of very skilled people are getting ready to obliterate this. I'm also very impressed with your plastic surgeon, I've had an breast uplift but was not offered a screening beforehand, your guy sounds very diligent. Kick back this weekend, you have definitely earned it with the stress you've been dealing with, the same to chocomousse, Ddw79 and Katie, I hope you ladies manage to zone out this weekend, turn the worry switch off and enjoy yourselves. I'm hoping for good news for all of you.",

I had the physicians assistant at the Breast clinic call and explain the results before I saw it in writing, Those bloody insurance companies I was told my MRI was preauthorized and now I'm paying over50% of the costs of it. For what its worth the area of concern was also found on a diagnostic ultrasound though I will admit they used the MRI as a reference point.",

I think some of the language used is to enure the process moves forward. Just keep thinking good thoughts, keep doing it, make yourself. The wait is excruciating I know. My biopsy was benign by the way, before the radiologist had no suggestion of what the nodule may be, didnt offer any reassurances, he doesn't speculate he just waits for biopsy they're very careful and that's excellent. My nodule was just regular Breast tissue. I found out on the third business day after biopsy, started calling them on the afternoon of the second business day, as I was told 2-4 business days. I'm sorry you have the stress of an overseas move and military involved. I don't know much about that I'm afraid. I do know that my mom and I had biopsies on our very first baseline mammograms, both were benign.",
