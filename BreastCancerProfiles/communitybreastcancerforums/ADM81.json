    "Content": "ADM81 wrote: New to this forum. 31 years old with BC history on my father's side of the family. Went to my OBGYN with pain in my right breast that has been there for the past year. Not normal monthly pain but sharp pain that I can barely touch without jumping (6 o'clock). He said he thought he felt a cyst and sent me to the local breast center for mammogram and ultrasound. Tech came in and said mammo looked good and during u/s they couldn't find anything either. Not even a cyst. Radiologist confirmed and sent me home, apologizing for not being able to help me with my pain, which he knew was bad due to my flinching when he touched me. The next day I get a call from them asking me to come back in for a repeat u/s, that they initially missed something that is showing up at very edge of mammo film. I went back in and they immediately put the u/s on my \"mass\" (3 o'clock, same breast), which is NOT painful. The radiologist said it looked like a fibroadenoma and based on my young age and that the borders were pretty clear, it was most likely benign. She gave me the three options I have read a lot about (1. Sit, wait, and watch every 6 months; 2. Have biopsy; 3. Have lumpectomy but she said this would be over reacting). I chose the biopsy. This past wed (may 29), I had the biopsy and they were able to take 4 samples (if it matters they were floaters but had a lot of blood in them). I am supposed to go in for results on Monday. In the meantime, I have scheduled an appt with a genetic counselor to see if I qualify for the gene testing. Should I have this done or would it tie their hands as far as screening goes if I test neg? My dad's mom passed away when my dad was very young and they don't remember which female part it started it but they are sure it was a female cancer. Her sister is a breast cancer survivors (in her 90's) and my dad had a spot removed from his breast when he was young. I have also been referred to a breast surgeon to figure out pain and get a second opinion on mass. Of course everything hinges on what the results say on Monday. So many questions with a newly heightened awareness!!! How often are fibroadenomas misdiagnosed (if ever)? Does bloody tissue samples mean anything? I also bled pretty bad during biopsy and had some bleeding a few hours later. Should I do the gene testing if I qualify? Just so much to think about and even if all seems well from my results, I am not sure I can just let go now. I have three girls 4 and under. Thanks in advance to anyone who responds.
