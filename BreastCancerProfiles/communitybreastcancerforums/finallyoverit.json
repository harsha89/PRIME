I was never a huge crier, but I swear, I can cry at the drop of a hat these days. Some days feel pretty normal and others I am crying at everything. Not sure if it's the drugs they have me on or what, but man is that annoying. Please tell me it goes away at some point. It could be that I'm still trying to figure out how to live with a 4-level fusion and full leg neuropathy or that the reality of the diagnosis is finally settling in.

I know you guys get that So, that said, I had my monthly MO appointment today. I swear, he\u2019s become a good friend. He treated me when I was first diagnosed and was just as upset as I was when the crap came back. I was talking to him today about how tired I am, physically and emotionally. And how I feel guilty about feeling blah because I\u2019ve been incredibly lucky and blessed through this whole mess. Anyway, he did his best to comfort me saying that we just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. He told me he had the hospice talk with a 39 year old man with pancreatic cancer last Thursday; he passed away on Saturday. Note to self: suck it up and carry on. Things could be so much worse.

I read an article today that talked about how some cancer centers are doing away with the ceremonial bell ringing at the end of treatment (chemo and/or radiation) as to not to be insensitive to those of us who will never reach that milestone who might be within an earshot To be honest, I\u2019ve never really given it any thought until now. Thankfully, it\u2019s never happened when I\u2019ve been in my cancer center. I think that I would feel happy for that person, but also feel a twinge of jealousy knowing that the only way my treatment will \u201cend\u201d is when I either say enough or I die. I probably shouldn\u2019t have read them, but some of the comments people left were right down cruel. I guess it\u2019s true that you really don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be a stage iv patient until you hear those words and actually live it. I\u2019m really not trying to start a debate, I\u2019m generally curious how others feel about it. Thoughts?
