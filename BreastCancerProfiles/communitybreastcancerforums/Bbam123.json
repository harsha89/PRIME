The discharge has been clear/yellow/orange/rusty then went to pure red blood then back to orange and now is a orangy colour. The doctor at breast clinic alsonsaid i had a split inversion in the nipple where the discharge is coming from. He did a discharge smear test and a ultra sound the US showed nothing at all but we have to wait for pathology on smear test now. He said if it comes back fine he will ring and discharge me if not he will make another appointment to come back in. I'm not happy with the if the smear test comes back fine he will discharge me bit as its not been explained why its coming out in the first place. If the pathology comes back ok am I ok to as for more test to be run to find out what's actually going on? Log in to post a reply",
