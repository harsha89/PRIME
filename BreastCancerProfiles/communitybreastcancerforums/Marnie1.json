Today, I met with my MO for the first time and she has suggested Chemo followed by Radiation to give me the best treatment to beat this.  I have always had long hair and tomorrow will be having it cut short in an attempt to make it easier when I lose my hair... Oh girls I need some tips on how to get thru this before I end up in a straight jacket in a padded room.  Thanks",

(Invasive Ductal Carcinoma)  Ok, I was hopeful.  On 9/3 I had a lumpectomy, my surgeon called a couple days later to tell me that the tumors were bigger than expected one was 1.0 and the order 2.1 and 3 invasive saltilies and 1 node out of 3 had a 4.0mm desposit and the other two were inflammed but no malignancy.  Now I am Stage IIB Grade 1.  At my post-op appt I was told you have an infection as the site area is pink and you are running a low grade fever oh and we didn't get a clear margin so when you get over your infection back to surgery.  I am being scheduled for a Bone Scan and Cat Scan and am a nervous wreck,still waiting on my DX,  reading all your posts have given me hope and I wanted to thank you for starting it.",
