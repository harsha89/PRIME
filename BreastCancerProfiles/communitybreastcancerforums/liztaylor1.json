I don't know why I am suddenly in such a big yank about this - since my positive attitude, over the past few months, has surprised everyone - especially me.

I need to \"intellectualize\" (is this a word?) so I plan ahead.  Did some reading last night about BMX and DIEP.  If I can face what I'm afraid of, then it gets easier to deal with for me. Thanks to you and Jenn, for instance, I now have a better idea of this next \"procedure\" (don't you love these euphemisms?).  My least favorite was \"lumpectomy\".  The operative report said: \"partial mastectomy\" - plus, I am 36A so, when she removed a billiard ball size tumor, that pretty much reduced my breast by a third, at least.  I think I have more anxiety about all of this - the whole enchilada - than I thought. Thanks for listening.  I really appreciate this website.  It's odd though - I started out on this thread (Waiting for Results) back in August.  Then moved around the website = finally ending at Radiation.  Now, I'm back to WFR.  Liz",

We'll see when the results come in Monday or Tuesday. We are having a SB party and I need to get upstairs and start gettring ready. ALL fun people coming over. I can't wait. Liz",

The two things that worry me the most about radiation are: the skin burns (?) and the fatigue.  I've loved reading these boards to prepare myself for the next step. As an aside, I'm 60 yo - had \"suspicious\" cevical cells at my yearly exam in late July plus HPV+.  Culposcopy showed the same thing - precancerous cells.  So, I'm now thinking that I'll get through this rad thing this fall - enjoy the holidays - and then discuss a hysterectomy for the winter time.  It's back to playing golf in the spring!!  By then, I will be CANCER FREE!!

The simulation took about 40 minutes.  I met with the doctor for 15\" or so - to finish asking questions and to sign the consent.  Then, it was on to a room for \"molding\". For this, I just laid on a table with my arm over my head (this was the only hard part...) for 20\" or so.  During this time, the table went in and out of a CAT scan machine.  They put wires or something on my chest to help with \"markings\" (these came off after the process was over).   Then, they put 4 large X's in different places (these are made with a permanent marking pen - that may \"wear off\" on your clothes over time) and, I think, that's where the \"tattoos\" were put.  These tattoos are so tiny - they were like 4 tiny bug bites.  I have a very low pain threshold and found this whole thing to be just fine. Hope this answers a little bit of your questions? My official rads start next Wednesday (9/30).  Looking forward to getting a move on this process. Best, Liz",

I come to this discussion board every day to see how everyone is doing.  No skin changes yet - using a weird combo of the mometasone (or whatever it's called), aquafor, and/or aloe.  Because of the messy lotions/potions, am wearing colorful \"undershirts\" - am putting together some \"interesting\" outfits.  Went to two baby showers for 2 of our kids (last night and this afternoon).  My husband's ex wife looked great - I felt draggy.  BUT, she has worked on some efforts for breast cancer cure/awareness - and was one of the first people to write after my diagnosis.  Funny how something like this (and our shared 18 month old beautiful grand-daughter - we were all together at the baby's birth) brings women together, Am getting tired but I also went back to work 2 weeks ago.

Right now, I come to the office by 9 or so - go for radiation at noon (it's only 5\" away) - come back and work for a few hours then drive home.  They put a nice lazy-boy recliner in my office (staff gave me the coziest comfort on earth).  Frequently hold meetings while in the recliner.  Those meetings almost seem like \"therapy\" for all of us.  It's one of the nice things that has happened in this journey.

I just don't feel very good.  Did a social thing on Saturday eve and church on Sunday.  That was about it for activities.  This fatigue is something else.  I drive 2 hours r/t to work every day - go for rad (5\" from my office) at  noon - eat lunch in my car.  Plus, these hot flashes.... I read your notes everyday but haven't had the energy to add a note.  My cardiac results were \"normal\".  Will have a hysterectomy on December 22 (so I can recover over the holidays).  My surgeon uses the \"daVinci robot\" which cuts down on  pain and time off from work. Right now, I feel like I've been hit by a truck. Thank you for sharing your experiences.  I read what you write every day. Love, Liz",

Pauldingmom: we are here for you and will be thinking about you tomorrow!! I went back to work today.  Since I'm the \"boss\" (LOL) I can rest when I need to.  The problem is that everyone wanted time with me today and I had to leave for rads at noon.   In some ways my job is nice and distracting from the rest of this.  I read these posts as often as I can and you are all in my thoughts. BRING IT ON!! Liz",

I drink water constantly. Suzanne, it was a cat - my car is fine but it really stressed me out. The rest of the day was tough, too.   With my job, I have to provide \"stability\" for a lot of folks.  It's hard sometimes... My breast looks a bit better now (with the silvadene doing its magic). I still prayed, today, for all of the patients who lay on that hard table -and for the staff who take care of them. What a journey we are on. Love, Liz",

Told my DIL today that I am going to be crabby for awhile.  I've earned it. Liz",

Finally, started to ring the bell as soon as I got up this morning.  Walked up to the check in desk, ringing the bell.  Then, proceeded to the patient/family area - ringing the bell for THEM (smile).  Next, changed into the blue gown, went to the patient waiting area (in our place, a fairly dismal room) - about 5 folks in there.  RANG the bell. One woman (hadn't see her before) said it was HER last day, too, and SHE wanted to ring the bell.  She did and then we knuckled bumped! So, I thought, what the heck.  I hung the bell (which was on a rope) on the bulletin board.  Asked the other patients to promise that they will ring on THEIR last days, too.  They promised. My boob is dark red but it'll heal.  When I was on the table today, I finally cried - hard.  This is the first time I've cried since the diagnosis on 8/24.  It was bound to happen and I feel a lot better. My very best to you all.  We are on this journey, each of us alone, but yet together. Love, Liz",
