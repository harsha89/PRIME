It is good to hear ideas and options that  I may have not thought of.  I will definitely start asking a heck of a lot more questions, that is for sure. Yes, she has talked about reconstruction at the same time, but I am definitely going to ask about a MRI. It is such a hard decision to make - mas vs lump, and I think I need to take some time to let it all sink in before I make that decision. I do thank you for your thoughts.. I am definitely going to meet with my surgeon on Friday with a list of questions...wheww... its nice to feel like someone cares and especially someone who knows what is happening .  Its like a whirlwind of emotions - up and down, and incredibly exhausting!",

I dont even know how long I will be out of commission - I need to tell my boss some kind of time frame. can anyone help me? Like I said, it is all happening so fast..

I live in Alaska, and in the city I live in, she is the only surgeon. She has given me a choice of Masectomy or Lumpectomy, but I am leaning towards the masectomy. She says she will not know until the results of the boipsy on whether I will need chemo or not. It is such a new world for me since none of my family has gone through this before. Should I wait? I also have the option of travelling to seattle for the surgery, etc,.. but am reluctant to leave my incredible support group. I just feel like I dont know what questions to ask, what I should expect, etc.  I do appreciate any advice you can give me.",
