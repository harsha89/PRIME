At that time, I had a faint red line (it did disappear over a month or so) in area that is now fully  inflamed . This inflammation is new. Hard not to get concerned and think that this means disease progression. I do see my gyny doc tomorrow for my annual exam and will absolutely have her take a look at it.  Just thought someone might have had experience with this and ... you know... tell me that it is a benign inconvenience.",

It is tough enough to deal with this when one has confidence in care providers but majorly anxiety-provoking when one cannot trust them.  You have a host of knowledgeable survivors here offering good advice.  Hope you can find a good advocate as 'Bernicky' suggested to ease some of the concerns. Eight months ago when I got this DX, fearing I was going to die in a number of weeks was very real for me. Today, I plan to live long and die of something else.  Best of luck for next week. ",
