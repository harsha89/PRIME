    "Content": "sophie23 wrote: Hey all! I posted here a couple months back with concerns about my right breast.. The nipple was purple and irritated. Well, since then, I've developed some scary new symptoms: Nipple pain (feels like someone is flicking my nipple, ouch), and a sensation throughout my entire breast I can only describe as 'millions of tiny hot needles poking my skin' constantly. It feels as if I have a skin rash on my breast, but I don't! I've been terrified I have cancer (still am), and those fears were multiplied by 10,000 when I noticed some discharge from my right nipple last weekend. I pinched and prodded my left breast, hoping something would come out of it too, but nope, nothing. My left breast is perfectly healthy. I called a gynecologist on Monday (who thankfully agreed to see me without insurance), but the soonest she could schedule an appointment was February 3rd. The next morning, I woke up with a huge brown stain in my bra, right under the nipple that's been giving me problems.. I called the gynecologist's office in tears, and they saw me yesterday. Naturally, there was no discharge when the Dr. examined me. She said my breasts looked/felt normal, but sent me for an ultrasound anyway based on the symptoms I described. Today I called about the results since I hadn't heard anything, and all I was told is I have a fibrocystic adenoma in my right breast. She couldn't give me any more information than that and said I'd just have to wait and see if the Dr. thought I needed a follow-up appointment. I'm a little confused. I know fibrocystic breasts aren't uncommon in women my age, but is it possible a fibrocystic adenoma could be causing the symptoms I've been experiencing? I've been struggling with this for nearly four months now. I'm depressed and exhausted living every day thinking I might be seriously sick and unable to get the help I need. I'm just so scared this adenoma is totally unrelated to my symptoms and the ultrasound picking it up means nothing. I want it to be something simple like this, and not cancer. I know cancer is rare at 24, but it sure isn't impossible. Sorry for the length of this post, but if anyone has had any experience with this or could offer some insight, I'd really appreciate it! I was also wondering if there are any questions I should ask? if the Dr. doesn't think the adenoma is anything serious, should I push her and say I want a biopsy just for piece of mind? Gosh, I never thought these would be things I'd be worrying about. Thank you in advance for reading and replying! Log in to post a reply",
