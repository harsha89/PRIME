    "Content": "daisybeth13 wrote: History - 44, blood/bone marrow disorder, family history of BC (mother, grandmother) Last year I had repeat mammograms and an ultrasound for an area of 'increasing density' on the scans.Â  The doctor said it was a cyst, not to worry and sent me on my way. Now, ten months later the lump/cyst/whatever is still there and there is now a smaller one next to it. For the last two weeks that area has been itchy, itchy, itchy. I initally assumed it was the weather since it is so cold and dry here. But my gut is saying there is something different going on. My breast just feels...odd for lack of a better description. I called to schedule a mammogram and the earliest I can be seen is March. I am scheduled to see my blood doctor who is also an oncologist in mid-February.Should I push for an earlier appointment or just wait and see her? I am scared to death and trying to convince myself that I am just making a mountain out of a molehill. Log in to post a reply",
