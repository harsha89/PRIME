Second chemo tomorrow (TC).   ami",

I get a second opinion next week, after surgery...  30 years of  survival is wondeful.",

Axillary removal scheduled for Wednesday. OncotypeDX test failed because there wasn't enough invasive material to test in the sample (that one really threw me). Onocologist wants 3rd gen chemo, which I think is the most aggressive.  I'm 47, excellent health (all vitals strong, good weight, active/exercising).  No BC in family but mom died of ovarian cancer (makes me worry about the Tamoxifen).  Surgeon said lumpectomy/rads probably sufficient -until that little bugger showed up in the lymph node.  I'm thinking of the other nodes are clean no chemo.  Thoughts?",
