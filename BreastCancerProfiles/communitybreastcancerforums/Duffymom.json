When I was 1st diagnosed stage IV everyone did treat me differently, esp my husband.  He's never been a romantic, more sarcasm. Then he'd look at me with puppy dog eyes and treating me differently.  As time has gone on, and things are going ok, things are more back to normal. But I've been stage IV for a year now so everyone has gotten used to it.  My kids don't even ask me how chemo went anymore!  I've learned that some friends can't take any bad news and I have 1 good friend that I can say anything to and she won't freak out or try to talk me out of what I'm saying - that's important. I look forward to reading more of your posts - I'm enjoying them! Kathy",

Had a bad allergic reaction and dr was going to switch me to Ixempra.  We're both frustrated by that since it's been working to keep the cancer from progressing and I have minimal SE.  After reading many posts on this site, I convinced her to let me try one more time getting add'l steroids, benadryl and running the infusion as slow as they can - going from 3 hr treatment to 6 hr.  I was supposed to do this yesterday but platelet count said \"no go\" so I'll try again next week.  I'm hoping this will work, but if it doesn't I'll have to switch in Oct.  I'm having a liver MRI tomorrow (thurs) because all my scans have shown \"inhomogenous\" appearance of my liver and she wants to get more info about it. My markers have been hovering around 59.  Back to working 3 days a week (preschool teacher).  It's a great distraction and makes part of my life feel \"normal\".  Also taking advantage of feeling good by going to the beach mid Oct.  Hugs to all you lovely ladies! - Kathy",
