My DH helped by bathing me while I held a towel to my chest to protect my breast and drain incisions. Rather than renting from a medical supply store, my solution was to buy a cheap-ass, plastic, folding footstool from Bed Bath & Beyond. But that was me. I second the advice to ask your surgeon and follow his/her instructions. TT",

My suggestion on where to start is pubmed.gov, a searchable database of articles from medical journals. You often get only the summary, but a good library (university, especially) can help you find full articles. Sometimes the summary is enough since it usually includes some type of conclusion.  You never know how you'll react to a regimen. There's always a chance you won't find that the side effects are twice as bad. I do think it helps to be prepared for the worst, though. Stock up on Ativan, Ambien, Percoset, and whatever else will take you into never-neverland. Narcotics are a chemo girl's best friend. TT",

And I've reached a point where I hate them. Somewhere along the line I got labeled a troublesome patient, I think. I wish I knew what in particular I did, but I did something because the staff's attitude has changed from helpful to hostile. Now whenever I go to the office -- which is quite often since I'm on a weekly infusion schedule -- I face a dismissive attitude during my pre-treatment check-up. The latest fiasco came today when I reported my rising level of joint and muscle pain from Abraxane. Evidently Abraxane doesn't cause muscle pain, the nurse informed me, because \"we don't see that side effect in this office.\" I am proud that I didn't scream at her, \"So you're saying that the manufacturer is a big fat liar because it's listed as a side effect in its literature.\" Then she wrapped up with a little ditty about how I should keep reporting these small little things rather than diagnosing myself. I've started a Charm Offensive on the staff to try to turn this around. Weekly baked goods and a relentlessly polite and positive attitude are my weapons of choice. But what I really want to do is stab them repeatedly with an IV needle until they GET IT!

But he and his staff don't have the patience or the interest to address my swelling and pain issues because they're \"not typical.\" I've been extremely angry and frustrated with that office for weeks, but felt trapped since I didn't want to switch in the middle of treatment. But now I'm thinking outside the box and no longer trapped. Made an appointment today and feel tons better. Thank you all for sharing your collective wisdom. TT",
