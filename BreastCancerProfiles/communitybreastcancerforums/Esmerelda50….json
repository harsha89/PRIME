I will be starting June 18 after I take a trip to see family and friends in Illinois. I had the double masectomy recon 3 weeks ago, so I am doing it the opposite way. I had breast cancer 10 years ago. Had a lumpectomy, A,C,T and H and radiation. This is the same side but a new case, triple negative. He thinks we can do without the port since it is only 4 times. Hope those nurses have some skills. Thanks for starting this thread zzlady, and look forward to meeting more June chemo sisters.",

Bilateral masectomy with immediate recon. Had my first chemo (TC) June 19. The surgery recovery went amazingly smooth. The worst SE so far from the chemo was the bone pain and headaches but that only lasted a few days. This isn't my first rodeo. Had lumpectomy, chemo and rads. 10 years ago. Oncologist says it is new case but it was same side. Sorry to hear so many are having such a hard time with SE. Great that we have each other for support.",

Add those to the long list of weird SE. I hate that others are having the same problems but it helps to know I'm not losing my mind and am not alone in this lonely journey. One more treatment on Wednesday. I have found that the Claritin really helps with the bone pain, which I would not have known if not for these boards. I will try magnesium. I, too, really hate being bald. It is very hot where I live in the Mojave desert, so anything on my head is too hot, but I do wear a scarf or hat when I go out. Then I still have these sores on my head, not as bad as they were, but they haven't totally gone away. The chemo nurse has been there 20 years and said we never see that. Sometimes I think they do play dumb. Well since I have double chemo brain, I can't remember names very well, but you all are in my thoughts and prayers, and I'm so thankful for everyone's support. Hope you all have a great day.",
