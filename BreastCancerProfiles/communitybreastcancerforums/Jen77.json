So I'm hoping the radiologist is on hand & I can know SOMETHING tomorrow. Does it hurt?? And if they decide I need biopsy, will that likely be scheduled or would that happen tomorrow too? I was so ready for tomorrow to come & now I'm terrified.",

She measured and marked off what she could feel. She figured it to be 6.5 X 4 cm. It's not exactly round. It doesn't seem to have smooth edges & it's pretty hard. See got me an appointment at a breast center for this coming Thursday, where I'll have a mammogram, ultrasound & possibly a biopsy. I made the mistake of going straight Google. Needless to say, I am losing it! I can't eat, I can't sleep. I haven't been on Google much since I found this group. I feel like I've read every post here, and I feel a little better, yet still terrified. I know you can't diagnose me, but what are your thoughts? Is it possible for a cyst to get that big? Or a fibroadeoma? If it does happen to be cancer....is it bad that it's so big?? I know that cysts like to pop up around the time of your period....I wasn't suppose to have mine for 5 more days, but it started early yesterday. Now my breasts are swollen & it's a little harder to feel the lump, because there's swollen tissue above it, but it's still there, unchanged. This makes me think it's not a cyst. Prior to finding the lump, I had shooting pains & the feeling of milk coming in from time to time, but I just dismissed it. 2 weeks before I found the lump, I noticed that that breast felt bigger than the other. It kept falling out of my bra, which has never been a problem, since I barely have C cups & they aren't very full. Last year I was diagnosed with Hypersomnia, meaning that I can sleep ALL THE TIME, but never feel rested. Always exhausted. So now I'm thinking, maybe I had cancer?! UGH! I've almost come to terms with the fact that it is cancer. I kind of almost FEEL it is. Only family history of BC is my 2nd cousin. Grandpa had lung cancer. Great grandma had cancer all over but somehow it all disappeared and she lived until 88. I had precancerous cells on my cervix & had those removed 9 years ago. I don't know of any medical history from my dad's side, never met them. I feel like I'm going to have a stroke by Thursday!! I told my husband, I would rather find out I have it, than sit here in the dark. Is that crazy? After Thursday, how much longer will I have to wait to get definitive answers?? Sorry for the rant, I just needed to get it out. Thank you Log in to post a reply",
