      "Content": "KLF728 wrote: I just had surgery Tuesday for the removal of a lymph node in my neck (PET scan showed it as suspicious). I now have numbness between my neck and chest from the center of my body to the left calvical. Has anyone else had this type of surgery?? What about any numbness? I've had a bilateral mastectomy, so I know about nerve damage. I suspect this is what I've got, but was curious if anyone else has gone through this. If all goes well, I'll find the biopsy results on Monday. I'm hoping for an infection! Log in to post a reply",
