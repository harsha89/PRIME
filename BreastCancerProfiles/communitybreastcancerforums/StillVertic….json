It is the first one they throw at you and I was given a ton of misinformation by my onc and given no other choices. He kept telling me I'd get the treatment on thursday and be at work on Monday. NOT. I had a delayed allergic reaction to the Taxotere and it damned near killed me (for real). It was like someone had dropped me at ground zero at Hiroshima. My hair instanlty fell out (a percentage of women remain bald forever and there is a website dedicated to the problems with the use of Taxotere.) Read it. I am 8 months out and barely have any hair. My skin began to literally melt off of my body, I had blisters all in my mouth and down my throat for several months and could not eat or tolerate food.i threw everything up.; my nails turned black and fell out and I have never in my life been so ill and felt so close to or wanting to die. I am still suffering major after effects. Taxotere blew out my thyroid; and damaged my heart and lungs. I became anemic: had no Vitamin D; and now need regular B-12 injections. The Taxotere destroyed my veins and literally, if a team needs a vein they cannot get one on my NON-BC arm without doing major backflips.I cannot go out in the sun at all (I live on the beach) with out getting sun poisening (Like in 15 minutes of exposure) and cannot tolerate heat of any kind. I have lost all of my beach activities like surf fishing or just walking the dogs on the beach in the daytime. My gums are now receding and my perfect teeth are cracking. mentally, i was profoundly affected-like ihad a major head trauma-my psych meds have stopped working and i may need togointo hospital to get stabilized (again this is 8 months out). I was in a \"chemo coma\" for months and could not do anything for myself. My Onc was so freaked out (saying he had never seen a response like mine) that he basically dropped me. He said he did not know what to do with me and that 'we' would have to wait until the drug got out of my system. I fired him immediately and went for second opinion at Chapel Hill. The BC ONC who saw me was stunned and outraged. He said he had seen such severe reactions but only in people who had a ton of treatments of CT due to very advance cancer. The opinion from three docs now is that i will never be able to safely take chemo again or to do radiation. My body is too fried from the Taxotere. I must stress, my case is unusual and apparently not the norm, but man if it happens, you DO NOT want it happening to you! It is the gift that keeps on giving. most allergic reactions happen right when they administer the first dose of CT. Mine did not. I functioned for about four days feeling pretty awful, then I exploded. I had a \"minor heart attack\" after (never had heart problems) and now my BP will not stabilize. My heart doc say he just put in a pacemaker for a woman who heart was destroyed by Taxotere. I have to drink gallons of water and gatorade a day bec i dehydrate so quickly. During the first few months following, I was so ill, I was ambulanced to the ER probably three times a week-no exageration. You can read all of my early posts on this thread from when I had the CT combo in January. Had I known, i would never have done it. imean I would NEVER have done a CT combo. The treatment is worse than the cancer for me. My first ONC failed to research that I was taking two drugs that I have to take that inhibited my body's ability to process the drug out so it ricocheted around in my body destroying everything. I now have major gastric problems and there are many foods i simply cannot eat without vomiting. I just simply have not been able to recover from the Taxotere. Again, AND I STRESS, my case is unusual and the probably among the WORST of what can happen from CT. What was worse was that when things went south for me, (meaning i personally didn't fit the \"gold standard CT treatment model) the onc dumped me and i cannot get another onc bec I am told I am a walking lawsuit. So I suffered thru this alone and would have given up without the support of the women on this Board. Educate yourself and get a second opinion on ALL treatment options available to you. There are different chemo cocktails that are much less drastic. And some oncs tell patients to save the big guns for last if possible. But do pull up the \"Taxotere\" website and read about the experiences of other women who had it as bad as I did. Also read posts from women who got thru it OK. To balance it out, many women had a lot of trouble but nowhere near the extent that I had it. Bec of the damage done, I am barred from taking any more chemo so if my cancer returns, the only things they are offering me is surgery. This is the toughest decision you will make and you are in control of your treatment. If you have an advocate like a supporting sister to help, use her to research! I know you are scared but educate yourself and get another opinion about chemo options and the REALITY of using Taxotere. My opinion, This is a cookie cutter treatment and they make a ton of money off of it so I have to wonder about the efficacy of resorting to the use of Taxotere. Blessings and good luck in your choices-remember, you have control over your cancer treatment-i know it is hard to believe. I now have a full treatment team from Chapel Hill and it includes a nurse oncologist and an oncology psychiatrist. It is a dream team and I SO wish I had them before I trusted one man and jumped into the TC treatment. ((((Biggest Hugs and prayers)))) SV",

It takes time and a lot of support: sharing of grief and anger and fear. And personally, I am on anti-depressants. The chemo did much brain damage and i just could not get out of the dumps myself. It is great to have cyber sisters but face to face group therapy really helped me a lot. I am not a pink ribbon waver and I think the entire vocabularly around cancer should be changed. As far as i am concerned, there is no \"brave and courageous battle' against cancer. Yeah, there are things I can do to focus on the quality of my life one day at a time. It is a year after my diagnosis and surgery and I am still in shock and simply don't know how to create a future for myself because the big C is always looming in the back of my mind. My best quality days are days when I can get out and do wildlife shoots. I am a wildlife photographer and there is something about that quiet connection with nature. And bone mets is NOT a death sentence. Many friends are living daily and living a good life and have for years with bone mets. Find your laughter and your serenity!! Hope will follow but again, it takes time and you are so very young. For me, My Mom passed away; my Dad had a stroke two weeks later and another two weeks later I was hit with a BC diagnosis out of the blue-routine CT was done to check my asthma status and they found the tumor and I suddenly felt like I had lost my life-and in a sense i did-it has all gone to doctors and treatment in the past year and it just s#cks.

You have a right to be afraid and to cry all you want too. The diagnosis of BC is truly overwhelming-let alone the CURES for it. Try to get out and walk, journal, vent here on the Board and let us know ASAP how all goes. I am reading that things are moving very fast for you and they did for me too. It was awful as the diagnosis of cancer is life changing and there is no time to adjust to anything before being slammed into surgery and having your body rearranged. Everything happened so quickly for me, i felt I had no time to 'process' anything that was happening to me. I felt so helpless. But we are here for you and this too will pass-easy to write I know. I am 9 months out of a lumpectomy and now looking at a double mastectomy. Really use your treatment team to get all of your needs met including sleep!! I have gone back into therapy to deal with the issues. We are all scared but I promise that it will get better. i will be praying for you on Thursday.

This seems to be par for the course but does not mean it is acceptable. you have to be comfortable with your doc and your treatment plan. Surgeons, Oncs and each specialty has a different view or seems too. you have a right to a second opinion and a third if needed. Sometimes the top docs are not the best ones for you-they may be excellent at what they do but they have no people skills. Problem is that, depending on where you live, it is hard to get immediate appointments. Lookon the BC.org board and I think there is a list of questions to ask (preplanned). i take a tape recorder in with me to every visit. Can you insist on meeting with your BS regardless of his time schedule or with one of his partners, like yesterday-especially now that you have report on tumor. you have an established relationship with him and tell him of your concerns about your meeting with him. See if he is willing to treat you like a human being. Do you have any friends who have gone thru something similar who can fill you in or go with you to the visit and/or give you a referral to another doc for another opinion. The squeaky wheel gets the grease and you have a right to demand the kind of care you feel comfortable with and to select the appropriate treatment and treatment team for you. I know for me, my choices were final and in many areas now (five months out of surgery and chemo) , i am not getting a second chance. i wish I knew then what i know now-I reacted out of panic and made choice I now regret bec i did not take my time and I felt directed by BS and oncs that i did not even know. like the first time I meet you and i am telling you to take off my breasts? . though many friends guided me thru the process because they had been there.in the end, you have to be absolutley comfortable with your treatment team and understand your treatment plan including all of the longterm consequences. honestly, i now know that I felt bullied by my BS into making quick decisions that I now know really 'fit his schedule' and did not meet my needs or fit my schedule. Is there a BC outreach program in your area that can help you. We have a wonderful one with an MSW who knows everything and i SO wish i had sought her out before I had surgery and treatment. after meeting with her I finally grasped that I truly did not understand what was going on because I was so panicked and i did things and made choices because 'that was what the docs wanted.'  They are the specialists and in the big picture they likely will not steer you wrong (i assume) but these are ging to be the most difficult choices you will make.They were for me (and all i wanted was the cancer out of me as fast as possible) and i made some critical choices on the fly. i am not sure I am helping but i find this the most difficult thing I have ever done and someof the choices i have made cannot be changed. If i had taken the time, i would have made radically different choices knowing what i know now.

AS i reread (just my thoughts) the anger, rage, rant is not about each other. And this is just my opinion-it is about getting some control (any control) of lives that have spun out of control because of a cancer diagnosis. i know that for me, i have had NO choices since October, when I first heard the diagnosis. Before that, I was a strong independant woman with my own business and after one chemo, I cannot do a thing!!! i (hating every minute of it) have had to rely on a bunch of men to tell me what to do to (not cure!!!!) but to cut cancer out of my body (my breasts yet) and then how to maybe keep it in remission for five years. SORRY I HAD ANOTHER LIFE PLANNED!! . AND, none of them seemed to have the magic bullet nor do they agree on treatments. AND THESE ARE THE EXPERTS WHO I HAVE TO RELY ON???!!!! When I am boiling, it is never about the Board or what is on it. I have no power or control over what anyone says-it is always about me and where I am with my feelings and emotions. For me, i am so GD angry that I got this disease that I am blind with rage and fear. i don't know what to do. The first people who get the \"cannon across the bow\" are the people I love most. And again, it is never about them-it is about me and my attitudes. AND THAT IS THE ONLY THING I CAN CHANGE-ME AND MY ATTITUDE. Just for me, if I feel hurt or upset by what someone has said, I have to look at: 1) why have I given my power away to someone; 2) what 'internal button' was pushed that I need to look at; 3) how can i use this as a lesson to learn more about myself and about what sets me off. Often it is an old childhood experience that I believe has become a reality for me as an adult-I need to challenge that idea. I need to \"rescupt\"my emotions to replant the best garden (routing out the weeds) I can for the cancer to stay in remission. We are all doing the best that we can with a disease that-bottom line-is either zero percent (no cancer) or 100% (cancer). My feelings do not sort thru the logic of my brain which says OK, I only have Stage 2a cancer. I am just as frightened and over the top about it all. And OMG, now I am lecturing-so sorry gals!! TO ALL OF MY SISTA'S \"HAPPY VALENTINES DAY\" and thank you for being the beautiful women that you are!! SV",

We all have tremendous storied under our BC that are profoundly heartbreaking. I came out of retirement as a hospice caregiver to care for my dying MOM as no one in the family trusted anyone else to do it. i chose to do it (partially as a full amends to my lovely Mother-opps crying again) but after a year of her being very ill and four months of her dying and the three week that we put her on hospice (i was her clinical caregiver throughout) she finally passed (not peacefully) with my Dad and me holding her-still crying). Mom and Dad were married for 60 years and she is the love of his life and mine. I did not have time to do anything because Dad had a stroke after she died and immediately after, I was diagnosed with BC. It is like, how bad can it be!!! We are tough and there is no need to feel like we are walking on eggshells or being stressed. If someone feels I have yelled at them, please PM me!!!!!

I even dream of my life precancer, it was and remains so devestating. i have decided not to do the mastectomy-if and WHEN the cancer comes back, I am focusing on getting some quality days under my belt and living life to the fullest. yes, I have a lot of very dark days but once in a while, God throws me a miracle day and gives me a new pair of glasses. And i had NO factors for BC-it was a complete surprise. It has been a terrible year-i was the hospice caregiver for my Mom who passed after six very difficult months, then my Dad had a stroke, then i was diagnosed with cancer. So i am pinging the PTSD chart! Truly i need to get my ass to a trauma unit like at Sheppard Pratt to process all of this crap-I have so much grief going on and psych meds are not helping much. Trying to make the decision to take a mental health break but the ocean sailing season is just starting and I sailed my first race yesterday and for the first time in 9 months, I transcended cancer and all of the stuff that goes with it. And wow, did ever feel good. I REALLY want to win a race!! (((BIG hugs to all))) SV",

Even when I had hair-I had the 'wash and wear cut.' TLC by the ACS has some great ideas. i am not a scarf person and my favorite 'hang out-keep my head warm hat\" is a funky felt hat that is too big for my head-but so comfy!!! Even to sleep in!  When my hair started to fall out, I grabbed the dog clippers and shaved it off. I had no idea how cold my head would get and how bothersome that would be! Even when I go to bed, my head is freezing without my felt hat. I did buy some 'dress up hats' to wear to church, etc but they have to be comfortable. I was not a hat wearer before this. I tried wigs but they gave me the worst headaches! And it did not feel like me. I am going bald headed just about everywhere and I am comfortable with that. AND A PAIR OF HUGE EARRINGS! SV",

      "Content": "Feb 14, 2010 10:35AM - edited Feb 14, 2010 10:44AM by StillVerticle Pardon me for differing! There is a difference between a rant and simply being mean and unkind because one has nowhere else (nor other tools) to vent. This is a public forum and the rules of etiquette are not always known, particularly by those with \"chemo brain\" or those new and just plain frightened and it is enuf just for them to get one word on the board. I can tell you that having read this thread and with only a partial idea of what is going on-because noone has explained the history of why everyone seems so upset, if I were new, I would be terrified to ask for help from ya'll. Again someone may have may a tremendous faux paus that i am not aware of (clearly it appears so). Any support group is not a \"hot bed of sanity\"-we are just human. Motto: speak your words sweetly, you may have to eat them. That includes me as I continue in my journey on this board. Perhaps in four years, (when I am not terrified of living with cancer every single day of my life)  I will have a different view, don't know. Having been in recovery for 21 years, tolerance of others is always the code. We never know what is holding other people together and it is important for me to help newcomers in leading by (I hope) the best example possible. Even when I choose to rant on the board. AND there are always PM's to rant too. I have to wonder about those who want to splatter their stuff all over the page \"just because.\" I am new to the board compared to others and I know I breached many etiquettes-thank God for the women who tolerated me and gave me gentle guidance in PM messages, etc. Written with love and great respect to all of the women warriors on this site and everywhere who are struggling with this horrid disease.

In my state it is illegal to put any medical diagnosis or linkage in any work performance report or ANYTHING related to work. This is a CYA tactic being done by the company you work for in preperation for future potential trouble. Fight like mad to get that out of your report-i believe your medical information to be protected as private by federal law. SV",
