Background: I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2007, but it only presented in the lymph nodes in my left armpit (occult breast cancer). I had 25 lymph nodes removed during surgery. For four years, I have had no problems with lymphedema. But in the last year, I've noticed lymphedema in my left arm. The swelling is still relatively minimal, but I want to understand my options for treatment now before it gets worse. I have been to see a lymphedema therapist twice. I'm 44, thin, physically fit and active, and eat healthy.  The therapist recommended manual lymph drainage and a Tubigrip sleeve. Here are my questions:  - Once you start experiencing lymphedema, can you expect to always have some degree of lymphedema (even after taking all precautionary measures, exercising, and wearing a tubigrip or compression sleeve)? Or is it possible to eliminate lymphedema entirely from the limb (and if lymphedema persists, you're not doing enough)? - I've seen references to wrapping throughout this forum. My therapist did not talk to me about wrapping. Is wrapping general recommended for people are experiencing more advanced lymphedema? - I've noticed that my hand is pretty swollen in the morning, which makes sense since I'm wearing a sleeve that doesn't completely cover the hand. Is there a complete sleeve that includes a glove? Or do you have to get a separate glove to accompany the sleeve (for example, I've seen a reference to Isotoner Full Finger Therapeutic gloves)? - Can you recommend an alternative to Tubigrip? Tubigrip gets grubby pretty quickly. Love this website and forum! Thanks for in advance for any tips and responses!  Michelle  Log in to post a reply",
