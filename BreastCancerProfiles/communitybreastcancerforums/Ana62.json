The lump in my breast is a lump of fat ( Thank GOD) and the growth on the rib is calcified cartilage ( again thank GOD). The doctor said that apart from fibrocystic breasts I do not have any growths of concern. I am numb with relief. They still want to do the CT Scan but with this news it does not scare me so much. Thank you all my cyber friends for replying to me earlier and taking away the \"aloneness\". Thank you and God bless. Ana Log in to post a reply",
