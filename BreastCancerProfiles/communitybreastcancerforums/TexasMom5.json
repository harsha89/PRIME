He told me to drink lots of water before each infusion. I will have 24 weeks of chemo. The thought of IV drugs in my arm for that long seemed more painful than a port. I guess we will see how it goes. I start on December 15.",

No port for right now. We will see how it goes. I am nervous, and while trying to be strong and in control on the outside, having a mini pity party on the inside. Don't want to be sick for Christmas. Reading all the posts here is really helpful! It's nice to know I am not alone. Thank you all for sharing your stories!",

I went to work for the entire day today and got a lot done. I may hit a wall tomorrow, but so far, so good. The worst thing this week was getting a port put in. It was too sore to use for first infusion, but next week we will use it. I am cautiously optimistic about this whole chemo thing. Maybe the anxiety of waiting for it, for me, is worse than the actual event?!",
