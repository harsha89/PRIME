      "Content": "mle78 wrote: Just found out on Tuesday that my biopsy results were positive for IDC with an additional area of what is likely DCIS. I also just found out this morning that it's ER+/PR- HER2+. The mass on mammogram was 2.3 cm and had microcalcifications in it as well as in another area of the breast. I'm only 35 so my nurse navigator warned me this morning that they'll be very aggressive with their treatment recommendations. I have an MRI tomorrow morning so my hope is that they don't see anything else suspicious on that. I meet with a breast surgeon and genetics on Tuesday and they're working on an appointment with medical oncology. I also had an suspicious looking lymph node on the US and mammogram that came back negative on FNA but the radiologist said that was discordant with the images. We haven't told our kids anything yet. We have twin girls who are 6 1/2 years old. We are waiting to find out more about a treatment plan. I haven't been super emotional about everything yet. My US and mammogram results were a Birads 5, so we were expecting the diagnosis. I've been on the boards since the imaging and reading about others experiences has already been helpful.

The procedure itself wasn't too uncomfortable but now I'm starting to feel a little sore. There was a pathologist present for the fine needle aspiration of the smaller spot to make sure they got good enough samples and he said it was definitely a lymph node. Not really sure what that means as of now without more specifics. Hope everyone else is doing ok.",

Unfortunately, mine is IDC with an additional area that's likely DCIS. Still don't have final results about ER/PR/HER2 status or staging. I have an MRI Friday and I'm hoping they don't find anything else suspicious. I meet with the breast surgeon Tuesday and hope to get started with treatment soon, so I can start kicking this cancer to the curb.",

I also ended up having a mammogram as I'm 35 and had never had one. The radiologist came in and said both showed that the lump was suspicious and there was a second smaller mass toward my armpit (close to the first one). He said he would categorize it as Birads 5. I don't have the final read yet. They scheduled a core biopsy for the larger mass and a fine needle aspiration for the smaller as well as an MRI and a surgical consult. So, just wanted you to know that you're not alone.",
