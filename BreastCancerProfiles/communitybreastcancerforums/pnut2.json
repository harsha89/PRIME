(oh wait, i don't have any hair) that fell out again when i started my ac. my chemo nurse (bless her heart) has to cover up the ac with tape so i dont have to look at the color. i was told by my surgeon today, that my healing from my mastectomy will take a while due to me being on  ac. kudos rocktobermom for suggesting on bringing the ipod. last week when i went for treatment, there was a real annoying woman sitting next to me telling her dear father who was getting a treatment of all the people who died of cancer because chemo didn't help. i had to blast the ipod so i wouldnt hear her running of at the jawls.i think the look i gave her after awhile shut her up. please god don't let me see her next week. anyway, i have told all my friends and family what \"I\" would like for thanksgiving. the reason;  on march 21 i lost my appetite due to treatments and medicines and surgeries. i am going to enjoy all my favorite foods then hit the treatment trail again with radiation. after all of this, i am the happiest person in the world. i have been blessed with a new outlook on life. i am more confident and outspoken. i dont take \"crap\" from anyone anymore. but for the first time i love myself %100. amazes me that it took cancer to find out how special i was, and how loved and adored i was by others. ",
