I was 12 (I'm 25 now) when I found a lump in my left breast that turned out to be a fibroadenoma and a bunch of cysts. I barely had breasts at this point, but they were already an issue. This diagnosis involved having about half a dozen (if not more, probably not but at the time it felt like it) people poke and prod at my developing body, reassure me it was probably nothing, but passed me onto the next doctor with concern. It was a scary day. I feel like having all that happen at such a young and vulnerable time has had a lasting effect on me. Anyone else feel that way or have similar experiences?
