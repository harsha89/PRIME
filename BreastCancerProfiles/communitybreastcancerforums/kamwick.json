    "Content": "Aug 24, 2009 07:41PM - edited Aug 24, 2009 07:48PM by kamwick just had my second small surgery (re-excision) for DCIS (considered stage 0, intermediate grade), margins completely free, yea!!!!  My oncologist told me that clear margins and radiation would decrease my recurrence risk to 10%.  Adding tamoxifen would only add a 1% benefit in risk reduction (to 9%).  Even though I am estrogen and progestin positive, she didn't think the benefits outweighed the risk.   Neither do I, especially since my liver chemistry is slightly elevated (although liver ultrasound is normal).  I had been on birth control pills for a bazillion years prior to diagnosis, so I wonder if that facilitated the cancer.  I just don't think the side effect risks of Tamoxifen and other aromatase inhibitors are worth the meager benefit for me, but of course that's just my personal opinion. I'm also not so sure of the wisdom of having tamoxifen alone after surgery (mentioned previously).  Maybe a good idea for those who can't have Rtx for whatever reason. Good luck and best wishes for us all :-) ",
