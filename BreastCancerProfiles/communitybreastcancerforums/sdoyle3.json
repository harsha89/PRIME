      "Content": "sdoyle3 wrote: Two months ago I was diagnosed with a local recurrence (left supraclavicle palpable lymph) due to my onc's vigilance at the time of my 6 month check up. My tumor markers were negative as they had been for 14 years after my very aggressive treatment(neoadjuvant AC,mastectomy, high dose/stem cell and radiation).The situation was very distressing for me because I was a 14 year survivor(disease free!!!) of inflammatory breast cancer. There aren't many of us who go this long with IBC let alone survive disease free. What is unusual about my already unique situation is that the recurrence is in 2 local nodes, even the PET scan showed mild hyperbolic activity. How can this be when I had a very aggressive cancer 14 years ago? The doctor who ultimately had node biopsied  explained that my cancer is agressive in a \"perti\" dish but my system coupled with my earlier treatment neutralized the agressiveness of the cancer cells very effectively. He is now treating me with taxotere(high dose, carboplatin, avastin and Herceptin(14 years ago herception was not even available)-I did not even every 3 weeks. I am having a difficult time with the chemo and hope that the treatment will end in 6 rounds; the projected date to end treatment presuming the cancer is gone. I will be on Herceptin for 1 year. In addition to the side effects of the chemo, I am also feeling anxious and a sense of despair. These are not emotions I experienced with any intensity the first go around. I have a family and friends who are supportive but I still lapse into moods and feelings of hopelessness and despair even though I know I am sooo lucky that their isn't any metastisis.  I know this is a long post but I am wondering if anyone has experienced this situation before, both the cancer diagnosis and emotional rollercoaster. Thanks for all of your help. We did not have many websites like these 14 years ago.        Log in to post a reply",
