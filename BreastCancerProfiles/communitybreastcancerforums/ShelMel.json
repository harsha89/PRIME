I am personally very vocal about what's going on with me, sharing everything via FB with friends, family and now strangers who are friending me. I was very sick my second chemo round (high fever) and I thought I was dying. And I shared how scared I was and how hopeless I felt with my \"world\" and surprisingly, I had a lot of support. But yes, I get a lot of the \"keep up the great attitude\", \"you're gonna beat this because you're just so positive\" mantras, too. I'm going to look into that book you mentioned.

Had a lumpectomy with clear margins, took chemo and had radiation. I was declared NED in May 2011. I started Tamoxifen and then I stopped Tamoxifen after about a year because the SEs were too harsh. Had a full hysterectomy in August 2012 and then discovered Lung/Chest Wall mets two month after that in October 2012. It took until December 5, 2012, with a surgical lung biopsy to finally get the right tissue to confirm that it was indeed 100% mets. Immediately started a chemo cocktail and am having a scan this Friday to determine if it's working. I am a military wife, married to my soldier husband for 9 years, and he is THE BEST. I have the most amazing kids. Right now I'm still absorbing everything and trying to find a level of normal while I navigate these waters of chemos, scans, drugs and feeling like general crap half the time because of the chemo. I'm so grateful to be here. I am overwhelmed with the love and support from all of you. Thank you for embracing me into your world with open arms and loving hearts.",

I hate taking them tho, they dull my senses and I don't like that, but with this, maybe I need to get back on them. Jennifer - I was stage 1, grade 2 with my initial breast cancer. For some reason I've got mets. No reason, I know it's not normal. I had a laproscopic lung biopsy with a chest tube on December 5th that finally confirmed the mets 100%. The FNA's (2 of them) were inconclusive. I haven't had Adriamycin yet. I think that may have been one of the chemo drugs that my onc mentioned I'd be doing. I will call him tomorrow with a clearer head and ask. 33skidoo - You rock!! And you're my hero!! Thank you. Ok. That makes me feel better. Love and prayers and hugs to all of you amazing women.

      "Content": "ShelMel wrote: I'm new to the mets board - and was dx'ed with lung and chest mets. I had my lung biopsy to confirm it on December 5th. My onc put me on Arimidex and decided to do a baseline Chest and Abdoment CT scan. That scan was compared to my Chest CT scan that was done at the end of October, which found the lesions which led to me finally having the lung biopsy in December. I had an appointment with my onc yesterday to go over the baseline scan and it was bad. Real bad. From late October when we discovered the lesions to now - my tumors have doubled in size and I've developed new tumors. During that time, I was not on any meds, because all the needle biopsies I had were inconclusive. For the first time ever, my onc was not very optimistic. Of course we're going to fight this thing, but he was extremely matter of fact. I will start on chemo on Monday. My head was swimming when he was talking that I forgot to write down the chemo names. I know that 5FU was one of them and two others. I'm going in on Wednesday for an echo. My onc told me that if this chemo (my first line of defense) did not work, that it isn't likely that I will have other options that work. He said that if this doesn't work, I am looking at a few months - 6 months tops. I apparently have fluid in my lungs, caused from the cancer. I have 20-30 tumors in my lungs and about that many in my chest wall. He said this cancer is extremely agressive and that doesn't stastically bode well. My onc works under the Vanderbilt umbrella. I know that he will be checking on other options and trials. After receiving the mets diagnosis, I spent some time wrapping my head around \"3-5\" years and started making plans, to live, travel, experience life.... Now? I'm scared shitless. I don't want to spend the next few months sick as a dog and miss out on living. I'm going to do the chemo, no doubt, but damn it. Can I cuss here? I'm so freaked out and can't stop crying. I don't want to leave my babies. I'm not ready, they're not ready. This chemo HAS to work. It has to. Has anyone else had a diagnosis like this?

Long story short I've had a Chest CT and PET scan that showed multiple lesions in my lungs and in my chest wall. After a lymph node and lung CT-guided biopsy that were both inconclusive, and a second opinion, both doctors are positive that it's mets. I'm meeting with the lung biopsy surgeon on Monday, they want me to get the biopsy done ASAP. The lung resection will most likely confirm what my doctors are saying. Sure, there's a tiny glimmer of hope that it \"could\" be something else, but the reality is that it's not likely. Both doctors said that the lesions are foci and because of number of them and location inside AND outside my lung, there's just not much hope that it's anything other than mets. I got my second opinion today so I'm in the middle of just absorbing that news and preparing to meet the lung surgeon. I'm kind of numb right now but I know the emotions are going to hit me hard very soon.",

Reading the boards has helped me though, so much. Thank you so very much for your kind words and support. I cannot express how much it means to me to have that right now.",

These boards are full of the most wonderfully supportive women who will love you, pray for you and support you as much as they can. With no insurance, I'm sure that has to be scary. As long as you pay what you can to your medical doctors and institutions, even if it's $5 a month, that's all you can do. Don't let the stress of paying medical bills keep you from getting better. Try not to worry so much. I know, it's easier said than done. I agree with chrissyb, don't worry about the scans that you've seen. Try to chill out this weekend and relax. If can, get a group of best girlfriends together and go window shopping or out to eat. Many prayers and wishes for a calm weekend. - Shelle",

He's always been very upbeat and positive. I think the agressiveness and abnormalcy of how this is progressing is not very promising in his eyes. He said something as we were wrapping up that struck me as odd, even though all of us hear it all the time from others. He said, \"You're braver than I am.\" I'm not sure why he said that and why it sounded so odd to me, but it did. I guess I just didn't expect to hear something like that from my oncologist. And if he thinks I'm brave, damn! I didn't fall out on the floor wailing while we talked, so maybe that's why he said that. I hate crying and I don't cry well or for long. I cry in short spurts, so maybe my lack of over-emotional response prompted that? Anyway, when I got home and thought about him saying that, it made me feel worse. Am I crazy?? LOL",
