      "Content": "Oct 27, 2017 06:07PM - edited Oct 27, 2017 06:08PM by nightcrawler I just finished a round of rads on Tomotherapy equipment four days ago. I got the 16-session (3-week) double dose instead of the 33-session (6-week) single dose. Each session was about 10 minutes from start to finish. First, a CT scan was taken; then, my treatment would begin. I was fortunate to have very few side effects. I didn't get any fatigue (in fact, I ran a half marathon two weeks into treatment). Every now and then, I'd have mild discomfort in the breast, which was relieved with ibuprofen. At the end of week two, I developed sensitivity and itching in my nipple and areola. Near the end of week 3, I developed an angry-looking rash on my breast, but it looks way angrier than it feels. It looks much like an allergic reaction; there's redness and some freckling. I didn't get any blisters. Four days post rads, I'm itching more and have switched from putting A&D ointment on the breast and hydrocortisone with aloe on the nipple and areola to just putting the hydrocortisone on the whole breast. I continue to run and go about my normal activities. I'm glad I was able to get the Tomotherapy because my cancer was on the left, and traditional rads on the left endanger the heart. Tomotherapy allows very precise targeting that protects the heart. I can actually see how precise the targeting was by looking at my rash; it's on my breast, not my chest, and the worst of it is right where the surgeon cut my tumor out; he cut along the left edge of the areola. Hope this helps!",

They just sound horrific to me. They are doing it as an outpatient procedure, which is good. It sounds like I may need to sleep on the couch for a few days. We have a waterbed, and I fear having difficulty getting up out of it.",

In the recovery room, I heard the words every cancer patient longs to hear: \"Clear margins - no node involvement\"!!!! Edited to add: His opening line was, \"This surgery couldn't have possibly gone any better than it did.\" My husband said he was just as enthusiastic when he gave him the news. The weather was awful here in Jacksonville yesterday afternoon, with severe thunderstorms. (One of the recovery room nurses was talking about how he was nearly struck by lightning in his yard.) But all of the color had returned to my world. It had turned black-and-white when I got diagnosed. Also, I had worried about getting drains; because he didn't need to remove much tissue or a bunch of nodes, I didn't need them.",

      "Content": "Jul 6, 2017 10:13AM - edited Jul 6, 2017 10:15AM by nightcrawler Update on my situation. I saw the surgeon this morning. He got the final path report from my lumpectomy last week. I am officially NED. He got fantastic margins, 1.1 cm. He said that my situation with the breast cancer is ideal: grade 1, stage 1, no nodes, clear margins, ER+/PR+/HER-. ER and PR are both 100%. He said is highly unlikely I will need chemo. I may need rads. I've already decided I don't want chemo unless they tell me there's some absurd chance the cancer will recur without it, which is unlikely because of the specifics of my case. Best of all, he is going to set me up for a consult with an onco gyn for a bilateral oophorectomy and a possible bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. This means, after 35 YEARS of BS, my endometriosis (which is highly aggressive and stage IV) will finally be addressed, once and for all. Ironically, I have the breast cancer to thank for this. Not only can I not take bcp's anymore, but breast cancer, combined with ovarian involvement of the endometriosis, puts me at high risk of ovarian cancer. That's why he wants me to see the onco gyn, on the off-chance they find ovarian tumors when they open me up. Additionally, my BC onco is in the same office, so I'll have a one-stop shop. 35 YEARS and BREAST CANCER later. I am looking FORWARD to this next surgery. I can't wait to get it!",

I've also got to get a couple of button-down sleeveless shirts. I don't have any. It's hot here in Florida, so I don't want long-sleeve shirts.",

He said that the only thing that concerns him about the margins is that the tumor is close to the nipple, only 3 cm away at 3 o'clock. I go in for pre-op blood work and electrocardiogram (I have a heart murmur) at the hospital tomorrow. I'm feeling confident, but not. Ever since my diagnosis, my world has been stripped of color. =(",
