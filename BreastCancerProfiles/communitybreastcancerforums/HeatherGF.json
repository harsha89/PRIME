Phrases like \"suspicious mass\" \"probably benign\" (YEAH!)  I asked her about what type of mass was it? She said the report didn't say. Then I asked how then do you know it's okay to wait 6 months if they don't know what it is. She said \"that would make me uncomfortable\"  In the end the PCP backs up the specialist and says it will hurt nothing to wait 6 months.  With that dead end I called OSU Breast Cancer Center and made an appointment. They asked what B rad rating my mass was...what??? I am going to have to look that one up.  Anyway it will be nice to have a second opinion and talk with a dr about this.  God bless Heather GF",

No need to biopsy. I agreed and moved on with life. Here we are again a year and a half later having a new ultrasound. The ultrasound tech started out perky and got quiet very quickly. She took the needed pictures and told me to stay put the radiologist may need to come in and get more pictures. Then stepped out to talk to the dr. She comes back in and says that the dr dosn't need more pictures. She told me the 'mass' has grown and changed from the first ultrasound. The radiologist is going to talk to my onocology surgeon I saw the first time and decide what to do from here. Is it common for fibroadenomas to grow? To change shape? I would appreciate any experience with this or links to help clear up some of the murk. Thank you HeatherGF Log in to post a reply",

She did mention that she wanted to keep an eye on it in case it was a phyllodes tumor. The surgeon was nice but she decided what to do before I got there and was not going to be changed. Now that there is growth and a oval like mass is now grown and looks like a lopsided peanut. From my non-medical eye it looked like there were thorns coming from the side of the mass. I am still awaiting a phone call or the electronic report to be sent to me. I a going to push for a needle biopsy this time to be sure.",

Come back in 6 months for another ultrasound. Then two paragraphs on 6-8% of cancers are hard to catch even with quality care thank  you for using your breast care center. Glaringly missing was any finding. No diagnosis or even a probable. No dr to contact with questions. No guideline if things change or what to look for.  I am pretty confident the stats are on my side and this will be noncancerous, but I want a second opinion. It bothers me that there is no diagnosis and no biopsy therefore no way to know if a 6 month wait at the age 35 is safe or not.  I am going to go cruise for an accredited breast care center. I live in northern West Virginia so there are many large clinics within three hour trip to go to.  Thanks for your help! ",

I was told that I was going to see a dr after the testing. I found out (through PCP nurse) that the dr wouldn't see me because the ordering dr was my PCP. Which means the tests and films go to radiology to be read then sent to my dr. Gotta love large hospitals. Do fibroadenomas grow fast? After seeing where the pain is in regards to the lumps. I realize that it's the pull down on my breast that is what is hurting the upper breast. The lump does not hurt. Where the lump is you can see broken blood vessels, small spider veins that was not there at my OB appointment in August.  Other than that I am still waiting for my PCP to call.....  Thanks for your advice!",

After being told that I wasn't coming back for 6 months I was called today and given an appointment in a couple weeks. A second dr thinks I need to see the surgeon. The mammogram just says there is a mass in the left breast with scattered fibroglandulad densities, BI-RADS 0. needs ultrasound The ultrasound report says \"There is a parallel solid mass seen in the left breast at 3 o'clock. Internal echotexture is herogeneous. isoechoic. Mass measures 3.48x 1.26 cms BI-RADS cat. 3 Now I'll wait until the appointments for more info.  God bless Heather GF",

      "Content": "HeatherGF wrote: About a year and a half ago I got an aching in my upper left chest. I got a CT scan. It found that I had nodules all over my thyroid so I had to get several biopsies of my thyroid, negative! As the year proceeded I kept complaining of my chest hurting then the nodes under my left arm (same side as pain) were swollen. Dr saw all this and said I was sick. I would get better, no real illness though.  Now the pain is bad. I take Motrin just about every day. The past two months I have been fighting shortness of breathe, diagnosised as an 'unusual pleurisy' given steroids and inhalers. I felt a lump near the spot of pain. I had to MAKE the dr touch it.  Bam! This last Monday I got an u/s and mammogram of the left breast. Not the nodes, nor the nodes now on the right side swollen, nor the nodes in my groin now swollen!!!! There was a clear 2 inch+ mass.  The tech laughed and said given your age and it's size it's a fibroidadenoma no big deal. Come back in 6 months. I NEVER saw a dr....the tech diagnosised me and told me when to make my follow up!!!  I am mad to say the least! Then as she was walking me out said come back if it grows or hurts. I said it hurts. She smiled and said have a nice day. It was like talking to an automoton.  I called my PCP and I am waiting for a call back.  I saw a more or less oval mass. There were small spots of bright white that looked spidery but small in the tissue throughout the breast. I guess I am not sure how aggressive to be about this. Any info and recommendations would be appreciated.  God bless Heather GF Log in to post a reply",
