My husband and I were planning on trying for our first baby this year, I am absolutely heart broken. So now at the very least our trying for a baby is going to be put off for 2 years. My oncologist wants me to wait two years for my body to recover from the chemo so I can carry a healthy pregnancy. There is a chance the chemo will put me into menopause and I will not be able to concieve. To make things more complicated I am ER/PR positive so I will need to be on a hormonal suppressent for 5 years, and I have no idea what that will do with my fertility. I am hoping I can have a sit down with my fertility specialist and onc after chemo and come up with some sort of plan. I did not have time to freeze eggs or anything before chemo began. It all happened so quickly. Are any of you in the same position? and/or have any of you had a child after chemo? Hope everyone going through chemo is doing well! follow my journey, vent about yours, check out my blog @ ifightlikeawoman.blogspot.com/ I am not fighting like a girl, i'm fighting like a woman dang it!
