Next big hurdle is the hair thing.  A couple of days ago I felt my scalp tingling and could swear I smelled something like burning hair; but no shedding yet, so it is probably just my paranoia.  I too have the wig ready and some hats, but have a hard time imagining myself with no hair!  I am pretty sure after this experience I will never again toy with the idea of botox, facelifts or complain about a bad hair day...will just be so happy to have my hair back, imperfections and all, and be done with surgeries, treatments, etc.",

I would post a picture, but seem to be the only computer-challenged participant who can't figure out how to do it.  I, too have lost about 4 - 5 lbs so far, but since I am 5'10\", it isn't a major loss...actually my pants fit better :) ",

Congratulations to all who are finishing up.  I know that my last infusion date will always be one of the most significant dates of my life!",
