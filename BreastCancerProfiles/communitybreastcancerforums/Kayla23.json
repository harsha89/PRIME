The radiologist who patiently did my biopsy (I believe it was ultrasound guided core needle biopsy) said he was having a hard time getting to the actual section to be biopsied. So he had to use something like a vacuum or some sort of pressure device to get the needle to proceed further into my breast. But he got it done. So sorry that you have had such bad treatment by people who should know better. I hope you have received better help by now! Wishing you excellent health!",
