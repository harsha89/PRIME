I've already looked it up, and I know that the \"lobular shadowing\" language can refer to Invasive Lobular Carcinoma.  I'm 37 and really don't have any risk factors for BC. Thoughts?  I can't decide how nervous I should be about this.  I'd appreciate any input you can give!  Thanks. Log in to post a reply",
