That is the most accurate description I have heard and helps me make more sense of these last 10 months. Likessquirrels, it takes courage to make changes. You have it. I rarely post but have read much on this forum. The ladies here have an overwhelming amount of courage, sympathy and knowledge. ",

Both the port site and the tube into my neck were uncomfortable for a number of months but not to the extent that I couldn't get out of bed. I still guard both sites particularly when my grandchildren are around. I love the port and am willing to deal with the slight discomfort. kaylynne, I take cold/allergy meds on a semi-regular basis and they don\u2019t affect my liver enzymes. I hope you find a good answer to your problem. ",

I do have some neuropathy but for me it is quite manageable; some tingling in my fingers and some numbness in my feet. My MO suggested I take Alpha Lipoic Acid and Gabapentin to help with the symptoms. I sometimes have fleeting strange sensations in the days right after infusion but nothing that I would characterize as strong tingling. The Weekly Taxol for Stage 4 has a lot of very good info. I'm sure the ladies there would have a lot of good suggestions for you. Please do not lose hope. I have not posted on this or the Weekly Taxol thread before today. I have read all of the posts on both threads and am so very impressed with the courage, knowledge and compassion you all have shared. My heart goes out to those ofyou who are so young.",

There was too much bleeding for the them to cauterize my nose so he put some cocaine in the offending nostril and then inserted a nasal balloon pack. My platelets were fine but my protime was high so they gave me a shot of vitamin K to help the protime recover. I don't know if the protime was high ecause my liver is having problems (my liver enzymes have been fine) or if Taxol is causing it. I see my MO tomorrow in conjunction with more chemo. Your thoughts would be appreciated.",

The only way I know the Taxol is working is because the scans show a decrease in the size of the tumors and because my TMs continue to fall. My last scan showed only one tumor decreasing in size with the others stable. TMs seem to be leveling off also. This is month nine on Taxol for me. Not sure how aggressive my mets are but TMs went up about 10% in two weeks before I started chemo. My thoughts are with all of you.",
