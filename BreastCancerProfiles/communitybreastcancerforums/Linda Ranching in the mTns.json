    "Content": "Linda-Ranching-in-the-mTns wrote: I just read about this in another thread, and think it may be what I am experiencing. My dbl mastectomy was Nov 6. Eleven nodes were removed from left side (plus 2 previously removed during earlier lumpectomy). I still have pain in my left arm, from wrist to inner elbow (on the upper side of the lower arm if that makes sense -- the thumb side of the arm), and another 'clump' of pain in the soft under/back side of elbow. Nothing feels hard in my arm -- the 'clump' is a feeling-- but I am on the heavier side, so perhaps that is why I can't see any cords. The pain is in a definite line -- I originally thought perhaps a blood clot... and that this might be bloodstream related, but when I described the symptoms to the nurse (via email) she pretty much ruled out blood clot, as nothing is hard and no heat.  But she never mentioned axillary web syndrome -- and led me to belive that muscles/nerves/lymph system are just readusting post surgery, and all will be fine... I live 12 hours from my surgeon, 3.5 hours from oncologist, who I also mentioned the pain to last week, in her office, but she just said it was normal to experience random arm pain post-surgery, and it would get better on its own. Wall-walking and table-walking with that arm are painful once I get past a point.  I am 26 days post surgery -- and far from any LE therapists. Feedback? Does what I am describing sound like axillary web syndrome? Thanks Linda  Dx IDC 5/30/12. LumpX 8/24/12 (1 of 2 nodes + for BC) DCIS/tumors in margins. BMX + DIEP recon 11-6-2012.
