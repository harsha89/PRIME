I'm wearing a \"toga\" at home so that no fabric will touch it. Any idea if this is permanent or ways to elleviate the pain? I take Tylenol but prolonged use is not good. I also apply Lidocaine topical cream but relief only last for a short period of time. Thanks for any suugestions or comments. Valencia1 Log in to post a reply",
