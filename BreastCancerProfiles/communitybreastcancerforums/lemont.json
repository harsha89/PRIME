(OK, the surgeries and chemo were hard too, but the waiting is right up there.) You're doing the right thing by getting a second opinion from a specialist. When I was going through diagnosis, it helped me stop the \"what-if's\" by writing down my questions. Somehow things seemed more manageable. If you aren't satisfied with the 2nd opinion, get a 3rd, or a 4th. I wish you the best. Keep us posted. Cinda",

I, too, was dizzy with all the factors swimming around in my head. I found it tremendously helpful to write down my pros and cons. It really made my choice clear. My surgeon just about went into shock when I told him. Because I had my list with me, I was able to calmly and clearly articulate my reasons. He ended up agreeing that my reasons were valid for me, and the rest is history. Cinda",

When I started chemo, I didn't know about taking a blanket. When I got cold, the nurse gave me a fleece throw that a former patient made and donated. She attached a tag that said \"I have sat in your chair.\" It meant a lot to me. I felt such a connection to that woman, though I'll never know who she is. Cinda",
