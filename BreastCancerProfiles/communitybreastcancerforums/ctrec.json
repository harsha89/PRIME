    "Content": "ctrec wrote: My 74-year old mother was diagnosed with a rare breast cancer, Metaplastic with HR2 Positive Feb. 2014. She had surgery, and radiation, but opted out of chemo. Now the cancer has spread to her lungs, and her oncologist wants to start her on TDM1. The side-effects frighten me as she has shortness of breath already; is on oxygen, and has had Hep B in her 40's. Has anyone heard of anyone at this age using this drug? Symptoms, quality of life, life expectancy, etc.? Thanks. Cherri Log in to post a reply",
