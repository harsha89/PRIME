Adrienne, I love the idea of telling someone that the scar is because Antonio Banderas tried to cut my clothes off with a sword!!!!  I think that is probably one of the best stories I could possibly give to explain it!  Thanks for the suggestion.  It made me smile!  I will do as much research as possible and hopefully will know a lot more once I meet with the surgeon on Thursday. Laura, thanks for the suggestion!  I will definitely try getting my path report so the ladies here can help me disect it!  The only problem is, my PCP thinks that the results were inaccurate.  So it might not help at all.  I am also going to try and see if my surgeon can move my appointment up any.  Maybe someone will cancel and they can squeeze me in even a day sooner.  I'm sorry to hear that a mast. was your only option.  All of you women on this site are so brave!  It is hard to think what you all must be going through!  And here I am with nothing wrong for sure, acting like it is the end of the world. Karen and Meece, thanks for all of the encouragement.  You are all such special women! You will all be in my prayers!",

I posted another topic because I found two swollen lymph nodes in my armpit and they weren't there before.  It freaked me out a bit and has me more worried than I had been that my results might not be benign.  I wish there was more information out there on what lymph node involvement looks like. Ugh! Thanks for everything!  :-)  Hugs to you!",

The tissue is solid.  I've been told it isn't a cyst.  Does this make a difference in how it will look afterward?  I hate having to wait until Thursday to know what the surgeon thinks, and what I should expect.  I'm reading the other topics here and just wish I knew what type of questions to ask about surgery.  The biopsy was not a great experience and I just want to get it all over with! Is it ridiculous to want to have the entire breast removed just to be rid of the issues?",

Thanks for checking up on me.  I had the surgery on Wednesday and it went so smoothly!!  My best friend took me to the hospital, and stayed with me right up until they took me to the operating room.  The nurses were all angels and the anesthesiologist was super nice as well.  The last thing I remember was when the anesthesiologist walked in the room and was behind me messing with something and I asked him, \"Did you do something to me?  Because I am starting to feel drunk!\"  Then I woke up in recovery!  It was such a relief to have it over with.  They loaded me up with painkillers and it didn't hurt at all until the second day.  Everything went so great!  I couldn't be more pleased.  I can't see the incision area yet because it is covered in dressing, but from what I can see, it looks pretty good!  Now the hard part is the waiting!  I meet with the surgeon for followup and to discuss the pathology on Tuesday the 29th.  Already my mind is reeling again!  But after the surgery went so well, I know I shouldn't be worried.  Everything will be ok, whether it is benign or not!    If I keep saying it to myself, I am hoping it will become true!! Thanks again ladies!  I don't know what I would do without you!",

I have told a couple of close friends (including my boss), but have not explained the situation in full to my parents or family.  I explained after the biopsy that I had one done, and it was benign (I am on my parent's insurance and they would have found out!), but I haven't said much about what is happening now.  I am planning to wait until after I have talked to the surgeon so that I can try to explain and give details about the next steps.  I hate waiting.  It really is tough.  I am so amazed at all the women on this board who are so strong!  It is really nice to have someone to talk to.  Friends on the \"outside\", God bless them, don't know what to say except, \"I'm sure you'll be fine!\" or \"Everything is going to be ok.\"  Everytime I hear that it makes me want to kick something.  Both are probably true, but it is frustrating because just the fact that I have to deal with all of this makes me feel like everything is not ok!  I love my friends!  They are trying really hard to be supportive, and that is enough for me! Thanks to you guys though.  It is so nice to have an \"insider's\" voice!",
