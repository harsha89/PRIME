I recommend binge watching to corniest shows on Netflix. Now that I am on the other side of it, I can say that my imagination was WAY worse than the actual experience. The funny thing with me was that I was such a wreck before the biopsy that once it was done I didn't even sweat waiting for the results. People here are so great that if it turned out to be bad news, I knew where to turn to talk me through the next steps.",

I had read all of the posts on here that had to deal with the biopsy so I was ready. For the most part it was sort of painless but they told me that because the lump had vessels, it would sting even with the lidocane and I think they knicked a muscle so that got my attention. Glad it is done and over with. Now I have to wait until next week to find out the results. I have told myself that I am not going to think about it. Lots of stupid Netflix for me this weekend.",
