I have breast pain, but normal findings on the mammogram. My Dr say's semi-dense is normal, but as I am no expert on these matters I just wonder if something could have been missed because of this semi-denseness. Hope this is making sense Thank you Log in to post a reply",

Will keep you informed but my appointment with the breast clinic is 2 weeks away. Going on holiday next week and not really going to be able to relax.",

I am out of my mind with worry and imagining all sorts of horrors...been having stabbing pains in one breast for a few weeks, along with a small lump I would not have found had it not been for the pain...been to doctors this morning...referral to breast clinic. I am trying to stay calm..but I am really struggling and feel sick to my stomach before even finding out anything, I am also currently being treated by a therapist for health anxiety...Just need some support and someone to calm me down.

      "Content": "angilee wrote: Hi, I was recently referred to the breast clinic because I started to get intermittent stabbing pain in one part of my breast, then a small lump (pea size) was found in the same place. I had a mammogram done at the breast clinic..nothing was seen and I was sent home with a breast pain booklet. I went to visit my GP after the report was sent back to him...all he said was, mammogram normal and semi-dense breast tissue..and said the pain and lump could be fat necrosis...I have never injured my breast or had anything done to it, so cannot accept this! I am 56 years old and still having hot flushes, so presume I am still in menopause and I am extremely worried that I do not have an answer to this lump and pain...How can I have this problem, yet have no explanation for it Angilee Log in to post a reply",
