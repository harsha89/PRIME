I have also posted on those other discussion boards, but I know all of you have done a lot of research on cancer, too (plus, I love your posts!). I am just ruminating here. My oncologist prefers ACT, but it has the potential to damage the heart and has a very small risk of leukemia. TC has no risk of heart damage or blood cancer issues, but ACT has a slightly higher chance of reducing my risk of second breast cancer than TC does. I am leaning toward TC (but I think that this is also because the SEs of TC are reportedly less than ACT's, but then that is mainly anecdotal). Would love to know what you guys think of these benefit/risk choices or if you have encountered them yourselves. Cheers to us all on our recovery. I am doing very well with the surgery issues. Feeling quite normal, actually, now that I am wearing NO BRA! My best to all!",

I am resigned to chemo--it is a blasted way to extend my life--but I am glad to extend it. Lovely fall days. I decided to recover where my boyfriend lives here in western Massachusetts. Will be doing chemo here also. Because support is vital, plus I hate my cooking!!",

All of your stories help me to imagine and bear my own. So sorry to hear about complications, vivian and schoolcounselor and now jo6202's pain. Please know we are all with you. I got off pain meds by day 8 because otherwise I cannot read, and that was more horrifying than the pain, maybe. Pain is subsiding at day 13. I was just told have to get chemo, though my cancer is small and all scraped off (barely 1cm), only on my right breast with left breast all clear and lymph nodes clear too--this is because I am triple negative with the hormone receptors, thus had a high-risk tumor. I expected chemo though because I am positive for the genetic mutation brca2 anyway. Will likely just take more time off from my job. Some things that helped during recovery, for cjc and others who will have surgery: a huge body pillow (called leachco body pillow), the red heart pillows called axilla pilla, and pliable straws (so I could take in fluid easily). There is a book called Now What: Recovery after Mastectomy that I read before the surgery and it was helpful: it also has exercises (very easy) that I am doing right now, very weakly, but good to do something. I have numbness and a kind of lump (nurse said it was normal) where the sentinel lymph node biopsy was done on the right, and the exercise helps. Â Again, all my best, LOVE to all.",

I wanted to thank Schoolcounselor for her explanations about her chemo. They help me as we have very similar dx though I have the added complication of brca2 genetic mutation. I had a mammaprint, not an oncotype dx (are they the same thing?). The conclusion is high risk basal type with triple negative hormone receptivity. Chemo is definitely in order say bs and mo. Had a great visit with very nice mo (my first lady doctor). Two options: dose dense ac + taxol 16 weeks or tc for 12 weeks. She's still figuring out which. Any comments on those options? As for bras, my ps gave me a compression bra, American Sports Bra, that really hurts but he wants me to keep it in 23 hours a day for at least 4 weeks. I am used to its weird pain now. I air my breasts for an hour a day which is very funny for the household. All my best to everyone. This is an awesome group. Best of luck, Denise, to you and your child at the wedding!",

I am concentrating on recovering from dmx and recon (the one-step surgery). My school allows me time off, and like me they are just waiting for news from my MO, before I make my decision.",

Helps us a lot who are waiting for it. batcatlady, I am so sorry to hear about your SEs, and I think you did the right thing to heal rather than push on and work. My BS advised me not to work after bmx, so I took time off for surgery. You have great students, TeamKim! Wow. I started the year not teaching, because all dx happened in August, so I do not know my students anyway. I am mulling taking the school year off, as that will be least disruptive for my school and for me. But it is all up to me what I wish to do. I definitely will take time off during chemo, because I am doing it where I can be supported (at my partner's house in another state) rather than being by myself in my apt. So that means returning to school in March, a very iffy time to return to classes as I will not know the kids. A reasonable choice for me then is to take time off, given the school's needs and my own. Less money (40% less) but time to heal carefully and deal with potential side effects.",
