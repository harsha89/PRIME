      "Content": "LisaL1005 wrote: Hi all, I am newly diagnosed stage 4 at age 45. At age 30 I had my first round with breast cancer (stage 2). It has come back after 15 years. I'm currently working full-time but out on short term disability. How does one decide whether to work or not? I'm struggling with this as I have so many doctor appointments, CAT scans and unknown medical things in my future that I'm not sure mentally I can commit to working. And the disability thing is confusing me. I understand my short term disability will turn into (?) long term disability if I'm out longer than the short term disability time period, but should I be going on family medical leave now? I understand that this will hold my position at work so they can't lay me off. But then when do I apply for social security disability - only when I'm not working anymore? Thanks for any advice!
