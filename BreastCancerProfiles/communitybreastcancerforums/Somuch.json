I find that saying \"this summer I was dx with BC but it was caught early and I should be fine. since I have to deal with this I might as well go perky and flat\". I found that when I down play it others are more comfortable ask good questions and are supportive. I'm a teacher and any opportunity I have to educate I take. It also keeps me talking and helps me reduce my own anxiety.",

I did lots of soul searching about what would be the best for me after hearing from friends and family, all who knew someone who had gone through it or had first hand experience. My DH said \"I just want you alive and healthy, and anyway I'm a tush man\" I am not so young, child grown and on her own and I'm getting ready to retire in December. But I like to look attractive and be styish. I had planned on reinvening myself and finding a new career after teaching. The breasts were important for breast feeding and mutual enjoyment for my husband and I but they don't define me as a woman.  Had the MRI and it found more DCIS than the Mammo. and something suspicious in my other breast. I was leaning toward a bilateral and that was it for me. I want to do all I can to \"close the book\" and enjoy being a long time survivor. I like to find silver linings and I'm not trying to be flip but natural looking perky boobs and a flatter stomach will be a real plus. This is your body and you need to be comfortable with your choices. It is a hard place to be. These posts are full of great information. hang in there, you are stronger than you know.",

Time never moved so slowly!   The waiting is awful but wait you must, so do whaever you can to calm yourself. Remember all the indicators you are reading about are based on the biopsies of others but you are unique. Just because it \"looks like\" doesn't mean it is, and unfortunatly for some, it doesn't \"look like\" can still become \"it is\". I understand about reading too much on the Internet, I started to drive myself crazy and second guess decisions I had made concerning my treatment.  Hopefully this will play out as B9, I'm sending you a big hug. Let us know how things turn out. ",

All procedures gave good information. My I.C. would not pay for BRACA 1 or BRACA 2 testing because I don't have two family members beside myself with BC. Otherwise I meet all the criteria.  Hmmmmm..  Sound like your Dr. has a good plan! Hang strong! ",

In the past 25 years I have lost one four legged \"cat child\" to cancer and a \"dog child\" who also had hip pain and could no longer walk. Taking Cookie to the vet was one of the hardest things I have ever done but I know it was the right choice. The pleasure they give is worth the pain of loss. We now have five \"children\" at home, 4 cats and a dog. The human child is grown and living on her own. - I have grandbunnies!    ",
