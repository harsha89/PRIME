      "Content": "Luv_my_Oz wrote: I went to the ER last night with a knot in my nipple that my husband found last week... why the ER?.... no Dr and no insurance.....the knot has pains that shoot through it at times and it burns at times.... my nipple was red on the surface when we found it but doesn't appear to be now..... they sent me for an ultra sound and told me I would be there for 2 hours after... to wait for the results... however when I went for the ultra sound... the first technition after doing it said.... I'll be back.... I may have someone else with me to look at this.... it was very obvious on the screen and especially when she compared it to the other breas...t there was a black mass on the screen.... she brought someone else back in with her who did the same ultrasound again..... then they brought in the Dr who reads the ultra sound and she did another ultrasound including up under my arm...she then said to me.... we will have to send you for a mamogram but I can tell you that this is not a cyst or a fibroadenoma or infection or anything we can drain.... they sent me back to ER at which time the Head Dr of ER ( and not the intern who had examined me) came in and said... \"what did they tell you in ultra sound?... (note: this is 10 minutes after having the ultra sound.... no 2 hrs to read it).... then she said.... we need to get you to a breast surgeon soon..... she asked if a student could come in and do an exam because she needed the experience.... I agreed.... the student was pretty informative saying... sometimes this can be taken care of with just meds (chemo/radiation).... and sometimes they have to remove the nipple but they will tatoo one back on.... and sometimes they have to do a masectomy in whch case the breast can be rebuilt.... but it's too soon to tell..... when the nurse came in to discharge me she gave me two breast surgeons to call for an appt in their Cancer Clinic... then said.... I'm sorry you got a bad diagnosis.... are you ok?.. This morning I called to make the appt and they wanted to coordinate a mamogram and surgeon visit at the same time which will be next Monday,Sept 26....the waiting to know is horrible.....Â so I guess like many others.... I'm very concerned while I wait and wanted to hear what others thought who have been through this.... I almost think that I have Pagets symptoms.... anything you can tell me will help... on top of all this I am bipolar and just beginning to get through a bipolar crisis..... I know there are people worse off than me....I'm doing all I can to keep from going over the edge.... A Friend is someone who knows the song in your heart....... when you have forgotten the words!

It was a long day..... they called me in 5 time to do new shots on my mammogram (these were not retakes, these were all new shots)..... then sent me for my 4th ultrasound........ they will be doing a biopsy on 2 seperate masses in my right breast.... I have an appt for Wed, Oct 6 but they told me to call tomorrow to see if there are cancellations to get me in sooner..... I talked to someone in the cancer center who examined me again.... she said the biopsy results should take 2 or 3 days and we agreed that she would give me the results OVER THE PHONE, as soon as she got them.... so now..... I'm waiting again....",
