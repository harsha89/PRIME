I've now had a lumpectomy and will be having radiation soon.  There was no lymph involvement and lucky for me I am Stage 1 and Grade 1 and didn't have cancer in my margins.  I can honestly say that looking at where the lump was removed (they took out 10 cm) you can hardly tell a difference.  It's amazing really. What worked for me may not work for you.  Everyone does what they need to do, for their own personal reasons. While some things are really outside of your control (like the cancer deciding to come back or not), there are some things you can control.  You can choose what course of action or battle plan you are going to take. Don't make a quick decision.  Start to read and study as though your life depended on it and then make an informed choice...for YOU.  Everyone's situation is unique and there are probably none of us that have exactly the same diagnosis with exactly the same grade/stage etc etc. Know that you are not alone and we are all here (not that any of us wanted to belong to this lovely club...LOL) for you.   Please take deep breaths and start to do research research research... Good luck to you...and God bless.",

I am wondering about something and if you don't know the answer have you seen this discussed much at this site? I am probably going to take tamoxifen but I was wondering how long I will have to take it (I am 58) and what would happen if I stopped taking it after awhile.  I will certainly ask my oncolgist these things as well but I see you are a nurse and can't help but wonder what you think of my idea. I do not yet know my Her status or my ONC score.  I am still in the waiting line up as my surgery (lumpectomy) was only Januray 8th. Again...congratulations and thank you for your time.",

So now you are going to meet your surgeon?  Or the oncologist?  Janet, there are so many treatments and strategies for dealing with so many types and stages of breast cancer.  Try to keep looking forward, one step at a time.  You will find the waiting game the hardest part of everything...at least that is certainly been my experience and from what I can tell...from many others as well.  Janet, welcome to this club you never thought you would belong to.  You've got excellent company and we are all in this together.  Hang in there, sister!",
