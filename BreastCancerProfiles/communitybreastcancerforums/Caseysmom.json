I admire her with the strength she has for fighting this disease that really sucks and is unfair. Like the other I know how watching someone you love dearly die. I lost my father 2 years ago not to cancer but to Alzheimer's disease. I was daddy little girl watching him go down hill was one of the hardest things besides the bc treatment that I ever went through. Keeping you, Diane, and your family is my thoughts and prays.

As for your boyfriend I had the same fear of telling mine that I had b/c.  To my surprise after telling him about it he became very active in my treatment. He even told my oncologist and surgeon that we would do what ever needs to be done because he never wants to lose me.   He even helped me make my surgical decision of either have one or both of breasts removed and he suggested that I have a bilateral mastectomy. I told him that my chest would be scared on both sides and he kept telling me did not care as long as he would not lose me to this ugly disease.  It has been 2 1/2 years since my surgery and tram flap and we are still going strong.  Hugs Laura",
