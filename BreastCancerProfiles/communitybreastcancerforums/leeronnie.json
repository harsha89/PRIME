      "Content": "leeronnie wrote: I'm 47 and no doubt in premenopause. Went to general practioner 2 years ago had an abnormal mammogram. After waiting almost a month between mammogram and ultrasound I was diagnosed with a cysts close to the chest wall on the left breast. A year later I went to the The Goshen Women's Retreat Center who came highly recommended by my sister inlaw. No cysts were seen and but microcalcifications still there. Few months later while taking a shower and doing self examine of breasts I squeezed left nipple and dark bloody fluid came out. I was immediately alarmed and made appt at GWRC. Mammorgram was done and nothing found. The radiologist suggested a ductogram. Scheduled appt but wanted second opinion so I made an appt with the breast surgeon on their staff. She said she wouldn't do ductogram as they are a waste of time and said mammogram and previous ultrasound were normal and suggested mammorgram in 6 months. I didn't do the keep the appt. For the last 4 months left breast is always extremely sore, and bigger than the right. Had mammo and ultrasound and found two 4mm cysts on left breast. The right breasts doesn't hurt at all. Went to see breast surgeon last Thursday who greeted me with \"well.....what seems to be the problem now.\" I wanted to just get up off the table and apologize for wasting her time. She said cysts are not large enough to cause pain and did not need to be asperated. She did palpation and I have obvious extreme tenderness on left side. Said it is just premenopause and I just need to \"deal with it. and said \"see you in a year.\" Something is wrong. I can't explain it but I know in my heart something is wrong. How can I find a dr who will take the time to listen to my concerns and talk to me. There is no history of breast cancer in my family. They did discover hyperdysplasia on my cervix when I was 4 months pregnant with my son and after he was born I had kryosurgery done and have had clean PAPS since. What would you do????
