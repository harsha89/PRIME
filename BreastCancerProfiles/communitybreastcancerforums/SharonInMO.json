At the time, I had just lost 30 pounds through dieting/exercise.  Two weeks before, I had returned from a trip to Istanbul to meet my Internet boyfriend.   I'd had the mammo because I planned to quit my job (and insurance) and move to Istanbul for a year so we could date more conveniently.  Now  I \"knew\" we'd have no future together.  In fact, on my first shopping trip after diagnosis, I got only half a dozen eggs because I thought I wouldn't live long enough to use twelve! I also was afraid of chemo and really fought my doctor on whether it would actually help.  I was several states away from the nearest relative, and had three competition sports dogs to train and exercise.  Also, I wanted to protect my fertility, as I hadn't ever been married or had kids.  Finally, my doctor convinced me that it was better to be ALIVE than to be fertile. I'm sooooo glad I had chemo!  Now I can look forward to a long and wonderful life. My treatment was pretty extensive.  I had a lumpectomy, a port implanted, 4 AC, 12 Taxol, and 35 radiations, and am now doing 5 years of Tamoxifen.  AC chemo totally sucked.  I felt like I had the worst flu ever.   It wasn't really painful, but just a couple months of uninterrupted feeling queasy and having a throbbing headache.  Just as my symptoms were starting to fade, BANG!, another dose would be given.  Between surgery and chemo, my boyfriend proposed.  He called me every time I was in the chemo chair--from Turkey--and made me laugh my head off. Taxol was a breeze, and it was no worse than being given plain saline.  :-)  However, I was able to live on my own fine during even AC.  I had read so many comments online of people being \"too weak to cook,\" unable to walk up a flight of stairs, unable to get out of bed, etc.  I had never heard of anybody doing chemo when they lived alone.  Well, after each AC chemo, I did have to sleep for about 16 hours.  But other than that, I was able to continue my fanatical housecleaning, dog care, inter-state driving, and even took up jogging for the first time in my life.  I was a pharmaceutical chemist, and only used 11 sick days in 8 months of treatment.  I was able to walk the dogs at least a mile a day, and often much more than that.  I never once threw up.  The worst part of chemo overall was that I gained 10 pounds because of the anti-side-effect steroids.  But my doctor was right, and I lost it almost immediately after finishing my rads.  I haven't gained a single pound after almsot a year on Tamoxifen, either.  Between a couple of Taxol treatments, I flew to Turkey for a couple weeks.  My boyfriend and I drove all around the country, climbed exotic Greek ruins, and had a great time. Just before my final radiation, I slipped on the ice on my driveway and broke my wrist.  I moved to Istanbul later the same week.  Twelve days later, I got married with a wig, and with a huge plaster cast on my arm.  Needless to say, my husband is a WONDERFUL guy!  He's 28 years old, too.  Turks love kids, and we would like to have one.  My doctor said I can go off Tamoxifen for a year and try to have a kid before it's \"too late.\"  I had regular periods which ended about 2 months into chemo.  I've never had a sign of them coming back.  So we'll have to do some fertility treatments for sure. Anyway, just do the chemo and don't look back.  You will have crappy side effects, but they'll be a distant memory about 6 months from now.  Sharon in Istanbul",

I was Dx 4/21/07, Stage 3A, Grade 2, 4/7 nodes, ER+/PR+ HER2-.  While going through treatment, I got engaged to my much younger Turkish fiance, an engineer in Istanbul.  And as soon as I finished my last rads in late Dec., I boarded a plane and moved here to Istanbul permanently. I've been here for 5 weeks, and our wedding was on Jan. 12th.  (I'm 43, no kids, this is the first marriage for us both).  We are having a great time, and Istanbul is a wonderful city. I had been going bare-headed throughout chemo/rads in the U.S.  I went bald to work, to stores, etc.  Here, even though my hair is in the 3/4\" long swirling guinea pig stage, I wear a wig outside of the house.  I look very obviously foreign with an auburn, short-haired wig, too, as the style here is to have very long wavy hair. I just started working as an English teacher last week for a name-brand language school.  They don't know I had cancer, and nobody seems to notice I'm wearing a wig.  I can't wait until my hair grows out a bit.  I'm sick to death of this scratchy wig, never having worn one in the U.S....  And I can't wear a scarf here, as that is always a religious/political statement in Turkey--the source of protest marches. By the way, my hair had been long, dark brown, wavy, and had about 10 gray hairs prior to chemo.  It came in salt and pepper, with 100% gray hairs framing my face.  I died it before I came here.  Does anybody know if the gray will always be there? Also, anybody else here on Tamoxifen?  I started Tamoxifen 3 weeks ago.  I heard it caused weight gain, but I'm eating like a pig here in Turkey and am losing weight. America:  low-fat or no-fat everything, 19 years of being a vegetarian, 2-4 miles daily walks, no meds....   weight = 154. Turkey:  full-fat everything, meat fried in olive oil and slathered with cheese, a pint of ice cream a day, walking maybe 1 mile a day and on Tamoxifen...   weight = 146. Anybody else on Tamoxifen?  What has your experience been? Well, that's all for now.  Now that I have Internet access, I'm looking forward to reading the forum more regularly. Sharon in Istanbul",
