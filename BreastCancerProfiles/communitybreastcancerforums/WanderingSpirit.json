Yesterday's PET scan revealed a spot high on my liver that lit up, and other smaller spots not lighting up. I have my history on my profile. I start my first chemo Monday July 27th- Carboplatin and Abraxane. Before that I was on hormonals that worked for a bit: Arimiedex I got 10 mths, Aromisin and Affinitor I got 6 months, Faslodex I was on 3 months and it never worked at all. So now on to my first chemo in many years. I did A/C (4 rounds) and Taxotere (4 rounds)in 2002-2003 when I was first DX'd with Stage IIIa. Lumpectomy, 4 positive lymph nodes out of 26 removed, and had the 8 chemos and 33 rads back then. Cancer \"free\" until June 2013. Anyone have any advice for the liver mets and the Carboplatin/Abraxane I'm starting? HELP! I'm 56.

In June 2013 my Tumor Markers on 27/29 were 900! I was started on Arimidex (got 9 months on that and dropped to 200 range).. Then Aromisin/Affinitor (got 6 months), then Faslodex shots (failed miserably, Tms shot to 900 again.) in July 2015. Onc started me on chemo immediately. PET scan showed now in liver! (It was extensive bone mets only). November PET showed bone mets calmed down (not lighting up) and liver mets gone. However, a spot lit up under my jaw. I had a panorex x ray with my dentist, nothing. I had an MRI of my head, nothing. We were going that the PET scan may have been a fluke. Thought this was smooth sailing. After 5 months on Carboplatin/Abraxane, tms went to 592 but last night (Dec 23) onc called to tell me to tell me that TMs rose to 678. He wants me to finish my cycle on Carbo/Abraxane because it's Christmas time, then in January as soon as insurance approves, another PET scan and tm test. Then he was talking about going to Xeloda. I asked him how many chemo are left, he said Xeloda, Gemzar, Navelbine, Herudin (sp on that one?) and maybe more. Question: what chemos have you been on, what are the SEs and how long did it work?

I had a lumpectomy of my right breast (3 cm tumor) and 4 positive lymph nodes of the 26 removed. After the lumpectomy I had  8 rounds of chemo (4 A/C and 4 Taxotere) and 33 rads and 5 years from 2003-08 on Arimidex. I was ER positive, PR Neg and Her 2 neg. In late June 2013, I thought my \"pneumonia\" that I had in May was back but instead it was pleural effusion of my right lung. At that time I had thoracentisis and they drew 900 ml of fluid, and it's still gone except a tiny bit. That same week, my onc gave me the bad news that the fluid had cancer cells in it and sent me the next week for further testing. He also put me right back on Arimidex. I am still ER+, PR-, Her 2-. The first week in July I had an MRI of my brain, an \"eyes to thighs\" Pet scan and a tumor markers test. The results were that I had a few positive lymph nodes in my chest, no organ involvement, but lots of bone mets: Skull, sternum, ribs, spine, pelvis, tail bone, upper left arm. Tumor markers were astronomical at 898 when first taken! So far the markers have dropped when tested every two months, but last check in Dec they were still at 136 point something. The PET Scan in October showed \"significant regression\" everywhere but tailbone and upper left arm. The lymph nodes were resolved. Still slight pleural effusion, but the onc says it's nothing to worry about. I began Xgeva shots in October 2013. This Friday, Feb 21,  I go back for my 3rd PET scan and my every other month tumor marker test. I want to be NED so badly but I don't know any other woman just like me with this many bone mets. My onc. wants me on Arimidex as long as possible and then \"when\" it fails, switch to something else. Chemo is my last resort this time. I trust him because he's up on lots of drugs and didn't fail me before. Is there ANYONE like me with extensive bone mets that is just ER positive? Anyone on Arimidex? How long has anyone \"lasted\" like this?  My onc will not give me a time frame or as someone says, an \"expiration date\". I asked if he had patients like me alive after 5 years he said yes, I said 10, he said some. But he has only been at that practice for 11 years so he has no others right now who are longer living. I did call the office one night last year and another dr said he just lost a patient who lived 17 years with mets, didn't say where. HELP. I need friends on here, I need encouragement, I need to know what to expect. Please write!

      "Content": "WanderingSpirit wrote: Hi, I've been on here a while now and posted a good bit. I've even started a topic before. Hopefully some of you have read my story already. Here's the shortest version I can manage and explain my situation: I had Stage IIIa b.c. in  Nov 2002,  had a lumpectomy, 8 chemos, 33 rads, 5 years on Arimidex. I was in total remission. ER positive, PR negative, Her2 negative.  In June 2011 I had some random pain in my body, went to my primary dr, was sent to a rheumatologist, and was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease that causes muscle pain, Dermatomyositis (like Lupus). I was put on Methotrexate pills for a while then all of a sudden I got \"better\". I got off the Methotraxate May 2013. In mid May I couldn't breathe well and I thought I had pneumonia. I saw a different primary doctor and was put on antibiotics. I seemed to improve but suddenly couldn't breathe well again in late June. That's when a CT scan of my thoracic area was ordered by my primary care doctor. That night it picked up pleural effusion on my rt. lung (900 ml was drained the next day) and \"spots\" on my spine.  So I was sent to my onc that week ( saw him on June 28) who told me my cancer was back and it was stage IV.  Still ER+, PR-, Her2-. He ordered an MRI of the brain (it was clear) and PET scan \"eyes to thighs\" on July 2nd. PET scan then showed extensive metastatic lesions to skull, spine, ribs, pelvis, sternum, tailbone, upper left arm (too many to count, per onc.). A few positive lymph nodes in my chest, and some remaining fluid around the right lung. So I began Arimidex (generic Anastrazole) June 28th again. Slowly things got better. My tumor markers dropped. A  PET scan last Oct (or thereabouts) showed \"significant regression\". I was supposed to start Xgeva last July but I had to have oral surgery to remove 3 bad teeth (ouch). So I was given the go ahead to begin Xgeva shots October 2013. Things are even better since. My PET scan in Feb. 2014 showed that NOTHING lit up this time. I still have slight effusion around rt.lung/heart (onc is not worried) and my tumor markers are still too high (136 I think), but they were 898 in June 2013! Now I need to know what to expect with the Xgeva from others who have been on it a while. I take the shots every month. Tell me your stories please. How long have you been on it? How often do you get the shots? Any success with it? Any side effects?  I seem to have more constipation that won't resolve no matter what (can't tell which drug is doing this). I have gained a lot of weight since the Xgeva. Could this be because the bones are healing and thickening up? How long can I stay on this? I've read some women don't get it monthly. Does it still work? Any information is appreciated.
