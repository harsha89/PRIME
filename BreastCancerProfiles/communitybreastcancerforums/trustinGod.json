    "Content": "trustinGod wrote: I've readÂ herceptin has a better outcome when taken along with chemotherapy (usually on 4th chemo) I was due to have chemo along with herceptin followed by a lumpectomy. I told my oncologist I would now prefer to have bilat mastectomy instead of lumpectomy. He has now reccomended waiting til after surgery before taking herceptin. Has anyone had mastectomy and a reconstruction while on herceptin? I am worried whether this is going to lessen my chances fo survival. Please advise Thank you Dx 1/2011, IDC, 3cm, Grade 3, 0/8 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
