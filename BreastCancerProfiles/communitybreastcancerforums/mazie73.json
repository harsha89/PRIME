I did have a skull met closer to the back of my head, but it's disappeared with treatment (clinical trial of Abemaciclib + pi3k inhibitor + faslodex). I haven't brought up the pain to my MO, but scans haven't shown any new skull mets. Honestly, I've attributed the pain to the fact that I spend a lot of time hunched over a computer and it's probably nerve pain.",

Three scans showed consistent improvement \u2014 the clinical trial folks measured a 56 percent reduction in tumor size. But, the last scan showed stable disease. My oncologist was happy with those results, as was my clinical trial coordinator. But, I'm not happy. I'm worried that this is evidence the medication has stopped working and we'll see disease progression on the next scan. My oncologist explained that this likely isn't the case, and that she has patients whose results will show stable disease for years. I'm still freaking out. Any advice? I'm seeing a therapist at my cancer center, and I have an appointment tomorrow. I'm sure she'll tell me that this is another example of my tendency toward catastrophic thinking. \u200bCurrently on a clinical trial at UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center: Abemaciclib + Pi3 kinase inhibitor + Faslodex Dx 8/2013, IDC, Right, 3cm, Stage IIA, Grade 3, 0/7 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Surgery 9/23/2013 Lymph node removal: Sentinel; Mastectomy: Right; Prophylactic mastectomy: Left Chemotherapy 1/28/2014 Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide), Taxotere (docetaxel) Surgery 5/15/2014 Reconstruction (left); Reconstruction (right) Hormonal Therapy 5/21/2014 Tamoxifen pills (Nolvadex, Apo-Tamox, Tamofen, Tamone) Dx 12/2016, Stage IV, metastasized to bone/lungs, ER+/PR+, HER2- Hormonal Therapy 2/4/2017 Faslodex (fulvestrant), Zoladex (goserelin) Targeted Therapy Verzenio Log in to post a reply",

I found out I was allergic to Codeine after a tonsillectomy when I was 19 (that *was not* pretty). I was prescribed Vicodin after my mastectomy and I was a little wary, since Vicodin and Codeine are both opioids. Not only did Vicodin do nothing for the pain; it made me feel nauseous. Fortunately, Tylenol was all I needed (thanks to recommendations from ladies on this discussion group). I brought up my problem with Vicodin when I had my reconstruction and got a prescription for Percocet. It's what they prescribe folks who are allergic to Codeine, because it's a synthetic opioid. It worked beautifully\u2014and I only had to take it for four days. Best of luck to y'all. ",

If you get bad news (hoping you won't), I think you'll be amazed by how you're able to get through it all. I was reading an article recently, written by a doctor who was diagnosed with cancer. He quoted a line from a Samuel Beckett play that had become his mantra: \"I can't go on. I'll go on.\" I've kind of adopted that, too. One foot in front of the other. I just finished chemo last week. Would I have rather not gone through any of this? Of course. But I've learned so much along the way.  Here's a great blog on breast cancer by a young woman from Toronto: http://passmeanothercupcake.com",

Diarrhea is the only significant side effect, and some tiredness every now and then. Unlike Ibrance, there's no off week. Moderators: can you add Abemaciclib to the list of targeted therapies",
