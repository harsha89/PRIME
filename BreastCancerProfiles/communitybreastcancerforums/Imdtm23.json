I will see BS every 6 months for the next couple years then every year. I will see MO every 3 to 6 months while I am on tamoxifen. She will do blood work, normal labs no markers. If I report any problems like bone pain or anything, she will send me for a scan or to another specialist. They do not do scans for BC like they do for other cancers. Her reason is that its too much radiation. I reported to her that I have been feeling a flutter near my heart and she is sending me to a Cardiologist Oncologist. ",
