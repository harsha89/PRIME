My OC wants me to do Tamox 5 years. I do not want to do this drug. I feel that for a stage 1 I have done plenty! I am already having terrible chemo induced menopause at age 42 - including hot flashes that make me feel ill every hour day and night. Has anyone else said no to Tamoxifen? I am VERY sensitive to meds so side effects are a big concern for me. I am now looking to natural healing for my maintenance program (Vit D3, Lignans in flaxseed, low sugar and high raw veggie diet) My OC will not listen to any of the natural healing methods to reduce risk of re-occurance. Thanks Ladies!",
