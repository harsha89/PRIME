Everytime I read your posts I am impressed, not only by your strength, but also by you being able to admit some weakness and fears on the way, such an important healing point in my opinion! A big thank you for the warm welcoming and your kind wishes! SBKH, as for looking at the boobs, while not that often as you :-), I also looked at them a lot! I also said goodbye to my left breast before surgery and shed some tears while thanking it for the many years of service and for feeding my two babies that good! I know it sounds weird, but that's what I did, what can I say! Leatherette, please tell me more about the cornstarch (edited) after shaving! What is that about? I havent' shaved for a week due to sensitivity and pain when touching my armpit and I am kind of embaressed to go to the doc tomorrow- stupid, I know! Illimae I wish you a fast recovery!!! As for preparetions, on top of the botton up soft pyjamas I would recommend getting them one or more numbers bigger than usual so they will not be tight on the armpit area. I had a couple of pyjamas and tops I couldn't wear because they were so thight there (never noticed that before!) As for me, in about a month I'll be turning 40 and my children are only 5 and 7 years young. They are staying with my parents for the time being as I didn't want to scare them with my drains and I didn't tell them too much about the surgery. I am beginning to miss them more and more, and knowing that I will not being able to hold them as tight as I used to for some time is so frustrating! Hopefully I will get my drains out tomorrow so I will be able to join them right after that (they think they are on summer vacations at the beach as every year)!!! As time goes by I am getting really anxious about the pathology report that is due today or tomorrow... Recovery is good, but the drains don't really help with that. I also get some burning and itching sensations in my removed breast area, but it's not something that you can't bare, just very very annoying... I am sending to all of you hugs, positive energy and keeping you in my prayers! Daphne P.S. Sorry for any mistakes, English is not my native language!",

I was able to find support and help from so many of you without you even knowing it! So a big thank you to all you amazing women!!! As for me, I just had my mastectomy done (left) on Wednesday, after a dcis (multifocal) diagnosis. I had also a few lymph nodes removed, which seem to be clear as for now (final results to be in on Thursday). Also, I didn't have reconstruction for now, but I do keep this door open for the future, although I don't want to even think about more surgery at this point. So I am now at home, walking around with my drains and counting the days until I'll get the biopsy results. The surgery went fine, I did have and continue to have some pain and discomfort on the chest and armpit area, but furtunately nothing that can't be handled. Best wishes to anyone that has undergone or is scheduled to undergo treatment! May it all be a distant memory soon!",

As for the vacation to relax at a beach (even if we can't get into the water or have a sunbath), that's always a good idea :-) Leatherette\u2026 thanks for the info! I went back to my previous message to edit and correct it so nobody gets confused :-) SusanGA, thank you!!! All the best to you, too!! jeannemg, it does happen. The margins can only be determined with the biopsy as far as I know... but other ladies might be of more help here! Wish you all the best! Keep being strong everyone! Hugs to all, Daphne",

There was a small IDC in the breast that was removed! Only 0.7cm big, but there it was.... missed by mammogramms, ultrasounds and biopsies, even lumpectomy! I really am somewhat shocked! I thought it would all be over now, but instead I made an appointment with an oncologist now... most probably he will suggest only tamoxifen, according to my BS (ER+/PR+, HER- if I get the lingo right) and not chemo, but we will see... Well the good news is that I had clean margins so it's all gone... and of course that I did opt for mastectomy!!! Hugs to everyone!",

After the lumpectomy I changed my BS, so the new one suggested to take new mammos and ultrasounds, to determine if I had more microcalcifications, in order to manifest the need for a mastectomy. So while the mammo and US showed that all the major microcalcifications where gone with the lumpectomy, it also showed some minor microcalcifications in other parts of the breast. The US showed another suspicious area above the lumpectomy (not as microcalcifications and not indicated on mammo) and a suspicious lymph node, so due to my history we had FNA biopsies done there. That showed multifocal DCIS (inconclusive for lymph node) again and so we proceeded with the mastectomy and SNB, since the BS said I had high risk to develop IDC (over 50%). And since I have very dense breasts, which could hide cancer, we were more confident then ever to proceed...I, too, have many cysts and often very lumpy and painful breasts, so that' s another reason for me to think about my other breast now... for the time being my BS proposed close monitoring of the other breast ... we will see... SBKH, biopsies really suck... and the waiting is so horrible... feeling with you!!! JenRuns good thing you did the MRI! I did one last year, after my first mammo showed microcalcifications, but it didn't catch a thing. All about what type of cancer it is, as you said! Hope all goes well with your treatment! jeannemg, I can't give you specifics, but really ask anything that is on your mind! It's a good way to avoid sweating over unimportant - in the end - stuff! Don't hold back! As for my recovery, I developed a seroma and swelling... since I have/had small boobs, it almost looks like I had recon - which I hadn't! I hope it will disappear without leaving anything behind, the mastectomy scar and not havin a boob is bad enough, I don't need knots or dog ears there!!! Hugs and positive energy to all! Daphne",

I was just wanting to add something about dense breasts I didn't see anywhere, I just remebered my BS saying, that allthough I have dense breasts, having the suggested by him digital tomosynthesis mammogram should be better then a regular mammogram... I found a related article on breastcancer.org (www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/... about that, but it doesn't mention anything about dense breasts... Actually, I just saw that I had one and it did see an abnormallity to biopsy (which was biopsied but it revieled only DCIS), approximately where the IDC was found after the mastectomy... maybe it's worth asking your docs about it? Take care everybody!!!",
