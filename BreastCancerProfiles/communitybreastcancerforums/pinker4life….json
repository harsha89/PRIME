This is the second time in my life going thru chemo. First bout was when I was 20 yo for hodgekins. Could it be that my follicles are damaged? I have tried everything. Prednisone foam, all types of oils ie rosemary, castor oil, emu oil, etc.. I just orderd Thymuskin because I heard it helps with hair regrowth for chemo patients. Has this happened to anyone else? My doctors are stumped as to why my hair has not grown back and frankly, so am I.",
