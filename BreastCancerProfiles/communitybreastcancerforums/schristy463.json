I actually always thought I wouldn't know a lump if I felt it cause I was already so lumpy, but I did notice it.   Also, my aunt died of breast cancer in her early 50s or late 40s. Now the lump feels bigger to me and to my husband.  Was the size of a pea, now maybe a dime.  It has only been about 3 months, maybe less since I saw him.  I plan to call him back. I was changing insurance and had to wait til I got my insurance cards.  I got them today.  I want to call, but I have fear and anxiety and I know it is better to act quickly, even if to find out there is nothing wrong so I can stop worrying, but I feel like I know that this is bad.   Anyway I am not sure why I am posting here. Maybe just to vent worries to people who have gone through this or are going through it.  Thanks for \"listening.\" Log in to post a reply",
