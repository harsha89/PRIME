I ask because I go tomorrow to a breast surgeon to rule out IBC and did put my morphea (which I wonder if these lesions could be) meds on the lesions they faded to almost zero.  I've stopped and they came back.  I want the surgeon to see them as is, but I do wonder about that...could cortesteroid treatment make those lesions fade or disappear?

Pain in my breast is deep at times (near chest wall) and other times it just feels like an all over burning/itching. I've been to my regular gyno 2 x now and he feels it is my fibrous tissue making some changes that is causing the pain (54 years old, dense breasts, total hysterectomy 8 years ago).  He looked at the indent in the nipple and feels there is no issue there either.  Just changes in breast tissue and thus the indent. He did suggest I see a breast surgeon for peace of mind.  My mother has double mastectomy for breast cancer on the 14th, she has cancer in both breasts and has had it in the left one time previously.  3 aunts with breast cancer, one of them IBC. I am vigilent with this but my body is telling me something is definitely wrong.  When it yells this loudly, I LISTEN. I'm just teary and scared and don't know what to do.  I'm typically the warrior, but this is ever present and so concerning. Log in to post a reply",
