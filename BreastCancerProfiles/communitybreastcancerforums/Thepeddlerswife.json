Also, is it true that you can be SE free for the first infusion and then get SE's on the second? Just wondering what to expect. Thanks, hope everyone is doing well. I think about all of you every day. xoxo Kim Dx 8/18/2011, IDC, Grade 3, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

They care, they listen. Right down to the Dr. placing port. Warm socks, warm air hooked up to the gown, and warm people. Made all the difference in the world. If our journey continues like this we will have the journey of a life time. Pain management was explained throughly. And so far so good. We'll see what tomorrow brings, but today is one for the memory book! Kim Dx 8/18/2011, IDC, Grade 3, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
