No chemo, and due to start Radiation Monday Jan. 3.  Am home from work today with sore throat and cough, and feeling discouraged/worried that this bug could delay start of radiation.  It has already been 3 months since my surgery.  Also am second-guessing my decision to not have BMX.  My regular surgeon of 8 years suggested BMX, but my oncologist thought it would be 'overkill' and the 2nd opinion from different breast surgeon thought the BMX would not make much difference in my risk for reoccurance. On my good days I am grateful for my good prognosis, but on my bad days I am baffled and blue about having this disease - it still seems very unreal and disorienting.    I live in Alaska and drive 50 miles each way to work, so have made arrangements to stay in town with a girlfriend once I get a few weeks into the radiation. Happy New Year to each of you - Debbie ",
