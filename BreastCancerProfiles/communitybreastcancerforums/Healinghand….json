I have my biopsy this Wednesday 5th and will be waiting patiently as I can for results.  I have been told the statitics of benign vs malignant. I have been trying to stay possitive and not worry, but the closer the day comes the more I seem to think about it. i have a good feeling that things will turn out alright, but it's nerve racking to wait.
