No methylparabens, at least nothing that says that or the synonyms that mean methylparaben. There are so many I don't know how we ever know exactly what is and isn't one. Anyhow, I am not sure this stuff is really meant for my hair and may be meant more for African or Indian texture, but I am going to keep using it until my hair is longer. Based on the ingredients, I think it would make a good general moisturizer. I slathered some on the foobs after my shower too. It is called Softee Indian Hemp hair and scalp treatment. Says its light and natural..not so much. Main ingredient is petrolatum (it has vaselineish kind of texture) but then has jojoba oil, sunflower oil,wheat germ oil, vitamin e, indian hemp oil, jaborandi oil, nettle oil, rosemary oil, birch oil, burdock oil, rosehips oil, irishmoss oil, coltsfoot oil, dandelion oil, yellow dock oil, elder flowers oil,brewers yeast oil,shavegrass oil,echinacea oil,wild cherry bark oil,nepeta Cataria. The only bad thing I can find is the second to last ingredient BHT, the preservative. I know it isn't good and can cause cancer in rats, but they are feeding them massive amounts. And they also use it in so much normal stuff I figure I unknowingly ingest itin the food preservatives. It is supposed to ensure maximum hair growth. LOL.  I am just going to slather away until my hair is just growing while I watch it!",

I had enough hair throughout the 12 weekly doses to get by and toward the end wore a baseball cap and never lost eyelashes or eyebrows. Two weeks after chemo up to four weeks, I started shedding hair again and lost my eyebrows and lashes. They were already growing in however and grew in literally in a week (at least the eyebrows). Eyelashes were also quick and seem thicker. Hair is another story. It is 13 weeks, and I have a covering, but that is about it. Top is about an inch but really not filled in well in spots, or so light it doesn't look filled in. Back and sides seem thicker, but are laying very flat to my head. I tried to spike it all with no luck. Then, I had the brilliant idea I would try a semi-permanent color rinse that washes out in 6-10 washes. Bought a blonde color and promptly turned the top of my head yellow. My husband gets a good laugh out of it. And it is taking much longer than 6-10 washes to go away! I'll be waiting until the end of October for my hair dresser now! I am also on Herceptin and thought that might slow things down, but I had hoped I would have a couple inches and be able to go without the wig. Hate the thought I might be wearing for another year! I'm not done with Herceptin until next March. I take biotin, multi, and b12 to help with hair growth. I've also tried Nioxin shampoo and scalp treatment. Not sure I think it does much. Ran across some kind of Hemp creme at the dollar store today that you put on your head and it is supposed to help your hair grow. Forgot to check for methylparabens...I am sure they will probably be there. Smells great!",

It's abiout two hours, with make up tips when you are going through chemo, etc.  You get a bag full of makeup. At mine, they passed around some hats that people had made that are great for just wearing around the house. Cotton and so soft.

I still had hair then so didn't try on the wig. It was shorter than my style so I didn't think I would ever wear it and just put it away. Got it out the other day and decided it was pretty cute.

I had some of the joint pain that special k noted when I went to the every three week dose dense herceptin. Also tired and some mld queasiness. Onc said I could go every week, but As special k noted, omaz mentioned increasing infusion time, so I thought I would start with that. It has helped immensely.",

Hair thinned significantly, but I could wear a baseball cap and get by for workouts. Eyelashes fell out mostly on the bottom right at the end, but they are growing back in. Brows just thinned. I am going to start latisse in the next week.  My plan, had they fallen out during chemo was to start it then and my onc was ok with it. I probably wouldn't start it in advance. I don't think it stops them from falling out.",
