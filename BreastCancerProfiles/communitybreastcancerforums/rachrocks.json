And about a month ago had swollen and sore boob aswell, although this has now gone. on monday im being sent for a biopsy of the discharge. apprently thy will inject dye into the breast and also insert a needle to get a sample... Im not too concerned about the results, more so th actuall test. Ive heard it is quite painfull. Is this true?...and also how effective is this test. Ive had mammo and ultrasound, and was told i have dense breast tissue. Also was noted s havin swollen duct. The radiologist said thi was very common in women who had breastfed. My doctor on the other hand wasnt impressed and wanted to know who reported on the scans and phoned them to get the cytology done. He also told me that due to my age 32, that mammo is an unreliable test. ( the mammo was ordered by a different doctor) Anyway enough rambling...some thoughts and comments would be great.
