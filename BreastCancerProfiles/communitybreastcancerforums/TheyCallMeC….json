Well, they only got 7 treatments within my desired time frame and they are at a different time every day. What a nightmare. Since most of my treatments are \"too early\", when I go home I need to get back on line and work and find myself still working at 6:00 pm. This is exactly what I was trying to avoid.

I needed both to get comfortable. They reduced my Neulasta dosage from 6 mg to 4 mg for the second treatment. (My WBC count went from 4-18). I think the pain was more manageable the second time around, but I also was more pro-active with the meds. I'm still following the Claritin regimen as well, although I'm not sure it is doing anything! It sounds like your trip to the Netherlands may have worn you out more than you think. Get more rest and drink as much as you can. I have discovered carbonated water on ice with a lemon wedge works for me. Have the standard instructions on thrush not worked for you? From day1-10 I do a salt water rinse a minimum of three times a day. So far so good for me. ( I know it is yucky, but if it works, it's worth it! Good luck, you can get through this!, ",

Well, she sent me home with a video she made on different head dress ideas and I spent some time last night sipping on a glass of wine, watching the video and experimenting with different scarves. Who knows, I may embrace the scarf thing yet! (I still ordered the wig!) I appreciate all the wonderful comments and advice I have seen on this Board. I've decided, based on comments here, that I should stock up on some Claritin to combat the Neulasta SEs. I'm curious to hear from those a little bit ahead of me about how working through treatment is working out. My employer has been very supportive and I am being set up with a home office. I manage a line of business in a bank and I couldn't imagine sitting on the sidelines for a few months. I'm already developing strategies to journal my decision making incase I develop Chemo brain! Keep up the positive thoughts and as they say \"Fake it until you make it!\"  ",

My MO has me scheduled to come in the day after each of my chemo treatments (4x T&C) for a Neulasta shot. I don't have any pre-meds to take. Apparently I'll get nausea meds and steroids in my IV. I have a couple of anti nausea prescriptions to take as needed. Anxious to get this started and get a better idea how this is all going to go.  ",

Based on everything I have heard, I am all set to have my regular hair dresser buzz me when the time comes. She has even offered to come to my house to do it. She said she would leave a 1/4 inch or so. So, I thought I had a plan. Then I met with my local wig lady. (Who I really liked btw). She really urged me not to get it all cut off and said that it is good to leave the wispy stuff around your hairline because it doesn't always all come out and having that stuff makes a wig look more natural. So... What do you all think",

First chemo treatment is tomorrow. Told my husband that I didn't want him spending the evening mowing the lawn because I thought tonight should be special. (Something along the lines that I go to the gas chamber in the morning and this will be my last supper.). I'm a bit of a foodie and am bummed that I may lose my sense of taste for the finer things in life! With that in mind, we are making Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi and opening an expensive bottle of wine. I've decided to save my liver to work thru the Chemo drugs, so have vowed to knock off the sauce for the duration. Woe is me! Picked up some Biotene on my way home. Do I start using it immediately or not until I have signs of mouth sores",

I was pretty tired from all the Benadryl they pumped through me, but otherwise the first couple of days were a breeze. My MO has me scheduled for a Neulasta shot after each treatment. It turns out that is what has caused me the worst side effects, not the chemo. I took the Claritin as recommended, but it didn't work for me. Sunday and Monday my legs really ached, especially over night. By Tuesday I had such severe back pain that I was using Lamaze breathing techniques to get thru the spasms. They put me on Tramadol and that coupled with Extra Strength Tylenol for 24 hours got me back to normal. I've consistently run a fever, but they are attributing that to the Neulasta too. Anyway, although the Neulasta SEs are lousy, I'm a testament that it works. At my worst on Tuesday my WBC count was 4.2. By today, it was high at 18.9. All that pain was my bone marrow on a workout. My NP says the worst is behind me. Hope so! I'm struggling with my optimism! I don't want to be a Debbie Downer with my friends and colleagues, yet I'm also realizing that this pillar of strength that I'm evoking isn't really letting them know that I could use a pick me up! I feel like I shouldn't ask someone to bring me a meal, you'd think they would already think that would be helpful! So, what am I doing? I'm making a big pot of Chicken and Wild Rice Soup for a friend with inoperable brain cancer tonight. I've had to sit out on my porch while it simmers, because the smell isn't doing it for me right now. So, I guess, rather than feeling sorry for myself, I'm doing something for some one else and that makes me feel good! Problem solved",

On Day 6 I was prescribed Tramadol for the pain and after taking it for 24 hours, I was pain free. By Day 9 I felt back to normal and have been back at 100% since. TC #2 is tomorrow. I tolerated the chemo well, but that Neulasta shot really got me. My hair started to go on Day 14 and by Day 16 was coming out in clumps. I had it cut way back and had my final wig fitting. I wore it when I was with friends over the weekend and I think they thought it was my real hair",

I'm planning to call my MO tomorrow to ask about it. Good news is that I'm starting to see some hair growth! December- I had a knot at my sentinel node scar site as well. It was suggested that I do some gentle massaging. That seemed to help. I have noticed that it flails up occasionally, maybe when I'm fighting off a slight cold? Started radiation yesterday! So far, so good! Best wishes to everyone! ",
