    "Content": "SusanCMI wrote: About five weeks ago, I found a small lump that felt like it was in the skin of my right breast. It didn't feel like I've read \"bad\" lumps are supposed to feel, so I waited through my next cycle to see if it changed. Four weeks later, I already had an appointment for something else with my doctor, so I asked her to check it out. She felt it and immediately said \"It feels like a fibrous band\" and referred me for a mammogram. I went in yesterday for a diagnostic mammogram. The lump I'd found is visible to the eye, but didn't show up on mammogram. However, two different masses did show up on the right side, and one on the left. In the black-ish field of my not-that-dense breasts, the \"new\" lumps were irregularly shaped and light gray. A radiologist at the hospital looked at the images while I waited and requested more focused pictures of the new lumps and an ultrasound to try to see the original lump. We did the second round of mammogram pictures, and then I had the ultrasound; the original lump still didn't show up, but I know it's there, because I can see it right now. Today is Friday, but since I haven't heard anything yet, I know I won't hear until at least Monday, and I am on pins and needles. Tomorrow is my 33rd birthday. I know all I can do until next week is wait, but any words of advice would be welcome! I don't know what to think, but I know I don't want to be told to \"wait six months and recheck\".
