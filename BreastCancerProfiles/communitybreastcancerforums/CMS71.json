I have implants, I don't want radiation and I don't want a mastectomy....Oh, and I don't want cancer ;) I think a mastectomy is what I'll end up doing. However, I'm super concerned about my breasts not matching. Yes, I know that sounds shallow in light of the true concerns cancer presents, but I guess its what makes me feel better.",

My surgery date is August 22nd. I'm scheduled for a mastectomy. My doctors have given me the choice of either a lumpectomy or a mastectomy. I originally said I want a mastectomy, but now I don't know what I want. They have warned me about the possible side effects of radiation and implants. My doctors did not tell that if there were complications they would just \"clean it up and put in new implants.\" I think I better get another opinion. I would like to do as little as possible, but I lean toward a mastectomy because I have Triple Negative and apparently my re-occurrence rate is about 50%. These decisions are so hard. I hope all goes well for you. Keep us posted.",
