My lumpectomy showed Invasive ductal in Left breast stage 1 and Lubular DCIS in Both Breasts. That was the determining factor in the double mastectomy. I was 41 at the time of Dx with No family History going back 3 generations on all sides of family. Was ER/PR Hu2 Neg. I had reconstruction and was completed with implants in 2009. Had CT scan with and Without Contrast. Was Negative.. Yahoo.. Then, May 2010 I found a Small Lump just under the scar on the left breast. My Plastic Surgeon removed it, expecting it to be Scar Tissue. Nope.. It was Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, AGAIN.. Had Full body MRI scan with some radioactive dye and I was Negative.. THANK GOD!!! It Only came back Local.  June, 2010 I started Cytoxan and Taxol 4 rounds every 21 days. I have had 2 rounds and am 10 days away from 3rd round.. that means I am 31 days from the Last Dose!!! Almost Done After round 1, I slept most of the day and the following. Was given Phnergan for nausa that I might get. I was soo scared of getting it, I took it every 4 hrs for the first 48 hrs post chemo. Didn't get sick at all, don't know if I would of without the meds. I was fine until day 4, then began to feel Flue like. I called and made an appt for day 5 for a Colonic. Felt worse on day 5. Had Colonic and Felt 110% better afterwards and continued to feel Great. Day 9 or 10 I woke up with the begining of Thrush. Looking at natural alternatives, I gargled with Coloidal Silver. was gone in 2 days. I was Sooo Happy it worked. I did Not want to put more drugs into my body, if there is even 1 for thrush. Went well until Day 15. My head started itching, and hair started falling out. By day 17, I woke up in the morning and it was GONE..  Wow, that was FAST. Still had my eye brows and most eye lashes. Under arm hair was gone. Round 2 of Chemo was July 16th. All went pretty similar except I started to notice that I was short of breath when walking and talking. Called Onc and he wasn't concerned. I figured in advance that seeing I felt fluish after round 1, I would in round 2, so I planned for a Colonic but on day 4 this time. I was constipated again, so the colonic took care of that and I never felt fluish this time. Slept again that day and day 2. My WBC's were on the low side of normal before this round, so I had to go back on day 2 for a Neupigen Shot to help Boost em up. There are 10 more days now until round 3 and so far I feel GREAT. I am a little tired is all.  Almost forgot: Day 6 of this round I was out in the sun for less than 10 minutes. It was about 90-95 (southern california Summer) and in that little amount of time I got Heat Exhausted and almost passed out. Now I \"Get it\" when they tell me to stay out of the sun and heat. I don't know if anyone else has had this issue, but, for me, it scared the heck out of me to almost pass out. I have had heat exhaustion in the past, but, Never has it happened in that Short amount of time.  Everyone reacts to Chemo differently. I know for whatever reason, I am lucky and am not having many side effects. I was begining to wonder if they gave me chemo or Saline. When my hair all fell out, that answered that question.",
