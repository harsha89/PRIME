I'm pretty new to this... and still dealing with it. The only thing I can say for sure... as hard as it is for me as well... try not to over think things! It sucks... none of us asked for this cancer crap or want to deal with it... but trust me... as hard as it may seem... we WILL get through this. And before you know it, we'll have 'bigger better boobs\" Ha Ha... at least that's what I am focusing on...!! :)",
