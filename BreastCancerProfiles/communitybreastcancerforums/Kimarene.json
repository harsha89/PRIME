I can relate to terrified.  My only advice is to keep busy, try not to worry too much (right!), keep (or start) exercising, and have a positive attitude.  Jeez, everything I write seems so stupid and trite.  There is nothing I can say to lessen your apprehension, except to point out that breast cancer is treatable and there are many people on this site who can attest to that.",
