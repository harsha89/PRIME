Thanks to Alyad for starting it. I just finished #3 of 32 (23 whole breast, 9 boost). I had lumpectomy 4/3 then 4 rounds of T/C (my oncotype was 22 so they recommended chemo) -- finished chemo 7/20. So happy to be on the other side of the chemo that I'm a bit in denial of the radiation! I LOVE the mohawk pictures-- you guys look amazing!  Betsy, I was given a prescription for 2 bras and a camisole (which looks to me like a super soft sports bra)-- they had said no bra was preferable, but I teach so I said I could not that!  I was pretty happy about free bras. So far the radiation has been quick-- in and out in 15 minutes or so.  I use aquaphor at night (yucky and greasy but it was what they preferred) and 100% aloe in the morning as it is not greasy and it dries evenly.  I actually put it on my lovely peach fuzz as I read somewhere that aloe stimulates hair growth... I can only hope. Hugs and happy weekend to everyone Helen",

Done with #10 out of 33 (9 of them will be the famous boost).  So far so good-- my left side just feels wierd, the skin feels tight somehow, but I am not red.  The scar aches a bit.  I am using aquafor at night and aloe during the day.  I was told initially that they would miss my heart and would only clip the top of my left lung (tumor was inside of left breast very deep to chest wall like Ravenruth).  Now I find out that the decision was made to hit the top of the heart in order to get the tumor bed that was so close to chest wall.  I was a bit shocked that my opinion was not solicited-- I would have agreed to do it as the argument goes that it is better to kill the cancer now and worry about heart and lung problems 15-20 years down the road-- but I would have liked to have been consulted rather than have it presented as a done deal.  Radiation is so creepy-- so invisible-- at least with the chemo you could see the posion going into your body....  I have found a roll on deodorant (Crystal is the name brand) that is aluminium free, fragrance free etc-- I found that the Toms of Maine solid was rough to put on-- I felt like I was dragging it across my armpit which could not be good for it. LoriR--I am up all night all the time with hot flashes from hell-- so it is hard to tell how much is fatigue and how much is lack of sleep. I have not slept more than 4 hours at a time since I was diagnosed....Work is tough--chemo brain still in full efffect:( Big hugs to everyone! Helen",

My hair is growing back but is is so so so slow--chemopause sucks and tamoxifen is next-- yeah.  Skin holding up with 100% aloe and aquaphor and a glass of red wine every night (my rads dr. printed out the red wine study for me and told me to try it!). I was told NO antioxidants during rads-- not even green tea which I love. I got my flu shot Friday on orders from oncologist and was told I would need to get the Swine flu shot as soon as it was available. Hang in there everyone--we are going to get through this!

My energy level really dropped my last week of whole breast zaps and I am still really tired  --my energy level has tanked--.  The appointment itself for the boost is much faster.  They don't have to line you up so particularly as they do with the whole breast (in my case at least) -- the only zap me in one position and they only hit a small area around my scar.  I am getting very red on that one spot, but the rest of my skin that was red and blotchy, that is no longer being radiated, looks a lot better.I will be done on Friday!  Hang in there everyone.
