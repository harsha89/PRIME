My mom recently had a mammogram which should a lump in her breast, she then had an ultrasound with pointed towards a fibroadenoma. We went for a second opinion and they suspected a fibroadenoma as well but wanted to do a core biopsy. That was done about 2 weeks ago and the results came back as a 9mm fibroadenoma with atypical cells. The dr. now wants to remove the lump for further testing. My question is how much discomfort will my mom be in? The lump is in the left breast and due to a stroke a few years ago she has no use of her right arm so using her left arm is crucial. Also can a fibroadenoma be monitored and what are the risks of later developing breast cancer? Thanks for your imput. Log in to post a reply",
