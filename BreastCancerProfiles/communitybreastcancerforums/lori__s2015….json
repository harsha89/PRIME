I began chemo October 2014 and had to stop 2 months later due to infected port. Since the cancer is slow growing the oncologist decided to try meds again and stop chemo. I have had chronic pain in my back and legs for years prior to all this. Now however it has spread to all major joints, my hip being the worst. Pain doctors say it's arthritis but I believe it is so much worse because of the meds and the chemo. I too had to have the Lunista after the chemo infusions. That is when my hip and shoulders joined my back in pain. I currently am taking high doses of pain meds and may have a pump put in to control the pain. During the chemo I went from being able to walk to now using a walker and even a wheelchair when I go out with the family. I'm going to begin PT again and see what happens. I'm glad to know I'm not alone. Is there anything that can be done? It sounds like many of us are going through this.",

Where do you get emu oil? Actually it sounds like all my joints could use oil. I make a lot of crunching noises when I move. I can not walk without the walker, however I do try to keep moving. Friends keep telling me to hang in there. What else can I do but keep trying.",
