I have one expander over expanded, and one still flat to help with radiation angles. It's scary at first, and I dreaded looking under the bandages. But I now feel pretty normal being nippleless. The drains are so awful, the devil himself must have made those. The expanders are so strange. My one expanded foob is hard as a rock. I will have my swap in May. I can't wait, my two year old loves to sit in my lap and use me as a pillow, which cannot be comfortable with a rock hard pillow lol.",

I'm not sure about the DIEP flap, that wasn't something my plastic surgeon talked about. He said we would only look at that possibility if my skin doesn't do well during radiation. So far so good. I am thinking about the nippple reconstruction also. I was talking to my husband and I think we've decided that the tattoo is the best option. It's one less time to go under for a surgery. Plus you will not have any sensation in the reconstructed nipple, so I think it would be a weird skin tag kind of. IDK just my opinion. The 3D tattoos look pretty outstanding!",

I worry about the future, but am hopeful and so is my oncologist. My tumor was 2cm with 12 positive nodes.",

Every doctor I've talked to recommends something different. I'm not opposed to the hysterectomy for a peace of mind knowing I cannot get cervical cancer. Idk, I just take it one day at a time. My oncologist told me that I will stop taking tamoxifen after I have my ovaries removed and start some new 10 year drug that gives better results for pre menopausal women. I cannot remember the name of it though.... I will ask next time I see him. I am a little concerned that my oncologist doesn't recommend any scans or blood work ever. I like the idea of a routine check where you can have a visual.",

I will have 33 treatments in total. I had chemotherapy, surgery, and now rads. I'm on tamoxifen, and it's not bad at all. Although the chemotherapy already put me into menopause. My next big decision is to remove my ovaries or do a full hysterectomy to keep my body from producing estrogen. Idk what to choose.",
