Went in for first mammo last week and report came back with prominent cluster of pleomorphic microcalcification in left breast and less prominent cluster in right and a Birads Category 4. It seems as though everything I read with pleomorphic tends to be more to the malignant side of things. I go to the breast specialist tomorrow to talk about biopsy, but really seem to be losing my cool while waiting. My mom passed away 3 yrs ago to BC along with my grandmother.Has anyone else had a similar finding on mammo and if so, what were your results. Thanks for any info, support, etc. I can't stand the waiting!!! Log in to post a reply",

She has scheduled me for biopsy on both breasts friday and will have the results back on monday. Other than the microcals they found what appeared from the radiologist as just a normal cyst. Today, the dr said she didn't like the appearance of the cyst/lump and it appears to be associated with the microcals. They also found some microcals in the right but are sending me back tomorrow to have a full diagnostic mammo on that side. Other than the worry, I am overall pleased with the quickness. They rearranged some schedules to get me in on Friday.",
