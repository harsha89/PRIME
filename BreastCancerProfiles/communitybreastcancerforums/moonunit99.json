I developed a huge Hematoma that has filled my whole breast as a result, and the MRI and Surgery has been delayed because of this. I have bad bruising and still have pain. The Biopsy was excruciatingly painful (i swear they forgot the Lidocane) still I am soo scared and my anxiety is off the charts!  How normal is it to have an MRI postponed due to a large Hematoma plus the surgery  postponed due to this issue??  The swelling doesn't appear to be going anywhere anytime soon. Also  My Breast Surgeon  said the MRI needs to be scheduled 7-10 days after my Menstrual cycle. Does all of this sound normal?   I'm overwhelmed and quite honestly so confused with all the info I have been reading.    ",
