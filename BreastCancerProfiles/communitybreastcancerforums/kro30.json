It was my mother actually who is the survivor. I was searching my email inbox for something she randomly sent me, I it scrolled back to 2008 when she was diagnosised. I actually found the email from her when we were waiting for the biopsy report. Then I wasted the entire first part of my day at work reading emails from October 2008 through today, and I can't believe that I have forgotten how my entire life during those 9 months revolved around cancer, and I never once ever thought I'd have to remind myself that it actually happened. From the volume of emails that were sent back and forth, I can't fathom how I wasn't fired from job!  So I want to stay as active as possible, because I learned so much during that time and it's the comfort of knowledge that helps during the inital phases. MDG - I am sure as you approach a month you're still exhausted and anxious, and you're diagnosis was my mom's exact except she was just a little into Stage 2 due to the size. She also on the same day was diagnosised with skin cancer. It was a banner week. It was Labor Day 2008. So we're all here for you!",

But what I didn't know then, that I do now, is that through the remarkable research and treatment available, that 2.5 years later, I have to remind myself that we were just starting chemo in January '09, and it seems like a lifetime ago. And I can't believe I have to remind myself to come back to a place that held me together for so long. I remember being on the boards back then, in this chat area for the recently diagnosised,  and I always promised myself I'd return after words to share words of hope and encouragement, and I am disappointed in myself for not doing so. This board got us all through those times, and I wanted to check in and say hello and that 2.5 years later, there's a bright light at the end of the tunnel. It takes a really long time though to see it, but it's there. Log in to post a reply",

She has seen some suspect moles and skin tags throughout the past few years, but nothing serious. I hope you're doing well!!!",
