So far I have avoided the dreaded nausea....just tired like the rest of us.  I take emend and dexamethasone for the nausea.  I took Neulasta yesterday and I am starting to feel the effect of it.  I am shaking like a leaf. If anyone else is having SE's from Neulasta please let me know. I made an appointment to cut my hair but cancelled it hoping that I will not be affected too badly. Sharon",

In regard to the rest of the SE's I take Emend and Dexametasone and have not had one day of nausea.  In regard to the Neulasta shot, I take one  Aleve before the shot and two a day for three days and have not had any discomfort yet.

This is day 3 following first chemo treatment and day 2  following Neulasta. I am having the usual side effects..headaches, fatigue and weakness but no nausea, thank goodness.  I am having the shakes though, especially when I first get up.  No bone pain yet. Regarding constipation, I took Senokot S( 2/day) and drank prune juice( 2/day)  for last two days and have experienced just the opposite.  I will cutting back on both. I wish everyone a good day.
