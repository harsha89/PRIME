She just found out that she is a carrier for BRCA1 4184del4 deleterioius (it says 5 site rearrengement panel no mutation detected) Then it says  BRCA2 No mutation detected.  I was just tested today and waiting for the results.  Is there any information on this form of BRCA1?   I have searched the internet and on here and can't find much about it.  It sure is going to be a long 10 days to get the results.  My sister was also tested today and they are sending the tests in together. So, we should get the results at about that same time.    Log in to post a reply",
