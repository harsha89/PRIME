She won't ask me how I am but will say \"your fine now\".  I reached my target I set 7 years ago when dx with mets, my daughter was 18 last week. Next target is for her College Graduation in 4 years. Can anyone  tell me what an enlarged superclavicular node is? I had to collect my last oncology report and made the mistake of reading it ------ bad idea.  Dollyd",
