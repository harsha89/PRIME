Obviously not DCIS. I went for another 10 days with more appointments, tests and visits before I finally found out I was stage III. Like you, it was not what I expected and so hard to deal with at times. Hang in there. Concentrate on one day at a time; I found that is what works for me. From what you write, it seems your chemo has been very effective in eradicating the nasties. Take comfort in that, you know that the chemo has done its job.

So not true.  Anyway, my next hurdle is finding a good, local clinic for my chemo treatments and getting a 2nd opinion. I want to understand everything first and more perspectives is helpful to me. My cancer center is 10 hours away so I will go there for the major stuff.

      "Content": "Sep 13, 2013 02:26PM Macy wrote: Hi all, I'm a newbie here. Unfortunately. I've been doing a lot of reading the last few days. There are a lot of wonderful ladies here who are sharing their journey in cyberspace. What I am really hoping for is that someone, anyone will have experienced something similar as to what I have. I already know there are no 2 stories that are the same but mine seems especially weird. It's been a hard road for me. I'm young, only 43, and didn't have the typical presentation of bc. Last fall during my annual checkup, my doctor asked me if I had had a mammogram. I was 42 at that point and honestly, it hadn't occurred to me. I had been busy and it had been a very tough couple of years. So, I told her I would go, yada, yada. I felt fine.  A couple of months later, I started having some weird, vague symptoms in both my breasts, pain and swelling. It was more pronounced in my left but it was in both. I kind of worried about it but life went on. The pain continued here and there, my left breast seemed consistently swollen and felt like it did when I was breastfeeding my babies. I had done several breast self-exams, no lumps, no dimpling, no anything. Just swelling. In May, I noticed that my left nipple was a little flatter than my right. I got a little more worried but hey, I had just started a new job, we were getting ready to move and my daughter was graduating from HS. I had plenty to do but made a mental note to schedule that mammogram! I kept checking my breasts for lumps but felt nothing. A few weeks later, I was in the shower and noticed a little blood from my left nipple. I freaked and called my doctor immediately. She sent me for my first ever mammogram. I honestly don't know what I was so scared of, the mammogram was easy. Because of my suspicious discharge the radiologist looked at my slides immediately but didn't see anything suspicious. I felt a little better but then the next day I got a call where I was told that I had some suspicious calcifications and they wanted to do a biopsy, just to be safe. I was assured that the odds were in my favor by about 85%. It was a few weeks before they could do the biopsy and get the report back-by now it was early July but I found out I had a small area of DCIS with a microscopic bit of invasive breast cancer. I was upset and shocked but dealt with it. My surgeon assured me that it was not a big deal and that I didn't have to do anything immediately. I could get a lumpectomy with some radiation and that would be it. I also went for an MRI which didn't find anything beyond that one spot either.  I felt like I had dodged a bullet.  I was enjoying my summer. We moved into our new house. My diagnosis was in the back of my mind all the time, I was kind of sad but felt relieved that it wasn't worse. In mid-August, at my surgeon's suggestion, I went in for a lumpectomy. All very routine. When I woke up from surgery, I happened to see the clock and knew that a lot more time had passed than was expected-I knew my husband had been waiting anxiously for me to come out of surgery. Something was wrong; I could just tell even though the nurses attending me didn't say anything other than to help me recover. I soon found out that I had had a 6.5cm tumor removed from my left breast, at least 8 positive nodes and no clear margins--I was supposed to \"only\" have DCIS! A week later I was able to get in at a major cancer center several hours from where we live. My reports were reanalyzed, I had more tests and scans and was scheduled for a mastectomy the next week.  I found out I had Stage IIIb cancer when I only thought I had DCIS. It was terrible; like I had to be diagnosed twice.  My mastectomy went very well--there is something to be said for going to a top-rate cancer center. No additional nodes were involved and had clean margins.  Now I face chemotherapy. I do not want to do this.  Thank you for reading. I didn't mean to make it so long but it was therapeutic to write it all out. All my doctors agree that my presentation was unusual-and serious. There was no suspicious lump and my mammogram was inconclusive. I think they only took a second look because of my nipple discharge. Otherwise, I think I would have been given a clean bill of health. Has anyone out there ever faced something similar? I feel alone in my hard road to my diagnosis. I'm terrified.",

      "Content": "Dec 9, 2015 07:45AM - edited Dec 9, 2015 07:46AM by Macy My experience with disability was very similar to yours, LynnFish, as was the decision to (not) continue working. I also wonder why this isn't talked about much, even here. I'm impressed with those who continue to choose to work. The first time around when I was stage III and continued to work, I remember how tired I was, particularly during radiation when I worked full-time. I remember being so happy to gradually regain my stamina. These days with the ongoing treatments, all my energy would be reserved for work. It's not worth it to me even though I enjoyed my job and miss it now. I have gone on disability. For me, just the time away from work for treatments, doctor's appointments, scans, feeling poorly from treatment, etc., would have made it unfair to my employer. It seems I would have to be away from the office 1-2 times a week, for a few hours to most of the day sometimes for medical stuff. How is that fair to an employer and how can I really be productive under those circumstances? I hope to get to a point where I am stable/NED/in regression where I can figure out what I can expect from my disease and then make a decision to return to work. In the meantime, although I feel quite well most days, the time away from the office and the uncertainty of the future is enough to keep me not working for now. I had the questions about volunteering on my disability application too. I think if one were volunteering a lot, then the case might be made that one could be using that energy to work, at least that is my guess. I was also asked on my application about exercising -I just answered honestly that I did exercise.",

The PET was easy--it was a PET/CT so both images were combined. You do have to drink a couple of nasty, sugary drinks before hand but I've had to drink similar ones for my CT too. Then, like a bone scan, they inject you with a radioactive solution to make you \"light up\" during the scan. My scan lasted about 30 minutes. I thought the PET was easier than the CT and the bone scan, but that's just my thoughts. The sugar will make any cancerous spots light up--but these spots can also be infections, injuries, etc. As an aside, I guess cancer uses sugar to help metabolize, so I guess that is why PET scans work when the sugar \"shows up\" with the radioactive element. It's kind of interesting. But, I had a family member tell me when I first was diagnosed that I better not ever have sugar again because \"cancer loves sugar.\" Lol.

I had my PET yesterday, no big deal. I like it much better than when they push that contrast through you in a CT scan and you feel all hot and weird. Trying to find a comfortable couch here. I will find out Monday morning, at the latest, but I am hoping for sooner. My tumor markers had risen very slightly a couple of weeks ago and that makes me nervous.",

But even if you have more physical job, I don't think that necessarily means that you absolutely can't work. But please don't let others' stories of how their sister/best friend/cousin worked through chemo treatment make you feel like you have to do this, as well. Do what feels right for you and what makes sense for your situation. I'm in a similar situation as you and here is what I'm planning to do about it, which is funny after I just told you to not pay attention to what others do (lol): I haven't started chemo yet--I will start in October. However, I have been off of work since August 26th because I had back to back surgeries. First a lumpectomy that showed my \"situation\" was much worse than originally thought followed by a mastectomy 2 weeks later. I'm planning to use my short-term disability benefit after my sick time runs out. I feel fine now, recovering from surgery nicely but I decided to get started with chemo and see how I feel. I want to get at least a couple of treatments under my belt to see that goes. I hear with chemo you often have good days and bad days depending on when your treatment day is and this can be individual for everyone.  So while I feel great for now and wouldn't mind working, I'm just resting up for the chemo portion. I can't go back to work-even for a short time- now that I have filed for disability because doing so would just start the process over for me. Not sure if any of this helps but I understand your confusion about when/whether to return to work. Everything is confusing with this stupid disease, isn't it?",

You were diagnosed right around the same time I was so I can understand all the confusion! I am also her2+. Most likely you will be given the drug Herceptin for a year as a part of your treatment; it is what they call a targeted therapy that often works well on her2+ breast cancer. Have your doctors told you about this yet? Hang in there and it will all work itself out, one step at a time! :)",
