I really don't like the furry look for myself. My hair seems to be coming in dark and straight (last chemo 6/4) and I've gotten brows and lashes back about a week or 10 days after they fell out completely 6 weeks after chemo ended. My eyelashes are shorter than they were so hopefully, they'll continue to grow. rocket - I agree with you that the appearance changes are so difficult over and above what we already have to endure. I hated it when I complained about the hair loss and people glibly replied \"it will grow back\". I wanted to blast them with \"easy for you to say sitting there with a full head of hair\" or \"sure, when's the last time you were completely bald, and had no eyelashes or eyebrows.\" I just wanted someone to say \"you're right, it's no fun, it stinks, it's insulting, etc\" Thanks for listening!

I also feel agree with QG that when we're in the thick of diagnosis, surgery, active treatment, we're in survival mode and once we're not so busy with appts, etc, we do have time to think and try to process what we've gone through.

Lisa - I had a similar situation. I've been prone to cysts all my life. 10/08 I had cyst aspiration and by 09/09 it was back. I thought I would just have it aspirated again but the tumor was behind it, close to my chest wall so it couldn't have been felt. I remember asking if the cyst I had aspirated was somehow hiding the tumor and it could have been detected a year earlier. They said no, it would have shown on the mammo or US I had. That was somewhat comforting. I just had my annual mammo last week and haven't gotten the results back. I was very apprehensive about the pain, the deja vu, etc. I had the same tech I've had for several procedures and she's very kind and understood my anxiety. It did hurt, though.  Gina",

I was ok with not getting a port. I am not great with needles but was able to keep calm as they started each IV. I never looked, just closed my eyes, breathed deeply and visualized myself somewhere else.  Gina",

I am 48, married, no kids, no family history and some days I'm still shaking my head over my diagnosis and wondering how I got here. I'm healthy, I exercise regulary, I don't drink and I stopped smoking 10 yrs ago. I had lumpectomy and SNB 1/4/10. All 3 sentinel  nodes removed had cancer. I had axillary dissection 1/28/10 and of the 14 additional nodes removed, none had cancer. I'm going to be starting chemo 2/26/10 with a bit of apprehension. I'll have 4 rounds of AC, every other week, with Nuelasta shot after each treatment. Then Taxol weekly for 12 weeks. Then 30 days of radiation and then Tamoxifen. I feel like I've got such a long road ahead of me, it's nice to read about others who have already done it. I have to say when I got the news about the node invovlement, I did feel as if it was a set back and the idea of chemo scared me. I think I'm coming to terms with chemo and the side effects. I feel that I've gotten many good \"chemo tips\"from this site. I work full time and I'm concerned about job perfornance and the fatigue and other side effects. I've got my wig ready and my hair appointment to get buzzed. I've shopped for my chemo supplies. If anyone has any words of wisdom before my first treatment, I'd appreciate it. Thanks!",

BS said that MRI and clinical exam did not indicate node involvement but she wouldn't know for sure until after lumpectomy and SNB. Path report showed all 3 nodes positive so I had axillary dissection 2 wks later and the next 14 nodes were negative. BS did caution me that diagnosis could change depending on path report but I was sad to know I needed additional surgery and scared to know I needed chemo. I agree with Jag that the ups and downs are the hardest part. You cling on to any glimmer of hope and good news you get. Bad news - you have BC, good news it'e early and treatable, good news clear margins after surgery, bad news 3 nodes positive, bad news chemo is recommended, etc I finished chemo 6/5/10, finished 34 rads treatments 8/16/10 and started Tamoxifen 8/30/10. I had a follow up with my rads ond and onc last week. I did not have any scans or blood work done. I will see onc again in 3 months. Gina",

I didn't drink enough water or eat enough during/after my first AC and didn't feel very well when I got home. I sure learned after that one what to eat/drink! I took the nausea meds as prescribed because my onc told me it was easier to prevent nausea than to control it. We had a 6 month old puppy when I started chemo so it was essential for me to walk him every day to burn off his puppy energy, even when I didn't feel like. It gave me the push I needed some days knowing that we both needed to walk at least a mile every day, no exceptions. It was a large part of my therapy as well. Drinking tons of water is critical to keep the chemo drugs moving through your system. I finished 4 AC and 4 Taxol on June 4th and feel like I tolerated it reasonably well. I worked full time. I did have some foggyheadedness after the AC treatments but was still able to work. I had my treatments on Fridays and Neulasta shots on Saturdays. Monday/Tuesday I was a little slow and foggy. Wednesday, I had joint pain from the shot but by Thursday I was feeling better. I was able to attend my indoor cycling class in addition to walking. I had longer than shoulder length, thick hair and the woman at the hospital wig program told me that it would take a week of shedding and clumping before my hair fell out. I chose to have her shave my head between my 2 & 3 AC treatments. I didn't want to deal with it falling out. I had a couple of great wigs and found that some Old Navy jersey scarves that I tied turban style. I wore my wig to work M-F and wore the Old Navy scarves on the weekends. It is important to find headcovering options that you are comfortable with. I also wore a sleep cap at night and had a coolmax exercise cap for walking/cylcing. All the best to everyone currently doing chemo. Just take it one treatment at a time. My best advice: Walk every day, Drink tons of water and Rest when you need to,",

Honestly, even though being done sooner is appealing, it makes sense to minimize the the body trauma. Saralmom - Are you relieved to know your treatment plan? I was. It gives you a starting point but most importantly, an end date. I had my first AC 2 weeks ago (2nd tomorrow)  and it wasn't as scary as I had imagined. I felt fine when I left the hospital and was even able to walk my dog a mile. But a little while later, I began to dwindle. I had a little nausea but took one of the meds they sent home with me and was able to sleep. Was a little foggy and low energy Sat/Sun but able to work all the next week. I felt fogginess begin to lift Tues. From Wed through today, I felt pretty normal. I did go to bed very early during the week. Will you be getting a Neulasta shot?",
