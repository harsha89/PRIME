My sister who had a stroke at the beginning of April (7 1/2 months ago) has slowly made improvement, but its very unlikely she can go home anytime soon.  She is in a wheelchair, and although she has recovered cognitively a great deal, her speech is very impaired by the stroke, she can hardly speak.  Its been a very sad time for me - I feel so bad for her.  My family is doing well.  Isaac has made wonderful progress with his cochlear implant, and is speaking very nicely.  We're so grateful for his progress.  My grandchildren are a great joy to me, and spending time with them is the best way to forget my cancer, but since they live in New York, I dont see them as much as I'd like. To the outside world, I appear fine, and am active as usual, however, there are occasional times I feel very fearful of recurrence - I just cant shake the feeling.  Its also a terrible downer to read about some of our posters here who are so unwell. (sorry to be down) I went to the ballet last week w. my 25 year old daughter - we are not ballet fans generally, but it was a program for Jerome Robbins 100th b'day and there is a new opera/ballet house in Toronto that we wanted to see.  The ballet was wonderful, and the opera house is simply stunning - its called the Four Seasons Centre and was very well received worldwide for its architecture.

Isaac has done exceptionally well with his implant, he seems to understand most of what is said to him, he continues to have audio-verbal therapy four times a week, which my daughter re-inforces at home, and has started to speak, which is a wonderful milestone.  We are very pleased with his progress. I have not been posting much - firstly, I find the new format hard to get used to, I cant navigate around.  Also, I did not feel great this summer, my hot flashes from tamoxifen became much worse in the heat, to the point that is really affected me.  I was constantly having bad hot flashes - beet red, sweating.  I am waiting desperately for cooler weather, since its been very mild in Toronto. I am not sure why, but I have been having some difficulty lately with dealing with my cancer fears - it seems sometimes to be getting worse rather than better.  Anyone else feeling like this?  Hope everyone is well, Linda",

My sister is now 6 1/2 months past her stroke, she has made great strides and if she could speak properly, she would be like she was.  However, the speech is hard for her, and it does look like she will not regain her ability to walk.  She can transfer from the bed to the wheelchair pretty well.  I asked the speech therapist if she can write what she wants said, but the therapist said no - its the same neural pathways as speech - if she cant get the word, she can neither say it nor write it.  She is in a very good facility - nursing home/residence - and is continuing to get therapy there.
