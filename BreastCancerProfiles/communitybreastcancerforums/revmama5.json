Well yes I did get a period on time and heavy and I asked Flo if anyone was going to stop her.I guess she said no she likes to come with a grand entrance. I just got done with Cycle 2 and sooner than i get to feeling good it will be Cycle 3 . My poor aching back oh my they cut the decradron down from 20 to 12 next cycles will be 8. That mess will have you spaced out and standing in a parking lot wondering what to do next. I lost all my hair yes my black braids are gone I look like Frenchie Davis. I wont go out without a wig no way. And that is hot talking about flipping a wig. 2 more cycles left Lord I want my hair back. My surgeon after the fact i said no radiation oh yes you do. I asked the MO she said no it was not necessary I'm confused. because in the beginning the the surgeon he said no rads just chemo now what the heck ? I wont see him again until Sept, I want reconstruction now because the chemo takes you to another place. I was told I would lose some hair , then all my hair is gone. I was told instant menopause I got a period. So really I just listen. Good to finally hear from you all and catch up. Anyone know where I can find a wig human that insurance will pay for? Smooches!!",
