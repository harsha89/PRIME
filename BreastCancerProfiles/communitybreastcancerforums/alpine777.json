I got my ultrasound result yesterday from my primary doctor that I have a nodule about 7mm at the 10'o clock position.  So, the thing is... my docter got upset because the Ultrasound Technician didn't mention anything about the need for further testing of my breast to determine if it benign or malignant. She told me they usually add their opinion about the nodule if it's bad or not, but they didn't mention anything this time-just that i have a 7mm nodule. So she got upset and told me she won't send her patients to that location anymore. She told me she's gonna book an appointment with a Breast Specialist to make it clear and I should wait until she call. So... my question is this, do you think the Technician didn't mention if it's benign or not cause I diddn't seem like I need further exams? Also, do you think that I will have a biopsy If I get to see a Breast Specialist? I know all my questions can't be answered by you guys, and they will only be cleared by my primary doctor, but I can't stop worrying about it. I am strong, and I'm trying to stay positive. But once I started to have these little worries, they grow inside of me and start becoming fears...   Log in to post a reply",

My nodule is fairly small, I'm young, and I know that this can't stop me.    I will pray for all you ladies who's suffering for breast cancer right now. Wishing you all the best.  ",
