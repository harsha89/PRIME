      "Content": "MommyGato3 wrote: I was told I have to wait 3-5 business days for the core biopsy I just did yesterday (3/29). It has been the longest 24 hours ever... My issue was literally felt overnight (Feb 2017). I experienced a sudden pain in my right breast and I noticed it was swollen/red, etc. Initial dx was Mastitis. Took antibiotics and the redness subsided but the swelling remained and the area turned into hardened lumps. In my 3rd ultrasound (Mar 27) which led to my recommendation for a biopsy, they found a 21x17x10mm [irregular hypoechoic] mass [w/associated vascularity] located 2 o'clock 7cm from nipple to 3 o'clock 2cm from nipple and the right axilla lymph node thickened cortex measuring 9mm w/2 nodules w/in the skin measuring 7mm and 4mm most likely representing skin lesions such as sebaceous cysts. I've had swollen nodules under my arms since I weaned my last daughter 2 years ago so hopefully that's not an issue. The waiting is brutal...I'm wondering if anyone experienced any similar results on their Ultrasound and if in fact it was cancer or something else. I appreciate everyone on here! I have great respect, admiration and love to all of you who are in this fight. Prayers to all! Log in to post a reply",

Part of me wants to know but the other doesn't want to know if it's bad news. My heart goes out to all of you who tested positive and are in this fight. I haven't been able to stop thinking of all of you as well. You're ALL in my prayers!! My heart gets so heavy and my mind feels so frazzled just imagining hearing the news and then I can't even begin to comprehend how to grasp the news and focus on a treatment plan. I'm sure I will find a way but just the thought of it right now is flabbergasting! Whew...sorry I had to vent. Hope someone can share any feedback!",

I deleted the other one as this one went more to the point. Thank you for your kind words and encouragement! It looks like you are great fighter. I wish you continued strength. I have great admiration, respect and compassion for you!! I'll be keeping you in my prayers. I will TRY really hard to stay busy and maybe not even come back here until I get the results...fingers crossed!",

I'm very relieved üòå the results were b9. I continuously have all of you in my prayers. Now, I'm just trying to figure out what my actual diagnosis is because my surgeon doesn't want to state one yet without further actions and testing. I just finished a 2nd round of antibiotics and it's only getting worst It seems a lot like Granulomatous Mastitis which is a rare infection. Hoping I can find a solution asap! ",

It sure does help when you can chat with others that can share the same sentiment and offer encouragement & additional support to maintain some peace during this phase. I'm not sure if you're a believer or not. I'm no saint that's for sure but I have been leaning on my faith a lot more lately and have been awarded with A great sense of peace and tranquility during this roller coaster of emotions & stressful state of waiting. My mind will wander and go through the momentary feeling of the unknown & possibility of having to deal with a positive result. I turn back to prayer, listen to a \"hillsong united\" pandora station and feel peace again. I hope you can also find peace leaning on what you believe, exercise, and any possible other distraction. Let's stay in touch!! Praying for b9 results for you!!! Much ‚ù§Ô∏è to you as well!! Jenise Gato ",
