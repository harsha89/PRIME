I got a new doctor the last one didnt really give a crap it seemed like probably because im so young , well my mom died when she was 30 so im a tad worried. I just want to know what my options are in the future, DR said somthing about having breasts removed, is that possible without them lookin disfigured and how long does that take and wehre would i be able to find an amazing doctor? Im in montana and dont want some random doc touchin my boobs :) ugh im just worried and have a million and half things going on in my head  and dont even know where to start. kinda feel alone i guess. oh and i have had this lump toward armpit for a while and getting bigger last doc wouldnt even look at it but this doc will with the mri i swear if its somethign im gonna sue that last doc for not looking ugh!
