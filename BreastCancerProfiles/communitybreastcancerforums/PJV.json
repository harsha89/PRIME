At first I associated it with my period but a few days after the beginning of my cycle the pain went away only to return a few days after I ended. All of last week I had a low grade fever and chalked it all up to just being stressed about my cancer returning to my liver. I had a mastectomy 4 years ago and a breast reduction on my right side which is now causing pain. It's been 2 1/2 years since my reduction so I know that's not it. Friday I happened to have an appt with my oncologist to go over my how I was doing on the new oral chemo pill. I mentioned how tender my breast was and he examined it and said he felt fibrous noduals. He said it might be my hormones and that the pain would go away. Over the weekend the pain became worse and I could barely wear a bra let alone touch my breast. Tonight I finally had to call my doctor and say something wasn't right. After a lengthy conversation and him being totally confused he thought I possibly had cellutitis...something I've never heard of and just researched on the internet and besides the severe pain I don't have any other symptons. Any one else have a similar problem or I am just weird. He rushed an prescription of antibiotic and naperson which i just took. I am just a little worried that there's something wrong.
