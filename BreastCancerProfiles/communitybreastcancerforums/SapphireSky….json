      "Content": "SapphireSky wrote: I had non-invasive DCIS high grade in April 2003 in my right breast.  I had a lumpectomy and radiation, with a negative sentinel node biopsy done during my surgery.  During my routine 6-month mammogram last Thursday, they found a lump in my left breast.  I had an ultrasound and biopsy the same day, and I am now waiting until Monday when my test results come back.  I know in my heart that I have BC again.  The people around me are being way too optimistic, and can't believe that I am saying that I feel like I have cancer again.  The thing is, I am less scared this time.  Well, on a sliding scale I am still way off the charts but I have done this dance before, so I know some of the things to expect that made the first time unbelievably scary. My jaw hit the floor when I stumbled upon this board while researching on the internet.  I am amazed at how many of you have had multiple run-ins with BC!!  It has helped me to pass the time waiting to be able to read everyone's stories, and in a weird way has been comforting to know that I am not alone. The waiting just really sucks!  Monday can't get here fast enough.  Log in to post a reply",

Guess I now \"get to\" post in the forum for those of us who have had cancer more than once.  I am really grateful there is a place for that, but very sad there is a forum to do that in the first place.  Thanks for listening, and thanks to the ladies who posted above.  Sometimes you just need some kind words from people who have been through it before. ",
