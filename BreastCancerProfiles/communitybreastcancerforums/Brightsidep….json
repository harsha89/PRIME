Just walking my dog around the block is a chore. I've got family coming tomorrow through Thursday, and I'm so hoping this is a low maintenance visit. I can barely take care of the kids let alone more folks. Today was my 18 yr wedding anniversary and Wednesday I turn 43...wondering how time has passed so quickly? Sleep well friends:)",

Spent hours today in ER so they could xray checking placement, lungs, EKG, all seemed ok. I just had it put in Wednesday, first Chemo A&C is starting this Thursday...I'm pretty freaked out.

That was one of my costume ideas as well, since I'm rocking that same look (yes December you can live on ice cream -and donuts, I've gained 30 lbs!!) but I confess vanity and the chance to wear a wig without pity looks got the better of me so I was a princess instead (lol) my BMX surgery is scheduled for 12/14.

This time instead of the dry nose/hard to breath feeling, I had weird aching in both legs, last time infusion stopped then proceeded slowly, this time same thing. Just weird. I was walking through Safeway like a bald old lady after that( I finally buzzed hair right after chemo, for me I felt it was just silly not to, as every time I touched my hair I got at least 25 strands falling out in my hand. But at least I was able to make it through hubbies reunion with hair:) It was bittersweet watching others dance with my hyper daughter, they played our \"dance party songs\" that normally she and I turn a disco ball on in her room and dance to...at 10 pm at night, waking up early going all day, I was just waaay to spent. I was grateful to the other mom dancing, and jealous too. Then we did a Disneyland day and a half, so was even more tired. It's no wonder with all that activity my neutrophil count was too low, doc says must do neutropenic injections days 3-7. I WILL remember to take Claritin or Benadryl... I'll probably need to put that on my phone, because my brain is just a wreck lately. My kids were laughing at me so hard, because I was talking about the new X-Files show, and I said I was glad it would still have \"Moldy and sculler\" on it! Sometimes the words are just not coming out right. So glad for your good news Julie! Justmaximom I also started my monthly friend two days before my AC2, I was like what is this? I thought my menses was supposed to stop, Just can't catch a good SE break! Sort of looking forward to having it all removed, but not the early menopause :( Have a great day my fellow warriors, I'm thinking happy Friday thoughts to you all:)",
