    "Content": "ksfarmwife wrote: My mother-in-law is 59 and has been experiencing breast pain for several months with radiating pain in her arm, but no palpable lump. She had a mammo done in August and that was followed by US with a comment from the tech stating that in 25 years he had never seen anything like that. She finally went to a BS and they did a biopsy on Tuesday 8/30 and at that time the surgeon told her to \"expect the worst because it looked like cancer\". We've spent the last two and a half days thinking that it was just a formality. Well they got a call late today and her biopsy was negative!  There seems to be a lot of experience on this board and I want to know what to expect now? She's not to go back until next week. But how worried should we still be when a specialist who does this all the time thought it looked bad only to have patholgy not match it? I'm not looking for trouble, but I'm still worried about her and she's still in pain. TIA for any advice. So glad I found this resource   Log in to post a reply",
