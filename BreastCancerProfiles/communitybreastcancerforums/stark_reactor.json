    "Content": "stark_reactor wrote: Hi, I am new to this forum. I am a 25 year old female who has been having right breast pain for several years. I have also been having right shoulder blade pain for a year and a half to two years. Recently, however, it seems the shoulder blade pain has spread to my spine in between my shoulder blades and to my right arm. It can be excruciatingly painful. The breast pain gets pretty bad as well. The reason I am posting this here is because of the breast pain, of course, and that I read that shoulder blade pain can be a symptom of breast cancer. Is this true? My mother had breast cancer a year ago but it was removed and she is fine now (as far as we know). Also, I've been to a physical therapist and he said he could not find a reason why I would be having pain like this from his standpoint. Can anyone help with this or has anyone experienced this? Thanks for reading and responding if you do. Have a great day. Log in to post a reply",
