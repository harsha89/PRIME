Don't know specific Roman Catholic, Jewish, Muslim prayers but sure know Protestant/Christian spiritual prayers; I think all prayers to the Holy One (whoever we know that to be) are prayers for all. For now - I offer up prayers for all who are going through this difficult experience, for relief from pain and fear, for restful, restoring, healing sleep, thanks for those who love and care for us on good days and bad days, and that we all feel the strong loving arms of our Lord God holding and supporting His beloved children.",

I think it was mentioned in an earlier post...just because you decline the traditional, potentially harsh treatment approach, doesn't mean there aren't other things out there that you can look into. Simple changes in diet and activity can help you feel well, pallative care (which is not necessarily hopsice related) is all about managing effects and side effects so you feel as well as possible, all kinds of meditation, prayer, reflexology/rekei/massage, tai chi and so on and so on. Always remember that declining traditional treatment does not mean instant death.  On a more cheerful note- I have to say I love the name JoJo Potatoes...its just fun to say...I am easily amused as you can see. I have images of a super hero, story/book character, some thing along those lines. Hugs and prayers for a lazy, sunny Sunday...Elaine",

During preschool the Telephone Pioneers did eye screenings for the preschoolers.  Since everyone in my family has glasses (me from the age of 2) we were expecting results that would send us to eye doctor.  Sure enough, vision in one eye was 20/400..the eye doc said she problably has never really used the eye at all.  Needless to say she was given glasses and had to wear an eyepatch for all but one hour of her awake time during the day. Even at 5 she understood and was not happy abouit it and was very worried abouit what the other children would say.  Dr was great and suggested that we have fun with it and decorate the eye patches.  Every night before bed we would discuss the next day and decide on decorations (often to match activity of the day) bugs for bug day, swimmer for pool opening day etc.  Some were stickers but most were drawn on.  Even had a special box.  Explained to her that the eye was lazy and taking a vacation so we had to make it work with the patch (since eyeballs can't lift weights) and allow the strong eye a vacation.  We had a week during Easter break to get use to this at home, had spoken to preschool teacher before opening day.  Teacher was great and the class talked about it first thing, allowing kids to ask questions etc.  Reaction by most of the children was---why can't I have one.   Anyway- the point of my long story was that it was someting that had to be done and we had fun with it.One day we decided to trick people and drew an eye on her patch and everyone thought she wasn't wearing the patch. The children will follow your lead in how to react to it all. I can't image the experience of hair loss and how I would feel about it but I think and hope I would be able to do what we did with Caity and have fun--wigs, scarves, hats, head doodles.  For me it would give ME the control.   I wish you all the best and keep you in my prayers...Elaine ",

The idea is to have the lowest amount of drugs, while still effective and string along treatments for as long as possible. It has been 3 years, there has been no progression and some improvement in a few spots. It is a newer thought process and very different from what I expected, but has been very effective.

I feel often like I (we) have to walk on eggshells, being concerned about how others will react to the darker side of cancer, or the dark humor that hits some days, or the open, frank language that might be used. Sort of defeats the purpose of a support or discussion bd. It shouldn't be this hard. One dx or stage is not better or worse than another, just different with each one having its own set of demons.

In addition to the ovaries (which is biggest producer of estrogen) the adrenal gland is also involved in producing/converting estrogren.  For anyone with estrogen positive cancer (meaning the cancer needs estrogen to grow) being able to cut off as much estrogen becomes important.  This is where AIs, tamoxofin come into play.  For those who are premenopausal, some oncs will induce menopause chemically (ie Lupron) or surgically and use AIs. Since estrogen has a role in joint/muscle health--cutting off all or most estrogen can cause joint stiffness or pain. ",

We support and encourage each other as we can and when we can't carry the burden, someone else steps in and helps.   We do what we can --in honor of all our sisters who have gone before us, to rejoice in all we have gained from knowing them; for in knowing each sister, a little piece of us is left with them and a little bit of them is left with us and hopefully we are all the better for it.

Did you all actually read and think about what was being said? I am amazed by the reaction of some ladies here, people who should know and understand that everyone deals differently with their dx, getting by the best way they can. I am pretty sure many of you have done the same, sharing and talking about what works for you. Grow up ladies, we are not in the 6th grade. This has nothing to do w/the alternative thread...its about dealing w/the stress of having cancer. Linda- I am really sorry you felt the need to delete your post and apologize.

I have been on Femara and Lupron for about 3 yrs now and unfortunately have not adjusted to the meds. Lots of aches. I believe many of the side effects are caused by the very low/no estrogen - remember that in addition to losing the estrogen produced by the ovaries, we are also losing estrogren converted by the adrenal gland (AIs) so this is not \"just menopause\" its what my dh likes to call \"menopause on steroids\".  Non-AI menopause ladies still have that little bit. Estrogen is involved with so much more than \"babies and girlie stuff\" Between that and other treatments, surgeries you might have had, the stress of life w/cancer, stress of life in general, caring for small children etc is enough to cause real problems. So glad you are going to see onc soon - always better safe than sorry -  lymphodema is not something you want to play around with! Very gentle hugs to everyone and hopes for an ache free day.

Know that I celebrate with each of you the successes and milestones and end of treatments/surgeries and moving on outside the \"cancer world\".  I have been very lucky that I am mostly healthy except for the cancer and treatments; my issues are not so much directly from the cancer itself as with the meds and side effects. But I know that it will never be gone or cured, its ok I have accepted that, and I'm ok with it (mostly). I have come to realize how much I enjoy you all, how much I lean on you some days, how much support I get even when I read and don't post. You are all such a big part of my life, support system.

K- I did not have the \"pleasure\" of chemo, rads or surgery...I was stage 4 at dx and since I am hormone positive, I was put straight onto Lupron and Femara to block estrogen. I know how I feel with this treatment (which is not good) and can imagine that chemo/rads/surgery are not any better but everyone reacts and tolerates the drugs differently... My thoughts are with you; there are lots and lots of ladies here who can help you out on what to expect and how to help get thru treatment and the side effects. After you get your bearings, there are some great discussions to explore here on all kinds of topics: diet & exercise, side effects & managing them, tips & tricks & things \"I\" learned, treatments, religions & prayer & philosophy, lots of good stuff. This place good for information, resources, support. Hope everyone is enjoying the fall leaves and pleasantly cool weather! edit for typos",

I think we are sometimes to quick to protect our children (aka bail them out, make excuses, and so on) because it is so hard to watch them struggle with growing up and learning how to be grown up and such. But at this point they need to learn to live w what they have done. This has NOTHING to do with you and Ed.. my goodness you have taken on a lot, already having raised a family, and dealing with variety of health concerns... Landen and Ella, while they may have some issues in the future (who doesn't) are so much better off now. They are safe and loved and cared for and wanted. Every child deserves that. As much as you can, enjoy all the good things that are happening while taking care of your selves... taking advantage of all the help that is available so that you and Ed are able to have time for each other.  I am in awe of all you have taken on... a real hero who deserves at the least a beautiful cape and tiara.  I so wish I was nearby so I could help.

This estrogen supply is not the highest amount in your system, that comes from the ovaries. This is why AIs are used for post meno women (whether naturally, chemo, medically or surgically induced) to help reduce whatever estrogen conversion is left after the ovaries are turned off. For some (like me) they are giving me lupron to deal with the ovaries and then Femara to deal with the rest.",

To us they will ALWAYS be our little ones that we want to protect from the ugliness of the world, but we can't and shouldn't. We all learn as we grow and experience the world...sometimes good, sometimes not so good.  All we can do is to be there for them when they need, to support them and to love them; remembering that they are now adults with their own lives and families. good or bad. Rest in knowing that you are close if any really bad or dangerous things happen. Who knows, maybe this will be a great thing...being able to spend time w/ Amanda and the children, even SIL, in bits & pieces. They will see what a good marriage is   .  Parenting is with out doubt one of the hardest jobs on the face of the planet! BTW- how is all with the pregnancy? any more information?

He sees no reason for a divorce since he does not want to get remarried and wants to share the house (so he can be around to help me). We can just live separately on a gentleman's handshake. This has been a real shock, no warnings that I noticed...in fact NO ONE who has heard had any idea....family, friends, coworkers ...I can not put together this person with the one I have been married to for the past 24 1/2 yrs...I hear the words, I know what they mean but nothing makes any sense, the more he talks and explains the less sense it makes and his reasoning seems so odd, off, bizarre.  If I were healthy and able to work and support myself (not on disability) I know what I would do but I'm not and feel so dependent on him.

I imagine all of us, at different times in our lives and marriages have hard times to get thru, choices that have to be made.

We had a house full of animals (7 cats and 1 dog).  The dog was a mistake (I was the only one to care for the FAMILY pet)   Became VERY stressful so after 9 years, I finally decided this was not fair to her or me.  Was able to find the perfect home for her- retired couple who had had a bichon and were looking to replace,she is being spoiled and is the very center of their world. I feel so much better knowing she is well cared for, much less stress for me. Over the past few yrs, as we have had to put cats down, we did not replace and found out last yr that dd is highly allergic to cats and dogs. Quickly found new homes for remaining 2 cats. I would love another cat- just one for my company. Next yr dd goes off the college, ds will be in his last yr of college- down in Savannah so for at least 1 yr it will be just dh and I (and hopefully a cat). DD wants to do physical therapy and is looking at about 11 schools- has been accepted to 7 so far and we are waiting to hear from final 4.  She has no favorite or first choice so far. To be honest, I am kind of looking forward to an empty nest, some rest time for dh and I, some travel time and us time. The children are wonderful, amazing children, but its been fun watching them grow up and explore the world. I think I live vicariously thru them:D. Debbie- hopefully a quiet day, maybe a nap or two and you will be feeling better! So sorry for all the stinky news,  yipey for all the good news. Sweet dreams ladies.",

No demands for explanations, no pooh-poohing of the crazy thoughts and worries...just acceptance, support, hugs, prayers and laughter. I feel so rich in the gift I have been given of this place.

OMG just heard thru grapevine that brother is getting married this Friday! How cool. It is really small: them, 2 moms and minister, party here sometime this summer. She is just the sweetest and he is so good when they're together. Happy day. Judie, We have always figured out a way to get things done, and will get through this as well. Feel really bad for dh, actually worry about him, so much stress, some he can control but so much he can not. In a good way (?) business is not related to economy but is just a down cycle. Kids are really good students, ds has partial scholarship, this coming yr we will actually be able to get $ in financial aid/grants etc. All the schools dd is considering are offering pretty good scholarships in addition to grants etc. Thankfully it will only be one 1 with 2 in college. Sheila- so sorry to hear about arm, hoping it is not significant. Karen, thinking about you and the scans etc. Waiting afterwards is the hardest part. Hang on girl, enjoy the game! ",

For a while the doctor thought the polyp was cancerous, in fact he was convinced based on its appearence and sent section of colon and a bunch of nodes for biopsy. Yesterday we learned it is NOT cancer. Big sigh of relief. She will be in hospital a few more days until everything is working properly.

It is so hard to make decisions, so easy to second guess, so easy to look back and say if I had only....But it does no good. We cannot change things in the past. All we can do is make the best decision we can with the information we have at that time and then move forward. There is a wondeful poem by Emerson I would love to share... Finish each day and be done with it You have done what you could Some blunders and absurdities have no doubt crept in forget them as soon as you can Tomorrow is a new day begin it well and serenely and with too high a spirit to be cumbered with  your old nonsense This day is all that is good and fair it is too dear with its hopes and invitations to waste a moment on yesterdays ",

The femara, which has been first and only treatment, has been controlling everything since 1/07, was on lupron until 2/11 but estrdoil was going up so had an oopherectomy. So this is failure of meds sort of thing and I am nervous, is this the beginning of something? I remember when I was first dxed the onc talked about stringing one treatment after another...a few years or months from each. I was lucky to get 4.5 almost 5 years.  This brings the whole cancer thing back into the center stage. I worry about how I will look, the surgeon says it is in a good spot surgically and cosmetically, but I am feeling stress, anxiety ... although I believe everything will work out..

I so wish I could take this from you... it is an awful place to be.  I won't say don't worry and all that kind of stuff, cause we all know that won't happen. I will say there are many wonderful women on this site with loads and loads of wisdom and knowledge. I will also say 1.  remember to breathe,  2.  you can and will get thru this, just take it one day at a time or if you need to go 15 mins at a time- you can do anything for 15 minutes    3.  Right now be sure to take care of yourself. Treat yourself as you would a good friend -- be kind, be gentle -- be understanding -- be patient -- be good to yourself!   4.  In many cases, you have a little more time than you think to start treatment -- take the time to make the best choice for you and your situation. Don't let anyone talk you into something if it feels really wrong -- get second opinions, ask questions, do research, ask more questions until you understand. 5.  be careful of \"the internet\" .... Mostly-- love your self. Come here with questions, for answers, hugs, support, to cry and be afraid, to laugh (yes that will come again), to share good and bad things and to be with others who get it and have been where you are right now. It will be ok.",

Nancy, I missed something, but understand the house is being sold?  Hope everything is ok and this is a good thing. Hugs Happy happy new year!!!  2010 - who would have thought? The date seems so futuristic - wasn't The Jetson's set in 2010?",

I do not really need him around to help I can do a lot, just takes me a little longer and I can hire someone for the rest...So much up in the air right now, I am breathing now and starting to look at all my options, what my needs are, what I want, be sure the kids are ok. Really have nothing to say to him and no desire to be around him. He wants separate, he can have separate. They can have each other, although he was saying the other day that he is not interested in moving out to her and she just got a promotion which will keep her there for several more years, he's very happy with how things are and if she wants any thing else its too bad! Sounds like great relationship!! Hugs to everyone! Hoping things are good and improving for all.        ",
