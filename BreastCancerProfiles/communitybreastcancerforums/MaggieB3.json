I was diagnosed with stage 3 Her2+ breast cancer in 2010 and in October of 2013 was diagnoses with Metastatic cancer in my lung and abdomen area.      I started chemo. (herceptin, Taxotere and Perjeta) I was supposed to have 8 rounds of treatment but after 4, my onc did a scan and decided only 6 were needed. I just had my 6th (and final) round on Monday. I had also been getting the Neulasta shot the day after the chemo and no longer need to get that. (so happy about that I want to have a party)       Because I am now stage 4 with the Mets. I now have to go in every 3 weeks indefinitely to get Herceptin and Perjeta. (Very happy not to need Taxotere anymore) I was wondering something and hope you can help me. I know every case is different and unless you are taking exactly what I took you may not be able to help me but thought I'd give it a shot.      I was told not to be in rooms of people (or on trains, buses etc) while getting the chemo due to my weakened immune system. My question is this. Is my immune system going to go back to normal or do I still need to be careful because I am still taking Herceptin and Perjeta? Now that the Taxotere (or chemo) is over, should I wait a certain amount of time and then resume my regular life?  I know I just had my last chemo on Monday so I will wait at least the 3 weeks for the drugs to go through my system and to get through the side effects first but then what. I had tried to ask my onc this (in 2010) and she said everyone is different. If anyone has any feedback on this I would greatly appreciate it. I was very involved with my church and  a few other groups and would like to resume that but don't want to put myself at risk with a weakened immune system. Thank you so much for your time and support.  Maggie       ",

My onc. said to me, (with this whole treated but not cured thought) It is all about quality of life and it sounds like you are enjoying your life to the fullest.       Also, I am so happy you are enjoying some time with your son, I know it is important for me to be with the healthy, supportive people in my life as I go through these challenges. One of the most important people in my life is my 84 year old aunt Frankie, who lives in Ireland. I just found out she will be coming here to NJ to stay with us soon  and is  staying a whole month. I can't wait. Please keep up the good fight. I know you are going to make it. Stay strong. Maggie",

      "Content": "Apr 23, 2014 02:40PM - edited Apr 23, 2014 02:43PM by MaggieB3      Hi Island Girl,      I want to first say you sound so positive about everything and that is really good. I also think it is great to have your husbands full support. Both of these things will get you far with all of this. My name is Maggie, I was faced with a similar decision in 2010. I was diagnosed with stage 3 Her2+ breast cancer and was told needed a mastectomy. I chose a unilateral mastectomy (right side only) and although I now no longer need to worry if cancer will return in the right side, My cancer has now metastasized to my lung, abdomen and to my left breast which has me wishing I had done the bilateral. So I believe you are making the right decision.  Good luck with everything. Stay strong. we are all going to get through this together. :-)",
