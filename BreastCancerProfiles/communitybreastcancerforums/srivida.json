    "Content": "srivida wrote: Hi,  I am not worried. But for the past 2.5 years I have had lumps in my left breast near the armpit area.  It use to hurt a lot just before cycles. I found 2 lumps initially and no more after that.  After so many months, after hurting only before cycles, now it is starting to act up during the break too. I am now finding a quarter size bruise over the lower lump. Also after a good night sleep I feel like my left breast has gone completely numb. Not due to pain but just down right numb. After I finish up my morning chores, the sensation returns to normal and most times the lumps hurt.  I was just thinking that it is the process of growing. I am touching 40 and maybe my body is going thru change.  But looks like this could or could not be a serious issue.  Should I be worried and go for a doc visit or is it just me getting forty and fabulous. Thanks. Log in to post a reply",
