Since then I was diagnosed with DCIS and I have had an MRI, biopsy, and numerous amounts of mammograms. I had a lumpectomy on February 18, and I am currently waiting for the pathology report. I am scared to death of what I have read about margins, DCIS turning into invasive once the surgeon gets in there to do the lumpectomy, and other scary facts. I don't want to die. I am so worried and cannot calm down. I do have ativan and prozac but I am still suffering from high anxiety. Can anyone help me out there to calm down? Is there any reassuring news? I am so scared of the pathology report coming back with metastatic breast cancer?? Can that be possible? Thank you for your help. Log in to post a reply",
