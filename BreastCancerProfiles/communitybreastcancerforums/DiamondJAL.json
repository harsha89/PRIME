It is a scary thing to always wonder, what if they missed something.  What if in between annual scans, something develops.  What if they don't order the right test this year.  So much to worry about and anyone that hasn't faced it, doesn't understand.......especially the insurance industry.",

Just remember ladies, it is your life and your health and you have the right to request anything and any 2nd opinion that you need.  If someone laughs at you, then you don't want that person for your doctor.   I can't even get insurance right now, I lost my job in July after 19 years with a major airline and now have nothing and I cannot afford to pay for it.  I am praying that our new president puts this as a priority on his agenda for the women in the USA.  I was told I make too much on unemployment to qualify for any assistance and there are no exceptions for cancer patients, doesn't matter that I can't even pay all of my bills.  If anyone out there knows of any programs that I haven't found in my research yet, please contact me. Thanks......Judy",

Also, I don't understand this wire thing and having to be cut that way.  I had biopsies by core needle samples and stereotactic, which is the one they use to extract the calcifications.  Is this not standard procedure or is it up to the surgeon how to remove the calcifications?  Or does it depend on the calcification?  I pray that all of you are o.k.",
