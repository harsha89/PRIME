We have been waiting on results for whether or not she is responsive to hormones or has the HeR2 marker. All week, every day they told her \"tomorrow\" they would probably have the results. Now it's the weekend and still nothing. Getting frustrated. Does anyone know if the grade (1) or size (small 9mm) or location (LOQ close to the nipple) have any correlation with being hormone receptive or the HeR2 marker? I know there's no guarantee and every case is different but can anyone tell me in their experiences and what they've heard if what we know so far points to any specific staging or have any information on lymph node involvement or just anything in general? (She did tell me she isnt too worried but can tell one of her lymph nodes seems swollen or tender which it hadn't been before her diagnosis. This to me seemed uncharacteristic of what I've been told about stage 1.) Thank you all so much for your time and experience. This forum and the people here are absolutely amazing and inspiring. -Tevyn.

I couldn't be more concerned for my mom and just trying to understand some questions I have if anyone might help. I really appreciate your time. My moms biopsy came back today but she didnt catch all the details. What she knows is that it is invasive something carcinoma. It's 9mm so it's small but it may be attached to the wall or at least the lump is immobile. They scheduled her 10 days out with an oncology team to take her lymph nodes out and test them, is this fairly routine? She is 42 and she's pretty healthy. I heard invasive means she is not stage 0? I dont think she knows whether or not it reacts to what hormones. Sorry if my details are poor, I'll try to keep updating this as I find out more. If anyone can maybe give me any guidance into what's going on, or what she can expect as the process gets further along?

I have a couple questions regarding location and lymph node involvement, it's in her lower inner quadrant beneath her nipple and she thinks one of her nodes are swollen, it wasn't swollen at the beginning shes pretty sure. Do these signs point to anything specifically ominous? I didnt think cancer spread fast enough to attack her lymph node if it wasnt there a couple weeks ago? She seems to be holding it together pretty well, at least in front of her children.",

My mom was diagnosed a while ago and the waiting has been horrendous. She has had quite a bit of good results/luck lately (details in the dx.) My question is in two parts. First, she's done with surgery (lumpectomy and SentNodeBiopsy) and to my knowledge she has 33 radiation treatments coming up, once every business day. After that she has the hormone restrictive medication and biannual mammograms for the foreseeable future. She got out of surgery just a few days ago and is still hurting. Can anyone offer me any advice on what I could tell her to expect for radiation or anything else anyone may have experienced? Or anything someone could have or shouldn't have done to help support you after surgery during treatments? Second question, after so much help was given to me and my mom I want to be able to give back to the community. She has a page on instagram as she wants to document her situation so others going through the initial diagnoses process can relate and maybe find some relief. Is there anything I can do to help others, I would feel wrong giving advice as I wasn't personally diagnosed. If you have any ideas I would really appreciate it. Thanks again for all of the help and relief this community has provided and thank you for taking the time to read this. I so strongly admire the people in this community.
