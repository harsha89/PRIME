Normally there isn't much of anything to express. In the morning I will see a crust but other than that not much of anything comes out during the day. There is no pain or anything like that with the thickened area its just hard.",

      "Content": "Dec 8, 2010 09:32PM - edited Dec 8, 2010 09:33PM by spriest Thank you. I meet with the surgeon that would decide to biopsy on 29 Dec and it would be up to her, unfortunately since I am in the militray I don't have a lot of options. There was never any mention of ILC which I though was weird the only cancer that they said it could be was IBC and it was not suspected because nothing was inflamed, so you can see I am working with some very uninformed people and I really have no where else to go (living overseas). I do think it is ironic becuase when you research anything dealing with Fibro thickening ILC comes up. I suppose they ignore google. The one thing I don't like is the fact they say \"well we we don't see anything so your good\"- well I feel something so what is it? I guess radiologists aren't trained in talking to people. The only \"trauma\" I have experienced is my 2 year old son beating on me and using me as a jungle gym, and I have had a slight discharge that has come out (both sides) a little blood tinged but from everything I have read that can easily be cause from him not whatever this thickening is.  I hope to find out more on the 29th, and I will be pushing for a biospy if only for my peace of mind, although I seem to be quite calm about all of this right now and I think it is because I have age on my side if nothing else.",

I would be requesting either a core biopsy or exisional, there is no doubt where it is and like I mentioned earlier I am small chested so it would be very hard to get anything out.",

I know normally the Fibro ones have- nothing did literally nothing did last week, it was weird. This whole thing is weird. It is still spreading too, it is now under my nipple, I can feel the hardening under the top part of half my nipple. I am really hoping this is just fibro because I still want another child and I am a big supporter of breastfeeding. I just finished my cycle and again no change at all except it keeps creeping around slowly. the whole thing is just weird. I know this is going to sound funny but this is how I discovered the oddity, I have some small tattoos on my clevage and of course they are not even my left was always a little higher than my right (a few mm), about 2 months ago I got out of the shower, I was suspecting there was something going on but then I saw my right tattoo was now higher. I am not any bigger in cup but they seem perky fuller up top as opposed to the left being baby fed saggy and to the normal observer you wouldn't notice unless I pointed out the obvious differences or you felt it, but the 29th can't come soon enough and then I would have no idea how long it will take to get the results back to here.",

About 2 months ago I noticed a thickening or hardening upper/inner right breast, no cyclic changes. It has since spread to most of the top of my breast and down to my nipple. Had and U/S today and it showed absolutlely nothing. Both my primary doc and general surgeron (in case of biopsy) can feel it. Because of family history of BC may do a mammo but because of age and fibro know it would be worthless (military would want to see it done regarless). Does the U/S usually show nothing? after having my baby (breastfed for 18 months) my breasts weren't exactly perky but I am a small size (130lbs A cup) and now my right breast looks and feels perky and heavy and this thickening is still spreading but no one \"sees\" anything, but they can all feel it, and today they said they can't do a biopsy if they can't \"see\" where to biopsy.    Log in to post a reply",

All I have gotten back from the Drs here (2 different ones) is that it doesn't look like IBC, which still strikes me as odd that ILC is still not even considered. I guess I will know in a few months.",

I work 2 buildings away!!!! Its a military base!!!!!...no one takes the younger women serious with this stuff. I guess I was just a waste of time. This is still spreading and hardening my breast, but I guess its nothing. I had the mammogram today- guess we will see if it shows anything other than what we already know/don't know. Those resulsts will be mailed to me in 12-14 days- at least I was notified ahead of time they would be mailed.",

Then the tech goes on to say that we should just cancel because the U/S didn't show anything. Hmm Military really doesn't teach them anything in school huh? I resheduled for the 20th regardless. Then called the surgical dept and scheduled the core biopsy for today. I need peace of mind!!!! Had it done- they took 8 samples (2 from 4 areas) \"blind\" as they said since they had nothing to base it off of except feel. To be honest nothing probably would have shown up on the mammo anyway, btw my age and Fibro breasts. They said the results will be back in 3 weeks.  80-90% chance B9 so I will be focusing on optimistic thinking until 1 Feb.",
