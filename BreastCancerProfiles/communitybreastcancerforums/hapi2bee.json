My surgery was based on my decision not to have reconstructive surgery. At 73 I just figured I could strap on anything I wanted and didn't want any more surgeries. Anyway, my seroma on the side they did a sentinel node biopsy and originally was about the size of a baseball, hard at first but now has decreased in size to that of a squishy golf ball. After reading as much as I could about people having seromas drained only to have them drained again and again or becoming infected. Am sure that there are people who have had seromas but can't find any link addressing how long they last or any successful ways of dealing with them. Not into infections tho. Hope you are recovering well.",

Post chemo it was wavy, thin and more gray. That only lasted for a short while - it was back to more gray, straight but quite thin. The biggest mistake I made was having my stylist color it too soon, I guess it would be OK if you like purple, blue and magenta. Poor lady cried. I was never fond of my hair so losing it was great for me, never had a bad hair day without it. I did look like Uncle Fester from the Adams Family TV show with no eyebrows.",

To answer your question tho, Angie didn't have to have chemo as she had a non invasive type of BC (DCIS). All the best to you.",

Had no trouble in the bathroom and showering was easy as long as I bent over to wash my hair. I did take a pair of polyester satin PJs to the hospital with me and put them on immediately after surgery in fact I wore the PJ top home the next day. They made getting in and out of bed in the hospital and at home a lot easier you slide. I had a few pairs at home and pretty much lived in them as they were oversized and slid easily over bandages and my body. They make me feel good too and at 73 I'll take all of that I can get. Do take it easy tho, I found naps to be a good friend.",
