I can tell you I really wasn't expecting a pcr.I don't think my MO expected a pcr due to the extent of cancer in my breast and lymph nodes,my original plan was a radical mastectomy with full axillary removal, but ended up having a quadrantectomy with 2 sentinal nodes removed.I'm still in disbelief and think they missed something on pathology but I need to get over it and think positive with having such good results.lol",

They did however show up clear on the breast mri I had after my 5th treatment.it also showed residual cancer in my breast but final pathology showed no cancer just benign calcifications and inflammation with a big scar from the initial biopsy 5 months prior.",
