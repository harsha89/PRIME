I am already feeling supported.  I have had a complete physical and multiple rounds of blood work done with my primary (and many many visits ha) in the last couple of months. I also have been seeing a counselor for awhile and seemed to feel more normal and less worried recently. Until now! Blah!  And yes, I agree that all of the research I have been doing has probably not been helping either :)! I just can't help it sometimes... eliz22 It's nice to know someone else out there understands how horrible anxiety is(even though I wish you didn't have to)!  I feel like I have the exact same type of feeling as you do in your left breast. Kind of like a solid large mass. I am so sorry you have to go through this process! Please, please keep me updated on how it all turns out. Feel free to message me too. I will be sending out good thoughts and prayers for you. The waiting around/diagnostic process is the absolute WORST.  ",

Since then I have had some extreme health anxiety and hypochondria issues. I am terrified of having to go through what she went through. Over the last 6 months I have been to many doctors, convinced that something was wrong. A lot of the symptoms I had(unrelated to my breasts) have went away and were attributed to anxiety. Every test/exam has come back normal for now, until just recently I starting getting paranoid about my left breast.  My breasts have always been a bit sore before my period, until last week during mid-cycle, my left breast on the outer edge was very sore to the touch. It has continued to be sore for over a week in that same spot. I am not tender in my right breast at all. I have been almost compulsively doing self breast exams ever since to see if I can feel any lumps. I have very small, not dense breasts, so I would hope a lump would be obvious. But...unfortunately I am confused as to what a suspicious lump feels like and am increasingly getting more panicky. It feels like there are many lumps in my left breast and it just feels very different or thicker in this area than my right breast. When I push down with even pressure on my right breast it doesn't hurt and it squishes down nicely, but when I do this on my left breast, it feels like there is something large and solid beneath my nipple. I also have been waking up with a really tight neck with some pain that radiates around to my chest/breast when I rotate my shoulder back. This seems to come and go, so I hope this is unrelated. I also have had tenderness under my left arm sometimes, but no palpable enlarged nodes that I can feel. I also have been experiencing pronounced fatigue the last couple of months.  Because of my struggles with anxiety/depression I don't really know what are real symptoms anymore or what might be manifesting from my mental state. I end up second guessing myself a lot now. I've had a 2 doctors over the 8 months or so give me a breast exam, because I have been very paranoid in general - although I did not have any significant tenderness or lump at that time. They didn't find anything during these times and ensured me that I was fine and to just keep watch. I have breast cancer on both sides of the family and one of my great aunts died of it in her early 30's. I also did the genetic testing and it came back negative. I am now worried that I didn't pursue additional diagnostic testing before with my doctor because I was embarrassed by my health anxiety issues and thought I was overanalyzing it. I called my OBGYN and scheduled an appointment for next week. From reading this site it sounds like it would be good to push for an ultra sound and mammogram, if I don't feel satisfied.  I am feeling very, very scared right now, almost paralyzed with fear. I wish I could go to the doctor right now and get some answers.  I know no one on here can reassure me and tell me exactly what is going on, that is what my doctor is for. I guess I am just looking for some comfort and support as I go into this next week. Am I right to be concerned with my situation? I always thought bc would should up in a painless, hard lump..but after reading many threads on here I know that tenderness can definitely be a symptom.  Sorry for the long post and thank you for the support. Love and prayers to all of you!  Log in to post a reply",
