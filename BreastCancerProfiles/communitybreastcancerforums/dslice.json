At first I was told I only neede a lumpectomy followed by radiation, but then they did an mri and found another area in question, so they biopsied it and found out it was in that area as well, so my size of my tumor became 5cm, because they included the whole area that contained the invasive and non ivasive cells. I was told to do a mastectomy because it was too large to have just lumpectomy. I did a bilateral mastectomy. I had a sentinal node biopsy with 5 nodes from one side and 3 on the other. All nodes were negative and my margins were clear for 2 cm from the edge. I also had the reconstruction done. Friday I will be having my expanders removed and my implants put in. I did not do any chem, because they did an oncotype test and showed that chemo would not make a difference in my outcome, because I was considered low risk. They did suggest radiation, but I chose not to do it, because of the side effects vs the benefits. I do take Femera daily and I feel that this was the best choice for me.Â  It is hard to make these decisions, but only you can do that. Just do a lot of research and ask your doctors lots of questions and once you decide, don't look back, only forward. Hope all goes well for you.",
