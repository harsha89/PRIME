I was told not to put any lotion on, can someone verify that with me?  Thanks for exchanging notes. God Bless!",

Thanks for reminding me not to think of Radiation as a big deal, because I was not wanting radiation and asked my surgeon if I could skip it.  He said \"no\".  I have to remember to be thankful about not getting chemo and just deal with the rads. On the question about Vit. E, my rad onc say \"NO\" to vit. E.  You may want to check it out with your rad onc (not just the technicians) about what to put.  I was given 3 choices (2 were samples).  Calendula cream (I got it at Whole Foods store), and received Aquafor and Miaderm as samples.   I will be doing my 3rd tx today, 30 more to go!  ",

It's invaluable for me to keep reading about your notes and what not to do.  I am truly glad that there's so much support here. My CT techs were super nice, rads techs didn't start off that way but I see an improvement already :) Good luck to you all.  I hope to trade notes with you too! God Bless!",

If this happens to you, will you report it? To whom?",

TMarina, Cindykaw, MPH70, BetsyP, Alca, CT124 and JFV - thanks for backing me up too, I had my regular Thurs meeting with rad onc.  Initially he looked surprised (but the tech #2 told me before my session that she had reported it to the doc), as I was telling him what happened, his nurse kept chiming in.  My doc actually said in verbatim \"they are drs./physicist and it is the norm in the States that they will even follow the doctors inside to check/tweak the machines\".  I let him finish, let the nurse finish chiming in and then look the doc in the eyes and said \"then I propose that I'd be treated differently, if there need to be any tweaking while I'm on the table, I want \"off\" of it.  I do not want to be there while they are tweaking or calibrating the machine.  If they need to get something or walk to the control station where the surveillance monitor is, I need to be informed and be \"immediately covered\".  Then I turned and looked at his nurse and said \"I know I have my right as a patient, right?\".  Funny, the incident that happened the day before, no one had apologized.  This time the rad onc apologized twice and said that \"he forgot how patient feels because he's been treating for such a long time\".   Friday - the techs are not really speaking to me, I can sense the coldness.  While being zapped yesterday, I could feel some pain at the rays was hitting me.  I get 12 zaps coming at an angle from left side, I could feel about 3-4 zaps where is was painful, can't describe it.  Like electricity/static hitting you.  Then 12 zaps coming from an angle from the right.  I fet 2 zaps that was painful.  Now the machine was calibrated/fixed 2 days in a row.  I sense something is not right. Then when doc checked my L axilla, at first he dismissed anything wrong thinking it was my subconscious thinking.  After telling him that it is not, then he felt the lump and said I could be getting an infection.  Will wait and see.",

Yay, so happy that I don't need to deal with that facility any longer.  In fact, there were student techs yesterday and today and I told them that I do not want any student techs during my treatment.  One of the technician had that snide look on her face and I abruptly turned around and caught her.  LOL.  The other female tech said \"Oh, you don't have to work with student techs\", I replied \"I know, and I don't want to anymore!\".  I tried to be nice before and it didn't work, and since those episodes with them I became a tough cookie.  Sad but true. My skin is covered with rash and tiny blisters (do not pop the blisters) and ask for steroid cream like Topicort.  It worked right away and dried up the rash and took care of the itch.  Nipple is crusty and I applied a thick layer of Miaderm.  The whole breast is pink. I will report back in a couple of days if there's any improvement.  Good luck to you all and thank you so much for your support, it was rough for me but you ladies helped me tremendously, I will never forget :) Feel free to PM me anytime you like.  ",

As for me, I went to the urgent care this afternoon due to skin rash appearing on my face and ears and left upper arm and it also spread to the stomach from the left breast.  The dots looks identical to the ones on my radiated breast.  I knew it would be tough for the doctor to diagnose, it could be (1) what I ate on Tuesday night, which was a small bite of Melba toast kind of thing and instantly my lips and tonge was itchy.  Wed morning, my right ear started to itch a little and it just grew like wild fire.  The right ear was red, hot, itchy and swollen.  Then dots was on my cheeks and upper left arm.  Then Friday went below my left rib area and appearing on the upper left arm.  It is just so weird.  (2) it could be a virus, a big maybe b/c my DH is a bit under the weather, and (3) radiation dermatitis.  So the doc is leaning on radiation dermatitis.  I got rx for the rash and the prednisone to deal with it for several days.  Just when I thought I was done and can take a break :( Tina, my platelet count is in the low 200s, and ladies thanks for the clarification.  I wonder why I have to ask the med onco for tests, shouldn't that be prescribed anyway?  ",

How do you ladies feel about the new TSA pat down rule?  I think they should have a BC survivor on the panel.  I just can't foresee myself being pat down, my scar did not heal well and I have LE symptoms, I just can't forsee being touched.  What do y'all think?

If my memory is correct, I think MPH and Tina are done with rads right? On, on the TSA issue: I think it would be a great idea if a Rad Onc will step up and explain to us about our exposure to radiation from the Body Scanners at the airport so that we can make an accurate informed decision about going thru it or not. (Right now, a lot of people are just guessing).  Does the FDA have to approve the machines before it is being licensed?  (if not FDA, whatever the agency has jurisdiction), then we should be able to find out from them what amount of radiation is being emitted. I too have my fear about receiving too much radiation already, but I will not be a good candidate to go thru enhanced pat down, because my scar is not healing properly and will eventually need a scar revision.  Sigh!",

Not only are they not changing the sheets properly, there were many incidents there were just 1 rad tech running the machine, no helpers to align me. Tell me about transmittal diseases, and some of you even thought about bacteria left by previous patients, I have witnessed several people with scabs on their arms and a couple of people were pretty sickly looking.  I didn't think about the arm rests until you mentioned it, \"Yew\"!  I do see my rad onc every Thursday, and I just wonder how he'll dismiss my complaint about cleanliness this time.  Will keep y'all posted. Good night.",

D3, between 1,000 - 2,000 I.U. a day.  When my DH googled it, the D3 helps with blood pressure and better sleep and everything else.   Shelleyj43 - thanks for the cupcake idea.  I will bring them something and see if little \"goodies\" help.  Good luck on your simulation. Dutchgirl16 - ditto on that. Nwshannon - the scar on my breast is not healing well at all.  It's puckered and it is causing the aerola to be swollen and it is very tender.  BS said that the rads will make it worse.  I was told to take either IB profen or Alieve daily as they will take care of infections. Kaydub - you took the words out of my mouth.  The experience is surreal.  How's your day #2 going?  sespebadger - I totally agree. khilde - welcome to this group. Sorry if I'd forgotten anyone, it's my nervous brain at work right now.  Prayers to all.",

Alca - I want to welcome you to this thread.  They took pictures of me too and I was not given much notice ahead of time, although I knew about the tatoos which is three pin hole dots on me.  I was given conflicting information regarding more marks being drawn on me, meaning Sharpie pen marks that looked like a computer graphic map.  My techs were women but they are the coldest people I've met during this BC ordeal.  The guy tech that did my CT was more informative. I was talking with Lorraine who's starting rads this coming Thursday, she said that her rad onc popped in to double check the techs' measurements, which to me is very reassuring.  My rad onc was nowhere during my CT or simuilation and I would like to ask if you ladies can give me your experience during the simulation.  I believe some of us have a lot more drawings than needed and my thinking was perhaps my tech was a greenhorn.  During my simulation, the gals opened and shut the big thick door like a dozen times.  While I had to turn my face facing the right, I can see a green line, and there was a tape with 2 lines like a large + sign.  I even asked the tech, is this green line supposed to line up with the lines on this tape? And she said \"No\".   I hope to exchange notes with you ladies so that I'll know what's not being done properly since my techs don't talk.  ",

About the Aquafor, do you use anything to cover the breast since it is so greasy? I don't want to ruin my t-shirts.  I had to purchase new t-shirts because of the map that they drew on me.  I look like Ms. Frankenstein. Sespebadger - regarding the blue tat that you have in the middle of chest.  My m-i-l had her eye brows tattooed and was not happy that it was way too thick.  Another salon that she went to was able to tatoo the flesh color on her brow to do the correction, and you can't even tell the flaw now.  So that's food for thought :) Do you ladies have your Rad. Onc supervise any of the simulation or dry runs?  Mine never showed up and felt like one of my tech was a pure \"Greenhorn\" ! - need your input please.  ",

I've also tried the Japanese green tea and I couldn't drink it, it tasted like grass.
