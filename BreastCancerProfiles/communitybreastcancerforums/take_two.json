Pink - depending on the chemo \"cocktail\" the side effects may not be that bad.  I had pretty nasty chemo ten years ago, and other than the fact that it sucked at the time and I had way worse side effects from it than anyone else they had given that treatment to, it only lasted 3 months and I had no residual effects.  I was half your age, but even so, for me the trade off and peace of mind was worth it. They should be able to put you in touch with people who have experienced what treatment they are recommending and that firsthand experience may help with your decision.  Best of luck making up your mind, and remember you can always change it - a survivor's prerogative.",

The drains are the biggest hassle.  They are somewhat uncomfortable and because of where they exit I can only sleep on my back.  My back does not like that after 6 hours or so.  Thankfully, the seepage is decreasing and clearing so I'm really hoping that they'll come out before Christmas.  The best part of this was that my surgeon told my husband I'm not to do chores for 2 years.  I wish!  Best wishes to you ladies with surgeries this coming week.  -Cathy ",

I had just come home from my 10-year survivor anniversary trip of backpacking in the Alps this summer to find another lump at my lumpectomy site and start the game again.  Both times I found the lump and the mammo couldn't see it due to my dense tissues.  It was 0.6 mm DCIS.  This time my other side wanted to get in the game too and had some atypical lobular hyperplasia.  I ended up having 4 different biopsies (I've officially had every type possible) and a surgical biopsy and lumpectomy before the BMX.  I think they either wanted to make money off me or make me happy to have a mastectomy.  They accomplished both, but I did have my MX elsewhere since my original surgeon wouldn't do nipple sparing on someone with a recurrence, yet other surgeons felt it was fine in my situation of only DCIS that was 5 cm from the nipple.  Apparently the chance of a recurrence was only a couple of percent, as was the chance of getting cancer at such a young age as I was and you are.  Too bad I'm not so lucky with lottery tickets!  ;-)  Best of luck with everything and feel free to message me if I can help in any way.  BTW, for you others out there dealing with not as optimal a diagnosis as expected, it may help to know that I work with lots of survivors through Team Survivor Northwest and Cancer Lifeline and I have 3 friends who are all 5-15 years out of a Stage 3 diagnosis, one with 8 positive nodes, who are all doing great and perfectly healthy, not to mention all the ones with Stage 1 and 2 diagnoses.  There is life after all this, sometimes an even better one.  Best wishes to all on either side of your MX,   -Cathy ",

I'm another young'ish (42), dense-breasted gal who had imaging and diagnosing issues despite having palpable lumps.  I'm so thankful I found it before it became invasive this time as I did chemo and rads 10 years ago before my recurrence this year.  Once was enough.  I must say that it feels rather freeing to not have my time-bombs anymore. For you gals going through all this for the first time, I want to say that there can be a normal life after all this.  In my case it was even better than the before-BC normal because it provided the impetus to follow some paths I would have been scared to otherwise.  You can do this and be stronger for it.  Best wishes all.",
