It's finally settling down, so hopefully I'll be able to eat my dinner. What are cold caps? I don't think I've heard of those. I'm pretty much resolved to losing my hair. In fact, when my stylist shaves it off for me, I plan to take in some eyeball temporary tattoos and have her put them on the back of my head so when my girlies get home from school I can show them that Mommy really DOES have eyes on the back of her head! My one question is... do the symptoms get worse as the chemo goes on, or can you pretty much judge your reaction by the first dose? So far I've had very little stomach trouble, and it would be nice to know what to expect as I go on. Thanks, BC sisters!",

My husband always tells me that I look sexy bald, though, so I'm just going with it. I cannot wait to be done with this, and get my life back. Most of the time, I do okay, but today has been a real struggle to not become discouraged. We got a bill yesterday from the orthodontist, and I honestly can't remember back to January as to whether I took my daughter or not (apparently, we missed it). My brain is gone, my energy is gone, my house is a mess, dinner is late... again... It's so hard to know what I've always been capable of, and readjust my personal expectations every single morning. I think what's worse is knowing that the fatigue continues through the radiation, which will be for 7 weeks, taking me right up to Memorial Day, and not knowing how long it's going to take to get my energy back. Okay, that's my personal pity party. I think I'm better now for saying that.",

I guess it's emotionally hard for me to consider seeing another practice when I've become so attached to these people, if that makes any sense. Thank you so much for your input. It's easier hearing these things from women who have lived it or are living it.

My last PET showed improvements in my liver met, which was small to begin with, and my lung met (which they'd failed to mention before, so that was a surprise, but explained some things). My liver function numbers have been running just a little high, but my MO is not concerned about it at all. The frustrating thing is that the bone mets are going the opposite direction of the organ mets. So it's wait-and-see until my next PET to find out if they're just flaring, or if we need to change meds again. I've only been on Afinitor/Faslodex since April, so that's frustrating. I don't know about you all, but I'd rather have something definite, good or bad, rather than \"wait-and-see.\" I got the same indefinite answer from my mammo last week, too. They're fairly certain the changes in my left breast are calcification from surgery, but we'll do another one in 6 months to verify. Considering this was a 6 month mammo to verify changes noted at my December mammo, I'm less than comforted. Oh well. I feel good, I look good enough that people are shocked when they learn I'm stage IV metastatic, I kept up with our 10 day cross-country family vacation to Colorado from Pennsylvania, my kids are fabulous, and I'm able to garden this year (we just brought in three 4-lb cabbages!!!), so I'm calling life a win right now.

What I didn't realized was the timeline for judgment. I figured I'd get a few doses and then they'd decide. No, the MO is looking at today's blood work and tomorrow's. It the numbers are still climbing, then.... well, that's it. Kaput. No more treatments. He and the consulting MO at Fox Chase are out of ideas, and I'm being sent home, probably with information about hospice care. This morning's blood work came up with the liver numbers continuing to climb, particularly bilirubins. So I have one more shot. If they're not down tomorrow, it's lights off, curtains closed, exit stage left. Part of me wants to go elsewhere, get more opinions, try more medicines, fight. Part of me is just tired. Tired of bad news, negative reports, painful procedures, each worse than the last. Is that giving up? Am I giving in too quickly? Or am I just being realistic? I'm really trying to hold on to hope for tomorrow's results, but... I haven't had a positive result in over a year. I had to call my parents and my sister today with the news. I hated hearing them heartbroken. I'm ready to go Home.... they're not ready to let go. I know that's not my responsibility, and I also know they'll be fine. However... I hate being the cause of others' suffering. My goal in life has always been to make people laugh, so being the cause of their grief is really difficult. Anyway, that's where things stand with me.

Last Friday I had a PET scan to find out why my liver enzymes have been on the climb. The only thing I heard back right away was that there was fluid on the lungs, some of which I had drained today. *shudder* I'm being referred to an oncologist at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. In June, the tiny little 1/8\" lesion on my liver was looking better. As my doctor put it, my liver now looks like it belongs to a 75 year old man who's been a lifelong chain-smoking alcoholic. It is fully involved. The cancer has \"exploded.\" Spine, both femurs, pelvis, right humerus and scapula, liver, both lungs, abdominal lymph nodes. He said he feels backed into a corner; he's out of ideas. In addition, they removed nearly a liter of fluid from my left lung during the thoracetises this morning; there's nearly as much again around the right lung. I'll find out the cytology report on it tomorrow, but I've yet to get truly good news in the last year and a half, so I'm not holding my breath. My MO is hoping that a doctor at a larger cancer hospital might have more access to trials and other treatments that he doesn't. I'll be getting probably two or three opinions and going from there. I was diagnosed 18 months ago. Everyone said there are so many options, so many treatments... I'm young, strong, otherwise healthy, and so very optimistic... the odds were in my favor. I'm trying to not lose hope, but... Of all the things I was prepared to hear today, \"I'm out of options\" was not one of them.",

I came to the ER this morning with very labored breathing and shortness of breath, along with a very high heart rate. That was about 11 hours ago. The CT scan showed only minor increase in disease, but they did remove 1100mL of fluid off my right lung, which helped quite a lot. This is in addition to the 780mL they'd tapped from the left lung last week. Had that been the only issue, I'd be home right now. But they just HAD to do blood work, didn't they? My liver is quickly going downhill. My bilirubins were elevated today, and my AST went from 480 last week to 756 today. So they're keeping me overnight to see if that comes down after the drain. My MO came in to talk with us this afternoon, and we finally got the last piece of the cancer puzzle. I am officially triple negative. He's at a total loss as to what to do for me, because the AST is so ridiculously high. He referred to a \"very narrow window of opportunity for treatment.\" So...

By Saturday, it was just occasional twinges, but not bad. By yesterday, I almost felt like myself again. So it's REALLY BAD the first couple days, but it gets better. Did your doctor say anything about taking Claratin the night before your Neupogen, and for 3 days after? It does help - that, and Aleve. I'm in contact with my doctor... the back of my hand broke out in a huge swollen rash. Called him yesterday (Sunday) and he said it didn't sound like a Chemo reaction, since I don't have it anywhere else. Hoping for some answers - it's hard to type with swollen fingers! Other than that.... Well, I've been amazed to see how quickly my energy came back after the first chemo. Still can't taste much, but I guess I'll get used to that.

The rest of my chemo side effects are starting to go away - although I bumped my fingernail on something yesterday and almost ripped it off. I think that the loosening nails is somehow harder to deal with than the loss of my hair and eyebrows. It's so hard to do things when your fingertips are so sore! I'm loving the new avatar pics. I may need to go figure out how to attach one, too, if everyone else is enjoying seeing faces as much as I am. 5LuvBug, there's a website called TLCdirect.org where they sell hats and scarves for cancer patients.

My AST is either 438 or 483, and my ALT is in the 260s. Apparently, that's at least 3x what they should be. He showed us the PET of the liver, and it was like a little sun in my stomach. Terrifying. The other major thing we learned from the cytology is that the cancer is now ER/PR- when it's always been positive. We're waiting to find out about the HER2 marker. But that would in part explain why the Afinitor/Faslodex did nothing, since that's for hormone positive. He wants me to go on a 2-drug protocol to get the liver enzymes under control, and if we get that down then there are a couple different studies I might be able to get into. I'm not sure I like this doctor. He never even looked at me when he was talking. He directed it all at my husband...

I don't know how much of that is just hormonal weirdness from the Faslodex, because I'm feeling particularly moody since the injections. I seem to be very sensitive to hormonal drugs. The other thing is the injection site tenderness. I feel like I have the world's worst bruises on my backside, even though there's no discoloration.

My assumption was that it was from the distention I'm experiencing because of the liver mess). The PET showed that there's now fluid in my lung, and he wanted to let me know to go to a different hospital ER if I have a breathing crisis, because the doctor at our normal hospital who drains lung fluids is on vacation until Tuesday. So all I know is.... The liver is going crazy because the cancer is continuing to eat me alive, and there's the chance that I could end up in the ER with a pleural effusion (he's going to set up a time next week to have that drained). God I'm scared. I'm scared that the draining is going to hurt like hell. I'm scared that he might put me on a treatment that keeps me from living my life.

I'll admit that it will be nice to be able to draw a full breath again, and to not run out of breath just having a lively conversation with my girlfriends! And yes, Moissy, I do know that I'm not alone. I was challenged by a friend of mine (she happens to be an in-home nurse, and has become, to me, a big sister with a medical degree) to start reading a Psalm every night for a week. This week was Psalm 3, and verses 3 and 4 have been so comforting and meaningful to me this week, even before the gut punch yesterday. They say, \"But you, O Lord, are a shield about me, my glory, and the lifter of my head. I cried aloud to the Lord and He answered me from His holy hill.\" It takes me a few days, but I'll get back to being able to focus on my hope rather than my health. I know I don't post here often, but I'm so grateful for this circle of suffering sisters. You never fail to lift my spirits! PP",

So now I take a potassium pill with breakfast and dinner. I got the call today that my freaking potassium is STILL low, so I need to start taking that blasted horse pill 3x a day, and start increasing the amount of potassium-rich foods in my diet. I already eat a lot of broccoli and potatoes and sweet potatoes and black beans and bananas! Arg! If it's not one thing, it's another. Am I right?",

I'm amazed by how many people laugh at the names I call myself, but then I tend to approach chaos with humor, because it keeps me more-or-less sane. So I'm really despising my insurance company. I found out today that they've denied my Afinitor tabs, because it has to be administered along with a hormone inhibitor. You know, kinda like Faslodex. The Faslodex which the insurance company already approved for me. Apparently, now my doctor needs to write a letter (\"Doctor Review\" in insurance speak) proving that it's a valid protocol. No idea how long it's going to take. So in the meantime, I get to go with no treatment other than the fas. Fun times. And I hate insurance. Beyond that, life is good. It's amazing how quickly things become normal, isn't it? One day the recurrence is the end of the world, the next it's just another part of life. Cancer life is one crazy train ride!",

I got my second pair of Fas injections yesterday, and oy gevalt! the headache I woke up with again! Looks like that's going to be one of my major SEs. Fun times. I got my other two injections as well yesterday, so my everything hurts. We're still waiting for the insurance to move on the Afinitor. My MO wrote a \"very nice letter\" to them, but it's still a waiting game. Meanwhile, I'm trying to keep my husband from freaking out, as he talks about retaining a lawyer if they deny the medication to sue them for, and I quote, \"killing his wife.\" Last I checked, I'm still alive, and there are still more options, so... he may be overreacting a bit. He's dealing with my diagnosis much worse than I am, and it's exhausting trying to keep his spirits up. It's been a wearying week. Not only am I having to hide my struggles with this diagnosis for the sake of my husband who seems on the verge of a breakdown over it, I found out, just before she left for 10 days in Spain, that my 17yo not only wants to come out as lesbian, but wants to identify as a boy; that two years ago her boyfriend was making her so anxious and depressed that she was cutting; and she wants me to believe that the first things and the second are completely unrelated. And my 15yo is dealing with a toxic work group for a project she's working on for a tech club competition coming up in a month; they exclude her from the work times, then accuse her of being uninvolved; they defy the advisor who insists the work be done at school, claiming it's to avoid the parts being stolen, but then I find out that the parents of 2 of the kids are doing half the work! And on top of that I'm trying to help a friend struggling with crippling anxiety and health issues that the doctors have no idea how to diagnose let alone treat. *sigh* Well, kvetching about things doesn't really help much of anything. The only thing I can really do about any of it is to pray about it and trust God to do what He's going to do. And in the meantime.... I guess it's back to the happy face and helping solve the world's problems! After all, that's what Mom does, right? Princess Pincushion",

My belly is so distended that I can't eat and I'm so short of breath that a lively conversation with my girlfriends leaves me breathless. It's looking like my liver enzymes are still running high even without the Afinitor. The next step is yet another PET scan. The earliest they could get is this Friday, which is frustrating. If the disease shows no other progression, then the liver damage is from the Afinitor, which means just moving to a different drug on the same level. If the disease has continued to spread, then the liver damage is from the cancer and we start looking at a more traditional chemo regimen. Either way, I'll be moving on from this particular forum in the next couple of weeks. I REFUSE to be discouraged. I refuse to consider the what-ifs. I can't afford to live there, even though my brain likes to peek at the brochures now and then. I'll keep you updated as I get more information. Pincushion",

I'm still trying to figure out this lung thing, and so's my MO. He wants to just keep an eye on it for now. As long as it's not slowing me down and not getting any worse he's not going to do anything. If it gets worse at all, I'm to call right away. I'm figuring it's just another irritating SE, just slightly more irritating than the four days of itchy buttocks after my shots! I agree that LABN needs to become part of the BCO lingo for the Faslodex crew! My nurse has been looking for ways to make it easier, and last week gave me a pair of ice packs to sit on while I waited for my injections. It actually helped! I have to say I just love the nurses at my cancer center.",

The results were \"mixed\" but my MO is calling it a positive. Basically, the spots on my femur, spine, and shoulder blade were brighter, but only by a bit, but the spots on my liver and lung were smaller and less intense. He said the bone mets can \"flare\" as they fight the treatment, so he's hoping that's all it is. Is anyone else having serious trouble with their potassium? Mine keeps going down, despite a potassium-rich diet and supplements 4x a day. I had to get an infusion the day before we left for vacation because they were worried about heart problems while I was away. Good Lord does that infusion BURN!!! My arm is still sore almost two weeks later! My family and I just returned from a 10 day cross-country drive from Philadelphia to Colorado Springs. Best thing ever. Well, aside from the dumb idea to go all the way to the top of Pike's Peak when I'm having trouble with my breathing and my blood pressure. I was sick for about 24 hours after that. But... I did it! Other than the potassium, and falling in St Louis resulting in a nice scraped knee and some bruising on my hand and hip, and suddenly pain in my shoulder blade where the lesion is (nah, not freaky at all considering my PET), I'm doing okay. I know I don't check in often, but I was working 3 part-time jobs until two weeks ago, and my teenage daughters and my vegetable garden take up a LOT of time. Blessings to you all! Pincushion",
