I want my surgeon to get clean margins the first time so there is no second \"surgery\" based on the 2nd pathology because of having to get pathology while they wait and I'm asleep. They were able to do that when they did my invasive melanoma and the only path I waited for was lymph node, which he was confident was ok, and it was.I'm not sure they will do that, I meet with him tomorrow. It's just getting expensive already, but I feel like insurance requires them to follow protocol. Thanks again God bless With much respect and in kind Angie",

I'm now reconsidering the hrt decision. I meet with my breast surgeon tomorrow. Since ADH was found on core, I am going to ask him for lumpectomy instead of excisional biopsy due to higher risk of ADH actually being dcis on excisional. He's an excellent breast surgeon and he also did my melanoma surgery, so I trust him, and I'm very thankful for him. Have you had any experience in core being upgraded on excisional? Any information would be appreciated. I've done my homework and saw where the 14 gauge spring loaded biopsy has a 48% chance of being upgraded as opposed to 11 gauge vacuum assisted. God bless you and thank you again With much respect and in kind Angi",

She said there is a 50/50 chance of b9 or DCIS. this palpable lesion is strange, lol. It shows new asymmetry on mammo that correlates with lump, and ultrasound shows complex lesion correlating with palpable lesion. she did tell me it was spiculated, but oval, wider than taller, and irregular borders. said it looked like a handful of grapes. but my history is most concerning for her, i think. I've had ALH, Invasive Melanoma, maternal aunt with breast cancer, and am on HRT for current menopause symptoms. but the dang MRI was negative, what in the world? I sincerely appreciate any insight you can provide. I'm not afraid, I'm just not a fan of the unknown.",

Its hard to understand unless you've experienced it. so 4 years ago a lump in my right breast was ALH. excisional biopsy confirmed. today, they called regarding results from core biopsy that revealed ADH on left breast (also a palpable lump) the good news is that it says no DCIS, and flat epithial atypia. Also good news was it was duct ectasia, surrounding fibrosis, and chronic inflammation. I'm quit sure my surgeon will recommend another excisional biopsy to ensure nothing lurking. Has anyone else experienced this? Is so, what decision did you make? I just turned 50 and don't want to be on tamoxifin because i'm on methatraxate for inflammatory arthritis. fyi. i've already had melanoma, am on HRT due to menopause, and a maternal aunt died of breast cancer at young age, many years ago.

I simply want to be aggressive and informed before meeting with the surgeon. I'm so glad they did they did the excisional biopsy to uncover the ADH, ALH and FEA. I guess the difference is that on my core they alread,y found ADH and FEA. So I really just want the lumpectomy because I suspect the DCIS i hiding under all that. And that way, if they do the lumpectomy, its done. I won't have to face another surgical procedure. I can never thank you enough for your input, encouraging words, and sharing you story. God bless you in kind and with much respect Angie p.s., alh was found 4 years ago in opposite breast at age 46, and now just turned 50. Is that considered young or exactly the right age? I know cancer knows no age. My friend just passed away at 48, another at 56, and another terminal at age 56. ",
