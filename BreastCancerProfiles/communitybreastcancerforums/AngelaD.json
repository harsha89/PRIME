I wish you the very best and will be thinking about you on the 10th!  Feel free to PM with questions or for support!  Angie - from the land of windmills and mowed lawns!",

This has been the routine since my BLM and initial expander fill to 200cc.  I am now 480 cc on the right and 500 on the left. Will exchange on 2/4 and doc says I probably wont need a bra after that !!!!  Hope that helps.",

Have had exchange now and nipples are almost done.  All is well.  Best of luck with your surgery.  AngelaD ",
