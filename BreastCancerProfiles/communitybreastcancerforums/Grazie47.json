When we returned my husband didn't want to tell our sons, he didn't want them to worry. I told him they are adults and will be the first we will tell, they will not find out from someone else.  I agree with Survivor 11 to not tell them would create a distrust.  Everything I have been through, every test the first one I call are my sons, they know every little detail and freely discuss it with me and anyone else who is interested. I work in a very culturally diverse nursing home, I went into work and calmly stated that I have been diagnosed with breast cancer and would be taking a leave of absence.  Wow was I ever surprised everyone was so comforting and wishing me well.  While I was at home fighting this rotten disease I was overwhelmed with the support that I got from people other than my family.  I got flowers, gifts, cards, calls of support and more importantly prayers from every known religion, Christens, Jews, Muslims, Fundamentalists, Hindus, Buddists, all praying for my recovery. Some co workers would just call out of the blue to gossip, talk, wish me well or to just pray, it was very uplifting. My extended family was just a wonderful, I am blessed.    ",

The only way to keep a secret is to keep it to yourself, if not it will eventually come out, much better if she heard it from you and not someone else. I work with the elderly and they have incredible life experiences, they are way stronger then you think and extremely wise.   They are not children they are adults and deserve to be treated like adults. On the other hand my parents died when I was young so I don't have any experience sharing my diagnosis with them so I am only speaking as a mother. Good luck with you decision.",

The powers to be will decide what research is done, what is reported and what is not. What is the research?  Is early detection available to everyone, or just the elite?  Do the poor have any access to health care, or any education about health care?  Do the non elite even know about breast cancer?",
