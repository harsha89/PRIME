My most recent child (8months) just stopped breast feeding about 3 months ago.  I first noticed a lump in my right breast about 5 months ago but didn't think much of it.  I thought that it could be a swollen milk gland.  About a month after I stopped breast feeding I noticed that it was still there.  Thats when my mother kept telling me that I should get checked (based on a family history of breast cancer, all of the women on my fathers side).  So I went to get a mammogram and they decided that I needed a ultra-sound, they said that the edges were clean and not to be worried.  At that point it took my doctor 2 months to get me in to do a biopsy.  The lump to me had seemed to grow but my husband says its because my breast are smaller.  Anyways I went to get the biopsy with this vacuum like machine and the doctor said that she had never seen tissue like it before, she said it was \"curd-like.\"  My question is since I'm soooo anxious for the results is could it just be a milk gland with curds?  Was anyone given this description of the tissue?
