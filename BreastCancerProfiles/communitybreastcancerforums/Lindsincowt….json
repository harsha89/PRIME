It has overall been better than expected so far. Day 1 and 2 weren't to bad. The infusion went smoothly with no immediate effects, but fatigue. I spent Day 3 and Day 4 pretty foggy. I probably napped twice each day and generally felt stoned. I took the prescribed meds and maybe one extra anti-nauseant although I wasn't giving it a lot of time to see if the feeling stuck around. I did the neulasta shot Day 3 which hit me hard on Day 4, 5 and 6 with a lot of back pain and bone aches. I continued with the claritin daily and used some tylenol. As of Day 7, 8, 9 I am have some loose stools, taste buds wacky and general fatigue. I am sleep deprived as my little one has caught a fever and cough. I am continuing on the claritin for a few more days. Crossing my fingers I don't get sick and trying to rest with 3 young children remains my biggest concern. Trying not to do to much is near impossible! ",
