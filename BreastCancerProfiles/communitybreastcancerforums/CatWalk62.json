My team is suggesting I begin with chemo, 4 drugs total, for 4-1/2 months, then consider mastectomy next May. Why wouldn't they just do the mastectomy first? I have my sentinel node biopsy on Thursday so haven't been officially \"staged\". Also dealing with significant health insurance issues. Started a new job 2 months ago, so may have to delay chemo and switch to a team within my insurance plan. Any thoughts? They say it's aggressive breast cancer, but does that mean I cant delay treatment for 3-4 weeks? So scared! Thanks! Log in to post a reply",
