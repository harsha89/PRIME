Binney, you have an amazing memory!  I start my rads October 12.  I had my reconstructed breast removed--and the other side, too--due to recurrent BC.  No lymphedema with the original, but this time I have already been told by the rad onc that I have moderate LE and can't expect it worsen.  I will ask about the lymphedema specialist when I go in for my SIMS on Thursday. Thanks again!",
