I was a triple negative with my breast cancer and am wondering how this will effect my treatment now. Oh by the way I am stage IV and a bit on edge! Are there any triple negatives out there with mets who can shed some light on my situation? I believe there are some things that I can't take due to being a triple negative. I have wonderful support from my partner, her family and my family and friends but still a scary situation for me. Any input will be appreciated.  :-) Log in to post a reply",
