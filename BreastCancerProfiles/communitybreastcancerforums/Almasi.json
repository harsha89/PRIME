In retrospect it caused me a lot of problems financially. Are you able to afford to buy her tickets home often? In that respect going to Arizona is not the same financially. I was only able to come home for thanksgiving and Christmas and maybe summer if I was lucky. My mom was not able to take time off to come see me. So my biggest regret is I got to see very little of my family and spent more money traveling. I changed schools but this time I was about 10 hours away when my mom was diagnosed. Again it came to finances. It was not really a drive to do to go home for the weekend, especially in snowy weather. Flights were too expensive and my mom had no income. I once endured a 15-hr bus ride just to make it home for $50. Even though I loved, loved, loved my school and had an amazing experience, it was very stressful for me. At that point I tried to transfer home but the were unable to match my financial aid package and my mom did not want me to drop out or take a break because she was sure she would recover. When I graduated I actually moved back to where I went to college because I loved it there. Unfortunately my mom was then diagnosed as a stage IV. I then had the choice to take a job closer to her or stay where I was. I went back and forth and decided to stay. I love my mom but I hate living where she is. It literally makes me depressed. If she were alone I'd go; but she isn't. I picture myself being a really bitter and angry person living there which does not do anyone any good. I am not exaggerating; it happened for years. So I just work extra hard and take unpaid days to go visit her. That way our visits are meaningful. When she's well enough she stays with me. The difference is I am financially stable now. So while your daughter may not think it's a big deal, the travelling really ads up. Cost and time-wise. Find out from your daughter why she really thinks Arizona is better. Let her give you concrete reasons. I think you should be honest and bring up the challenges of if she goes and honest reasons about your health and how that will affect her. Don't make it seem like you are telling her where to go or offering her a guilt trip. My mother has never done that to me. She let me make my own decisions. If you'd like I'd be willing to talk to her so she can consider the reasons without feeling pressured or like she has to please you. All in all tell her you'll support her and love her regardless. Also, if you are stable right now maybe it's ok. Tell her she may need to consider what happens if you take a turn for the worse. She can always take a semester off or visit another school close to you for up to a year. So there are work-arounds; but they may not be free. Everyone who lost a mom to cancer told me to do whatever it takes to spend as much quality time with my mom as possible. It's sad to discuss your ticking clock but it's necessary and a very painful reality. In my opinion, if you are in a financial position to bring her home often and she really articulates why she wants Arizona you should let go.My biggest challenge like I said was not having money to visit. If my mom had become stage IV while I was broke it would have killed me.I would've moved back home for sure.",

I actually realize that 2 out of 4 years I only went home for Christmas because I could not afford a thanksgiving ticket (the busiest and most expensive flight season). It also depends on the school - some give a week off for thanksgiving and others just give you the day maybe the day before but usually just the friday. Getting a reasonable flight and traveling in such short time is a nightmare. You usually end up either missing school to travel on a weekday, or leaving on saturday to avoid the sunday rush. I think you should be honest with your daughter about the toll being far away when you are sick will have on her and I was probably 4 years older than her when I went through it. She can have a great experience 4 hours from home. It's far enough to have your own life. My sister stayed 2 hours from home and graduated college which significantly less debt than I did and she was far enough to be independent and close enough to visit every weekend when my mom was diagnosed.",

HER2+ Nothing in the lungs, bones, liver, brain etc. Just that network of nodes. Most of the people I read about here have it in either the bones, liver or lungs.

Social media may also be helpful for more tips on how to get the story on the news. I can tell the news about many things to pull their heartstrings but not about my mom's illness because she wants it kept private. I always tell her she's a better person than I am because having cancer sucks so if I had it I would milk it for anything good I could possibly get. I tell her she should not have to wait in lines or pump gas in the frigid cold while she is on chemo. My mom loves that dog too even though she does not care for animals. That's how awesome of a dog she is. Anyway, sorry to turn the focus on my problems which are nothing compared to what all of you have to go through and even what my mom is experiencing. Also I hope my comments about using your cancer to get as many good things as you can are not offensive. I just always try to find some bright spot in this terrible illness and the havoc it has caused in our lives. Of course no amount of freebies or attention or good stuff would make having cancer worth it.",

Even when she was first diagnosed stage 4 I supported her when I thought she was going to opt out of chemo (thank God she did not) because I have watched her suffer through treatment so in as much as I want her around forever I don't want to watch her suffer. I am weighing in because she asked me to because she knows I read a lot and know a lot about the disease and treatment. Ultimately I will respect her choice but I wanted to hear from women's experiences since there is not much data. I do know if the cancer comes back it will take a miracle for her to do chemo again. So that's why I lean towards advising her to stick to herceptin because she has little to no side effects on it.",

      "Content": "Mar 2, 2015 02:21PM - edited Mar 2, 2015 02:27PM by Almasi Hi Deanna and musiclover. My friend said she was invited to go to christmas eve dinner by her in-laws. They took the dog and left it in the backyard and their in-laws have a guest house in the back. Their renter opened the gate and the dog got out. They say the renter did not tell them the dog had gotten out until hours later. I would never have left my dog with her if I had known she would ever leave her in the backyard unattended. I rarely go anywhere without my dog because I need her but when I do I never let anyone who will do that take care of her. My psychiatrist retired and I don't really like his successor. She took her sweet time getting my paperwork renewed (it expires every year) so I could travel with the dog. Anyway, push came to shove so I decided to leave because of my mom's condition and thought I could trust my dog would be well taken care of. I was gone all of one day before the dog was lost. I could not even leave go back and look for her because of my mom. All of that doesn't matter because it cannot change anything now. Yes,  I have put up almost 200 11X18 laminated, fluorescent flyers, hundreds more paper flyers, I check with the shelters everyday craiglist and facebook. I put an ad in the local paper. I initially did not offer a reward because she is very shy and I was advised that people would try and chase her if I did (trying to catch her for the money) and I still got a good number of calls which did not lead to anything other than finding other lost dogs! Even without a reward some really cruel people have used my posters to call me trying to get money by pretending to have the dog or claiming to have killed or injured her. Someone else used it as a ploy to convert me to her religion (!) and just weekend someone called and asked about the dog and then tried to solicit sexual favors from me. My new posters offer a reward now so who knows who will come out of the woodwork now! I don't know how much more of this I can take. I don't want to give up but the search is also emotionally draining. The fact that my friend lost her 2 hours away is the worst of all of this. If she had been lost in my area she would've found her way home; or the cops or animal control in my area are very good and would've caught her (where she was lost they don't care) or at the very least I would spend every day knocking down every single house looking. I cannot afford to keep making that drive.  I would really love your help using social media but I would ask that you don't mention my mom's B.C. My mother is a very private person and has not told most people (including some family members) so I cannot risk having anyone find out about it on facebook. I will come back and post the link.   ",

I really want to bring attention to metastatic breast cancer, especially since there are options for our employees to donate specifically to charities that raise money for metastatic breast cancer. Most just donate to Komen because it's all they know. So I was thinking this year I may be able to reach more people and put a more human side to the article if I did an interview with someone with metastatic breast cancer. It may also be less disconcerting for them to see that many women continue to trudge on even after the diagnosis. Please let me know if you are interested. My mother has stage IV BC but she refuses to even tell some of her closest friends and family about it so she will not let me write about her. The newsletter will not be distributed beyond my job. Because of the nature of my job (we do some work that requires securityclearances and background checks) I cannot share the entire newsletter with you when it is complete because it will include some work-related stuff I am not allowed to distribute. However, I will let you see the article in it's entirety before it is published. I can also ask management if it's ok not to use your full name. Thank you.",

In January of 2015 she was NED. She continued herceptin and perjeta until August of 2015. Her onc took her off of all meds and said he wanted to \"see\" what would happen. She is still NED as of January 2016 on zero meds. Her onc wants her to think about whether she wants to be on herceptin indefinitely as a precautionary measure. What are your opinions? I think she should do it. The stage IV came back in such a sneaky and unexpected way and her prognosis was very poor at the time. If her chemo had been unsuccessful with the type of mets she had she'd have been gone in 6 months according to her onc. I guess I just worry that since the cancer came back despite successful treatment of her early stage cancer that it is bound to come back...but I don't know and I can't seem to find much info. Her cancer is HER2+, ER- PR-.",

However, when she had her stage IV recurrence and she went on chemo, 3months into chemo the pain went away and she was able to sleep on that side of her body just fine. It could've been coincidence or maybe she had other inflammation there and given the drug cocktails she took on chemo maybe one of them eased the inflammation. We can't really tell.",

She did chemo and herceptin/perjeta and was NED. She was on nothing after, which I found odd but I think it may have been her choice since the chemo itself was an uphill choice to begin with, having done it before years prior and sworn never again... Now she has mets to her liver which were stable early this year but now show some progression. She is now on herceptin/perjeta. Anyone have good results with targeted therapy on liver mets",

At her initial stage II she did carboplatin, taxol and herceptin. I know for sure she will not do another taxane or broad spectrum chemo. She would rather die. She did not do well at all. She even has a lot of side effects with perjeta. So I really hope herceptin and perjeta work. I already lost my father.",
