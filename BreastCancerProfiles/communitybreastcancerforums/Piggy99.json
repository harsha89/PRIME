I've had good results so far, after the first three months the bone mets and lymph nodes were almost gone by PET/CT and the breast only showed physiological uptake (so no FDG-avid tumor). The doctor can still feel a \"thickening\" in the breast (which can be scar tissue or sleeping cancer that's not metabolically active enough to be seen by PET), but it's changed quite dramatically from a hard tumor that was over 5cm in January.",

I then switched to Letrozole. Some insurance providers might be less accommodating and make you wait a couple of months until you are actually in induced menopause, but I think most women in the US generally get approved. ",

Right now you've been hit with the news that your worst nightmare as an earlier stage survivor has just come true. It takes time to deal with this sort of news, and crying, being angry, sleeping to forget, eating icecream and binge-watching Netflix to quiet that scared voice in your head for a couple of hours are all valid responses. Hopefully your CT and PET scans come back clear and you're looking at bone-only mets, but even if they don't, the doctors have a lot of options to get the disease under control and give you many more good years. Most studies show that a positive attitude won't help you live longer, but it would probably help you live better. But you can't force a positive attitude, and putting one on for others won't do you any good. At some point the shock will wear off, and your mind will get tired of going back to the pain of the diagnosis and will want to visit some happier places, but it won't happen overnight. You'll slowly feel better once you have a treatment in place and realize that the mets are not going to kill you tomorrow, or next week, or next month and most likely not next year either. Having an active lifestyle and a healthy diet will help with the side effects from the treatments, so your hard work over the past two years is not wasted. Welcome to the special club nobody wants to join - you'll find lots of support and encouragement here. Hugs",

I hope that fifteen years from now you will still be on these boards, giving hope to newly diagnosed MBC patients as well as early stage gals.",

I think some people mentioned trouble sleeping/bad dreams taking letrozole close to bed, so I decided to take it with lunch. I take Ibrance with dinner because it's my biggest meal and it's supposed to be taken with food with some fat in it. I also wanted to spread out my daily pills and supplements so I don't whack my GI with 12 different pills at once (I take a baby aspirin and fish oil, calcium and vitamin D, a probiotic and an antihistamine in addition to the letrozole and ibrance). It won't make a difference whether you take them together - the half-life (time it takes for the blood concentration to be cut in half) of letrozole is 2 days and that of Ibrance is 27 hours, so there will be plenty of each drug in your blood at any given time. Take them whenever it's most convenient and gives you the least trouble.",
