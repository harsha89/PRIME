Mine was palpable, and on a good day, you could probably see it in a tight shirt (sorry so graphic.) It must be very difficult to be in the space that you are in, and not having a sense of when is enough? I would make one suggestion, and it is to go ahead with the MRI. I am a veteran of many tests over the last decade or so, and not all for breast cancer. I have heard from many that the MRI found additional cancer areas...and there is also the reverse, ruling out additional cancers. When I made the decision to have my bi-lateral, I asked myself what I could deal with in terms of the efforts I made to get rid of the cancer. So I imagined different scenarios, and was able to sit with my choices, difficult as they were. Some days I have to remind myself too, it's ongoing. There are many stories on these boards from women who were in this ambiguous place as you are. and I hear the your fear, which is very normal. I am confused...are you having another core biopsy on the 10th? hoping you are hanging in there, Traci",

I then took another round of lessons for a year in DC before I popped my lung on a fall. In Blacksburg,I remember going to the gate, and yelling \"Horses! Horses! at dinnertime, then hearing the awesome thunder of hooves. The horses would come running from the vast fields, and it was my job to let them in a few at a time, or when in, make sure they didn't eat other's food on their way to the their stall. A little intimidating for sure. I had an experience that was nothing short of magicical one night while at work. There was snow on the ground, and the large barn was all lit up. The snow was glistening from the lighted barn, and the mountains were looming in the distance, dark purples and black outlines in the night sky. I was tasked to go get one of the wild ponies, so I went down to fenced area and walked into where the ponies were. I could hear their breathing, the snorting in their nostrils. Their coats and tails were matted with burrs and their hair was long and wild. I just stopped all of a sudden, and looked up at the barn, which was streaming with light. Everything around me was silent, except for the hooves on snow, and the breathing. I felt peace that I had never known before, and this memory will be with me until I pass. Absolute peace. It is fear that keeps me off the horse now, but if I rode again, I would go for the Western vs English saddle. I just did not have the balance (I am very tall) or strength, and my trunk/pelvis has had repeated surgeries. My mom was very funny when she said to me that riding English was like riding on a place mat....no oh s**t handle (my words.) One minute you are on, the next whoosh! off you go :) Love and respect these gorgeous creatures. I think I need to choose a lumbering fat horse with a Western saddle to get over my fears. Preferable one where my feet drag on the ground.  There was a horse named Ella at the stables in DC that I thought would have been perfect for me. She was named after Ella Fitzgerald, and was a tad on the portly side. and slow. Sorry I am rambling, I just love this topic.  does anyone know of any horse therapy in the DC/Va/MD area for breast cancer patients? traci",

I have that tall women's thing where I had a bleb that popped in my lung, which collapsed my lung without the broken ribs. But I did get the surgery and chest tube. Nice, huh?

So here is my question...I really think the Western Saddle is the way I need to go if I ever get back in the ring. I think I have seen more of a sit trot in western, not a posting trot. Would I look the fool if I posted around in a western saddle, displaying the only skill I am good at?

I imagine I would be quite bored as well, so therefore would have to come up with tricks to get my human off. I swear, sometimes I could hear my lesson horse laughing and making plans with his buddies when I would round the corner. Yup, I am that girl. Taking me up to the trees so I could get a \"closer look,\" do you think they thought I was a tree surgeon? What would you do to plan a camping trip? Does you horse go willingly into the trailer? Does your horse put up the tent, or stand by and shout out directions....  :)",

I am going to sort of break this down into parts...When faced with a threat to our bodies, we often revert into coping mechanisms we have used in the past.  (learned this from the professionals :) So I will tell you to try and see you are trying to get some control over some very scary news...and it has gone from the question of cancer to being alone and your husband leaving you. Your worth as a human being and as a woman is not summed up in your breast. But your reaction is normal....If you had a friend who was going through something similar, would you think the same for her?  (this is where you need to be your best friend...)  You will also see many husbands referred to as DH here, and husbands who write for their wives.  I only hear support for them, and that's what you deserve. So I ask that you take a deep breath, and remember who you are as a person, and your worth. You are only 45 :) I was diagnosed at the age of 42. Breast Cancer, or the threat of breast cancer is very difficult, and I would not trivialize it...but I do believe there is much to be hoped for, and it does not necessarily mean losing your breast, and certainly doesn't have to mean losing your life.  Many woman have lumpectomies, and go right no living. So, I don't know if this has been helpful, and it is early in the morning here...so not sure how this is coming across, but I hope you can be good to yourself today, and try to relieve some of the stress you are under.  If it seems to much, call your MD and tell them how anxious you are. You would not be the first person to do so, and many of us needed some anti-anxiety medication in the beginning.  I believe you can get through this, and I would hope the same for your relationship.

(vs. the obvious nasty pharmeceuticals, all dangerous.) Great example would be our dear old friend Digoxin. From foxglove. I swear, I bet if it was on the shelf in a health food store wrapped in a blue bow, I would see some saying how it cured their cancer. So many \"drugs\" are available over the counter, non regulated, and just because they come from a plant, they are considered safe. Great story about Vincent Van Gogh. It is speculated that his \"yellow period\" was really about his overdosing on digoxin through the plant foxglove. Remember in school talking about dig tox, and the yellow halo's? His paintings during this period had that dig tox appearance. Anyway, some days it's really hard to stomach dangerous ignorance. well all days. Thanks for listening, as I don't want to pull my hair out, but really it's just too much. Dangerous even. No less dangerous than assuming all regulated meds are without fault. Just hard to see someone who is going to most likely be physically hurt from their choices, but they don't want to hear Science. Peace. (I'm trying!)",

Now, I don't know where that stands today, but certainly that stuck in my mind, as they were looking at Nurses in particular due to the ready sample of night shift workers. My chemo was delayed 6 weeks due to my drains and cellulitis. My scar healing was delayed a bit on the cancer side, and my drains were in for 5 weeks, then my TE was punctured during a fill, so I had to get another one and go through the drain issues again. But I did keep them and still have them, waiting for exchange in the spring.  It wasn't looking good for a minute, but I made it through. I'm not sure when you had your surgery, maybe sometime in September? Are you about three weeks post mastectomy? I'd check your posts, but then mine would disappear...hang in there Pat. What's the reasoning for the PICC line, are you on extended antibiotics? I did get a port, and am very glad that I did. It doesn't bother me at all, it took about a week to get over the discomfort.

Thank God, most of my care has been pretty good, less the horrific post mastectomy care on the Surgical Floor. I was disgusted, sicker than I ever needed to be, and swear a nurse came in, read my People Magazine for 20 minutes, without barely saying a word to me and left the room. I didn't want to bother her in her sacred Nursy moment. The only Nurse on that floor that gave me good care was....wait for it...a breast cancer survivor. In her words to the MD, let's get her out of here before she gets any sicker. I again, want to say the rest of my care, especially my treasured Oncology Infusion Nurses, were Angels. Yesterday, I was trapped in thoughts again of the disasterous care my mother received after I brought her to DC for treatment of her Pancreatic Cancer. I could list ten events alone that will haunt me through my days. I felt responsible for leading her to this place where they failed her. One example? Showing up in the morning, my mother in excrutiating pain with her epidural delivering narcotics to the floor having been dislodged MANY hours earlier if I calculated the amount of the puddle verses her flow rate. sorry ladies, I had to get that out. I just cannot forgive myself bringing her to DC then her dying here. At least Hospice turned it around and gave us 12 more days to be with her in comfort. Namaste. Off to cry :( :( :(",

But I researched and I don't take anything blindly. There are several medications that are in the health food stores that have very bad interactions with meds. I have to do a very intensive review of my patients meds to make sure there are no interactions. A big contender for review is St. John's Wart. Never said it didn't have it's place, but we must be aware that these meds can do harm when mixed with others. It is the same in reverse. I remember one day getting ready to D/C a patient off tele, then all of a sudden he started having arrhythmias. He had been perfectly fine over night, NSR. When we went in to check on him and try and sort out what was going on, he showed us all of his \"own\"meds that he had just taken (all OTC.) He bought himself another day in the hospital, and my eyes were opened. So, I walk a line, but I honestly spend a lot of time having to play detective and to me, this is serious. I also have the same critical eye for meds that are FDA approved. I know people have been hurt, and this is through anecdotal evidence. Acupuncture is a wonderful treatment modality, along with massage, meditation, yoga and many herbs as well. We know many meds come from plants and \"nature.\" Our taxotere is/was derived from the yew bark, wasn't it? (off the cuff here, as I will lose post to go look it up, you'll re-direct if needed won't you?) oh, and so agree about incorporating prayer, affirmations prior to anesthesia induction has a very positive effect on patients. I remember there was a study, and the end result was less nausea meds, and better pain management (again, if my recal is correct.) Very good points, and I believe it is up to us to be open, yet mindful that we must Listen Listen Listen and hear our patients, to meet them where they are. (but help to keep them safe.) Namaste!",

Then to have had bad experiences with Doctors.  I think it's perfectly appropriate to ask your MD for something for anxiety if you need to.  They would most likely write a prescription, so they might not have anything at the office for your biopsy, but don't quote me.  My core biopsy was not painful as I had a numbing agent injected beforehand (that wasn't bad either.) It's of course the worrying that is the hardest to manage.  The biopsy will need to be sent off for evaluation, and I believe it was about a week? before my results were back.  Keep reaching out...there will be other ladies that will tell you of their experiences.  Unfortunately, this is a step by step process, and many of us agree it's the waiting that is so agonizing.  That's why I mentioned the anti-anxiety medication, or at least to tell your MD's how difficult this is for you.  I will pray for a negative biopsy, and a better workup of your pain. I'll check in on you later...hang in there! traci",

I have what feels like intense pain, muscle fatigue, and some nausea.   I have been miserable the last two days. I had a hysterectomy 8 years ago, without estrogen replacement.

I remember having the Nurses do that after a surgery in 2005, and she gave me 'tude for making her take the script down so it was ready when I left.  Whatever...

I have to say, I was welcomed with such trueness of heart on the Catholic thread, that I just kept coming back. I had other threads where I would be basically talking to myself, and people writing around me. I barely received a nod of recognition. It's a thread where I \"should\" be, but am not. I am happy for this, as it pushed me right where I needed to be. The whole door window thing. I am learning so much from everyone, and really stretching to reach a place where I have wanted to be for so long. I am happy. When I hear all of our struggles with what our loved ones and ourselves have had in hospitals. I am sad! I agree, NO ONE is perfect, much less me. I try very hard, and listen to people. Icannot imagine having been outside of dialysis with your Dad going through what he did. They should have shut that place down after the last patient was finished that day. Unacceptable. I have had patients stop me when they were concerned with the meds, to find our they had some very important info to share. The patients know themselves best, and if they are unable to speak, well, God bless those who stay at the bedside. It can be a double edged sword at times, but I have also had families that were right there with me, being my eyes when I was down the hallway, telling me that their loved one was not acting right. They were the best to tell me their loved one's baseline. They also helped me learn. Some were downright obstructive, but I too would try too work with them. ( a few come to mind :) But today, I think we have to go in and stay with our loved ones, and I learned that the hard way. I even would find my mom's nurses, talk to them, and then come back the next day to see, all was not well, and some had not been her advocate as I thought they would be. If your gut says stay, then stay. Later I will share the day I tried to get someone to go into her room, while calling from my house. Bring a barf bag for that one. Alright, I am off, and praying for a good day. Namaste. (take good care Pat!)",

It's so interesting how different the timing and treatments are between us all, which I suspect has more to do with out medical teams.

Thank God it seems to have been limited to the surgical floor, but so disheartening. Keep up the good works Native, and keep your chin up. I'm proud to have you out there, working so hard on behalf of our profession. Our society today supports this behavior, can you even imagine Florence N.'s response to these students?

I once chewed a piece of gum in the AM, 5 hours before an injection where I was going to be sedated. Well, that was a baaaad idea, b/c I guess I was coughing/choking, so they had to lighten my sedation significantly. Then came the screaming....from me.

My body wide pain sequela feels like someone took a wooden spoon and hit me all over with it. My last two nights have been very restless, and I am exhausted, close to tears. I am going to try and up my Neurontin dose, but I won't be able to take it in the day if it makes me too sleepy. Kate, Botox makes sense, they are expanding their use of it. They had started using in cerebral pasley patients awhile back, but dosing and side effects are of concern due to the amount needed. Something local like the pecs is worth a little research. I'm sorry you are in pain. I still have my TE's, and it they will have been in for 18 months by the time I get my implants. They are far from comfortable. Jessamine (like your Tiger pic!) Sorry you are going through this too. I'm just shaking my head..it would be nice to have something be easy and non eventful, right?",

Long story short, I now get to carry around my turtle shells for breasts for 18 months...and then we will do the exchange. The reason for the change in plans was I only had a 1 mm margin of non cancerous tissue on the chest wall.  Being triple negative, this too factored in my decision. I know these decision are so hard, and I was way upset to have to make it.  Ask a lot of questions, and follow your heart. Traci",

Years ago, I had tried Lyrica, and granted my MD probably started me on a dose that was too high, and I was dizzy spinning for 24 hours so I said never again! I havn't had the guts to try it again at a lower dose. So the neurontin for me has been really great. My pain MD started it before the chemo to try and preempt the side effect of neuropathy from the chemo. I did get neuropathy, worse in my feet than in my hands, but neurontin has been very helpful to me. It's inexpensive compared to Lyrica too. Because I am sensitive, and it makes me sleepy, I never made it past 3 300 mg. capsules at night, maybe one capsule during the day added on, on the weekends. I also feel like it mitigates the pain.There are some people that take divided doses throughout the day, so my dose is really the lowest that will provided symptom relief. Just go nice and slow...have your MD titrate you slowly, and you may begin to feel some better. I wish you the best, would you let us know? Traci",
