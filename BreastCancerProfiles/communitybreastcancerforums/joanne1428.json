I have not bought gifts for every occasion ahead, because that just felt too overwhelming.... To be honest, I had started doing some of this on my own, but the music therapist and social worker through my palliative care (hospice) program, have helped me do a few things I never would have thought of on my own, and it does bring me peace. Also, I'm not stopping, it's pretty well what I devote my time too - making gifts and keepsakes for my friends and family members....  I would also love to totally go through all of my possessions and divvy it up and then throw the rest away so that my husband and children do not have to do this task, but I don't think I have the physical ability to do that right now..... For now, it is stiching, and I am a stitching demon.......  Too bad cross-stitch is apparently \"out of style\"  and a decorating no-no, (hee hee) cuz my loved ones are getting a bunch of it...........

I have a feeling this report sounds a little depressing, but believe me, I am still holding bundles of hope, and I just try to sqeeze on to that with all my might!  You ladies here help me a great deal to hold on to that hope, you have a very powerfully good influence on me !!!

I have been on Cisplatin (a cousin to Carboplatin) and it was managable to me, with the anti-nausea meds they give.  However, I was 44 at the time and it was my first line treatment for lung mets.... so I was relatively \"healthy\" Since that time I have been on several chemos, some have worked better than others, but I have never had more than a partial response.  I have had malignant pleural effusion and unfortunately when I had it drained (a relatively routine procedure) something went wrong and my lower left lung collapsed, causing me lots of pain and sudden lessening of my lung function.  Chemo, oxygen, morphine and bedrest have worked to get me back into a relatively good state, although my functional mobility is very low..... My quality of life (as long as i stay in bed) is decent.  There are a lot of ups and downs in this disease.  Chemo has worked to lessen the effusion.  I'm not sure why your mom would have an effusion if not for lung mets, but I would ask before assuming, you never know with this disease. As for your mom's wanting to make her plans, I can imagine how difficult it is for you to particiate, but if you can, it will be a real gift to your mom.  Most of us here have -to some degree- made some plans and worked on some legacy type things..... sort of planning for the worst, but hoping for the best.  I've been doing it slowly, as I've been emotionally ready, bit by bit.  I had a priest sit down with my mom, my husband and myself and planned out my funeral, I've been deciding on gifts, writing letters, recording some CDs for my kids.    Your mom will have more peace if she feels like you are going to be \"ok\".... I know that's what I want for my kids who are 21, 19 and 15.  I know it is going to be terrible and horrible to lose a mother, I just want to feel like they will get through.  I have gone so far as to ask certain of my friends to check on each of my children and my hubby, kind of assigned a watchdog to each......  It brings me a bit of comfort.....Even though it is on the bizarre side, being present while she vocalizes her wishes likely brings her peace, and that is a big gift to her if you are able to give it. Again, I am so sorry you have to be dealing with this, it is amessy, uncivilized disease.  But while the \"worst\" is a possibility, never forget that there is still lots of hope, all things are possible and a few months from now, the situation could be reversed for the positive.  Always reasons to hope.     Take care - Joanne",

A few months ago, and rather suddenly, I took a serious nose-dive downhill.  Something went awry during a routine attempt to drain a pleural effusion and my right lower lung collapsed.  Suddenly, I was placed on morphine and  on oxygen and I was being referred for homecare nursing - for a hospital bed to be put in my home, etc.  All of a sudden I was very very sick. The social worker at the cancer clinic asked me if I was open to her making a palliative home care referral, or did I only want regular homecare.  After a great huge deal of SHOCK at the word \"Palliative\" (I didn't want it to be \"time\" for that yet !!!) I figured out  that I would get much better service on the palliative service than the regular, so I swallowed my pride and agreed to the palliative/hospice service. Best decision I ever made.  The truth is I am Stage IV and although I do not consider myself to be \"dying\" at the moment, I have all the expected issues in dealing with a life threatening disease.  Their team has just done so much to help me (and my family) cope with everything that it is just amazing.  I utilize a social worker, a music therapist, a spiritual care counsellor, OT, and the nursing care - I can't say enough about everything they do for me, but I'd be happy to give more info if anyone is interested.  Plus, they are just so skilled at dealing with the big \"D\" issue, they just know how to talk about it without being freaky, or at least that is my experience. It was the only good thing that came out of my little medical crisis.  I'm still in the hospital bed, still on oxygen and morphine, but I'm not planning on going anywhere soon, and they support me in that goal too.   They know I want every single day I can squeeze out of this deal, and they support me in that, but at the same time they help me plan for \"the end\" whenever that may be. Hope that bit of info helps....Joanne",

I hope you really enjoy your chemo break.  As I remember, your oncologist wasn't all that enthusiastic about it, and you were asking us for signs of progression?  Perhaps we weren't able to provide you with the answers you seek, partly because breast cancer is so sneaky.  None of us can tell you one way or the other whether you should take a break, if your cancer will stay stable, or even what it might feel like if it keeps growing.  I know for myself... I have often had progression on my scans at times when I thought I was doing great....  for me it seems like the disease progresses in advance of any visible symptom.  That's why I am hesitant of giving advice about it! I am also thinking of taking a chemo break over Christmas, but I still haven't decided, I am terribly UNDECIDED in fact.  Weighting out the pros and cons, but I'm having a tough time.  In the end, I guess we each must do what is right for us, in our unique circumstance.   Right now I don't even know what is right for ME, so I feel very stupid trying to give suggestions to others! I am lucky because I am on disability and do not have to factor in an unreasonable boss.... I sure hope that your boss settles in to a more consistently supportive person. Minette, you have said several times that you feel really stressed and it does seem like you have a lot on your plate.  Maybe your nurse has made a good suggestion about seeing someone while you are on your chemo break to discuss your decision, your life in general and your stresses, see if there is anything that you could do to ease the burden or ways in which your family could lighten your load.  I hope you find some of these solutions and I hope you have a ton of happiness and peace during your chemo break.  Joanne",

I've only been told a typical prognosis once (because I specifically asked) and I'm pretty sure it would not be helpful to mention it again, here or anywhere.  Prognosis stats are something that depend on so much and they are also outdated, many oncologists are reluctant to even say, since they are so often wrong. It does sound to me like your mom has plenty of time to have that reconstruction with no ill effects on possible mets treatment, but of course, in the end that is up to her.  And it is no matter of vanity for sure, it is a unique decision that is different for each of us.  Still hoping for your mom that the further scans will show benign nodules - keep hope burning bright, it does happen!!!

I imagine that your mom's doc thinks it is reasonable to go ahead with reconstructive surgery, since getting a PET will take awhile anyway - to get the scan and WAIT for results, etc...  If indeed it is lung mets, it sounds like the amount of disease is TINY, and so I don't think that having the reconstructive surgery would cause her risk with any treatment she might need, although if she does need chemo, it would delay it somewhat. I have lung mets and mediastinel lymph node mets, which I developed 5 yrs after being treated for Stage 1 bc,  and I am 46 years old.   I have never had reconstructive surgery for my mastectomy, and to be honest it just isn't a big deal for me.  So personally, I would NOT put my energy there right now if it were me.....  HOWEVER, the reconstruction may be really important to your mom and one of the biggest ways we support each other in this journey is to be respectful of each person's goals and wishes.  One thing I do know from my heart is how much your support must mean to your mom at this difficult time.   She will let you know by her words and actions what will be the most helpful thing for her, but your support is a true gift.  Bless you both while you wait in this agonizing time.

OR when the longer term survivors (Hooray) might develop some of the serious side effects from these heavy hitter drugs..... It's a pickle...... I know for one that I have been fully informed all along about risks and benefits, including response rates to all the chemos I have been on.  News of poor effectiveness does not come as a shock to me.......I was NEVER told \"take this and you will be fine\".... but maybe the medical world has to make darn sure that we all receive highy informed information so that we are honestly consenting to whatever the treatment is - good, bad and the ugly.  Joanne",

I think it was probably just one of those bad surgical outcomes that should  never happen.....  something technique wise must have gone wrong to have introduced infection.  Do you know your surgeon's record and experience with port insertions?  Some are experts, putting in dozens regularly, others just once in awhile, it might be relevent and something to ask about.  Surgeons should not be offended by enquiries related to their success rates and infection rates......  and should be forthcoming with the info.

Because of space and crowding, they had to put me in a chair in the pediatric chemo unit, and because of the length of the day I was there the whole day. A boy the age of my youngest son - I would say 15 or 16 - was brought in his mom..... a brother and a man (dad? wasn't sure) arrived, the dad watched the TV for 15 minutes, and then left. The mom left as soon as the dad arrived. That child was alone all day having chemo. By the end of the day he looked terrible, he was very nauseated and sick. He had two different times when they had to call the doctor and he had to deal with those visits all alone. I left when the unit was closing at 4:30 and he was all still alone. Maybe there was a very good reason that it all happened this way, but I found it very, very very sad. And there I sat, a 46 yr old woman, and who was beside me all day, keeping me company??? - my MOM....it is in these moments that I feel \"lucky\" even though I have Stage IV cancer...... Terrible enough that children get cancer, just so much more terrible to have a treatment alone. My kids are either teenagers or recent teen \"graduates\"... I know teens don't want to be smothered by their parents, but I also know that they need their parents still, even if that means from the next room! They still need them there. Just needed to share......... I came home and gave my boys an extra hug...... if you have teenagers, please go and give them that hug that little boy I saw today should have had from his mom or dad.

Anyway, It may well not be cancer - don't forget that bronchial problems/infections, etc... can take a long time to heal, with continued SOB.... also if indeed you have a partial collapse, that DEFINITELY causes SOB.  My right lung is partially collapsed and I have been SOB on exertion since then (June).  Anything that lasts and doesn't resolve warrants investigation, so keep pushing, you deserve answers!

      "Content": "Oct 8, 2007 07:51PM - edited Oct 8, 2007 07:51PM by joanne1428 I am so sorry your scans turned out this way, and I am glad you came back here to tell us, and to allow us to help you through.  This is awful news for any of us and it arrives with a terrible shock.  If I could suggest anything, it would be to allow yourself a couple of days to let this all sink in, and to begin to get the opinion(s) so that you can get a treatment plan in place.  Bone mets are very treatable, as are other mets as well.  You will read some real \"miracle\" stories, right here on this board.   So even at the depths of your current despair, just try to remember that there is hope.  You don't have to believe it just yet, just believe that it might be possible, and the reality of that will unfold before you when you get over all this shock. As for your husband (and positive thinking):  Well, I think that he is wrong.  Positive thinking is great, and helps us have a better life.  But it alone will not treat this disease.  And, yes, it sure helps get us through treatment, but we need a lot more concrete support as well.  Like having someone to listen to us cry in those \"not so positive\" moments.   You've just been given a diagnosis that makes your cancer a part of your life forever - at best it will be managed as a chronic disease, at \"worst\" this disease  can be fatal.  It is impossible (in my opinion) to be positive all of the time.  Trying to keep up that kind of \"Positive at all costs\" face, takes a high price.   So if you are not feeling all that positive right now, you are completely normal.  Believe it or not, you will regain equilibrium and you will learn to live with this disease.  And if you were positive before, I am sure you will be again.....  but you also deserve to have any emotion known to man when you land in this kind of quagmire.   So, I hope you will allow yourself ALL of your feelings, it's part of learning to carry on with this dreadful disease. Hang on and keep posting.  We will try to keep you surrounded with love and support to help you get through this next while.   Joanne",

In the end, we have to safeguard our own well-being, and keep those who are damaging us in a place where they can do us less harm.  I'm not just sure what that is....  when I am really vulnerable for example, I try not to speak with them, let my husband do the talking. That sort of thing.  In the end, I am sorry you are having this type of reaction from people that you love.... you deserve more.  I hope that they \"wake up\" and offer you better support.

Anyway, my husband immediately told me he was relieved with my decision.  My 21 yr old said \"solid call, mom\" and when I expressed my disappointment that I would not be as lively as I would like, she said \"I'd rather have alive than lively\"....  Whoosh, and I'm crying, I foolishly assumed they'd rather have \"normal\" times, and they are actually more comforted that tx was not delayed.  Go figure. So, it is alreay done, I had Taxotere on Friday.   I had Taxotere in 2004 and it is considered successful because I had more than a year disease free interval, so worth giving a try, we'll see how it goes. ANd yes, you all remember me well.  I'm the one who took a big tumble in June and have been crawing my way back to anything since then.  It's so weird, I'm now getting pretty good CT results, but the damage done to me when I figured I was a goner in June is proving to be a tough recovery.  Funny thing, I promise you all.... I've been held in a limbo of sorts, here in my hospital bed/wheelchair/morphine/oxygen/palliative nursing, the works.  You would think it would be constant depression, but it is not.  I do hate all the chemo, but I have learned that you can still live a very joyful and happy life even within some very narrow confines.  I still get to be a mom to my kids, yes, it is a different way, but I am still here to listen to their ups and downs, encourage them, and remind my youngest that it's time to get in the shower.  I wouldn't have ever predicted it.  But now I know why people fight to the end.  It's just to keep having more \"normal\" and more time to say \"I love you\" to everyone and anyone you want! Thanks again for your love and good wishes and prayers, apparently I am still in need of those, I'm still waiting for my miracle! Joanne",

Unless you onc can really explain why he is not worried (ie. something about the appearance of those nodules must seem very benign), I don't think I would let the matter rest, and that is mostly because when you have single solitary nodules (and if, god forbid they turn out to be cancer) you have some treatment options that do not exist once lung mets are extensive.  Such as surgery or ablation, etc.. Myself, I think I would want a second opinion and at the least a rescan in 3 months.  I have benign nodules in my liver, and no one has ever been alarmed due to their appearance.... I now get CTs about every 3 months to monitor my lung mets, and they have never changed, definitely benign.... so your doctor is right, odds are in your favour for benign.  I just think I would want to be on the \"safe\" side and get it checked sooner rather than later.  My lung mets were also discovered on routine CT scan, but they were already diffuse.  I'm triple negative and so chemo has been my only option.....  But there are ladies who have solitary nodules removed and are doing well years and years and years later.... In the end, it is you that must have peace with whatever you decide, and of course, you will find support here no matter what that is.....  I think your onc must be pretty confident they are B9, but you just don't want to be the one oddball where the \"look\" doesn't match the reality.

Right now I'm in bad shape due to cancer.  However, my husband and I are extraordinarily close to each other, and we have to be happy with that for the time being.  I think it is just a result of staring death in the face and having to deal with the reality of that.  We've had converstations with each other that leave no doubt about the depth of love and devotion we feel for each other..... but sex has not been a part of that.... I wish it were still a possibility but so far I am just to weak and too unwell.    The amount of support I've had from him on this topic alone has stunned me, I expected a certain amount of support from him, but he has been kind and loving about it.  Also, good chance there isn't as much desire to be having sex with a clearly sick person. Now..... on the other hand, if you are finished treatment and recovering - physically and emotionally, I think there is where a lot of challenges with sex come in, for both partners.....and I think that lack of interest in sex might well be viewed as rejection by either gender, unless there was a whole lot of communicating and understanding going on.....  With  my first and second round with cancer, I felt I was never going to get my sex life back - but I did and I must say it was actually better than pre breast cancer....  but it is a process of healing, just like the other aspects of healing... Angel - hang on, there are good suggestions out there that might help you and don't be afraid to speak to your doctor or oncologist, they have a few tricks up their sleeves to help with the physical parts...... if it is more an emotional barrier, then a therapist can help get you past that part too.  Things will improve Angel, but it can take time, and patience!!!!

Even a few months ago, she resented having to help me do anything because she didn't want me to need help (does that make sense?) and she would still try to get me to do things for HER to prove to herself that I was still there for her.  I had given up expecting to feel any peace at all about her and yet, here it is, I get a glimmer.......
