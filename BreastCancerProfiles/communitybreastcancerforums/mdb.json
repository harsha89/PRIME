My diagnosis, August, 2006, 2cm right breast IDC, ER/PR+, HER2-, Grade 1, no node involvement. Cut out, with huge margins. No radiation, no Tamoxifen, no further treatments.  2+ years, later, totally clear, mammogram. Although, summer, 2007, I had a left breast, anomoly. The digital mammo on that breast (first ever, the prior ones had been film) found ADH.  The MRI, found, nothing. Stereo biopsy, to surgical excisional biopsy, all nothing, in the end. Totaly clear, No cancer in the left, non-cancer breast. And no cancer, in the formerly right, cancer breast.  My next digital mammo/MRI is December, 2008, see what happens, then.  My experience. ",

Followup Recommended in six months.\" Totally normal, breast tissue. With my rejecting, the radiation, after two years, if there were some cancer cells, left, shouldn't they have grown, by now? Of course, they still may be growing, but SO slowly. I'll definitely \"catch them,\" in time. Why even DO this radiation? But you said it before, Marie. they force the radiation on 100% of the women for the 10% it really helps. And I find this, appalling. I didn't even know, about those earlier, studies. We women, don't have to accept, this. And I've made, my decision. No radiation, for me. EVER. And NONE of this Tamoxifen or anything else. What I find, interesting (or appalling) is that they treat breast cancer like that's the only \"bad thing\" that can ever happen, to you. And so, you have to \"do everything,\" to stop, it. And if you agree to all of these horrible \"treatments,\" you're fine! Even if the treatments, make your life, a living, hell. Well, the truth is, you don't have to submit, to them. And no guarantee, your life will be \"fine.\" For my part, two years before my 2cm IDC diagnosis, I got this external Leiomyosarcoma butt cancer. Which is like the most deadly cancer, of all. 1% or less, of people, get this cancer. And it's totally, deadly. But mine was external, and they cut it out, and I'm fine. No Doc, even at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, offered me any \"radiation\" for my Leiomyosarcoma Butt Cancer. No $$$ to be made, there. I do still have CT scans, for that, and all clear. Unlike this incredible market in useless, whole breast radiation. This is a Big Business! I just find it, sad, how people have their breasts, cut off, and take drugs that make them sick,and accept radiation that gives them lung cancer, for nothing. Nobody gets out of here, alive. For my part, I love my breasts. And so does, my lover. And I'm going to enjoy them as long as I can.",
