I was diagnosed with BC 5 years after, not related at all. I had stage 1, grade 3 tumour with 5/25 nodes affected. I had Doxetaxol, carboplatin and Herceptin. I didn't really have any change in my feet, my finger tips got a bit weird for about a week after each treatment. I guess you will need to talk over this concern with your onc, as everyone is different. Good luck with your treatment",
