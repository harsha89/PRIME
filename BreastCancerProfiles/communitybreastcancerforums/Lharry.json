I spoke to breast advocate and she said that the doctor likely won't do anything with it, because it isn't showing any signs of infection or anything. How long did yours last? It has been a week since my surgery. I literally hear the sloshing when I stand up from sitting! Do you think me going for nightly casual walks in the neighborhood have anything to do with it? It is awefully humid outside, and I do sweat when I'm walking. I just am hoping for anything that could relieve this full, pressure, feeling like I'm carrying around a large water balloon feeling. I'm not digging this whole breast cancer thing right now! (who ever does, right?)",

It has been a 9 days for me, and it hasn't gone down at all yet. I'm learning to just deal with it. But, every bump in the road hurts still!",

Is this correct? I don't have constant pain, but occasional pains. But just a few minutes ago, I had a SHARP pain that literally felt like a hot knife had stabbed me! And I can honestly say that I can withstand pain fairly easy, but this had me in tears. It only lasted a quick minute, and was gone completely. Needless to say, it scared me! Anyone else experience this? Is it likely to continue? Is there anything I should do",
