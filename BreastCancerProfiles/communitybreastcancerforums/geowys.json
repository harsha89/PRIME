Definately has lifted my spirits and something to look forward to besides more treatments, CT's, PET's etc. Dr is giving a 1 week break before trip to allow hands/feet to improve.  Figured the tiredness bouts will be accomodated by being on a train -- taking a small pillow.  Will smile a lot between naps.",

It had followed being on an antibiotic for a UTI.  Then maybe it's related to the coumadin/warfarin I've been taking for months to ward off blood clots (very bumpy veins on leg tho passed a sonogram okay).  So not a very nice subject but has anyone delt with spotting?
