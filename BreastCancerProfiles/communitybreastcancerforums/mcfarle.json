    "Content": "mcfarle wrote: At the end of February I was diagnosised with DCIS I got two opinions, both recommended lumpectomy followed with radiation. We had a beach trip planned for the end of May both surgeons said I could wait until after vacation so lumpectomy was scheduled for May 26th. Genetic testing was recommended due to all the cancer on my dads side - dad died of lung and also had throat, his sister died of breast and colon cancer, him mom died of lung and his dad died of pancreatic cancer. I thought that the genetic testing wouldn't show anything. Wrong again I have Chek 2. Back to both doctors, one doctor says double mastectomy other dr says its is my choice lumpectomy radiation with follow up every 6 months (MRI and then mammogram) or double mastectomy. I have been to two plastic surgeons. I don't even know if I want to do reconstructive. I don't know what to do. Any suggestions advice thoughts questions to ask would be appreciated.
