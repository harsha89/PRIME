If I am right I \"think\" Tamoxifen is a hormone blocker and does not actually contain hormones?? Maybe someone with more knowledge will come along and answer soon.",

After spending days reading here I am starting to feel almost alone and it's driving me crazy. When I first went to my Dr. with breast pain she assures me \"You're lucky it hurts, breast cancer usually never hurts\" and sends me for a mammorgram that ends up with me being sent into another exam room by the radiologist for 2 ultra sounds...They tell me there is a density but that's all they say..I'm go to the surgeon who says maybe Lobular Carcinoma and sends me for an MRI this Thursday with the contrast dye..Why would he say that? I know he said I have a thickening in that area I am having pain etc..he says the MRI will let us know more. My breast is a little swollen today and feels heavier and the pain is still there as well as armpit pain but so I know it's got to be something but everyone says \"It can't be cancer, cancer never hurts and with you being 34 and not having a family history yadda yadda\"..well OMG I don't want to be brushed off  because of that..I read that MRI's aren't always right so what if it looks ok on the MRI but I actually have breast cancer? I'm concerned they aren't taking me seriously, I know this is all probably because of my nerves but I'm in pain and have something odd showing up on my mammogram and ultra sound and the only words mentioned are maybe Lobular Carcinoma...no one mentions cysts etc.. I've looked all over the internet for info on breast and armpit pain trying to see what they can do to get rid of this discomfort but I don't have pain that goes away with my menstral cycle, it's always there and it just suddenly showed up one day in one breast, no injury etc..yet it can't be cancer so what is wrong with me? It's about to drive me crazy.  Sorry to go on and on but I'm at a loss right now. Log in to post a reply",

Also how is it that everyone here knows what their mammogram and ultra sound results say?I was never given the results, just a letter that said my mammogram was abnormal and my Dr. called me next day and made surgeon appointment? I knew the ultra sounds were abnormal because she did them twice and the 2nd one she must have high lighted and clicked forever and they told me there was density but I never got actually sizes or numbers or a copy of anything?  I do have my mammogram films here to take with me Thursday but that's no help because I have no idea how to even interpret those.",

BUT I'm pretty sure he's just a surgeon because I noticed they hanled several different operations there, gastric bypass etc,, I could ask when I go back to the Women Center for the MRI, they are just for womens breast issues etc..I will ask them what they think of him as a  breast surgeon.  I don't want to sound like I \"want\" breast cancer, I don't but I don't want it to not be found..I'm afraid I sound like I \"want\" them to find cancer, I really just want them to tell me what is wrong..",

Could something have changed that fast? sheesh I thought when he said he wanted me back in 6 months that I would be having another mammogram and ultra sound. I know it sounds silly but I hated the last MRI so much..I am really not looking forward to this again because this time I know what is going to happen..:( Anyway I wanted to update you guys and let you know I'm in for my 6 month. And see if anyone knows why the MRI so soon?? Thanks for being here you guys!! Tonyia Log in to post a reply",
