      "Content": "buffyjc wrote: Hi ladies! I hope you're all having a great week. :) According to the radiologist, my DCIS is \"extensive\" so when I met with my BS, we discussed the possibility of needing a mastectomy and she sent me for an MRI which I had Tuesday so she could get another look (I guess, to be in addition to the mammo images). I'm meeting with my BS again this afternoon (pre-op). So, I've got so many questions going on in my head, I need to make sure I'm understanding everything. Here goes... 1) If she advises that a mastectomy is my best option, I would prefer to have bilateral with immediate reconstruction. If surgical biopsy trumps all and something invasive is found, by this point, I would already have TEs in place. Doesn't radiation and chemo usually happen BEFORE reconstructive surgery? 2) The hospital I was sent to for my biopsy did NOT test for ER/PR receptors. I've questioned this and have been told that if someone orders it, they'll do it. Isn't this important to know NOW before we choose what type of surgery I need? 4) I'm terrified of general anesthesia having never had it. If I end up getting a DMX (is that the correct abbreviation?), how long will I be under? 5) FWIW, I'm 41 and my mom was diagnosed when she was 59 (10 years clear!!!). I've tested negative for all the gene mutations. Any insight anyone could provide, I would truly appreciate it. Thank you!

I had a fair amount of anxiety about the procedure and I'm SO relieved it's over! My experience today was uncomfortable but that was only due to the positioning and maneuvering of my breast (they're relatively small). The radiologist was extremely fast with the actual biopsy and he told me he took 7 samples! I'm now in a bit of discomfort but the ice pack does seem to offer some relief. In two days, I have a follow up appointment for my results. Please know that I'm thinking of you, as well as all the others here in waiting mode, and sending positive thoughts and prayers for good results! ",

Had my screening mammo 1/24 and had to have a diagnostic on 2/1. I also have clustered microcalcifications (like you, no lump) that was termed \"suspicious\" and my BIRAD score was a 4. My radiology report sent me to Google for all sorts of things, as well. :) I'm having my stereotactic core biopsy tomorrow, 2/21. The only reason I couldn't have it sooner is because I have to visit a facility that has the equipment where I can be seated vs lying on the table with my breast through the hole. My calcifications are in the upper outer area of my right breast near the chest wall. I suppose if I were having the biopsy done in the traditional manner it would be much more difficult to reach the area that needs to be biopsied. So, I got the first available appointment, again, which isn't until tomorrow. It has been such a long wait but I'm so ready to just get it over with! I can understand your \"see-saw\" of emotions. I've felt the same way. During the day, while at work, I'm occupied and while I have three children to come home to each day, it's when I lay down to go to sleep that my thoughts begin to run rampant. I just keep trying to think positive but in a realistic manner. My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2007 when she was 59. However, I don't know the extent. I just know that she had a lumpectomy, some lymph nodes were removed and she went on to have chemotherapy and radiation. Today, she's still cancer free. I have complete faith that if *anything* is truly \"wrong\" with me, I can overcome it. I know it's easier said than done but try to stay positive and not let bad thoughts get the best of you. I do hope you get good results! Please keep us posted on your outcome! ((HUGS))",

I've noticed a, what seems to be new, vein in my healthy breast since my reconstruction in September but thought nothing of it until last night. Someone from another BC support site posted an article about warning signs of BC that sometimes go unnoticed. One of those warning signs mentioned was visible, dilated veins in the breast. Apparently, those veins can sometimes be an indicator of BC as a tumor needs an increased blood supply. Can anyone speak from experience about the validity this? I'm completely freaking out right now! I've called my regular doctor who said they can examine me today or tomorrow. I've also left a message with my breast surgeon's nurse (although, I'll admit she's not always prompt about returning phone calls). Should I just go to my regular doctor and ask if they'll send me for a mammo or ultrasound? TIA for any input!!!

I'm meeting with the plastic surgeon Tuesday to get his recommendation for reconstruction and what he can do for the healthy breast. I guess I need to visit the reconstruction forum to ask questions there regarding unilateral mastectomies and immediate reconstruction. I should have a date for surgery by the end of the week.

She's sending me for an MRI which could happen as early as next week (hoping since I just want to get it over with). She did question the location of my biopsy site and hematoma in relation to the initial radiology report indicating the biopsy to be done in a different area, though. The radiologist who read my diagnostic mammogram ordered the biopsy to be done on the \"upper outer quadrant\" of my right breast but the bruise is about midway with the hematoma sitting just under my breast and right above my bra. So, she said she would inquire abou that and is also part of the reason for the MRI. She is thinking I may still be a candidate for lumpectomy but depending on the results from both the genetic test and the MRI, I may need to consider a mastectomy. I'm nervous about surgery and general anesthesia so to hear I may need a mastectomy has me a bit on edge. I've never had any surgeries except 2 c-sections and I didn't need general anesthesia for either. I know this should be the very least of my concerns but I'm one of those people who get true anxiety over situations I know nothing about. I'll definitely be praying for strength for all of us.
