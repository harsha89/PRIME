      "Content": "Jun 14, 2008 05:56PM - edited Jun 14, 2008 06:00PM by myheidiscrapbooking Hi Cupcake, I too am very sorry to hear that you are going thru this. I can't add a whole lot but did want to tell you \"congrat's\" on losing the weight! Your right, that will be an added bonus to recovery with BC.  There is a link on this website that shows you how to read your pathology report and what all the abbrevations mean so make sure you look that up. You will feel much better when you speak to your Dr. (make sure you are comfortable with him/her ok!) you should feel comfortable to ask as many questions. I agree, write them down and make sure someone is with you. My husband was a godsend as I was in shock (still) at the dr.s and afterwards I didn't remember 1/2 the stuff.  I was diag. this 2/14 and I also had in lympnodes (2) and went thru chemo.  You will get thru it. They have so many drugs now to combat your side-effects. Some people breeze right thru it.  I was also so surprised at how fast everything went at the beginning! wow! I was shocked! But it is the normal procedure - really!! Wet to dr. - Immediately had surgery, then 3-4 weeks recovery - immediately started chemo- everything moved so fast -some people start chemo first, depends on your diagnosis. But yes, its fast, as I guess its just the next step. My head was spinning. I also kept a folder too for all my notes and appt.s- that really helped. Also, look around this site - this was a god-send to me. This was my online support group that I can talk to about anything in my pajamas :) You will be ok. Really. There are so many drugs and advances today and more every day! We are so lucky in that aspect. I wish you good luck and prayers for you. Keep us posted. Big hugs. Best, Heidi",

      "Content": "Jul 25, 2008 03:42PM - edited Jul 25, 2008 03:57PM by myheidiscrapbooking Hi Rsea22, and all others :)   Yes, you are right. My hospitals BOTH told me that \"multi-focal\" is \"starndard mastectomy\" across the board, but, they think they put that out there when they are dealing with \"masses\" and ofcourse that has the \"safest\" results.  However,both hospitals told ME that each \"multi-focal\" is different and it really does depend on the type of cancer, location ect. and is NOT across the board - but, instead told me that they believe in looking closer at each person's \"multi-focal.\"  I got two separate opinions-and both told me that cancer can show up any where in your body, ofcourse -  I KNOW that can happen especially since its in my lympnodes (two to be exact) and multi-focal (3 tumors) (maybe 4?) however.. .and big however. ...I also know that both multi-conferences at two diff. hospitals in Mass. told me that IF it does \"re-occur\" in my breast, that I have to have a mastectomy after this most definately. I am totally choosing to take a chance on it NOT re-occurring and trying to keep my breasts. I know its more popular to just take them off and not worry., believe me.  I KNOW this is a very difficult decision and its really up to each person personally - we all know what we can handle!!!  I know that my percentages of keeping my  breast (having three tumors close together in same quadrant) and-I was told by both really good hospitals- (multi-focal and not multi-centric ofcourse) gives me a 8-10% of re-occurance in my same breast OR, if I have it the breast off (one breast w/cancer) 2-3% of re-occurannce in the future.  I know its not a decision for the light-hearted. Its very scary to me - believe me. However, after much agonizing, I'm going to take the chance and keep my breasts and pray it doesn't come back. If it does, I was told that I would have to have no chemo, would have to have radiation again and have my breast taken off. Again, both said it was rare to occur (IDC) in both breasts if was only in one. Lobular I was told was much more likely to occur in the other breast not IDC) . Again, for me, I am going to take the chance. I know most of you must think Im crazy. The reason I get thru this is because it won't \"up\" my chances of getting it in my other areas, or organs, AND  affect my overall survival rate. These percentages only refer to my breasts. Keeping my breasts won't make the cancer more likely to go to my organs I am told.  Again, I know this is not an easy decision. I aggonize, believe me!!!. I dont know if I'm making the right decison and will regret it eventually. Like everyone, Im taking a chance that I will be pissed off if it does in fact come back in a year and I have to get a mastectomy AND rad. again. I just finished chemo and that was a big question for me as well. THey told me most likely I would not repeat chemo if it re-occured. This is such a personal decision for everyone. I will say I have been married for 17 years however I do not have children. I think that would be a bigger decision - as well as your life circumstances with other family members, spouses, ect.  I just wanted to relay my experience and decision - I just really want to keep them and see what happens. I am obviously hoping for the best and my two opinons have been very upfront with me and agree. They can only give stats. I understand and this is what I chose. As for everyone else, it truly is what you can take, given your own situation.   I have a tendency to ramble and repeat. SORRY!!!! Heidi",

You may want to look around to all the subjects posted here OR post your own title with exactly what you would like help with. Being in this column about mastectomy, your questions might get lost. Look around - there is SO much good info. I loved this board (and still do!) during this.

      "Content": "Jul 24, 2008 06:44PM - edited Jul 24, 2008 06:54PM by myheidiscrapbooking Hi Rsea22, I too was diagnosed with IDC when I was 47 as well (am 48 now - just finished chemo) turned 48 during this.(also no family history, fit, healthy, not much more than a freakin cold and this came out of no-where!  I too had multiple tumors. (feb.14/08) Three tumors as of now, to be exact and in my right breast. My doctor told me that IDC \"usually\" is rare to happen in your other breast which I must admit, I was relieved to hear that (via well-known Beth Isreal In Boston) . I wanted to tell you that as it made me feel relieved. Also, like you, I am big breasted and I laughed at your reference to loving your breasts! I feel the same way. The only two things that I felt were above average my whole life was \"great hair\" and great boobs!!! and,  Now I lose both!!!??? Anyway, I did have cancer in two lympnodes and now they think (after chemo) I may still have a tumor that they thought was scar tissue after all. I am STILL presently fighting a mastectomy and they are surprisingly positive about keeping them even though I am multi-focal. I guess the area where the tumors are really make a difference. In my case, they are all near each other. 1.5cm, 4mm, 12mm and a \"big maybe\" on a 5mm. I want SO much to keep my breasts :) I am devastated over the thought of losing them. They did tell me that my reocurrace rate of getting cancer again in my breasts would be higher (8-10%) rather than 2-3% BUT that it would not affect my overall survival rate. This is what I am now focusing on. I realize that if it does reoccur in my breast later on, that I WILL have to have it removed - no question. I hope that I dont sound like these are  my whole identity- they arenot - its just that its tramatic for me. I can't even think about it.  Everyone deals differently.   I will, if I have to have them removed, remove them or one,  but I am awaiting a new biopsy (next week) on the \"spot\" they're not sure about -and that will decide if it goes. I, like you, find it will be so hard if it does have to go- as \"matching it up to the other\" is gonna be tough!  If I was small breasted, it would be easier.   What a hassle it will be if I only have one \"big' boob huh?. Ofcourse I think I still would want \"one\" rather than none - but, thats only my opinon.   I realize it will be easeir to have both off and match, but I feel that it would put me over the edge emotionally.  I am writing because I totally relate to what you wrote and how you feel. Anyway, good luck with your decision and keep us updated if you feel like it. ok?? Im definately there with you! ahhh. Best, Heidi",

I feel badly for my husband. One day I feel like Im fine and then the next BOOM.  I've been told it is normal however I feel very badly for my husband and over time, Im sure that has to get old! Its so hard. I think its normal to feel also angry and bicker. I mean, come on! we're married ha :) Actually I have to say, I find it harder for people who love me. I feel like I can deal with it but I know they are hurting and feeling sooo out of control. Yes, I do too but I think they worry more than me :(  Men tend to be \"fixers\" too and when they can't \"fix\" you during this, it's really hard for them and it breaks my heart. You sound like a great husband and I am too blessed to have a great one! Chemo was rough for me (only because I was anemic) didnt know it until I got on chemo - felt like LEAD but most seem to do well on chemo and being anemic isn't too common so I hope your wife does well. I found the fatigue the worst but other than that, everything was ok. I hope you dont mind cleaning ha :) my husband hates cleaing but is good about everything else so I just had to \"drop it\" and just let it not matter. She will get thru it. Im sooo glad she got clean margins! wow, that is great! Hey, one milestone!  I find out my results tomrrow from my biopsy. we'll see!!! In a way, Im just glad to know the next step.

Now, that I have a diagnosis, I feel much more in control. I'm sure when you get all the facts, you will feel so much better but what your feeling, I can't tell you, is soooo normal. I was all over the place. I am going thru Chemo now (day 10) and have had NO side-effects. I know many people do not. You see Robin Roberts on tv with chemo - some people are lucky but they do have soooo many drugs now to combat side-effects. If it wasn't for the type of job I have (flight attendant = flying petri dish, and being very physical) I would be working thru it.  My dr told me that if you normally have side-effects with prescription drugs then you may have a harder time. I was one that was blessed to have an iron stomach. I never had any. The hair thing if you have chemo (maybe not!) will fall out but can you believe scarves are hot this year ha! My sister gave me the current issue of vogue and said that I always time things perfectly :)  Keep us posted and let us know how you are doing. I'll say a prayer tonight for you deidre. Best, Heidi",

I also had a 1.3cm tumor in right breast - and while they did the lumpectomy, found another small 3mm tumor in front. They then told me that because it was now called \"multi-focal\" I would have to do chemo. I also had two lympnodes found with cancer. However, if no lymphnodes were found and just those two lumps, I would still have chemo. I will tell you, it was a scary ride (where you are now) I am now on chemo (day 7) and honest to god, have not had one side-effect. Matter of fact, my oncology appt. was today and I asked if she thought it was actually working :) She said that chemo today is SO much different. I was literally in a state - of fear about chemo and really nothing else. My husband was too. However supportive, I knew that the chemo would scare both of us. We are dancing on clouds as we cannot believe how easy it has been. Your wife will have lots of drugs for side-effects.  I am actually off the drugs now (as of day 5) because of no side effects. Things are a lot better today than prior. I had to write because your situation seemed similar to mine. Im 47 and I also was just told that even though it is \"multi-focal\" - (same cancer but in more than one place) that I didnt even have to remove my breast - I thought for sure, when they found more after the fact, that was it for my breast. It wasn't. I had two opinions - Beverly Hospital in Mass. and also famous Beth Isreal in Boston whom was the one that really thought I could save it. It would not lower my overall survival rate. If it isn't in her lympnodes, she could be 100% curable. If it is, my rate was 80% in remission. I've talked to many women now and all had no reoccurance. Sounds like she got it very early and that is an \"excellent\" thing. You both will be alright. Just take your time with all the info. coming your way - a lot is scary and most wont happen to her so try to take it with a grain of salt, if possible. I will say a prayer for your wife and you.  Keep in touch, and god bless you both. Best, Heidi",

They cut around all of both and got \"clean margins\" (which means they basically cut around as far as they an get cancer-free tissue. I would not be afraid of chemo as her life is the most important and you would not want to take that risk if they thought she should go aggressive. Granted, again, mine was in lympnodes -but even if it wasn't, they have such a great result on chemo that they wanted me to do it anyway.

Now that you know about the malignency(?), read up on it and it will bring you comfort. Knowledge is power. I felt much more \"in control\" once I knew what was going on. Make sure you go to a good dr./hospital as well.  There are now a lot of hospitals that have \"breast centers\" - those are usually GREAT because they have a team and a very organized program - step by step for you. This doesn't have to be a prestigious hospital - just a good one.   If you don't feel \"comfortable\" with your dr., go elsewhere.  I also went on anti-anxiety meds. (not like a xanex or valium) I went on Zoloft and I will tell you, it saved my life. I don't feel as weepy, up & down and it just helped control my anxiety so much. I had no side-effects and the only feeling I had on it was that I felt \"better\" - there are many diff. kinds. Be good to yourself and don't beat yourself up for \"being positive\" all the time. I posted a prior post on \"be positive shutt up!\" - read that - its from a good doctor and she says it has no affect on your course of cancer. She is from this site. Yes, its good to feel good but a huge burden when you don't. So be yourself. I wish the best to you and post and keep in touch. You have everyone here ok? Heidi",

If they put you on A/C (Adriamycn and Cytoxan) which is a normal routine chemo for Breast Cancer - they put you on that first (8 weeks) then they put you most likely on a diff. chemo after- Taxol/herceptin. This is a common common routine (I just finished both) last Thrus. Now start Radiation which most likely you will too.  I think that College might be hard on the AC treatment,  but the other is definately do-able!!! Most people have a lot of fatigue on AC and that may make it tough for you. I had a tough time fatigue wise but no other side-effect.  I know how scared you must be. I was diagnosed with one lump and when they got into surgery, they found 3 more so I know how you feel. Mine was in two of my lymphnodes as well. Have they mentioned anything about your lympnodes yet?  You have a right ot be scared. It is very very scary. My hardest time was at the time you are right now. I was soooooooooo overwhelmed and cryed all the time. It was awful. As you get to know your condition, diagnosis, ect, you start to feel better - more in control and you will feel better. There are SO many drugs now to combat Breast Cancer.  I also went on Zoloft for anxiety and that helped me a ton personally. Also, read all the subjects and mssg.s on this board and write anytime!!! Everyone here is going thru what you are or have already. There is so much great information. I found this board to be the support group I needed. It helped so much I can't tell you. Please keep us updated ok? and write again with any questions or updates. God bless you. You will be ok :)  Really! Big hugs, Heidi",

Then, when I blow dryed my hair w/a round brush, my brush had much more hair than usual. Literally the next day (day 13) I could pull clumps out with no pressure. By day 14, I put it in a loose ponytail and went to the salon w/my husband (last appt) 8pm on thrusdays luckily and got my head shaved. I felt it was the best for me as it sort of grossed me out that my long blonde hair was falling out in my hands. Also noticed the same in my private part.
