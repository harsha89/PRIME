When I went they not only saw that the dr found an area of thickening on the other breast. They did a biopsy and it came back as tumor cells but not cancerous. After having the baby I noticed a change. When my breasts fill my nipple sucks in on one side. My dr sent me for another ultra sound and they did not see anything. Should I continue to push for tests or just let it be. I don't have a huge family history (my dads mother died from an aggressive form of breast cancer) but other than that nothing. The biopsy was negative but can that turn into cancer? I am only 29 so I shouldn't even be worried right? Please help if you have any information thank you so much! Log in to post a reply",
