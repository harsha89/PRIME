    "Content": "puncturedbicycle wrote: Hi folks. Is there a thread here specifically for CMF tips and hints, starter kit, SEs etc? My mom gets her first CMF (all IV) treatment this Tues, which is likely to have less severe SEs than other chemo cocktails, so not sure if a lot of the usual chemo kit will apply, but I want to be prepared for the SEs she is likely to get. I'd be grateful for any recommendations for a specific shopping list/starter kit for CMF. Feel free to send a link if there is one and I missed it. She will also be getting IV decadron, pepcid and kytril pre-meds as well as fluids. I'm especially keen to head off any constipation problems straight away because I know that will drive her nuts. Not sure if that should be a stool softener, laxative or fiber supplement - ? We don't want to overshoot the goal and go too far in the other direction either. :-) So I thought some kind of fiber thing you can take every day to keep things as they should be without being overstimulating - ? Preferably nothing gluey or chalky or otherwise unpleasant to take. Recommendations gratefully accepted. Are mouth ulcers likely to be a problem? Should we have something at hand for that? Or am I overthinking it and they will tell us what to do on Day 1? I have about a hundred fat leaflets about the ins and outs of all the drugs she'll be on but tbh I had a migraine yesterday, my mom is moving house on the 15th etc and I would be ever so grateful for a bite-sized chunk of easy shopping list info. I think I can speak for my mom too when I say that we were fine for surgeries and rads but we are both SCARED of the chemo experience. Even though as they keep telling us this is 'chemo-lite'. Thanks all. So grateful for this forum. Log in to post a reply",
