Barbcard: I have been very emotional and I get depressed and anxious very easily since I started all my treatments and surgeries. I just hope I go back to normal when this is over!  I am glad I found you ladies! I am going in this friday for a similation and starting my 6 weeks of rads on the 10th. I am a little nervous, so thank you all for sharing your experiences, it really does help. As far as skin care, I was given two creams to choose between (don't recall the name off the top of my head).. My doctors nurse wants the patients to keep a daily record of how it goes for them because they are trying to determine what is better and make it the standard for patients to come.  Mari ",

I am interested in trying the Miaderm...can anyone give me any input on this? Has anyone tried any of these creams and what were your experience with it??  I start treatment on monday and have not made a decision yet!! Barbara ~  Yes mariposa is butterly. I just love them and they remind me of my dad. I was raised in Queens but I haven't lived in NY in quite some time. My husband is military and he is out of the country so I am staying with My brother in the bronx while I do my treatment out in long island.  Rachel: We are starting rads on the same day. I was given a schedule for 25 sessions.. I think that includes 5 boosts.. Mari ",

I drove 30 minutes in the snow yesterday to find out my simulation had been canceled! =( Apparently my doctor was not happy with the way the machines were set up, so they have to redo that and get her approval before they will do the simulation. I wont be able to start monday and have to wait for them to call me to go back in.  Toomuch & Grannydukes~ I was told they are doing a clinical trial, so if I choose to use one of their creams  (which I was considering the Calendula) I wont be able to use anything else.. I think I\u2019m going to try the Miaderm and see how that goes. Debbie~ I use the Tom\u2019s deodorant with the lemongrass scent and I find it works well for me. Susantm & Cincilady ~I went ahead and ordered the Miaderm last night. I plan on using it with Aloe. I haven\u2019t found a good Aloe gel yet so I might be using the natural plant. I don\u2019t mind except for the smell is not that pleasant!! Lol I hope I get lucky as well and don\u2019t burn too much.",

One,  I have a really bad sore throat (they said its radiation splatter), which I told the nurse about yesterday and all she said was to use cough drops, and that if it got worse THEN they would prescribe something.. Well, it has gotten worse, but radiation is closed until tuesday. Is there any type of mouth rinse or something I can use that I don't need a script for?? Also, there is a part of skin under my arm that is REALLY  REALLY painful. It looks like it might be starting to peel, but it's painful to raise my arm and to have it my side. I have been taking motrin, but it's only helping slightly. Mari ",

I started my radiation two weeks later than I was supposed to, so friday was the end of my second week (number 9) and I am already red under my arm and down the side. Also, I've been having headaches everyday after treatment. Has anyone else experienced this? The nurse said it is not from radiation because they are not radiating my head, but I'm perfectly fine on the weekends. Michcon~ I am at 2 weeks and I have had a couple of episodes of nausea as well, one wich was really bad. I wasn't sure if that was normal either. Mari ",

I also have itching and was told to try tylenol pm because it has some benadryl in it, but for the day time all the nurse said was \"dont scratch it\"...??? I'm worried about the condition of my skin since I still have about 11 rads to go, but all the nurse keeps saying is that everything looks very \"normal\" for the stage of treatment I'm at. ",
