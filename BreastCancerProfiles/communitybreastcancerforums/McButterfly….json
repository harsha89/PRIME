Just my curious nature. I got to see the physio-MD at a local hospital yesterday but she couldn't treat me because I'm not part of the public health program here. But not quite back to square one. She answered many questions and referred me to a private clinic which I'm looking into. She suggested 1. I wear the comp. sleeve every day, during the day and remove at night; 2. the reason to avoid scratches, mosquito bites, etc. is that our immune systems are compromised (less lymph carrying stuff out) and to get a mild and simple antiobiotic if ever I get a fever or my arm turns red and hot; 3. mine has been caught early so it's possible my arm could go back to normal, but I will always have to wear sleeve; 4. no problem doing lymph drainage massage with a reoccurance or active cancer (I'm taking hormone therapy); 5. when arm goes down, have arm measured for smaller sleeve; 6. don't go into the sun during the middle of the day without covering the arm. She specializes in this and they have a full program at this hospital, including wrapping, massage, and physio, including swimming. I wish we had something like this at the cancer clinic in Victoria, but it's all private with prices to match, I think. Perhaps an Rx will help getting it covered by our medical system. Yes, Hugz, I assumed the salt was an issue. And packing my own food is a good plan. Thank you. And thanks, Momine, I totally hear you and agree on all counts. A clean, sugar-free, no white flour (even better, no flour), whole grain, fruit and veggie diet is the way to go. I also make a green juice first thing in the morning \u2014 that's medicine for me. Re: the private therapists that won't treat me: I am now in possession of an Rx from my oncologist for LDM as well as another one from my Naturopath, who is specializes and is a professor of Oncology, so that should get some results. Also, osteopath will see me again, now that I have these. I'm still working on the dr's note to allow me to change my flight. Since I have no place to stay if I go home early, I've found a room in a small town here with trains to all points. Once I start getting treatment, I'll be able to do some of the sight-seeing I haven't been able to do since I'm so off the beaten track now, and will be in even better shape for flying. The compression sleeve still is not ready. Evidently it's coming from Germany. That's it for now. Thank you all for your incredible support. It has probably taken 100 pounds or more off my shoulders and lightened my heart. xo",

I've noticed my body is much less achy and I don't feel so restricted through the back. The jury is out on this and the FDA and some medical sites have made some negative claims, but mostly what I've heard from people I trust, is positive. It's been recommended for cancer, inflammation and also, specifically for lymphedema.",

      "Content": "Jan 5, 2018 03:09PM - edited Jan 5, 2018 03:11PM by McButterfly Hi, I'm new here. My right arm lymphedema just became noticeable on December 3, 2017 while working here in Italy. I've had a hell of a time getting information as I don't speak Italian, but I won't go into all of that now. I must tell you, though, that I cried when I found this forum. OMG! I'm not alone and my arm may not explode. I was told about a homeopathic by my naturopath back in Canada called Lymphomyosot made in Germany by Heel. I did find it here on amazon.it and have taken it for a few days but without any results I can track. I'll add, too that my mastectomy was 23 years ago and I've not had lymphedema in all the time until now. But I was diagnosed with a reoccurrence in June, 2015. I believe the culprit to be the Letrozole that I started taking about 8 months ago and then the long air flight here. Sorry if I'm getting off track. Posting to see what you know about the Lymphomyosot. Thank you, dear ones. So happy to find you! Angela",

      "Content": "Jan 7, 2018 12:07PM - edited Jan 7, 2018 12:12PM by McButterfly Thank you for your response, Binney. The scariest part, that I didn't mention and maybe I'll start a thread for, is that I did find a LDM here in a nearby town, but when she found out I have \"active cancer\" \u2014 as in a reoccurence, she wouldn't treat me. Same with the osteopath I had been seeing, who spoke to the LDM and was told she shouldn't treat me, either. I wasn't able to speak to her myself, but the fear was that they would spread the cancer through the lymph, or even through a cranial sacral treatment. (If that's the case, it's too late now as I've been doing a self-massage for about 2-3 weeks now.) I've been searching for treatment in order to 1. learn how to wrap myself; 2. get the swelling down; and 3. learn more and discuss the possibility of flying home; oh, and 4. get treatment before it advances and destroys tissue, etc. So the order of my BC has been: 1995, DX and MX and removal of 13 LN; 2015, reoccurrence \u2014 only cleansing diet, no surgery or radiation but the tumors continued to grow, so 2017, began Letrozole; late 2017 (December 3) lymphedema. Am feeling a bit frantic as I've been searching and looking and going down rabbit holes with nothing turning up so far except I was directed to a shop where they measured me for a guantlet and sleeve that is very pricey but is supposed to be ready by January 10. I do hope I'm not overwhelming you with my frustration and fear. I am okay and get a little stronger each day, as it really has been a test of my ability to accept the situation and carry on with my search. And thank you for these links \u2014 they are just what I need to know. Gentle hugs back, Angela",

Possibly the fact that I'm from another country and she just doesn't want to deal with that added complication. I'm not sure what my own oncologist back in Canada would say as I haven't been able to reach him but I will keep trying. The one MD I've seen here regarding this knew nothing about MLD and I read that the lymph system is not a big part of what is studied to become a doctor.  I have an appointment at a hospital here in Italy with a physiotherapist on Wednesday. I have no clue what will happen there, but will keep you posted. Thank you for what you've shared with me so far. Much appreciated (and anxiety-reducing!) yes, chocolate hugs, :) Angela",
