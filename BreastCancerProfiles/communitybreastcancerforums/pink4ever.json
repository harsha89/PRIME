I continue taking the Herceptin and Zometa every 3 weeks, and Femera daily.  The side effects of the Zometa disappeared after the first few treatments but my nurse gave me great advise.  Push the water intake 24 hours before and after the treatment and if necessary request they give the dose over a longer period of time (30 minutes vs 15).  The benefits FAR exceed any SE.  My dentist keeps a close tab on any SE but assures me they are extremely rare.  Just have to have any major dental work (extractions or root canal) done prior to starting.  It is important to continue regular cleaning - in fact I go every 3 months now. Best of luck! ",
