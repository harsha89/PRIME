I have a copy of my original bc mastectomy, it says, \"residual tumor mass, reveal an infilterating ductal carcinoma.  The tumor is characterized by infiltrating tubules and small nests and cords of tumor cells........   Maybe you have resources that you can investigate this more.  My knowledge of where to look is pretty limited to this site and Mayo, and google.  I may have just missed something too.  Thanks again.  Mable",

I, too,  feel like I am going down hill.  It has been a long time since I posted anything.  These past 2 years have been a real roller coaster for me.  I have 3-4 months when I feel really good, so I try to get alot done.  But my cancer drugs go bad one me.  First I was on Femara, it lasted 7 months and I felt like I was run over by a truck, it was lots of pain.  My Onc took me off the Femara and gave me Faslodex shots.  In the mean time I was suffering with terrible back pain.  The cancer was in my bones including my lower back.  I had two herniated discs and had Steroid shots and treatments by chiropractor and physical therapy.  From all the drugs, I developed what is called Lymphocitic colitis,  It took 6 months to figure that out.  Terrible diahrea, I lost 12 pounds.  Anyway by the end of May I was feeling well, but my markers had started climbing.  In June I had a PET/CT scan and it didn't show any cancer significant enough to change my meds.  I stayed on Faslodex until November, when, because the numbers made some big jumps.  19 points in Oct.  So another PET/CT scan - but still no additional cancers.  The Onc changed my meds as he doesn't think the Faslodex is working anymore. I am now on Tamoxifen.   It this doesn't work, he said my next treatment would be Chemo.  He is giving me 2 months to see if the Tamoxifen changes my numbers.  In the meantime I have had a urinary infection and my potassium is so low I have to have a prescription for that.  I am on 9 prescriptions now.  It is awful.  I feel like I am falling apart.  One thing after another happens and I have some reactions to the meds.  I am extremely tired all the time and this past week I have been putting up with nausea.  I just don't get much done.  Lie in the recliner alot and doze for hours.   I think of whoever wrote \"I wish I could go back 5 years\"  I felt so alive and with energy, I was so busy with life, exercising, gardening, etc.  Now nothing.  I don't know if I will get my Christmas decorations up because of the nausea. I love Christmas, it is my favorite time of the year.  My daughter did my tree 2 years ago.  Last year it took me all month to get things up and then it was time to put them away.   I know you've heard enough from me, so for now I will sign off.  I want you to know I think of you all often and my prayers are with you.  Lynn, hang in there, I have and still plan to.  Its up hill sometimes and like I said a real roller coaster ride, but we can get through this.  Mable ",

(clowns).  It was so cute.  We had a nice Christmas and I felt pretty good.  I found out that if I eat small amounts and not much sweets I don't have as much nausea.  The day before we left I had a sonogram of my pancreas, spleen, liver and kidney's.  Found out I have a cyst in my pancreas, this could cause some nausea.  I have dr appointments to find out what all needs done, if anything, about that and my next oncology on the 13th.  I still wonder if my markers are way up and that is causing the serious fatigue.  I still can't do much or I wind up in the recliner dozing all day.  If I do little bits at a time and nothing with any lifting or stairs, I can be up for quite awhile.  I wonder, too, about the tamoxifin's side effects.  Years ago when I took it I had side effects and had to go off it.  How long does it take for the tamoxifin to take effect?  I would really l ike to know.  Also, the past couple weeks I have developed weird pains in my palms and soles of feet that feel like a bee sting and then sometimes on other parts of my body it just feels itchy.   My hairline, eyebrows, inside my wrists and here and there. I haven't had allergies before so wonder about the tamoxifin.  Can anyone give me some advice.  I put medicated lotion and use lanocane. They help some.  Mable.",

Just want to report that Friday, Jan.4th, I got the results of the CT scan performed last Monday.  The oncologist was positive that my mets had gone to my liver and/or bowels as I have been having diarrhea since the middle of October and they have tried so many things. They did not find any cancer in my adominal area.  Yea!!!! I was so happy to hear that report.   I have been on rice/bananas/toast and clear liquids for nearly 2 weeks now as it had gotten so bad.  This menu has helped a great deal.  I did have an attack while I was at the Onc.  He became very aware of my condition.  He has ordered a colonoscopy for Tuesday as the next step.  I still think it is the Faslodex.  I have a pamphlet that I got a couple weeks after starting Faslodex.  In the side effects paragraph it lists diarrhea as the 4th thing on the list.  I have ask the onc if it could be the Faslodex and he always says -No!! it is not the medicine.  Has anyone had any experience with Faslodex giving them diarrhea?  I just have to find out what is bothering me, I just can't go on like this.   Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  I won't get my colonospy results until the 14th.  Onc is booked solid until then.  I think I am going to call and ask if he can't tell me on the phone as it is 50 miles to his office.  Hope you all are doing good.  Take care and hang in there (that's what I keep telling myself).  Mable Log in to post a reply",

Lots of drugs to keep me sedated.  Also on the day of my MRI I saw my RA and she took blood tests, etc.  They came back - Lupus normal, RA some abnormalities of which she wasn't sure of.  She confered with my Onc and they determined a small amount of cancer in the pelvis area but the rest was herniated discs.  After the bone scan I saw my Onc and he said I had herniated discs in 3, 4 & 5 Lumbar and some problems in 1 & 2.  HE said I could go to my chripractor, but I am also on muscle relaxant and will see a pain management specialist to see about an uperderial. My pain has gotten so bad I can hardly walk 20 feet and then I am all bent over. I have been ice packing and immobile.  I just can't imagine how it all happened at once?  I can hardly wait to get rid of the pain.  The good news of course is there isn't any cancer in my bones except a small group in the pelvis area!!!! yea!!!. Mable",

Thanks for your concern and comments.  I really appreciate this site and to read of everyone's experiences.  It really helps me.   Mable",

You are all so special in your comments.  They are always encouraging and uplifting.  Now it's my turn to ask for prayers. I ws dx recurrent bc last Dec.  In my bones/bone marow. Took Femara for 7 months and had a reaction.  Then Faslodex since Aug. My markers had gone down every month.  Now I have been having terrible bouts of diahrrea for the past 10 weeks.  My Onc gave me a cholesterol lowering drug, it's side effect is constipation.  It worked, for about 3 weeks.  The past 2 weeks I have really been hit again.  Taking the drug plus Immodium several times a day.  Today I am on a liquid only diet.  Yesterday I saw the Onc and he thinks it is the cancer.  I will have a CT scan Monday, get the results Friday.  He thinks it is in my liver and/or my bowels.  Here I thought I was doing better as my bone scan in October showed the cancer was nearly gone from them.  My markers went up 9 points last month though.  I have decided this journey is going to be very hilly, with lots of ups and downs.  Don't know really what to expect if they find it in my liver or bowels.  Do they do Chemo and/or radiation when that happens.  You that have liver mets - what can you tell me?  I appreciate all your comments and support.  Mable.",
