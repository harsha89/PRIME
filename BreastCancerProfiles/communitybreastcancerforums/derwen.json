    "Content": "derwen wrote: I found a lump under my left arm seven weeks ago. My GP referred me to the breast clinic at my local hospital. They mammogrammed and ultra sounded me and said they had found three lumps in my breast, and biopsied those. I kept asking why they weren\u2019t doing the lump under my arm, and was dismissed. Two weeks later was told the three lumps are DCIS, and that I had to come back next day for nine more biopsies for lumps they saw on the mammogram results. Again they did not biopsy the lump under maybe arm, despite me asking repeatedly. Next result day: all the lumps are DCIS. I asked the consultant what is under my arm. She felt it and told me it is a lymph node and not to worry. I was then referred onto a second local hospital as the first is unable to do reconstruction. Last week I was seen at the new hospital. The surgeon said he could not find any results on the lump my GP reported, and I told him my story. I had an ultrasound which revealed a large lump (2.5cm) under my arm which they confirmed is not a lymph node. The surgeon told the sonographer that a biopsy was not necessary as I have I have a mastectomy anyway. Today, 7.5 weeks on from my initial GP appointment my breast nurse contacted me to say the surgeon has changed his mind and does now want a biopsy on the lump. But I have to wait for an appointment, and then results and the surgeon won\u2019t see me again until those are back. She was unable to give me any reason why he\u2019s changed his mind and what this might mean. I\u2019m absolutely at my wits ends. I have no idea how this was missed by the first hospital and why I was dismissed when I asked about it. Now I have no idea why they are changing their minds and why this is all taking so so long. I\u2019m being told surgery can\u2019t be until into June now and my first diagnosis was April 18th. Very scared and need any advice anyone can give. Log in to post a reply",
