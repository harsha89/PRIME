I just noticed this group (I'm a newbie) I had my uni mx on April 28th, so I am 2 weeks  post op and drain-free, (but not pain free) I'm not on pain relief but making small improvements seems to come and go, I gradually do a bit more and yesterday was ok, today I had more swelling and tiredness...I'm hoping all will be ok for me to return to work in 2 weeks' time. It's really my back as I had a Lat.Dorsi flap reconstruction with a permanent implant, and the implant feels tight and heavy right now!",
