Meeting with surgeon on 2/13 to plan treatment. But I've been reading lots on here, and lurking, and posting a bit. My question is this...cold caps? I see people talk about them, I understand the concept, but cost? Insurance approved? Seems like a great idea, but I'm a special education teacher just scraping by. There's no way I'd be able to take on any more expense...this whole treatment thing is going to break me anyway. Thanks in advance for answering my question.

I've got one round left. Your question on a wound vac? Think of a seal a meal, where it vacuums all the air out and seals everything together. That's what it's doing, except it's attached to my MX incision. I had over 7 cm of undermining where the pectoral muscle was removed, and it didn't attach back to the skin. It wasn't healing, and this was the way wound care thought it would heal best. Negative pressure the whole time. I now have a fabulous looking incision, totally healed. I just had to pack a 5 lb pump for a month on my hip while it worked.",

I'd start sooner, but I have a new fashion accessory that is attached right now. My wound vac and I are good friends for the next little bit, as it tries to convince my skin that it really ought to adhere to the muscle again! Med onco says he won't start without the vac being gone a couple of weeks, so I'd best kick it in gear. I'm going to be proactive and take the shoulder length hair back to my 1 1/2 inch spike this week. It's a lot easier to lose that way. Wishing y'all the best of luck as we roll into April on Wednesday.",
