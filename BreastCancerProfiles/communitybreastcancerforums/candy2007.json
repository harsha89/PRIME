Thanks and my prayers are with you, Candy",

E help?  Does the clonodine seem to be helping?  I am still getting Herceptin.  Do you have to take that? I live in North Carolina, not too far from FL, so I know what you mean.  The summers here can be pretty hot.  When my hot flashes started they were not that bad, but now they are terrible and I have one at least every hour that last for about 15 minutes each.  I kind of miss not having any hair, at least it was cooler then.  But, I do like that my hair is starting to come back.  I have a good two inches now and can style it, somewhat.  Everybody says that it looks good, but I still don't like it.  Probably won't until it gets a lot longer.  I went from really long hair (3 1/2 feet of it) to bald.  BIG Difference.  Thanks for the info. I will check with my dr. about the clonodine. Candy",
