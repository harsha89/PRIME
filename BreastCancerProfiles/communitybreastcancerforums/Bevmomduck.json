Now I'm making notes for DH and daughters cause they want assignments. One daughter will be the social media gate keeper, another the delivered food record keeper, daughter who lives 4 hrs away is assigned to up the sending of funny kid pics and anecdotes. Any other suggestions? Surgery is Feb 16 - this is my 2x around and no messing around - I want these boobs off cause I can't get away from being aware of the lump that came back so quickly.

I'm aware that fat grafting may not last and that just might be the ticket to bringing a smile instead of a sigh when I look in the mirror. I am planning to get temporary tattoos to cover my one nipple-less side and have even looked at the prosthetic ones (see the Nipple Exchange thread) if that side is a lot flatter than the other.

They are dear, trusted friends who will give us practical advice and encouragement. She send me a pic of her doing a beautiful yoga stand on top of a rock while they were hiking last week. She was 2.5 months post reconstruction and felt great and wanted to plant in my heart the seeds of my own upcoming recovery!

And my node arm is swollen and painful so I will try to be proactive tomorrow by stretching and stuff. All I know to do is from google bc I haven't even started PT yet but craving some stretching You're right, activity here has seemed to slow down, but I know we still have each others' backs and ‚ù§Ô∏è and only want good things for each other all the way to the finish üëçüèºüí™üèºüòò AND.

My DSCI has just reoccurred about a year after treatment, so I am looking at a bilateral mastectomy within the next few weeks. A noticeable, touchy lump appeared this time when it was just a teeny 2mm dot the first time discovered by mammogram, and now this one has grown right before my eyes in a short time! Not a good feeling. Just saw surgeon yesterday and am still in shock üò≥. Glad I found this group  ",

I'd really hoped for sooner - both surgeons were really trying, guess hosp was booked up. PS seems confident that I can keep nipples - even the one that was radiated last year!! I'm hopeful for that but will deal with what ever happens. Here we go with The Waiting again ‚è≥üï∞‚è≤ On a very happy note, my 3 lovely grown daughters took me out last night for my birthday and solidarity girl bonding to get ready for the upcoming bad boob to good foobs experience!
