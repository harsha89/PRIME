This is actually my first ever post to any kind of board or community but I have been reading and feel supported already by comments not even directed at me. So here I go: I am a 43 year old who is scheduled for a biopsy May 2. I tried to get in sooner but I am having two areas biopsied so they need a longer block of time. I went in for a routine mammogram early April and was told that i needed to return for a magnified mammogram of an area on my right breast. Had the second mammogram April 17 and met with the radiologist who explained that she saw fine pleomorphic calcifications with a linear distribution about 4.5 cm long. Birads 4c. She said that she recommends biopsy of the area at the forward and end of the distribution. Hence the two biopsies. I understand statistics and it could all be benign but im still worried.",

She did consult oncology during the surgery to see if they concurred with the decision to stop there or if she should continue with more node removal. They confirmed that she should stay with the sentinel lymph nodes and not proceed, saying that i would be getting radiation and probably chemo.",

I\u2019m definitely on the \u201ctalk to your pcp\u201d bandwagon, but o would make a list of everything you want to talk about. I have a biopsy coming up tomorrow and of course I\u2019m worried, as is normal. One thing you mentioned that I would mention to your pcp is the pressure in your neck. I had a similar issue and was diagnosed by an ent with silent reflux which could cause swelling in the neck and the feeling of your neck being lightly squeezed. Of course, when I found out I needed a biopsy, I started worrying that I was dealing with something bigger than what it might be, and that the ent might be wrong, but now that time has gone by, I\u2019ve calmed down and think that the silent reflux is just that. anyway, what I\u2019m saying is that you should write down everything and go with your list to your pcp. I\u2019ll be thinking of you",

I did not have the same condition as you, but had I not gotten a second opinion, the LCIS in my left breast would not have been identified, as three radiologists in the first practice I went through were so focused on my right side that they missed what was going on in my left. Completely missed. Ifyou still have questions, and the first set of physicians refuse to or cannot answer them, then find yourself ones that can and want to.",
