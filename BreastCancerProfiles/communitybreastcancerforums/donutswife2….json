I keep telling my self it is just hair but my inner gut tells me different. I decided that when I first notice the hair starting to go I am going to have one of my daughters shave it off. That way if I blubber like a 2 year old I won't feel so bad! Even though I have know my hairdresser for several years it is just a little different than family. We will get through this and be stronger than before. I like to look at the cancer as a little detour in  my life that will eventually make me a better person. I can still complain that at the present that it sucks alot but it is only temporary. Keep me posted, we can compare notes. I will be thinking of you next Friday and say a liitle prayer for you.",

I didn't get my RN degree until I was almost 40, a late bloomer I guess. We don't give too  many complicated meds in our department so excuse me if I ask stupid questions.Sometimes I think my dr's just assume that I should know what's ahead and all the meds involved. I am  thankful  for this site as I have found so much valuable information. There has been several people diagnosed with BC in our small community hospital within the past 5 years. Makes a person wonder doesn't it. I live in a farming community so my concern is with all the field chemicals that may seep into our drinking water. Maybe we will never know. Susan",
