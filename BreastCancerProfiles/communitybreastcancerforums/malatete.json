      "Content": "malatete wrote: Hi everyone-- I'm hoping you LE experts here can help me. About 3 weeks ago I developed swelling in my shoulder, armpit, arm and hand--and I haven't even had surgery yet! I'm still doing neoadjuvant chemo for stage 3 IDC...my mast and SNB will be sometime in mid-December. Since I haven't had surgery, everyone is scratching their heads, saying it can't be LE since there was no incision/dissection. Meanwhile, I'm swollen from the armpit to fingers--not terribly, but enough that it's noticeable, uncomfortable and measurable (up to a 2cm difference in some areas). Does anyone have any theories about what this might be? (We have ruled out blood clots, by the way.) My onc flat-out says he doesn't know. I insisted that just because he doesn't know, I'm not going to sit around and just hope it goes away. So I had an initial consult with an LE PT yesterday, she mentioned that it could be \"cording.\" It could also be an infection from my port (it's on the same side as the swelling), though I did a 10-day course of Keflex and it didn't seem to change anything. Another theory is that the port is pressing on something it shouldn't, though I had it put in in August and it's been fine until now. Any thoughts, ideas, hunches would be very much appreciated! thanks, Malatete Log in to post a reply",

I planted some bulbs on Sunday and nothing funky happened, so that was a relief. The arm is achy, though, now that the chemo steriods have worn off. I'm keeping my (fat) fingers crossed that things will continue to improve with time and PT. Onc also agreed that lymphoscintigraphy would be a good idea if we don't see a change.",
