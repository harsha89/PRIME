And I too have trouble functioning before 10 am, what's up with that? Anyway, hang in there. Hugs and prayers to all Susan",

I stay on chemos for about 4 months then we have to change cause Waldo starts to move around again...always need to find him. Can't to targeted treatment anymore cause I became hormone refractory . Waldo eats up those treatments like food and spreads even faster. So general chemo for me. This last one I started December 13 th, havelan.....and I am still on it. And with good reports. The only node detectable is one in my jawline on left side, but it is smaller than it was in December.  Best news I have had in 3 years. Maybe this one will,work for a nice long time. Se are very very doable. I have been having a blast since February, and will continue to do so :) , for as long as I can!

So I bought a treadmill, my thinking is it's prob easier to exercise in a controlled climate. Up to a mile and a half. Far cry from my marathons, but I will be happy with 5 miles. I hike with a great group, but I so miss my running and fast biking. Hopefully this summer the bike won't be a problem. Gotta stay motivated even though it's such a struggle to breathe:).
