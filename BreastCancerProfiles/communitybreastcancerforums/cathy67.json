Mine is most likely benign, and I don't have chance to talk to the radiologist, who recommends me for a core biopsy. I googled and learned, and confirmed with breast surgeon, that this kind of biopsy will insert a metal clip into woman's breast for surgery location, if no surgery afterwards, then it will be there forever. Lots of women complainted its side-effects. So I have the choice, to go, then 5% (say) comes out not b9, 95% comes out a whole rest life side effect, not go, 5% is not b9, 95% still has a nice life. I am in Canada, that is a screening mammography, also my first one, a very dense breast, and Asian woman. I rarely see Asian woman in that mammography clinic. I am 44 years old, almost 45. ",

It is good you guys in States can look for second opinion so easily, just bring your film or CD. I had been staying in States for one year, I know the private insurance there. In Canada, everything is covered by government, so I don't need to care about the expensive fee, but everything is controlled by others. It is almost two months after my first mammography, I am still waiting for the biopsy schedule. Unfortunately, I can not be offered three month mammopgraphy followup, only six month, otherwise I just go ahead for this appointment.",

But I don't know my suscious areas, maybe radiologist still needs to start from normal screening mammography. I am in Canada, want to look for second opinion in US. Anyone from Seattle area can recommend some place to do this? Thanks.",
