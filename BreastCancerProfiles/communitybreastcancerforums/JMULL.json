Had my second tx of Taxol today and also spoke with my MO NP.  She said it was definitely a reaction to the Taxol, however it is a side effect that only occurs 1% of the time.  She suggested that I take Zyrtec during the day and Benedryl at night to control the itching.  And use lotions as much as possible. She also said if it continued, they would consider reducing my next dosage.  Hope this helps! Stay strong!!",

I have not yet lost my eyebrows - as far as I can tell.  They are really light anyway so normally no one can see them.  My eyelashes have always been sparse as well and I think they are holding on tight.  I did notice several spots on my face have appeared darker but I just chalked that up to being so close to my super white scalp that they just looked that way. I am supposed to be getting rads 6 weeks x 5 days after chemo.  And I had a full mastectomy.  The MO said it would probably start 4 weeks after chemo so that puts me at the end of Dec/beginning of Jan.  I am going to have another consultation with the RO, however, because he told me when I first saw him back in May that if I had a mastectomy that I wouldn't have to have rads.  Kasi - have you tried scarves or hats?  They might be less work...  I myself feel quite silly in them but I think I am going to sign up for a Feel Better class to make to see what they suggest.  I watched a couple of youtube videos to see how to tie them and they look so cute on the people in the video but I either feel like a pirate or a gypsy.  I have embraced my \"toplessness\" and normally only wear my wigs to work and hats other places.  Although haven't been to too many \"other places\" so...  I think you said you have a 12 year old?  My daughter just turned 12 on the 26th and my littlest will be turning 3 on Monday. I am in a bit of a dilemma...I have a coupon for a half day at the spa that I received for Christmas. Supposed to be a manicure, pedicure, facial and massage. I am torn with what to do since we are not supposed to have manis or pedis and I am assuming a facial would be right out as well. Does anyone know? I need to remember to ask my MO about it in a few weeks. Robyn - no worries! It's good to see light at the end of the tunnel.  We are all getting closer to be done and that is what is important! Best of luck to all the rest of you.  Hugs and prayers sent to all my August sisters.  WE CAN DO THIS!!",

On a different note, I picked up some ginger chews from trader joes.  Someone at chemo had left a bag out for people to try the other day and though I am not a huge fan of ginger, I have been eating those instead of taking the compazine this time around.  I was hoping that not taking the compazine might help with the headaches, but no such luck. Hair will be buzzed off tomorrow.  Yesterday I pulled out a handful in the shower and now multiple strands are coming out all the time.  So, time for the plunge!  The worst part of it will be going to work on Monday. The pandora bracelet idea is beautiful!  I am spending time with my sisters tonight and may drop the hint!  :-)  Wishing all of you minimal s/e's this weekend and dry weather.  It has been raining for the past 3 days here in the midwest, so I am sure you east coasters are getting it as well.  The sun is finally out now, so hopefully the weekend will be dry.

I also did the big cut last week.  Friday night I had my DH shave it down to about an inch but couldn't stand that it was still coming out by the handful so on Tuesday he buzzed it down further.  But it hurt!  Today I couldn't take the funky looking stubble that I had so he got out the shaving cream and razor and now I look like Mr. Clean!  I found some different ladies we can compare ourselves to other than Sinead O'Connor....Demi Moore, Natalie Portman, Cameron Diaz and Brittney Spears all have shaved their heads at some point in time.  Though Brittney was crazy when she did it, so don't know if we would want to compare ourselves to her! I would go 'topless' all the time if my head didn't get cold and it didn't freak out my 9 year old. She always asks me if I am going to wear my wig. I don't like wearing them either. They are itchy and I am constantly wondering if it looks ok. To top it off, not everyone at work knows about my situation and I have one long haired wig and one short haired one that I interchange.  One of my co-workers the other day asked me if I was a secret agent with my various disguises. And that's what I feel like with my wigs on....like I am wearing a disguise. Vivie - so sorry that you are having such a hard time with your family. It sounds just plain awful. Sending lots of hugs your way. My mom can't even talk about me having bc to people outside my immediate family and that includes her own siblings. She saw me last week at my most exhausted and now doesn't believe me when I tell her I am feeling fine. She thinks I am trying to cover up for her. I don't know how she will react when she sees me without hair. To everyone else - sending lots of love and hugs and warm wishes to all of you to have minimal se's. Good luck to everyone having treatment this week. If #3 hits me as hard as #2 it may be a while before I can get back on but know that I am always thinking about all my August Sisters!",

Chrys - I too am on the Red Devil and I don't take the steroid the night before.  I take mine the day after for 3 days.  I am on the every two week schedule and have Compazine, Zofran, and Ativan for nausea.  Though after round 2 I only took the Ativan at night to help me sleep.  My side effects have varied.  Round one I was slighly nauseous - like morning sickness and tired with a huge headache for about 5 days.  Round two, still a little nauseous and really tired.  One of the side effects of the Red Devil is mouth sours.  When the nurse pushes it in to my IV I have popsicles or ice chips.  I also have something called Biotene mouth wash to help prevent them.  Adriamyacin also leaves you with an increased risk for heart issues later.  That's why they do the Echo for a baseline now before you start treatment. Jennifer - Sorry about your hubby. Prayers for a speedy recovery for him! I had SVT during my mastectomy surgery and shortly thereafter.  Follow up EKG and Echo didn't alert the docs to anything so they are thinking it was just the stress of the situation.  I almost got out of Adriamyacin because of it. Madismommy - I have them give me my Pharmacy orders each time so I know what they gave me.  I compare them to what I got last time just to make sure.  You should ask for them if you don't get them.  Prayers for no puking!  No one should have to go through that. Mary - glad it's not shingles! We can get those??? I had two really bad bouts of chickenpox as a kid so hopefully I have built up enough immunization from those guys. Sorry you are still going through that that. vtEllen - keep us posted on what the docs find. I asked my Nurse if the chemo would kill any would be cancer cells in the other breast and she said definitely yes! Someone had asked about the flu shot - I just asked my Nurse and she said she would find out for sure as there are different answers apparently! To all who had tx this week - thinking of you and hoping for minimal s/e's.  To all that had their last AC YAY!!!!!!!  Great job ladies. By the way...aren't our periods supposed to stop with chemo?

I forgot to bless the drugs before they administered them!  But the chaplain stopped by and we said a prayer together, so I hope that covers me for this go round.  I also got a cute little knitted cap.  My mom makes knitted hats and prayer shawls for the church to donate to either boys clubs or hospitals.  I don't think the one I picked was her handiwork though! Thanks for all the well wishes and good luck to everyone having treatment later today or later in the week!",

Zanoa - I had my first treatment today too.  I didn't have the nose thing, what's that from?  My head was really heavy as well and then I developed a wicked headache which I attribute to the C drug.  Took 2 TS Tylenol and they didn't even touch it.  Vicidin worked though so I am feeling better now. Welcome Lindy - my treatment is a little similar.  4 AC every 2 weeks followed by 4 Taxol every two weeks.  If you have time to read through the whole string there are lots of tips as well as looking at the tips to Chemo thread. I don't have any of my own yet to advise with. Here's to all you ladies starting tomorrow and the rest of the week.  Stay strong!",

I am halfway there with first Taxol tomorrow so I will be with y'all until November 30th.  Not looking foward to tomorrow, but then again, I am never looking forward to infusion day.  *sigh*  When I asked my MO how long the infustion was she said only about 2 hours.  But some of you are there much longer, right? Regarding lymphadema...I don't have it and I don't want it!  My PT said it could happen at any point in time.  I don't fly that much but I am definitely going to be wearing compression garments when I do. Summergirl - I am so sorry that happened.  Men can be so stupid sometimes. Best of luck to everyone getting TX this week. I am really hoping Taxol is kinder to me than AC as I do not want to spend all weekend in bed again. Hugs to everyone!",
