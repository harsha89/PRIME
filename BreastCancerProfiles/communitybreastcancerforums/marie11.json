Bs said you are doing great stop trying to do so much and it will get better. Best answer so far is from pt who says it's scar tissue and massage it five times a day. I spend the whole first mile of my morning walk/run rubbing my chest. Wonder what the neighbors think of that? It does help so i dont really care what they think.
