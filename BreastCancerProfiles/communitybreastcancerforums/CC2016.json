I haven't heard much about the port placement until reading this, I had the impression it was no big deal. I was even hoping to get my chemo teach later that day so I didn't have to wait until the following week - weekends keep getting longer and longer since I know nothing is happening to move this process along. Think I'm crazy for that idea? And who gets Nulasta? I'll be started on AC whenever I actually start. And how many days after chemo are you back to \"normal\"? By the time I actually start this I do want my weekends back! ;) I've got no problem asking questions, as you can see. I'm glad to find this group and wish I had a few weeks ago when my Oncotype came back. I was struggling to find others that were \"young and otherwise healthy\" - that's the catchphrase this summer, fyi. Not sure how many times I've heard it - and it never makes me feel better. Getting the recommendation of chemo has hit me hard. The surgery was successful and this cancer is basically gone. Going through this for the future is understandable but...ugh.",

I'm not sure yet how much it really helps but I truly believe it takes the edge off. I have a diffuser going most nights with various calming oils. Keep lavender with me for when I start getting panicked about whatever- been whipping that out a lot this summer. I made a nausea blend to carry around - lavender, peppermint and lemon. Most citrus should help nausea I've read. I've been using a muscle relaxing blend on my shoulder (maybe port related, maybe tension) of lavender, peppermint and frankincense. That one does help me sleep. Plus carrier oil to the blends! I've been fortunate that my se have not been too bad so far, a lot I've been dealing with many for weeks before that I attribute to the nerves and stress building up to day one.

I have found a charity online that will take 6in donation rather than 8in which would be at my scalp. I'm not ready be bald yet!

My only thing was I really want a hair cut now pixie-ish, not buzz just yet. Couldn't talk them into a cheap cut and paying $50 for a cut that will fall out in less than a month is just not an option for me. Going to a beauty school tomorrow for a cheapo cut hopefully.

My port was placed last Friday, surgeon said the goal was that I would be able to forget about it between infusions. That has not been true! The swelling has gone down but my shoulder and neck is still sore and it has been uncomfortable to sleep. Besides the fact it's a visible lump under my skin! I took hydrocodone the first couple of days but then remembered an essential oil blend I made for my husband's bad back. Slept well for the first time that night after rubbing it in. I'm still using that rather than the meds. First AC infusion was Tuesday morning. Scared to death walking in but it was really not bad. My biggest fear was some horrible reaction to the drugs. The infusion center is not in a hospital, the doctor is there but I'm sure an ambulance would have to be called. No need. Wild imagination. I got to go home and see my kids. Prayers answered. Port access was no problem, freezing spray before the poke so didn't feel anything. I had put the lidocaine on but didn't mention it since I know the spray works really good ;). I had a bag of anti nausea, I know she said I would get steroids but don't know when that happened. Then started C and finished with the red A. Got a tad queasy a couple of times. The nurse called in scripts for prochlorpromazine and zofran. The P for mild to moderate nausea and Z if it gets worse. She recommended I pick it up and take it right away since it seems I have a \"sensitive tummy\". (I didn't a few weeks ago, until the nerves of chemo prep took over.) I did take 2 P on Tuesday and put on the Seabands. I was drowzy and queasy the rest of the afternoon but can't be sure how much was meds and how much was nerves. I actually ate a decent dinner-and got horribly nauseous and tired so went to bed super early. Wednesday was nothing to report-Seabands made my thumb muscles sore I think. I took them off that night and haven't had to put them back on yet. And thumbs are better now. Yesterday and today I've definitely been more tired than normal and my stomach has been making weird noises. Some D by that has been off and on for a few weeks now-nerves I think. A Culterelle has kept it under control so far. I've made some essential oil mixes for tummy/nausea and keep the Seabands with just in case but haven't needed it yet. My appetite has been good, not great, but definitely better than expected. Metal mouth has come and gone several times, saltwater rinse when it does just in case that's a sign of oncoming sores but nothing yet. I've heard neulasta is a possibility if levels drop, here's hoping I can hold off. I prefer to keep the meds as minimal as possible. Some of the stories y'all are telling scare the crap out of me so I'm glad of the lack of pill bottles I have right now! I've heard days 3-5 are supposed to be the worst so am holding out hope that was it. I've got big plans this weekend that I really want to make it through! GonnaBePoz - I'm praying you're community gathers round and takes care of you and your daughter. Exes and bosses are not what you need to stress over! I hope a secret admirer brings you groceries soon ;) Bagsharon- if the race has the \"give up trucks\" or whatever they're called I'd say go for it! As long as you can stop when you need to and you feel up to it at the starting line, why not? I started walking a couple miles most mornings just over a month ago now trying to prep. It's been harder this week but then the air has been crazy heavy humid. Can't be sure again if it's the chemo or not. I'm sure it's a factor but to what degree...?

Maybe there is something to the exercise and movement helps the body. Hmmm... And glad to know I wasn't the only one with the mouth film. Although mine went away for about a month and then came back! Still have it on my lips at times but hoping it is heading out for good.",

I'll be bringing my own snacks. Now I have to wait another few days. I start Tuesday morning. After sitting that long for a haircut I should be able to handle the infusion ;)But am glad to have progress this week. Leydi- hadn't been told anything about pets. Switch out the gecko for a turtle and birds for hamsters, just one cat and we match! I remember when I was pregnant doctors saying not to personally clean the litter box and have someone else do it but I can't remember why - the dust maybe? I'm going to use this reason and get my daughter to do it, it's her cat that she's supposed to be caring for anyway! And normal hygiene for turtles is lots of hand washing- not sure if it relates to gecko health as well.",

I've been wondering if this will ever end as well this week. (I actually started a blog about this journey and called it Young, and Otherwise Healthy since that was all I kept hearing last summer anyway.) But as others have said, you have to do everything in your power now so that there won't be a next time. I'm doing it. Dragging my feet at times but doing all like a good patient. Hand to God if I have to do this again down the road I will NOT be such a good patient! Expecting not to have a treatment and then being told it is highly recommended REALLY sucks - that was chemo for me, I had a lumpy so knew rads was coming. Great surgery, clear margins, node negative and the damn Oncotype came back intermediate. \"Since you're young....\" Cry it out, fight it out (I got a second opinion, just to hear the same thing in another voice - actually did wonders for my mental state, the whole weight lifted thing, for real. I'd totally recommend a 2nd if you need an added push), and then do what you know in your heart is right for you. My take on rads - not a big deal. Wasn't fun, was very \"exposing,\" was a daily job to get up and dressed and drive to the center. Took longer to drive there and back than the treatment but it was over in 6 weeks and it didn't seem that long. (and then I started a REAL job the next day!) My skin did get a bit burned and uncomfortable the final week but now, a month later, it's still a shade or two darker but back to almost normal. Young skin is a bonus on this one. Chemo effects are still bugging me worse. Even started tamoxifen but haven't noticed anything bad there yet either. Chemo sucks. Amen. Amen.",

My diagnosis was at the end of May last year - I had just quit my job, school was letting out (and all the \"stuff\" that goes with the end of year for kids) and we were moving to another state. This year I became permanent at a new job that I started the day after finishing rads, school was letting out (and all the \"stuff\" that goes with it still), new MO was beginning the process of shut down my ovaries and switching to an AI (and a sore/tweaked/weird feeling belly started) and... I felt another lump. This month was a year since LX and I celebrated by having a pretty painful mammo and ultrasound. (Lots of smushing and pushing and glopping since the lump was in a most inconvenient spot closer to my shoulder) A lot of worry, even though I kept telling myself it HAS to be scar tissue, it is very close to original tumor site. Okay news was that the lump is most likely fat necrosis and calcium something, I can't remember the official word. \"Nothing serious, no need for a biopsy just yet, we'll keep an eye on it and see you again in 6 months. Let us know immediately if anything changes.\" It wasn't there in Feb at the last mammo, so things have changed. I've got a CT scan scheduled for my belly tomorrow to see if it might be ovarian cysts or appendix issues or something else. I had gone to the PCP last week with my belly concerns thinking its not an issue for the MO and the aches were becoming more constant. Let MO know (her PA actually, as she was on vacation) at my appointment monday and she basically dismissed any concerns I had with anything as it's not likely treatment related. Honey, if it's ovary related then it's most likely treatment related since we're screwing around with them unnaturally. And I've been getting bruises that I have no idea where they are coming from (I got 3 in 3 days this past weekend on my legs) and the response was basically an \"oh well.\" Apparently she's trying to see if I'll grow horns as well. You're screwing with my hormones, I'm telling you flat out I don't feel good and you will probably act surprised if I'll become demonic...seriously?! Thinking about putting in not to see this chick again. I've got my next Z shot Monday (since they scheduled me a week early \"by accident\" or incompetence) so I get to go back, again, and hopefully not see her, just get the shot. If it hurts as bad as it did the last time I might be ditching this treatment option sooner than later. \"It really shouldn't cause any pain\" - then you try it chicky and let me knowhow it works for you. Yeah, the horns are starting to grow and I really don't care THAT much. I've been a good girl and did everything they told me to for a year. Their time is running out. I'm actually better mentally than I was a few weeks ago. The okay-ish mammo and the negative pregnancy test (PCP ordered \"just to rule out\" and I flipped out with all the drugs and scans I've had in the last few months) seems to have calmed me a bit. I've come to the realization that this journey is far from over even though I had really hoped I could start fresh this summer. One day at a time has got to stay in the forefront and dealing with what has to be dealt with is just part of life. I was dreaming of getting some kind of vacation in but finances are beyond tight so...maybe next summer. We're going to be hosting an international student for a few weeks starting tomorrow so we will be totally embracing a staycation and playing tourist while taking her around to many places we haven't gone to yet..as cheaply as possible. One of my new hair stories...had a customer in the other day that I guess I haven't seen him since I had the wig \"You did something to your hair, got a cut?\" - Had a few actually, guess it's been a while - \"At least you still have hair\" - .....yeah...

I'm planning a birthday party for my daughter the weekend after my first dose. Hopefully. Maybe your MO could help arrange a assigned nurse for you? I'm scheduled for a class that has already been pushed once, now it's after my port placement. After reading much here it sounds like the clanot much more than what you can get here. I'm hoping that the port goes well so I don't have to push into the following week. From reading here it sounds more than what I was lead to believe.",

But having rads or not after a lumpectomy made a huge difference with a recurrence...can't remember the percentage but it was enough to make it a wise decision to do so.

Hair on the pillow, in my hand, all over the shower the next morning -can't ignore that. Been wearing scarfs and kerchiefs just to keep the strands off me. I think I'm ready for a buzz. Inlaws are coming over tomorrow though and rather not scare them just yet, that side of the family is very much into appearance. I'll at least wash it before they come but can't be sure what that will do. Need to pick up the wig and have mixed emotions about that. Plus it's still in the 90s down here. I agree completely with the med folks needing to be more forthcoming about what is next. And not just when you ask. I'm pretty good about asking questions but it seems every time I see my MO he gives me some shocking news and I just can't recover in time. Tuesday was supposed to be #2 but my labs weren't where they needed to be so he said to come back Friday and try again. If that didn't work he would make \"modifications\". What modification I didn't/couldn't ask. Turns out labs were within range but I would get neulasta this time. Wasn't told and hadn't taken Claritin. Joy.

My update (and I don't remember what my last one was): Gyn oncologist did recommend ovary removal or at least suppression and to be on an AI rather than tamoxifen. I've been on tamoxifen since March with very little SE. I've decided to start getting the OS shot (first will be in a few weeks) and switch to an AI. I figure if all works well I can have the removal surgery by the end of the year. I kind of want to keep my opinions open in case the AIs don't agree with me and make life even crappier. I ditched my wig in April. Got an \"even out\" cut, chickened out and wore the wig one more week and then went short pixie. I even had to get a trim last month for the back. I like the short back but want the front to grow much longer. I've got weird waves and curls that are tough to manage. I finally found a product that is working in keeping it acceptable to me so am finally in a better place there. I gave my daughter permission to die her hair this summer and she chose a bright crimson. I was going to swipe a bit for fun but she chickened out. She's going to koolaid die instead but mine is way too short to make that work. She's telling me to style like Pink-still got a ways to go. Finally found out what my arm pain is! Two MOs and an RO didn't think lymphedema was the issue but finally got me to a physical therapist. After first session she's almost positive it is, \"if it walks like a duck...\" A light case but I won that prize too. Forever. And with just 2 SN removed! I'm so over all this... I have had medical professionals tell me \"I doubt it's lymphedema\" \"I doubt you'll need chemo\" \"I doubt it's breast cancer\" all in the past year. So over all of this! Still don't know why my other hand hurts. But the neuropathy is definitely easing up. I seem to be tired a lot still. Need to be more active but it's so much easier to be lazy. I really need to find some motivation but have been drawing blanks. Need a vacation too but just started working the day after rads finished. It's supposed to be temp to perm but am wondering if I'll make that transition. The contract will be over soon but communication is not something big at this company. My eldest daughter's soccer team is heading to Tulsa in a couple of weeks to play a regional tournament which is a huge deal-and expensive. She and her dad will go since I have a job now. That's pretty much our vacation budget, and beyond. (I typically can get some great deals but not when officially you MUST stay at a specific 4 star hotel, and wear specific clothes that she doesn't own for opening ceremonies and...ugh) I just hope they do well! My youngest just had sinus surgery on Thursday. The surgery took almost 2.5 hours and was terrifying for her parents. She did well and can breathe again out of both nostrils so we'll call that a success. She's still groggy though (asleep on my lap as I type) but with so much anesthesia it's going to take a bit to work it's way all the way out. Lots going on without trying to plan a vacation! Was wanting to make a beach day happen (I do live in Florida now!)but little can't submerge her head for about a month due to the surgery so there went that. Try taking a kid to the beach but don't go in the water... I will figure something out eventually. Or just loose my mind. Whichever comes first. Hope everyone is having a good weekend.",

No to legs and chin. And my skin has been really good with chemo but is now starting to turn back to my normal. Oily forehead retuned yesterday... groan. Here's a \"get over yourself\" story to share. Apparently getting called out by a 7 year old boy the first time I wore a wig in public wasn't enough for the universe. I've been trying to get a job now that chemo is done. I always wear the wig to interviews, just to not have \"that\" discussion yet, and think I can fool certain folks for those few minutes. Got a call for an interview for the next morning for a designer position, they found my resume and was interested in speaking with me. Not expecting to get it but will go for the experience. Falling asleep that night it hits me, it's a hair and beauty products company! And I have no hair! And I usually wear fake hair! And it's a NATURAL hair and skin products company! And...!!!!! Seriously?!!! Yep, my luck. Laugh on whoever came up with this one. Freak out commence. Had radiation before heading to the interview and took a poll of the ladies waiting to get zapped, all of whom couldn't believe my luck either but talked me off the ledge. Favorite scarf on my head or wig in my bag? Went with the scarf, nailed the interview and didn't get the job. Can only guess as to why, head covering or ability or fear of the future availability. But got another experience like none other. Happy weekend",

My big report is that I am MAD at the medical profession in general right now. After agreeing to doing the biopsy and waiting and worrying until the appointment - nothing happened. Literily. The doctor who was scheduled to perform it was not the same one who recommended it and this one didn't see anything that should warrant risk of infection and discomfort from the procedure. I'm still annoyed and it has been a few weeks already. At least this doc took a really good look through ultrasound, and went back to my files and looked some more and really believes it is just fat necrosis - and might even be getting smaller. I even asked the doc the week before about any size change and he didn't think it was any different. &(&^%$^%~!!!! I've got an appointment with the Gyn oncologist next week to move forward with removing my ovaries. I've gone back and looked again at all the side effects to the AI and shots and figured that maybe if I'm able to drop one of them I might start feeling more normal again. I really don't want another surgery but I REALLY don't want those shots anymore.It's not bad, but I'm just so tired of being tired and my belly is almost always sore. And no doctor can tell me why other than what it isn't like appendicitis. So what DO y'all know? Meanwhile, I'm sure you have all gotten your new insurance premium increases. I'm going to guess that it is increases for all - can't imagine anything going down this year. Mine is almost doubling, again. I'm moving all my new year appointments to before the end of the year, and scheduling anything else for this year as well, really hoping this surgery will be one too. I'm hoping to drop my coverage down since I truly should only be on followups next year and hoping that won't come back to bite me. Medical coverage shouldn't be like this for anyone... Hope you all are doing well and not nearly as b*y as I am! Happy November to all",

Mammo & US = fat necrosis and calcification - see you in 6 months. Followup with BS - let's do it in 3 months. Mammo & US = is still there, probably fat necrosis & calcification - let's biopsy. Go for biopsy = laying on table, doc REALLY doesn't think this is necessary and just about positive that it will come back with \"nothing to sample\" and doesn't want to risk infection - will send note to BS. One month later, BS followup - never got notes, \"why'd you cancel the biopsy - really think you need it\". F*&@#$(*&_@ seriously?!!!????!!! Apparently the US only shows the dead fat so a Ultrasound Guided Biopsy won't get much. The Mammo shows the calcification and that's the concern. First time I heard this since this new spot started. And then the Biosorb that should have been absorbed by now is still there and is making some results wonky. BS spoke to a specific RAD doc so they are on the same page and both agree I need a mammo guided biopsy ... and they have a new machine to do so, hopefully, since the spot is all the way up near by underarm. Normal mammas are hard to get a good pic - can't wait to be smushed and stabbed at the same time. And, of course, RAD doc is off until December. No one is expecting anything to come of this but they want to make sure. So now I get to wonder and worry for 2 more weeks about what if there is something and what can I possibly do since I've already done everything they've told me on the most aggressive treatments available. Plus, this is now scheduled for the day before I'm planning on having my ovaries and tubes removed and get to worry about that. Is that all they need to take and will it go well since they could be issues with previous c-sections and I've had 2 and what results will that get?And I was planning to change my insurance plan to something more reasonable since I was \"done\" with most of the pricy stuff this year. Better have good results back by the 15th so I can. I'm not sure what else I can handle before the end of the year since it was supposed to be the wind-down year....fun times continue.",

Being a good girl I did what I was told. Okay, fine, I ran out around the right time. And then forgot to get more until a few days post. I had also read b6 is good for neuropathy. When I finally got them there was no b6 at this store and I was too tired to go anywhere else so got b complex.

Just wanted to get it over with so I dealt with it and didn't punch the tech. Prayers for what I suspect is another member of our club. This center has a radiologist give the okay to change and go home after a quick review but there was a delay yesterday. A tech finally said that she was in with a patient. I've seen the radiologist before and she used words like \"suspicious\" and \"concerning\" and within a few days I was part of this club. Anyone having any weird pains not zapped skin related? On and off the last few weeks I've had horrible pain in my thumb, index and middle fingers, hand wrist, forearm of my zapped side. Typically at night - waking me up in tears at least once - and sometimes in the morning - making it difficult to hold my coffee. Insult to injury for both, IMO. It almost feels like carpel tunnel pain but I have done NOTHING to cause a flare up. Living an extremely boring life right now. RO doesn't think it's related to his stuff and doesn't think it's lymphadema but will keep an eye on it. Of course, there's no pain when I meet him. Ever. And this past week I've been getting a weird sensation on my back/shoulder blade area, also on the same side. I see my MO this week and will bring it up with him but will expect him to blame it on the chemo still. The neuropathy has gotten better but this has been worse than that ever was. I can report I'm not sure about the rads fatigue. I'm tired, yes, but can't be sure exactly why. BC has controlled my life decisions since late May, I'm mostly done with rads - and rads daily travel (which is worse than rads itself, I think), rads is STILL not the end since hormonal therapy will take years and will begin shortly, I've had a great sinus gunk hit me this past month so I wake with a numb hand and clogged nose most mornings, I've got 2 active kids with their own schedules, I'm in the midst of a job search with all the anxieties of getting hired to have a job vs getting hired at the \"right\" job. Pretty sure it's just life fatigue, honestly. Whimper and whine time over, thank y'all, love y'all. Time to send a few more applications and take a nap!",

Got routed to a home health provider company. Took a bit to be understood of what I was calling about and where she needed to look for information. It came down to they also farm coverage out to another company. She took all my information to submit and eventually I got a call from a company in state although on the other side of the state. From what I can guess (without asking specifically) is that it\u2019s a mom and pop type shop that is very enthusiastic about the work they do although she wasn\u2019t very professional (a lot of communication was done by text and there was enough misinformation that really frustrated me). Bottom line though, she took care of all the insurance paperwork, knew coverage amounts for my plan (100%!), and got everything submitted and approved by the end of the year. Two sets of gloves and sleeves were sent to my home on the 29th and arrived this week. She said normally they would get custom gloves made but time limits were a factor. This is my first set so I\u2019ll give it a try and let her know. I was on a PPO plan that she says automatically covers compression garments completely. I switched to an HMO this year (I should just be on follow up care now-praying that\u2019s the case) but she says I should still be covered for replacements. That\u2019s my story so far. My advice is to give it a try with insurance. Get to your calm place and make the phone calls, refocus and calm, and make more phone calls, calm and follow up. I\u2019m hoping that now that I\u2019m in the system I\u2019m done. Finding the correct person to talk to was annoying and then getting the communication between the supplier, MO and PT - during the holidays- was excruciating but it did work out! I\u2019m letting my PT know as well since she told me insurance didn\u2019t cover garments! Happy new year",
