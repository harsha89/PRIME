I've finished 4 of 6 rounds. So far the worst side effect for me has been hair loss. I'm guessing I've lost 75- 80% of my hair. It continues to shed every day. I've been wearing a wig since the 3rd treatment. I'm really bummed about this. I feel like my oncologist downplayed the haircut loss, claiming it might thin but I wouldn't \"lose my hair\". Yet here I am wearing a wig everyday. It will take me years to grow back my long hair. Has anyone else lost a significant amount of hair on CMF? Did your hair eventually return to normal? I'm also concerned that oncologists downplay hormonal therapy, which I was told I would need. I'm currently on Lupron and hate it. The hot flashes and lack of libido are the worst. And this is supposed to be long term. After chemo, im going to try switching to tamoxifen but I'm pretty concerned about going on this drug based on the side effects that I've read about. Feeling very demoralized right now",

Since then, the shedding has slowed but I do shed everyday. I'm currently on treatment 5 out of 6 and I've probably lost 80% of my hair at this point. I hope you keep more than I did. I hate chemo too! But at least it's short term. I fear that I'm going to hate hormonal therapy more :( I already can't stand Lurpron. These cancer treatments are awful. I wish the cancer industry would make better advancements. But nope, too much money to be made",
