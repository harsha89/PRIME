I opted for a lumpectomy on my doctor's advice. The lab reports came back with three IDC tumors and lots of NIDC. The next step was a mastectomy. I don't regret having two surgeries at all. For me it was better to know for sure before having my breast removed. I don't think there is any way to tell for sure what they will find during surgery. Its your choice. The most difficult part for me was waiting for the second surgery date. Because I chose an immediate DIEP reconstruction the surgery was long and I had to wait over a month to get enough time on the doctor's schedules. Whatever you decide, best of luck. Valerie",
