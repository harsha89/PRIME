To remove the elephant from the room, I will address Athena.  <deep breath> I'm sorry for anything you have been through.  I honestly am.  Especially something that was caused from the simple fact that (for some reason) pot is not legal in most places.  Everything you mentioned is not a problem from the POT, it is a problem because it is not legal.  IF it were legal... no blood on anyone's hands.  Here in the states, the government at one time tried to make alcohol illegal.  Did people still drink?  Of course!  Were they doing illegal things to have that drink?  Yep!  And so... the government decided repeal the law and now... many many years later, our government is making a TON of money off of the sale.   Correct me if I'm wrong here, but, I'm 100% certain that no one in your country is having blood shed due that fact. Michelle:  you are not intruding at all!  This post is not for stage IV only.  Anyone is welcome.  :)  God Is Good:  love you for many reasons! :) Elaine:  I too, was a \"just say no\" kind of woman, once I became a Mom.  I  put pot in the same class as cocaine... \"illegal drugs\".   After further thought I have came to realize that I was wrong.  It's never too late, nor is one ever to old, to admit they are wrong.  I don't think of it as being hypocritical.  I think of it as a lesson learned.  Wisdom.    To everyone else... thank you SO much for your input!!  If you agreed, or if you didn't!  I was pleasantly surprised that we can disagree without turning to personal attacks.  :)  Again... yall rock!
