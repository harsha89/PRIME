      "Content": "Jul 18, 2016 05:15PM SusanRachel wrote: There are two categories of lymphedema: primary and secondary. Primary lymphedema is something that a person is predisposed to from birth, though it doesn't necessarily show up at birth. The three categories of primary lymphedema show up at different ages: birth, adolescent, and 20s-40s. Secondary lymphedema is caused by something specific. Worldwide, the most common cause of secondary lymphedema is an infection called filariasis. In the western world, the most common cause of secondary lymphedema is cancer treatment. Is it possible for lymphedema that shows up in the absence of diagnosed breast cancer to be a symptom of it? Yes, it is an outside possibility, but in someone without known cancer who develops lymphedema, it is far more likely that it is either primary lymphedema or filarial lymphedema (if at risk). The other thing I would point out is that examining your breasts is a learned art. You said in your other thread that the lumps were symmetrical and extremely large, but the doctor examined you and did not find any masses. Is it possible that you were feeling your ribs? I am a doctor and often have younger patients who come in after finding a rib. I use it as an opportunity to educate, but honestly, I'm just really glad that they are starting to do regular self-exams.",

The first thing you need is information. If either the mammogram or ultrasound is abnormal, you will have a biopsy. In my case, the mammogram was stone cold normal, but the ultrasound was very abnormal. They were able to do the biopsy the same day. I don't think that happens most places, but it was nice not to have time to dwell on it. The biopsy results took two days to come back, but based on the ultrasound, I already knew it was cancer, so waiting the two days wasn't hard. If you do have cancer, the size, type, and location of the tumor will have a lot to do with whether you are a candidate for lumpectomy vs mastectomy. I chose lumpectomy because the healing is much faster and also, since I had positive nodes, I was going to need radiation regardless. Some studies have shown that all-cause mortality rate is also slightly lower with lumpectomy, which was also a plus. As far as your hair goes, the FDA recently approved a cold cap that you can wear during chemo that can help prevent hair loss. You will have to ask the women who use it how well it works, but it is possible that you won't lose hair during chemo. That is huge. I never realized how important hair was until I didn't have any. Anyhow, best of luck to you. Hope your tests are all negative.",

I have LE and have done a study measuring before and after flights and have not seen any change. The reality: the study I was in (not yet published) is the ONLY prospective study on the effect of flight on LE. (There are two studies on the effect of flight on people *at risk for* LE: one says yes and one says no). The therapists say it can cause issues, but there isn't anything in the literature either way. I'm not sure how that idea got started - maybe they think that having less air pressure on the outside of your arm will cause LE. In reality, osmotic and oncotic pressure inside your arm coupled with the elasticity of your skin provide way more force toward preventing (or causing) LE than air pressure can. So much more research needs to be done!!! (BTW, that doesn't mean that no one is affected negatively by the flight environment - just that there isn't enough research.)",
