They were able to get a room at the Ronald McDonald house so they will actually be taking him down there in the next week or so. The oldest grandson ( 8years old) is not bad at all; he loves to play my other son's x-box and math games on my laptop. My scans were posted this morning and they seem positive but I will have to wait until Wednesday to hear it from him. My scans are a little hard to read because it was a different doctor (kaiser) that performed the initial PET and CT scan. It did read that my plueral effusion is gone which is of great relief. I will let everyone know more Wednesday. I have only been on Ibrance/ falsodex for 3 months and I remember everyone saying that it takes 6-12 months to see a remarkable difference. Micmel- Stable!!!

I try to be happy and enjoy myself (determined to not let cancer steal anymore from me) but at some point all I can think about is whether I am going to be around next year to celebrate.

I know that you were waiting to see what your scans read this time to determine if you were stopping all treatment. I have seen you on another post and know that you have had your scans but have you gotten the results? We all have to stick together. We are the only ones that understand what each other are going through. I want to thank everyone for being so supportive. I realized last night that I will never be able to talk about death with my DH. I was telling him about the woman who was cured and how on another site she said it would be 5-7 years before it would be the norm for everyone and I said that I hope I can make it that long. He actually said\" why where are you going?\" I said well realistically unless the cure comes sooner than later this disease will take my life. He got sooo upset and started yelling that he hated when I talked like that and that I'm not going anywhere. I really need to find someone to talk about my wishes for when it does happen because right now he's not there.",

I love your room and especially the quilt. I think we all need one so we can read it when we are feeling down. 50s- how is the tamoxifin treating you?are you on anything else? Earlier you asked about my husbands kidney. When we were still young(24) my husband was told he had high blood pressure well he thought he was too young for that and didn't take it seriously. At age 33 he developed an aneurysm and was told he had 11% of his kidney function and within a year he was on dialysis. He was on dialysis for 12 years and got a kidney. The day he got his kidney is the day I found out that I had cancer(1st time). So as you can see our lives have been pretty eventful. The person I feel most upset for is my daughter who will be 17 in October. How does that saying go? What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.i believe that's how the saying goes. Gracie- I'm glad you got the rest you needed. I'm also glad the port went well and that you had a caring doctor.people would be surprised at how much that makes a difference. when I first was diagnosed with stage 4 I was scared to death! The mo at the time did nothing to make me feel any better. The mo I have now makes me believe that I have at least a couple more years ahead of me. You see same disease just different approaches from the doctor. I'm glad you are feeling \"human\" again. micmel- I'm glad you're feeling better. Your dh always knows when to swoop in:) mae- the concert sounds like it was soo much fun!!!",

Gracie- I'm glad they were able to make the headache go away. I have been suffering from sinuses and I've had a headache on the left side if my head and it goes into my eye. Not a good feeling. micmel- how are you doing with a quiet house?",

Just as summer is about to end now we are in the new school mood. micmel- I'm glad your surgery went well. I know that you are panicking about the bridal shower but I am sure you are going to have a great time 😊 magda- it's great to see your smiling face. I don't know about you but it seems that a lot of us on here are redecorating rooms in our houses. Do you think that stage 4 gives us the same feeling as empty nest syndrome? I am working on my daughters room because she loves elephants. Amazon makes it waaaaay to easy. pots- it's funny that you were talking about a cough you have. I get drainage and a cough towards my last days of ibrance before my week off. I talked about it on the ibrance forum and a lot of ladies get it. It does always make me worry that my pleural effusion is back. chelle- you are my new hero! 10 people! I have 7 in my house and sometimes it gets crazy! Well most of the time. Thank god I am still able to work to escape it! I agree with micmel. Pain comes and goes and we always free the worst. I will be praying for a clear scan for you.",

Sheila- I hope that when they do the pet scan there is no progression. Did you start out with Mets on your spine. I have heard of several women being in so much pain and then they use radiation and they feel soooo much better.",
