My mother is actually the one with Breast Cancer and even though I'm an adult (30yrs old) I'm devastated and feel like I still need her terribly. I have been searching all over the internet just trying to understand the diagnoses and what is the best next step. She had her masectomy 8 days ago and the pathology results just came in 2 days ago. Stating that she had a 2cm tumor and negative margins but had 1 positive node with extracapsular extension which has my mom devastated (4 were Checked and only one came back positive)The report has her as stage llB and Chemo and radiation has been recommended for treatment. She really doesn't want to do radiation but is willing to put up a fight and do chemo. Thus far with all my reading and research this community has help me the most with understanding this diagnosis. I guess I'm trying to find people with a similar experience who could possibly explain The significance of extracapsular extension, I'm unclear if that means cancer is floating all around her body now (which is my biggest fear) and their recommendations of handling the effects of chemo. Thank you everyone for your responses and everything that you do this community has really helped give me hope. Log in to post a reply",
