The first one went so well that I didn't think I needed it for the second. The second one was by far much worse. Although I don't actually know, I suspect one reason the first one went so well as compared to the second was because the Xanax helped me chill out. I still have one breast left, and if I ever need it biopsied again, I will ask for Xanax. I think everyone is different, and it may or may not help you, but it did with me.",
