I'm kind of in love with my right breast right now & hope I get to keep her. I had an allergic reaction (I think, not certain) to trace nickel in the biopsy clips (two in each breast). Was put onto antiobiotics so I could keep surgery date and then developed hives, I think to the antibiotics. So craziness all around. It will be a relief when I can concentrate on just healing from the BC itself! Funny story: My 10 year old son kissed my left breast goodbye the night before the surgery. He is a bit of a ham and he played it up and said \"I haf to kiss eet goodbye!\" in some kind of Eastern European accent. It was so funny and silly and cheering that I thought to myself, Life can't be that bad if I have such a wonderful son who can make me laugh. But this is tough stuff, isn't it, sisters? I have always loved my breasts even though they were a bit big and getting a tiny bit saggy. I just loved them. And now I have only one to love. I can't even bear to look at the skin near the mx scar let alone the scar itself. So bony and defeated and folded-over looking like a cloth napkin waiting to be ironed. Maybe I'll have reconstruction later...I've got a long road ahead first. To those of you with surgeries still ahead, in many ways please take courage: it hasn't been that bad! Percoset is amazing stuff. To those of you who have had surgery, I'm sending you special healing thoughts as I type this.Â Good night!",

I went on a bike ride. Saw a social worker therapist who I think will be helpful. I have a lot less pain and am much stronger overall. However, I am now experiencing much more numbness than before in chest and under arm. Very strange. So I will call the surgery nurse and see if she has anything to say! Anyone else experience this? Meanwhile found out I will start chemo (16 weeks) in about 3 weeks, then a break (TEs then?? I'm not sure) and then radiation. Kind of a long haul! Weird to think we will all disband and move on to different boards--September chemo for me. Worried about a reaction to the port since I reacted to the biopsy clips and ports are bigger. GrammaB, Rosamond, Delirium, and my other sisters--keep on posting so we know how you're doing.",

Excuse repitition but here are some things I gleaned from SIL and from the boards: wedge pillow amazingly helpful (I can post the link if you want); start Colase the night before; get thank you cards ahead of time (here's hoping you have many people to thank!); extra pillows of varying sizes if you have sentinel / auxilliary nodes out; order camisole with drains (I can mail you mind if you'd like; it's clean and ready to go!). Lastly I got a side table that swings over the bed--not strictly necessary but very nice. Best of luck in your preparations and beyond.",

Anyone else have this? So have switched to humble ol' Advil which isn't quite as wonderfu but I think is lessening the nausea. Though traumatic for us I think removing a breast or breasts isn't that big a deal from a surgical pointof view because we once didn't have them and they grew on top of what was already there....so we can heal.

I am still on the fence but leaning towards some kind of light fasting (say 500 calories per day) for the two days before. Hard to see how that could hurt anything!

My very first chemo date is Sept 16 (2013) and I'll be doing A C followed by T (I guess that will show up on my sig?) My oncologist hadn't even heard of it so I sent her some of the links. Still waiting to hear back. Though young she strikes me as conservative and very middle-of-the-road. I just called the 1-800-4CANCER folks (National Cancer Institute) and it appears that the trials underway will not conclude till 2015. So we just have anecdotal evidence to go on and the one 2009 (?) study that involved only 10 people. I guess the question is does modified fasting (say 500 calories?) help reduce side effects or do we need to go all out, I wonder? Thanks, Bonnie",
