I'm back at work after my surgery and super tired at being \"normal\" again, although I am embracing normal at the moment. :-) My hubby and I are going wig shopping this weekend. I just talked to my boss this morning and will be taking the Friday after chemo as a work from home day while this is going on. It's no problem, so I hope to work nonstop through all of this. I have been avoiding the date, though. I hate every day that it gets closer to the 18th. Some kids at my son's summer camp were making fun of me losing my hair already. My son was so upset on my behalf. I promised him that I would never pick him up without a wig on. *sigh* It's all this little stuff that bogs you down sometimes. I will address everyone more personally as I get to know everyone and get caught up. Happy Monday!",

I go every other week, so it looks like I should be done before Thanksgiving. I feel a bit unprepared compared to some of you. I was hoping to just need radiation but found out two weeks ago after my lumpectomy that the tumor was bigger than they thought and the cancer was in one node that they removed. I just visited the chemo place yesterday. I haven't cried yet and everyone keeps praising my positive attitude but today I feel like bawling.  ",

We were celebrating Kindergarten graduation. It's petty and senseless but I will never eat at Cracker Barrel again. lol I just picture myself pacing outside the building hearing \"It's cancer\" and have sworn the place off! My port isn't really bothering me but where my lymph nodes were taken, it still is numb but also weirdly hurty. How are other people feeling where there nodes were removed? My surgery was June 20th and by the end of the day at work, I'm in pain.",
