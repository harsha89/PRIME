I know the waiting is hard I found a lump in my left breast about 6 weeks ago, I had the mammogram, ultrasound and core needle biopsy.  Last week I had the lumpectomy because mine had its own blood supply.  It was a Birads 4. My results came back B9, I'll pray that yours will too.  The waiting was so hard, but I found this site was the best to read and find comfort knowing I wasnt alone in this.",

I am just concerned with the tumor having 2 cysts within it and it having an internal blood flow. The radioligist report stated that it was circumscribed and hyposchoic. I know my only answers will come from the biopsy reports, I am just over thinking everything and getting myself very anxious.......",

      "Content": "rezski wrote: I posted first time yesterday, but I can't stop thinking about what the results are going to say. I keep feeling like I can't breathe. I'm trying not to search the internet, but it seems hard to stay off. I guess what scres me most is that the ultrasound stated internal blood flow.....I don't know why I keep focusing on that. I have a great boyfriend who has been there the whole time, and my family is amazing. But we haven't said anything to the kids. Their father really is a dead beat, so I want to keep things \"normal\" for the kids until I know something. But I find myself unable to cry at home because I don't want to upset the kids, I work full time, so I can't get upset there, and now can't really cry at all about this.....  I am glad I found this site though, reading through everyone's journey's seems to help me :) I guess I'm just venting today. I wish I had my results so I knew exactly how to feel and what I'm dealing with....  Thanks for listening Stacey :) Log in to post a reply",
