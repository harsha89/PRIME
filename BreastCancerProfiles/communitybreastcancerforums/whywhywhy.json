My sister who is 36 has just found out she has ductal carcinoma, unfortunately it is invasive and extremly aggressive . from the scale as far as how bad the cancer is my sister is at the max for all of them and is considered high risk. she will be having a mastectomy next week. possibly double.. 4 weeks later she will under go intravenous chemotherapy. i don't know what all this means and neither does she as everything is happening so fast. I'm so scared for her shes so scared we have no clue what to do .. we never knew it even ran in the family. i say to you  \"please help\" to see a different surgeon get second opinions and don't wait till October. If its invasive thats not good. that means it can get to the lymph nods if it hasn't already and spread to the rest of your body. my sister found the lump about 2 months ago and didn't get checked by the doctors until it started to bother her. Now shes at the highest levels on all categoriesfor her type  of breast cancer and we are now in a fight to save her life. please don't wait. pleas find another doctor that can see u.. waiting is the last thing u want to do if its invasive.",
