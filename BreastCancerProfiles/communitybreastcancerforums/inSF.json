I'm definitely struggling with this phase of treatment and the hair issue is finally really starting to freak me out. I shaved my head early in the process and actually had significant hair growth during taxol/taxotere (switched part way through). I am now more than 9 weeks pfc and have zero additional hair growing on the top of my head. I actually shaved my head again at 7 weeks because the male pattern baldness looked so bad, and it is not improving. I started just going out bald sometimes (doing hats the rest of the time), but I am starting to worry I will be in the small group with permanent hair loss. I guess I'm just looking for encouragement and some positive examples. Was anyone else nearly bald on the top of the head at 9 - 10 weeks pfc?",
