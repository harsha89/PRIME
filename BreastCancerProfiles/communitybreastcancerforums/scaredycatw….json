Everyone has failed me and I am blaming everyone.  I haven't stopped crying since I got my mammagram results. I fear I am so self-centered and childish. If it is not too painful for you to think about, may I ask you if your mammagram showed suspicious microcalcifications that needed further testing to see if they were cancerous or if the radiologist or breast surgeon knew from the mammagram that what they were seeing  was cancerous.  I have been reading that 80% of the time these biopsies of suspicious microcalcification clusters come out benign.  That sounds encouraging. and my radiologist had said that if she had to make a bet she would guess mine were benign but then she immediately added but they can be tricky and surprise you sometimes.  I think she saw the fear in my face so threw a lifesaver with her benign comment so whatever hope I could glean from her statement was destroyed in my mind. Also, my sister was diagnosed with early stage 1 breast cancer around 10 years ago and she said her mammagram showed suspicious calcification patterns but she never got a biopsy but went right to a breast surgeon and it sounded as if they could tell from the mammagram that she definietly had cancer and to expect some lymn node involvement. Thanksfully, she is cancer free to date which is so wonderful.  I don't know if 10 years ago they didn't have stereotactic biopsies in place or if her calcifications were much more serious looking. so I guess my question to you ",

I also had more pain after the procedure.  I don't know but I am glad that is over!! I am scheduled for the excisional biopsy on the 26th.  I still don't know if the surgeon will be cutting at one or two sites until we get the report from the mri biopsy.

After my stereotactic biopsy showed LCIS I was sent for a breast MRI.  That showed a second area in the lower part of the same breast that might be just a b9 firoadenama  and a swollen lymphnode which the surgeon thinks is from the biopsy but they thought why not biopsy before going in to see if it should to be removed. We tried to do an ultrasound today to see the fibro thing and then they were going to do a core biopsy on it but they couldn't locate it on ultrasound. So now the next step is to do an MRI guided biopsy. For someone like myself who is afraid of any physical pain or medical procedures, I am starting to be a pro... Before the first core biopsy, I went hysterical on my husband who was not very supportive about my fear and anger, so he just packed a bag and left!!!  So your husband falling asleep in the waiting room seems like a minor thing to me.  Thankfully, I have 2 sisters, who though they live 3 states away from me, are such good people that they dropped work on a moments notice to come down here and help me though that first biopsy, MRI, and 2 different surgeon appointments. I am going to send them home back to their lives now even though I have to do the MRI guided biopsy on Monday and if I can get the test results back on that in 24 hours I may even do the wire location biopsy as soon as wednesday...The surgeon I like is going on vacation April 1st and even though she said I could wait to do it, I want to get it over with while my body is used to all this prodding and pricking. I am still quite nervous about the wire insertion biopsy...My breast is still bruised from the stereotactic biopsy they did on March 6th and then it will be sore from the MRI guided one they are doing on Monday, so the thought of them jamming those needles in to numb my breast while they put those wires in on Wednesday (hopefully it will only be one and they will find that fibro lump thing b9) is scary.   I hope I am not rushing things but I do want to know asap and get it over with asap... I will have to take Tamoxifen or one of the new drugs femura or something like that regardless of what they find when they go in right now my diagnosis is LCIS but ny surgeon said they could find spots of DCIS which is still not invasive but still cancer is cancer to me!  even if there are spots of invasive cancer it is not the same as metastisis to the rest of the body so at least I no longer feel like I am going to be suffering and dead in a few months... They also said they found a spot on the liver in the breast mri and probably should have that ultrasounded as well although it sounded like they see things on the liver a lot doing Breats mri that turn out to be nothing seious--but it is another thing to worry about!! Did you have general or iv sedation for the wire biopsy??  How long did you have to sit while they do the wire insertion?  Did you have to take a tamoxifen like drug  after?  Any side effects for you?  Thanks Carol My husband has come back and is really trying to be supportive now--but talk about a jerk!! Men are so limited emotionally!! Anyway,",
