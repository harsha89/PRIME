I had a stereo tactic biopsy and really no pain at all,I'm also small 125 lb and a size B cup.On Tuesday I had a lumpectomy and awaiting final path results. I know is a \"roller-coaster\" from which it seems we can't get off.....I too cry a lot,been prescribed xanax,with each new day I find that the fear was actually worse than the event. For now focus on the fact that 80% of these results are B9. Wishing you all the best. Pat",
