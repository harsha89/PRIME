      "Content": "Nov 24, 2017 08:31PM - edited Nov 24, 2017 08:35PM by Milkweed93 Hi there! Just starting rads next Tuesday 11/28. I have sensitive skin also and got folliculitis with chemo, so I'm a bit nervous about this next step. Set-up was fine, but not a lot of info besides certain creams/ointments to use. You guys are far more informative than the RO office. Maybe after the first one, she will tell me more. I was never told what the rad field would be, so the suggestion to lotion up to clavicle and to breast bone is helpful. I asked about the \"prone\" position possibility, but they don't have a prone board (it costs $10K she said - why did I have to know that?), so I will be face up. I can however do the breath hold, even though my tumor bed is on the right side. I am not a candidate for the hypo-fractionated, so 30 treatments for me - 25+5 boosts. I see that some of you are saying to treat your skin before the rad session, but aren't we supposed to have the whole area clean for it? My sessions will be at the end of the day, and I'll be coming from work some of those days, so I'm wondering if I should bring something to wipe any residual lotion off my skin before tx. Also, I got a good teeth cleaning last week and I'm seeing the Dermatologist next week. And my surgeon suggested a lymph drainage session before rads, so I did that today. I have a lot of congestion around my surgery, but no lymphedema. Whew! Also, I have been washing my pits with Hibi-Clens since I tend to get folliculitis there, and I have not needed deodorant. No smell! ;) I hope it helps keep my skin clear thru rads! Where are you guys buying bras/camisoles? I would like to get a cotton bra (no underwires of course) and some good cotton camis. Thank you!!! ",

If not, I will get something like them. Ellyn - I have a great book called \"Cancer Fighting Kitchen\" that I use when I want to get creative. They have fish, chicken and turkey recipes mostly, but I'd be happy to share some if you want to PM me (or I could post here - I just don't know if it is okay to do that?). Each recipe yielded about 35 grams of protein per serving. Also, if you have a good meatloaf recipe, use lean ground turkey and add grated cheese for the fat. That might bump up the protein a bit. During chemo, I kept hummus around and hard cheeses and nuts for snacks. I eat a lot of eggs and have bought some egg whites to cut the fat and calories of the yolks. Thanks for the bra suggestion!

We can tell our stories and worries, and get positive energy :) Georgia - I have been wondering about the vitamins and turmeric since I usually take both and forgot to ask my RO last time, so thank you! tlfrank - not to worry! You don't bring us down. We are here for each other, good days and bad. Amy - I have stickers, which he said won't come off until we take them off, and I have some tiny black tattoos. I was worried because a client of mine has some big dots that are tattoos and are kind of grayish. She hates them. I too have to drive about a half hour each way. And today at 3:45 which is my usual time, I was so sleepy! I don't know what its going to be like in a couple of weeks when the fatigue sets in. I will have to get someone to drive maybe. DodgersGirl - great idea about another thread! Ellyn - Love your positivity! Go us!! ",

Check the temp on your wrist like you would a baby bottle. It takes a few tries to get the head angle right so it doesn't immediately go down your throat. Oh and do this over the sink. I give it a little sniff while there is still water in my nose to get it up in the sinuses a bit. Then I blow gently into a tissue/TP. Then dab some vaseline. I hope this works for you!!",

Update on me: Just finished 9 of 30 rads and just starting to get a little itchy and rashy. I will up the aloe and calendula to 3X a day instead of 2. I had debated on when to schedule my sessions. I had one friend that said end of day was best for her so she could have her work day, then go home and rest. Another friend said beginning of day because the machines can break down and when they do it's usually later in the day. I chose end of day and wouldn't you know, so far the machine or computer has had problems 4 days in a row! Fortunately, I was still able to get my session in on the days; I just had to come in even later. Hopefully, they have worked out the kinks or whatever it is that they need to do. My rad tech is a quirky guy who I'm fine with, he just isn't that warm. It's okay, I'm only there for a few minutes. I am doing the breath hold technique and he had to adjust mid treatment because my RO didn't think it was still aligned properly. I have more marker marks with clear stickers now. I don't even see where they tattooed me. I live in Santa Barbara county, and while I'm not near the fires themselves, we are getting a lot of smoke and ash blowing our way now. I just feel so toxic with the radiation within and the air quality without, you know? I have air purifiers going in our house all the time, and I'm trying to eat and drink as \"clean\" as possible. But I can't get my usual walks in and I love to walk. California has had a hell of a year! For those of you who have done the 30 day, when did you start feeling the fatigue? I am scheduling clients in my 4th and 5th week and don't know if I should lighten up my days ahead of time or not (I'm a massage therapist). I know everyone is different, but it seems like fatigue is what we can count on on this rad trip! Thank you and congratulations to those who have finished!",

I asked him a question about what I need to wipe off because I'm coming in at the end of the day and he was so rushed and dismissive. I didn't feel like he was listening to me at all. He is a replacement while the regular one is out on maternity leave. And I was supposed to be able to talk to my RO today, but she had to get on a conference call. I was on the table for 30 minutes while they took pictures/x-rays and did the first treatment, and I was cold. No one offered me a blanket so I think I need to bring my own next time. I was not a happy camper. I'm so glad to have this board to share our stories and SE's and help each other. Thank you all! My radiated breast is definitely warmer than the other one. I'm going to use Aquaphor tonight, but Calendula cream tomorrow, and lots of aloe. IntegraGirl - lol, shitshow is right, amen! Congrats for finishing :) Amy - hugs and I feel you! Angela - I think they do tack on missing ones at the end of the day. My tech said sometimes they make you come in twice in one day if they miss, so one in the earlier morning and one in later afternoon. It just has to be 6 hours between. I hope this isn't the case for you! Well off to start my new bedtime routine!",

It is so interesting what other MO's in other countries do as a matter of course regarding rads (you and I have such similar profiles). My RO said that I was not a good candidate for the 15+boost because of chemo, even though she knows that other countries do it. She specifically consulted \"Harvard\" docs on this - whatever - and strongly wanted me to do the 25+5. I was really hoping for the hypo-fractionated. Oh well. Anyway, good to hear from you again!",
