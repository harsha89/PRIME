Thanks for the fasting advice,I am interested.  I think I'll try it, anything that might help is worth it. I see everyone is getting their wigs or hats, I have gone to a couple of wig stores, but still haven't purchased one yet.  My hair is to long and thick to try wigs on properly, so next week I am going to get a short cut then try on the wigs.  Thanks for the tip on the cancer society wig and hat give aways.  I think I'll check my area out. I have signed up for another great program from the American Cancer Society called \"Look Good ...Feel Bette\", where they teach you beauty techniques to cover appearance-related SE from cancer treatments.  In my area it is given once a month.  The onco nurse said they gave out great high end make up, it should be fun to go to.  The national number is 1-800-395-LOOK or check out their web site www.lookgoodfeelbetter.org. Reading every ones posting and wishing all the best, lots of hugs.  suz3 ",

I can't wait until I am completely bald maybe it will stop hurting.  I hope you have found relief. Yesterday, I had to make an appointment for a CT scan in March.  This is my first check up even before chemo is over.  I thought I'd get check ups after chemo, the scan is to check my liver because it had some cysts.  They need to check for mets.  I maybe one of the first ones on our thread to have be checked for mets.  Well it is nerve racking.  I keep reassuring myself that they will just be cysts and they will say we'll check again in 6 months.   Has anyone else had to have a recheck?  Let me know.  I think of you all often, read all the posts, take care and lots of hugs, suz. ",

Anyway back to bc, I had a dmx with delayed recon in Dec (I was on the Dec Mast. thread too) my margins weren't clear after a botched biopsy so went for the dmx. As for chemo my onco and breast surgeon have given me two different protocols.  I prefer the onco's protocol because it does not involve a port.  However, it is a combination of taxotere and carboplatin, which I haven't seen anyone with that combo without HER+.  I find it very curious.  Has anyone else out there been given this combo?  I want to say thank you to Julie for starting this thread.  I have been on a couple other threads and received a lot of support, especially the auto- immune, a good thread with anyone who has other problems beside breast cancer.  Julie and Tammy, I see you work in schools, please let me know how going back to school works for you.  I am a early childhood special ed teacher and I am a little worried about teaching the 3-5 year olds during chemo (a least one has a cold).  Bamamama2 and WarriorPrincess24 special hugs you both have gone through so much.

Vis0121- I have the same oncodx score as you 21.  At first the bs and onco said I wouldn't need chemo because I was in the gray area, but after they found a positive node they said all bets were off and I would need chemo.  That probably is the same for you.  I getting T (taxotere) and C (carboplatin) kind of a different combo, I'm going to ask the onco why he is giving me that combo.  Good luck with your chemo.

Vit. C 2000,  3. Anti Ox (Nutrieology, one or two daily,  4.  Co-Enzyme Q-10 100mg, one twice daily Pre- and Post Operative Supplements 1.  Beta-carotene 9a form of Vit. A) 50,000 I.U. daily,  2. Zinc mg. daily,  3.  High potency B-complex, one daily,  4.  VIt E as mixed tocopherols, including the gamma form, 800 I.U (however some drs don't want you to take E before your operation. Post Operative 1.  Increase dose of Vit. C to 2000mg. 4x daily as soon as tolerated after surgery.n If diarrhea occurs decrease to bowel tolerance.  2.  Bromelain 500mg daiy  Homeopathic Remedies: Dissolve pellets under the tongue, nothing to eat or drink for at least 15 min. before and after a given dose.  No Coffee 1.  Arnica Montana 30 C, 4 pellets once a day beginning 3 days before surgery and continue 2 weeks after surgery.  2.  Hypericum prefolitatum 30 C, 4 pellets evening before surery, the morning of surgery, immediately post-oper. and then once a day until surgical pains resolves.  3.  Aconitum napellus 30 C 4 pellets the morning of surgery.  4.  Staphysagria 30 c sometimes given instead of Arnica starting the second week after surgery.  5. Other remedies as indicated for specific symptoms after surgery.  I hope this might help someone.  I'm being staged on Thursday, I'll see where that takes me.  I've been thinking I had Fibro the past couple of years but the oncologist wants to send me to a Rhumi after my treatment to check for RA.  In the mean time I have a neck injury and the neck dr is sending me to have an MRI tomorrow, just one test after another, however if I get answers it will be worth it.  I really find this the most helpful thread, thanks.

Both are going to keep track, I guess. All the sharing is really helping me figure out things.  Wed. I am actually going to look at prostetic bra, just to keep my options open.  I also meet with an onco, I will relate all your info so he can help give me the right treatment.    MAGOB, thank you for sharing, I hope you feel better soon.  I don't have any advice yet since I'm a newbee, but I hope next year I'll beable share and help others, like you wonderful ladies.   Lots of hugs. suz3 ",

Barb- I asked about the pain shot and they said absolutely no shots until chemo is over,  I kind of figured that.  I am going to get another opinion from a none work man's comp dr, I think they (wmc dr) are biased toward the work.  Plus I have extra bone scans from the cancer scans, they did a special one on my neck.  Should give me more information. Katie33, good information, it doesn't surprise me.  My allergist told me facts and discouraged me fro recon. because he thought I would get chronic pain.  He told me to get it in writing from the PS that it would be 100% pain free after the normal recuperation.  Plus he said he knew a PS who has taken dozens of unsuccessful recons.  I listened to him got a dmx with no recon..  However they want me to see a Physical Therapist because my scares are starting to stick to my ribs, hopefully that will work. MAGOB- Thanks so much for your support. Hugs- suz3 ",

A may not be good for bc, so we should post that, to give everybody knowledge to make sure it is right for them.  Thanks for doing that, I'm terrible at all the computer stuff.  In fact this is my first experience with chatting or anything like this. jessamine, Thanks for the in put on Vit. A., I see the allergist tomorrow, I'll ask. CrazyKitties, hang in there we know how tough it is and people just don't understand.  I think that's what so great about this thread, our sisters understand us and we can cry, laugh, support, give information and it can be fun.  Take care of yourself.   Today my work gave me a basket of goodies for my operation, it was only the second time I cried, a very emotional moment, maybe it is just sinking in and it is reality now.  Anyway it was very thoughtful of the ladies I work with, I'm a early special education teacher. Lots of hugs bc sisters. suz3 ",

Interesting subject on sensitive, I to am sensitive to especial smell.  I think my body is fighting off so much, now even cancer, so I can't fight off smells that bother me.  Everything goes together.  Well I'm going to keep up with all the interesting subjects, I'll let you know if my drs give any interesting news. Please take care, lots of hugs suz3 ",
