I had a bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction started April 14. I have no family history of breast cancer and am 36yrs old. I am starting chemotherapy May 10, with radiation and Tamoxifen to follow. I'm very anxious and having a difficult time accepting all of what is to come. I have read/heard so many different things, I don't know what to believe anymore. I have been reading many of the blogs on this website and I was hoping to join your forum.",

I have heard so many conflicting things that I am so confused and terrified  of them both. I never thought of myself as a vain person, but I must be because I am so concerned with the SE. I have done so much researching on the Internet, I feel I have done myself a disservice  because I have read some very scary things. I need to confirm my decision tomorrow with the onc as far as which regimen I want to do. I just pray I make the right decision for me and I have no regrets. marmalade skies:  It is so wonderful to hear that you have someone that is so supportive. I feel the same, my husband is my rock. I can't imagine doing this without him.  When I get really down and start feeling sorry for myself I try to remind myself that things could be so much worse. It's been difficult to get my head wrapped around it all. I feel like I'm having an out of body experience or it's only a bad dream. I don't think a day has passed that I haven't cried since I found out. I just want to feel like my self again. I'm afraid I never will. I wish luck and many positive thoughts to everyone starting their chemo. ",
