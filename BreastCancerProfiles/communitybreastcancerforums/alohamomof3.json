Do any of you feel unsure when doing your monthly breast self exam?  I have been told in the past that I have \"ropey\" breasts, and I deal with health anxiety, so it's frustrating when I feel my breasts, and think \"is that something or just normal?\" Any thoughts or advice would be great! alohamomof3 Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "alohamomof3 wrote: Hi ladies! I have had unexplained, occasional twinges of pain in my left breast since 2004/05 - numerous mammos, ultrasounds, and exams haven't come up with anything.   I saw my gyno again yesterday about the same concern, and she suggested I try vitamin e, and in the meantime go to the imaging facility I go to for my mammos, etc., and get a fairly new diagnostic test done, called a BSGI, or \"breast specific gamma imaging\" test. I got lucky and got in this morning for it - when it was done, the tech came back in with the radiologist (who has 20+ years experience with breast imaging!) and showed me a dark spot on the picture of the left breast and told me it was just density - he said the bottoms of my breasts are dense.  He said a cancer spot would show up very black.  He also reminded me that my mammos have always checked out fine.  He said they obviously didn't find the reason for my breast pain, but he was going to report the test as \"normal, premenopausal\".   I don't know why I feel doubtful about this - I do suffer from OCD and health anxiety, though.  I read somewhere on-line earlier that cancers on mammos show up white.  Could this be different with a gamma imaging test.
