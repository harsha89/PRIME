Her family started a thread on this web site looking for info, I believe it's still active.  This made national headlines.  In the 2 years I've been dealing with bc I've heard of many young women who have been diagnosed.  You should do an internet search for sites dedicated to young survivors of bc. Again, sorry for your wife to having to join us, but glad you found this site, it has a wealth of information you should be sure to take advantage of during the journey. I think many people in your shoes would consider a medical malpractice suit against the dr. who told her she was to young and not to worry.  It might be wise to document her experience, get copies of her medical records from this dr.'s office and seek legal advice from an experienced malpractice attorney.   Good luck to you both ",

My son just turned 11 and I know how I'd feel if in your shoes.  I would do anything for him. That's him in my avatar, to the right (a few years ago).  (I don't know why this text went gray & small, I can't get it to change back, that's why the Edit) I did recently hear through a friend of a young girl who went through something similar, finding a lump, etc....  It was not taken seriously, and no tests or follow up were done. She died at the age of 16. You're daughter is so lucky to have you as parents and lucky to have docs who listened!  You should get copies of all her medical records, path reports, surgical notes, etc....  You can get CD's of any imaging as well.  When I needed mine I called a week in advance for the CD's with accompanying paper reports and then went in person to each department for doctor's reports. As tkone said, fight the fight!  There is much info to be garnered from this site and sites geared to specific types of cancer.   I'm confident that you will figure out what to do next, do the research, and you'll know what's best for your daughter.  I have learned the hard way, through my own journey, that we must be our own advocates, cannot stress that enough! Let me also say that there are many resources for treatment.  The most talented and caring doctors will help you with your insurance company, just don't be afraid to ask. There are amazing plastic surgery resources as well, should your daughter be in need.  Lots of info right on this site.  Use the Discussion Board search tool.  She may not need much until she develops.  Don't give up until you find the best, they may not be in your back yard, but they are out there and they are passionate about reconstruction.   If you don't mind, I see my plastic surgeon tomorrow and would like to discuss this with her.  She is one of the extremely talented, caring, passionate ones.  I'll pass along any insights she has.  Good luck, you all will be in my thoughts  ",

I think I only took pain meds for a day or two.   I do know that anesthesia makes me nauseous so I asked for meds for that and did not have any problems.  Anti-nauseau meds can cause constipation.  Take a stool softener before the surgery if that is a concern.   This is a day surgery, you'll spend a few hours in recovery and then go home the day of the procedure.  You'll need someone to drive you.  I went downhill skiing a few weeks later which helped alot with range of movement issues I had with the lymphnode removal.    I don't think anyone could accurately tell you what your breast will look like after since it depends on your surgeon, the original size of your breast, where your lump is and how much tissue is removed to get clear margins.  You might consider a pre-surgery consult with a plastic surgeon. Ask your breast surgeon for a referral. Good luck.",

Its clinicopathologic spectrum ranges from incidental, microscopic foci to clinically and mammographically evident breast masses [98]. Originally, hormonal stimulation (particularly with progesterone) was suggested in the etiology of PASH, on the basis of observations that this disease is most frequently seen in premenopausal women or in elderly women taking hormone-replacement therapy, and because similar histologic findings are seen in normal mammary stroma during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. However, thelesion has since been found in men and in women not taking hormone therapy, and only a small percentage of PASH cases are positive for estrogen receptors or for progesterone receptors [98, 99]. Clinically, rare cases of PASH present as a well-circumscribed, dense, rubbery mass mimicking a fibroadenoma or a phyllodes tumor. Both the mammographic and sonographic features in PASH are nonspecific, so biopsy of these lesions is necessary to exclude a malignancy [99, 100]. On gross examination, PASH is usually a well-demarcated mass with a smooth external surface. The cut surface consists of homogeneous white and rubbery tissue. Histologically, a complex network of anastomosing slit-like spaces within a densely collagenous stroma characterizes PASH. The histologic appearance may cause confusion with mammary angiosarcoma, so immunohistochemical vascular markers are used for distinction. Immunohistochemically, the bland spindle cells that line these spaces are strongly positive for vimentin and CD34 and negative for cytokeratin and factor VIII. The recommended treatment for PASH is wide local excision. Although PASH can recur, patient prognosis is good [98]. I hope you find this helpful.   It seems that rare cases of this can be malignant, hopefully the lumpectomy will take care of the problem for you. I've never heard of PASH which is what made me look it up on-line.  Also, if you do a search of this discussion board, you will find quite a few postings on PASH.  Good luck  ",

Barbe, regarding your question.  Prior to u/s, that's what we were thinking, but it was so obviously a mass (I asked to see the images) that the attending radiologist didn't hesitate a second to recommend biopsy. ",

There are reconstruction options other than the TRAM procedure.  Your friend can investigate them all on this site and others.  Only she can determine which one fits her circumstances best.  Another web-site, with very graphic pictures of before & after is www.breastcenter.com   Good luck to both you and your friend. ",
