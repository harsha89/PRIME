After these ops followed 6 chemotherapy treatments and 20 radiotherapy sessions. Having experienced sharp pains and rib aches I decided to search the Internet to see if anyone else had experienced these symptoms as I was getting rather concerned and lo and behold I see it is quite a common problem and like most of you hadn't been told that this could occur. Anxiety can give the most awful symptoms too which doesn't help the situation but I am pleased to have read everyone else's posts on the subject and feel more assured now. Thank you",
