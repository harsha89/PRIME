I started my first rad on Wed. Yesterday they told me the rad doc hires a massage therapist to come in weekly, so after my appointment I got a very nice 15 min chair massage. She was very careful to ask what kind of cancer I had, where, if I had nodes removed, and then used less pressure on that side and used a motion that moves the lymph fluids the right way. She is specially trained to treat chemo/rad patients. I will seriously consider going to her spa and paying for a full hour treatment. I want someone who KNOWS what they are doing.  It's not too late for you to find someone you trust. It is not unreasonable to have anti-anxiety drugs. I would venture that 80% or more of the women here take (or have taken) an anti-anxiety, anti-depression, and a sleep aid! One ativan is not going to cut it. See if your center or clinic has a social worker and enlist his/her help.  ",

Suggested I needed a flu shot (had one in Feb), a pneumonia shot, and a shingles shot (seems like if I needed all that I should have done it pre-chemo when I was most vulnerable to infection).

I just couldnt see having two additional major surgeries that were medically contraindicated. Cried throughout the appointment with no acknowledgement from RO, went through mapping, simulation, etc. came home, cried some more (cried a LOT) and decided I just could not do it. Husband agreed.

Much more in tune with my needs, not looking to add treatment I don't need, spent lots of time answering lots of questions, and just seems like a very knowledgable guy. No pomp, very confident, no condescention. I've had enough of that. Got remapped, tattoed (this time with black light not ink) and simulated. Will be flexible with my schedule since I am traveling 90 miles to get there. Will be able to stay with parents if I get fatigued. I have been highly emotional since I finished chemo (can cry easily anyway, but this is worse); more so as rads draws near. Then add a jerk for a doctor and I became a wreck. Have taken Ativan at night with Ambien for sleep, but just started another Ativan in the morning. Prescription allows for 3 a day, but I am going to start with 2.

Not supraclavical, and not thyroid area. But if it is jaw or higher the saliva glands can be damaged, so then the teeth/roots are at risk. If you have extensive dental work, fluoride treatments may not be a bad idea, he said. He thought no drinking for three hours was excessive. He recommends no drinking for one hour after fluoride. Radiation is very targeted, so it is very unlikely that your teeth roots are at risk from that. You might want to call and ask the dentist specifically.",

But when rads started and I had gone through a major emotional event with my first oncologist, I realized that I was about as low and stressed and emotional as I had ever been. So MO suggested talking to primary doc for anti- depressant and I started on Cymbalta two weeks ago. I have also had several sessions with the oncology social worker. As a school counselor myself, I am a big believer in therapy along with meds. A support group is also beneficial. Unfortunately the days mine meets are not at all convenient. So I try to meet with or call the social worker at least every two weeks. I guess the main thing is to realize there is no shame or weakness in asking for drugs for anxiety or depression or both. This is situational; it doesnt mean you will need them forever for most of us. And I hope by so many of us sharing our stories, others will see you are not crazy and you are not alone and it is okay to cry and be scared, but it is also okay to ask for help to get you through this.",

It did not go well and I have been second-guessing ever since. tdsmgb I think we must have the same rad doc! OMG, it was horrible. I should not have gone forward past the consult, but I got paralyzed even with DH along (a very practical/logical sort of guy-total opposite of me-and he was not impressed either!) First thing RO said was \"You're young (50), you're triple negative. That's bad. Real bad.\" Didn't hear much else he said as I pretty much cried through the rest of the consult. He did say, \"You're probably cured already, but we want to be sure.\" Treatment suggested seems to be standard of care, but was surprised about his recommendation to extend the field to the clavicle area, as I am stage 1, 0/3 nodes, excellent clear margins. BUT...grade 3 and triple negative. This idea of extending the field to include the clavicle area has not been mentioned before and I am concerned about adding it and thereby increasing the SE's (although he says it does not increase the risk of lymphodema). He is the only RO within 50 miles. Question to the group: are any of you early stage, no node involvement, triple negative AND getting clavicle area radiated in addition to breast? We are all so unique, I know it is hard to compare. I've asked the same of the TN thread as well. It is done for those with node positives, but not often with node negative, even if TN. I found one research paper (very recent) that would support this however. After crying all through the appointment and all the way home (husband was in separate car because it had been at the mechanic's) and having a long talk and restless night, I finally called the nurse navigator.  She apologized and said she had talked to her manager before about his doomsday approach and lack of tact. She even suggested a second opinion and said it would not be a problem to delay the start of rads in order to meet with someone. It means going either 50 or 70 miles away, but if I get confirmation that his suggested treatment is appropriate (which I think it is, except not sure on the clavicle thing yet), it may help me decide if I can suck it it up and deal with him for the one time a week we'd see each other or that it IS worth the extra hour's drive to have someone I can trust and be comfortable with. Husband supports me 100%. It is so rare for him to have such strong feelings about a doctor; he is a dentist and is much more logical and be much more objective. He's never felt the need to \"like\" his doctor as long as they get the job done and know what they are doing! With his own patients he tries to make sure they understand exactly what he is going to do and why, especially when it is something involved and complicated. That is when they need to trust you the most! So, for now, I am feeling so much better about getting a second opinion.  P.S...Beetlebum! I can totally relate to having feelings hurt, rather than getting angry. That's me! I must say, I did like the techs so if I do go back at least I know they won't beat me up! P.S. S. Cancer sucks, doesn't it?!",

I can see the first question will be about creams...starting immediately rather than waiting until the skin turns pink! Melanie, I got Aquphor at Shopko, I believe, or possibly Walgreen's. You don't need a prescription for that. It was on some list I saw on this site somewhere...probably before, during, after chemo.

I am thinking that in the beginning it may not even be much of an issue driving up and back in one day, but as I get further into treatments, it would be good to have the option. I have been second-guessing myself all weekend, but after an hour conversation with my friend and discussing with husband I feel much better about getting a second opinion and making a switch. Thanks for all the support ladies...now I just hope I can get an appointment quickly.

So check with your social worker or receptionist and see if they have the paperwork for it. There is a form, but the receptionist filled it all out for me. don't know how long it will take. But had not heard of that benefit before.  There was a massage therapist today when I left my appointment. The RO hires her to come once a week for his patients. She is trained to work with cancer patients; very nice touch. It was a chair massage, fully clothed, shoulders/back area for about 10-15 minutes. But still a very nice thing to offer patients. I will see her weekly  and might make an appointment with her for a full-fledged massage! No tears for first appointment yesterday, but today I did when the masseuse was so caring and gentle. Glad I only have 3 sessions this week. Next week will be the full five treatments. I got scratch tickets today. 33 of them. Won a dollar on the first one, so off to a good start. Love that idea.  ",

They just filled out the paperwork for me yesterday. Now it won't help with the fatigue, but it would certainly be something to look forward to! You can also check with the ACS and see if they have driver's in your area. I my little town of 2800, there are 2 women who will drive cancer patients to their appointments, no cost. Many local chapters have volunteers who want to do this. Many have had cancer in their family and know the hardship of driving. So consider that as well.  I have had several offers of people who will drive me. Seems silly for a 10-minute appointment, but I'm thinking that having someone in the car would be a nice thing. They could even drive my car! Some have friends/family in the town where my treatment is so if I want to spend the night with parents they would go see their relatives. With co-workers (teachers), we're thinking that several could go and we'd have brunch before or after my treatment. The hardest part is asking, but the best part is how willing people are when you do ask.  ",

So I got the shampoo/conditioner (GIANT bottles...all my stylist carried...should last a YEAR!) and I read on the bottle that it is a 3-step system, so i called stylist back and sure enough, there is also a spray, which she recommended I use too. She said the spray (can't remember what it is called) can be a bit irritating and even cause scalp to turn red, so not to be alarmed. Said I should use at night. Anyone else using these products? I am only 2 weeks out from final chemo and have some very light fuzz similar to Christine's picture I think. Onc would not agree to any Biotin during chemo since I was on clinical trial; am considering that as well. Any/all advice appreciated!  Also, what about Minoxadil? Saw that recommended too and bought that. Then read fine print which says it isn't effective for hair loss due to chemotherapy, although I guess it is still frequently used by chemo patients. Can you use both the Nioxin and Minoxadil at the same time? ",

I do not know if theOnco was ordered, but I am still waiting to here on the er/pr status, so hopefully it will be a part of that. But definitely something I need to find out   It sounds like I don't yet have the whole picture and seeing an oncologist is just part of that. But knowledge is power and I am learning lots! Thanks!",

I had a lumpectomy on Feb 3 and had my post-op with surgeon yesterday  (Friday, Feb 11). I already knew the tumor was approx 1.9 cm and that it was grade 3 prior to surgery. The surgeon then shared that I was Stage IA, with no cancer in the margins, and the nodes were all cancer-free (3 were removed). This should have been great news and it was. However, for some reason I was not at all prepared for his recommendation to see an oncologist next. Both my husband and I knew that radiation would be required but have not yet met with the radiologist. But the surgeon asked twice prior to surgery and then after if we had met the radiologist yet. We hadn't because my surgery was moved up two weeks due to a cancellation. Just not enough time. We also knew that chemo might be needed if the tumor was larger and/or there was cancer in the nodes. 1.9 was confirmed in the path report, making it just under the one guideline. Clear nodes makes the other guideline. We don't yet know the ER/PR receptor status. That will take another week. So why, if I'm clear on two counts, do I need to have chemotherapy? I was devastated and cried all day yesterday, even though my results were so good. He said it isn't a sure thing, but something that should be reviewed with the oncologist. I just don't understand why we weren't told right off the bat-regardless of size or nodes, you'll need an oncology consult. I would have been so much more prepared. Radiation? I'm ready. Chemo? I would have been with some prep. Now I feel like I've received the C diagnosis all over again.  Sorry this is so long, but seems so similar to what others are going through. I have been given two oncology referrals in two different towns (I'm in a rural town-one oncologist 30 miles away; the other 90 miles away) and I plan to see them both to get two opinions. I have not heard about the Onco test. Does he do that or the surgeon? Or will that be part of the missing lab report still to come? Also, what is a cold cap? I'm gonna have lots of questions for y'all, I'm afraid! ",

I have had lots of tingling/numbness. I take 2 scoops of glutamine 3x/day, plus Neurontin (an Rx) 3x/day. Because I am on a clinical trial, they won't allow me to take any other supplements such as B6. As long as it is not severely impacting \"daily skills/living\", they will not change or stop the Taxol. If I was stumbling, or couldn't button, things like that-then they would reduce or stop. I keep a daily journal of symptoms, just in case. After round 2 I had severe weakness in my right leg/knee. I was limping-even went for 2 acupunture treatments (w/onc approval). That is when I started both the glutamine and the Neurontin, so hard to tell now if acupunture helped. It has been better after chemo 3 and I will have chemo 4 this Thursday. It does have me concerned. Nails so far are okay, but dry. ",

I can only speak  factually about my own treatment, but have talked to many in a support group and of course by the interactions with the many women on different threads on this site. I guess I can understand your frustration and concern if some of you get a cookie-cutter treatment! Chemo is clearly different for each patient. Some go weekly, some go every other week and some go every three weeks. Some get 4 doses, some six, eight, or 12 or 16! The medicines vary. I was weighed every time and the dosage adjusted accordingly. I was also questioned extensively about previous SE's, especially nausea and neuropathy and again-the dosage was adjusted accordingly. Because I had stage 2 neuropathy my taxol was reduced 25% for my 2nd dose and again on the 3rd dose. They were prepared to eliminate the taxol if my symptoms didn't subside. That scared me as much as the neuropathy did! Surgery can be before or after chemo. Many patients participate in clinical trials, including me. That by definition deviates from the norm. Radiation is not always 33 sessions. I was originally scheduled for 40+, but then got a second opinion and ended up with 33. However, if my skin didn't hold up, I could have been done sooner. I was weighed and had a CT scan and x-rays every week to very precisely measure where the beam would go. Some have 28 rads then boosts immediately following; others have a week or two in between. I know some who had 28 rads, but not the boosts. Still others had more or less than 33. Because I was stage one, 3 nodes all negative, I was prepared for rads only. It was the triple negative status that added the chemo for me. Rads is a very important piece of treatment, IMHO. I think Beesie gave a very thorough explanation. I would probably give up chemo before rads if forced to make a choice. To those that have a center and/or hospital nearby, you are so fortunate! To have a naturopathic oncologist, how cool is that! My clinic only has two oncologists and they are 30 miles away. I got a second opinion at a center 95 miles away. For radiation, there was only one RO and he was a jerk! So I drove 95 miles one-way, every day, for 33 treatments. Although it was a hardship, I did have a choice. It's just that sometimes the choices we have aren't all that great.",
