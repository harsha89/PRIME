      "Content": "VegasKat wrote: I will be having a lumpectomy procedure later this Month (Nov 2009) to remove two areas (one is an intraductal papilloma and the other is radial scar) that were previously biopsied which came back benign.  At the biopsy, they inserted the two metal clips in my breast.  My question is:  when I have my lumpectomy surgery will I still need to have the wire guided procedure done prior to the actual surgery or will the two metal clips be enough to guide my surgeon for the surgery?  I know they will be doing a second biopsy of all the removed tissue and areas of concern just to be sure they didn't \"miss\" anything on the first biopsy.  I forgot to ask my surgeon this question at our last appointment.  I also asked him how much of my breast would be removed and he told me he wouldn't know until he got in there...has anyone else heard that before?    Log in to post a reply",

Just waiting for the insurance to authorize the surgery...I've been waiting for all of this to \"end\" since July 2009...it seems to be a long \"ride\" (one I didn't exactly want to get on like the rest of the ladies on this board)...I guess I won't know for sure if my \"ride\" will be over until the last biopsy after my lumpectomy.  Thanks for your support! ",
