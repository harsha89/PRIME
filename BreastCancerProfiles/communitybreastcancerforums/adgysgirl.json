I just found out a week and a half ago that I have the BARD1 mutation....BRCA1 and BRCA 2 were both negative. I have an appointment scheduled with an Oncology Geneticist at Allegheny Health Network (Wexford) in January...potentially the same office you went to. The not knowing what to expect is driving me crazy. I feel like I'm walking around with a ticking time bomb on my chest. (Crazy? Maybe) My maternal grandmother and great grandmother were both diagnosed with and died of BC in their 30s...I am 37. I have a personal history of 2 lumps that have been biopsied and, thankfully, were benign. I also have a personal history of pre-cancerous skin lesions...and had a hysterectomy when I was 30 due to adenomyosis (I still have both ovaries). My local OB/GYN didn't even tell me to see the geneticist...in fact, she said that I should just be thankful that it wasn't BRCA. While researching the mutation on my own I found that it was recommended to see a geneticist...particularly with my personal and family history . To try and put my mind at ease, can you offer any insight as to what to expect with the upcoming genetics appointment? Will they make a treatment recommendation based upon my personal calculated risk ? And if so, based upon your personal experience , how receptive was your breast surgeon to following that recommendation ? I work for a plastic surgeon and I know he will be amazing...it's everyone else I'm worried about . I feel like they will think I'm crazy for just wanting them off my body. Thanks for listening and for any peace of mind you can provide. Sincerely, Sleepless in Brockway",
