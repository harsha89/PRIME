      "Content": "Yogana wrote: June 18, 2018-My mammogram description: Scattered glandular tissue is noted bilaterally without suspicious microcalcification or architectural distortion. There is nodular asymmetry seen in the innner lower quadrant of the right breast. There is a small asymmetric nodular density in the lateral left breast on CC view. Spot compression views and possible sonogram of both breasts may be considered. Skin, nipples, axillary regions are unremarkable. Impression: Nodular tissue asymmetry seen in the right breast and small asymmetric nodular density seen in the left breast on mammogram. Spot compression views and possible sonogram of both breasts may be considered. BI-RADS Category 0: (Incomplete. Needs Additional Imaging Evaluation) Waiting for last mammography report from 2014. Next Report: Comparison was made to a bilateral mammogram done on 9/30/2014. The suspicious appearing finding in the right breast is not seen on the prior mammogram. No interval changes are noted on the left. DIAGNOSTIC DIGITAL BILATERAL MAMMOGRAPHY/RIGHT BREAST ULTRASOUND Clinical Indication: Follow up to 6/18/2018 screening mammogram. On the right side focal compression CC and MLO views of the lower central region of the breast revealed a persistent small irregularly shaped non-circumscribed 5mm mass-like density in the 6 o'clock position about 5cm from the nipple. A focal compression MLO view of the lateral left breast was obtained revealing no persistent abnormality. Sonographic evaluation of the right breast was performed in all four quadrants and the retroareolar region. Homogeneous glandular tissue and fat is noted throughout the breast. No abnormalities were found in the 6 o'clock position to correspond to the mamographic finding (see above). A benign appearing lymph node was found in the axilla. IMPRESSION: Small irregularly shaped and non-circumscribed mass-like density in the 6 o'clock right breast, persistent on compression mammography but no found on ultrasound. The mammographic appearance is suspicious and surgical consultation and biopsy is recommended The finding in the left breast on the screening mammogram was not persistent and is compatible with having been due to a superimposition of glandular tissue. I am seeing the Breast Doctor in 2 weeks for her opinion. Can you let me know your opinion on this. Any feedback about not finding anything in the ultrasound? Thank you so much, Yogana Log in to post a reply",
