I have also been told not to do repetitive weight lifting that will tire the arm. Did you do these kind of exercises after your surgery before getting lymphedema. I do pilates and had my surgery 3 weeks ago. Wondering if I should just exercise one arm or just do the exercises anyway. I am seeing a PT for the second time tomorrow and will ask her some more questions about it.",
