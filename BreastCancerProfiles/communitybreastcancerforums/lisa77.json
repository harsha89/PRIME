He said he could aspirate, but they were so little, that he thought it was not necessary, but he was worried they would get bigger. I know he was hoping they would go away if she went off the pill, but you know how young people are. They feel like nothing bad will happen to them. She just is afraid to get off the pill!",

I am so nervous. I know 80% are nothing, but it's that 20pct! I just wondered how common it is for a 23 year old with no children to have this lump be something. I read on line to maybe wait for a period cycle or 2 to see if it is related and will go away. What is the next step...an apt for a mamo or an ultra sound? Thanks for any advise!

We are hoping it is just nothing and tomorrow will call a local breast center to see if they recommend an ultrasound. I wish I knew a breast specialist, but only know of mamogram centers that also do ultrasounds, etc. I guess they recommend a doctor if their test show it is needed. My daughter is very flat chested and this small hard lump feels like it is about 1/2Â  inch below the skin and an inch above the nipple. Thanks!",

He said he saw 2 very small cysts...not cancer. I wonder how he knew they were cysts and not cancer. They were only about the size of a small pea. He told her to stop taking the birth control pill and come back in 4 months to see if still there. She is engaged and does not want to chance stopping the pill. She would like to have kids in a few years, but not now. I am worried for her and wondered if taking one of those lower dose pills would make a diff. Anyone with experience with this and would you be nervous over cysts? Do they eventually become cancer? Thanks",
