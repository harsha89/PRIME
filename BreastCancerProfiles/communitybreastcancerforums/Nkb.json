At the beginning I did feel that stage IV was a death sentence and glad I didn't have it- but, I didn't know anything about it at the time. I'm just surprised that stage 0-->Stage IIIC all have the potential to become stage IV-none of us are immune to this.

It really shows the \"art\" involved in medicine and how our MOs are all trying to figure this out. I had no scans after initial treatment for Stage III C ILC- was on Arimidex only for about 5 years. I was told that there was no advantage to detecting MBC early- to wait for symptoms. I don't know when the bone mets and bone marrow mets actually occurred- I was severely SOB on a hike and had a HGB of 7.5- that led to the discovery. Perhaps if it really started 2 years earlier and frequent scans would have picked it up- but, I may have not have been given Ibrance- maybe would have burned through a bunch of treatments. Who knows? After the MBC diagnosis I had scans every 3 months times 3- then at 4 months. My MO told me if all stayed stable I could wait a year for another scan. I was shocked and a bit worried. But, she said that I had such a good response and she has so many patients on F/I for 3-4 years that she thought the monthly lab and TMs was enough unless I wanted a sooner scan or felt bad. It's been 9 months since then and I find that I am less worried and consumed. Yes, a stable scan made me happy- but, only for a short while- then I started worrying about the next scan. I felt like I could get off that seesaw a little. My TMs are super high- they went down about 40% with I/F and now bounce around- now they are heading up again and I will have a scan- If it is a small progression I hope to deal with it with radiation and stay on I/F as Cure-ious has planned. My MO did mention that studies have shown that too much surveillance is psychologically damaging to people- but, she would go with what I wanted to do also. Since I am kaiser- I do not need insurance permission, and no co-pay for the scan, I get PETs due to her preference and my allergy to CT dye. In the back of my mind I see all the comments about scans not being accurate esp if you have ILC- hard to hang your hat on any one approach. TMs are a crap shoot too for many. ",

Seems like the whole world cares about our hair. I did go without my wig if we were on road trips to go into the store or bathroom. I had mine colored at about 17 weeks PFC and cut and it looked so much better but still seemed way too short to go public Without engendering a lot of comments as it was still fairly thin. The second time I had it colored I didn't cut it at all and then I stopped wearing the wig. It may be that younger women's hair comes in all at once but mine still has new hairs coming in seven months plus later and it's really thickening up now. I have decided to go for length for the next several months not trying to even it out, it will stay short for so long if I try to even out all the layers of hair that is coming in. I'm sure that my hairdresser could make it look a lot better but I decided I'm going to have to go through some awkward phases to get some length so may as well do it now. I had baseball cap with hair which I wore through most of the chemo phase unless I was inside, it was really cute and comfortable and looked just like my old hair. At some point as the weather got colder it seemed kind of silly to be wearing a hat inside and outside so I changed to my wig. Many people complemented my hair not knowing that it was a wig which felt kind of odd-and they were particularly disappointed to see my real hair so short. I find it incredibly convenient to have my own hair pretty much no matter what it looks like.",

I just thought if it would look a little better I would try to do it. Sounds like from what everybody says that it's going to be growing in layers for a year or two. I certainly hope mine continues to get thicker. my husband says that the length of my hair is similar to what many women in my area wear which is probably true, but mine is thinner and doesn't look like a style yet. Thanks everyone for sharing your hair stories no one else understands this obsession, they all think they would be fine without hair. When I was first told I would lose all my hair I was also a bit casual about it but I think it's because I thought it would grow back in three or four months. It is so reassuring to see people who were bald and now have a thick growth of hair again. A bit of a funny story I went for my colonoscopy yesterday I was wearing my wig which I think doesn't look real but, maybe other people do. Anyway one of the nurses said I love the color of your hair is it natural? I said no and she said \"I'll be right back I want the details.\" When she returned she said \"okay do you color it yourself or does someone else do it?\" I said \" it's a wig, I just had chemo.\". Suddenly three or four other nurses came in to all look and tell me how great and natural and beautiful it was. Several neighbors have also told me they like my new hairstyle, I just think it's a lot neater looking then my old hair was and that's what they're noticing, every hair eerily is in place all the time.",

I hope they don't all fall out just thin or at least do it over a longer period to ensure better randomizing for the next cycle. I was really enjoying mascara and was putting a little color on the brows also. I had a trim and color -nonpermanent dye at 17 weeks PFC am going to have it colored again in two weeks, I really don't want to trim it again, although it is a layered mess. I'm sure my hairdresser will want to trim it but I just feel like I can't lose any length right now. What amazes me is that some of the hair started to grow in seven months ago while on Taxol and some of it is just starting to grow in now and everything in between-a truly layered look. I'm still wearing my wig outside although not inside at all. It's very odd that I get lots of compliments from people who don't typically notice things, about my (wig) hair, so expect to get a lot of comments about my real hair which is not as shiny, beautifully colored or styled. I don't feel ready for all the why did you cut your hair I liked it so much better before type of comments. In the looking around I noticed that actually most people's hair doesn't look very good. It typically doesn't look healthy or cut well which is maybe why the perfectly coiffed wig attracts so much many compliments. Once I get over the initial shock and questions from people I think it's going to be a great relief to no longer worry about throwing on the wig to take out the garbage etc.",

She put the same color wash that she'd used prior to my hair loss which she used to cover streaks of gray. It was not permanent dye and just faded over time and has no peroxide. She thought the color looked much flatter on the new hair that I have grown and will make changes next time to brighten it up a bit until I start growing in my old type of hair. It's nice to have the gray gone but it's really short still and I haven't completely decided whether to just go topless now or wear a wig.

Don\u2019t want to be sick here- so many sick people everywhere we go   ",

Another one is a restorative yoga teacher who is wonderful. My husband's first yoga teacher was Judith Lasseter! My teacher has gone to many of her workshops and talks about the new thinking to protect joints etc. Before my first cancer I once went to a yoga class with my daughter who was in college-it was in Santa Monica and it was a 'yoga for the people class'.

I go to 1 1/2-2 hour yoga classes and eat a full breakfast 2 hours before the class and 1/2 of an energy bar right before the class. I felt the need for mid exercise calories if I didn't do that-low blood sugar perhaps, not sure. Some people do exercise early morning before life intervenes to distract them away from it. I always take a 1/2 mile walk with hubby after dinner also- I feel better since I have taken the Ibrance with dinner- and it's fun to yack and catch up with him.",

If you have room for one it could be your backup. I've also heard that people go to indoor malls and walk-some malls even open up early just for the walkers. I did a faster pace walk yesterday and 3 reps of an outdoor flight of stairs (116 stairs x 3) at the top on the 3rd rep I felt like I was going to faint-almost sat down, but, weathered it and then walked home. My Apple Watch said that my heart rate was 126-if it is 30 points off like it was using the polar and the bike-that is probably why I felt so bad.

First day of school was always so exciting Micmel- I think that what you are going through is very common-every family has some variation of how to grow up kids. I think for us the old plan of kids leave home at 18 and are on their own and make a go of it etc doesn't work well anymore. A lot of it is the super high cost of living-rent was $50-$100 per month with a Roomate when I left home, now it's thousands of dollars. College costs so much money and if you end up in tremendous debt from it, then your whole life is changed trying to pay off college debt instead of buy a house, or get married or have kids. You will have to let go of some outcomes and standards for them to get independent. I stopped doing my kids laundry when they were 10 and my son announced that he wanted to wear the same shirt everyday. It's true I had to share my washing machine and dryer with them-and they were rough on them-but, whether they had clean clothes or not was their problem now. They made their own lunches from 2nd grade. when the school called and said they didn't bring enough food for lunch- I said talk to them, they make their lunches- the food is available. I did let them get away with some stuff because they went to an extremely academic high school and had hours of homework every night and I wanted to \"enable\" them to do it. But, I had a friend who did so much for her kids that they were afraid to make a phone call to a business or even go into a 7/11 to pick up a few things on the way home! That story was a lesson to me. Yours is more complicated by the divorce of course, taking the high road as you did is the right thing. I took walks with friends and asked them how they were dealing with the various growing up issues and we really are in a whole new era without the usual guidelines. Our kids are all different and each need a different roadmap- some need a lot of help, others less and we need to navigate this. I do know that me yelling, begging or whining didn't do much. I don't know the age of your kids or what they are capable of-but helping them to independence is a good thing usually. When my daughter was in college she said their were parents who came every weekend, cleaned their kids apartments, washed their clothes, cooked a lot of food for them-she was appalled ! It's hard to get a little selfish when you are a mom, but, you seem to be building up a lot of resentment which is not good for you. Do what you and your husband want to do, support your decisions, use your active voice, give them a little notice of your plans and move ahead. I wouldn't use cancer as your reason, I would use this is what dad and I are going to do now. Good Luck- it's hard!",

I echo 50sgirl in feeling helpless here to lend you a hand with transportation. It makes me realize that as flawed as our health system is- we have options and help from organizations and churches esp if you are not too poor or have good outreach skills. I did Taxol as an initial chemo after some other harsh ones in 2012. I already had lost my hair from the other chemo- and actually my hair started growing back while on Taxol- I think something like 13% of people don't lose their hair on taxol? I did get some nerve damage in my feet and shoes were pretty uncomfortable for about a year. Ice packs may help that. I also was allergic to Taxol and had to do lots of steroids to manage it-I had 6 months of chemo all together and tried very hard not to gain weight- I still gained 15#, but, lost it with hard work afterwards. Your metabolism is slowed down by the chemo and also the steroids cause some weight gain, I don't remember which chemo caused most of the weight gain. I walked every day. Do you have a relative who could stay with you? Could you hire someone to drive you and help with the animals while you see how things go?",

Is the Xeloda to keep things in check while they wait for the cells to multiply or is to to try to expose new antigens for the NK cells to recognize and attack? I hope that your liver biopsy ends up in the right hands and gets the desired tests done on it! If you are around Kyoto again- there is an amazing museum outside of Kyoto called the MIHO museum. It was designed by I.M.Pei into a mountain. You take a city bus out there that takes about 1 hour. When you get off you can elect to walk up a hill and cross an amazing bridge to the museum as you round the corner it comes into view and is just magical. The design is based on Tao Yuan Ming's \"Tale of the Peach Blossom\" we took an early morning bus and when arrived there were only a handful of people- when we left after lunchtime it was packed.

My hairdresser went to the wig store with me which helped with color and style etc-i felt overwhelmed there. I am not sure what to do about your \"enormous\" head (men's hair replacement store?-maybe this is a stupid suggestion -I don't know) there are ice caps here to try to decrease hair loss which I would try if I had to use chemo that would cause hair loss again. I suspect that it is very expensive- although I have heard of people having their friends help them and lowering the cost. My favorite \"fake\" hair was a baseball cap with hair attached. It was the most comfortable and easy- not itchy etc- it works well outside or in a store- at home it is a little weird to be wearing a baseball cap. Wigs were less comfortable to me especially on a hot day. I would get the synthetic hair unless you are good at styling. It is cheaper and basically you wash it and it dries right into its style. There is a thread devoted to hair topics that you could go on. I haven't been on it in years-very supportive and informative!",

Where is it all coming from? Many years ago there was a report saying that if we moved to an area with really low breast cancer rates and lived there a long time our breast cancer risk would be the same as theirs (low) if they moved from a low breast cancer country to ours and lived here a long time theirs would increase to our rate. That makes me think that it is environmental- but, what are the toxins? I was at a party recently talking to a person I had never met (no one at this party knew I have cancer) we were talking about art-out of the blue she said \"and everyone has cancer\" Before I could think of a reply it was announced that the cake was ready.

We can't save them from a lot of the heartbreak of growing up and making costly mistakes as much as we want to. From my experience and what friends have told me of their experience with grown children living with them- you pretty much don't get what you are asking for here. After college my DS moved home for awhile, he was darling, sweet and fun to live with- but, chores, money etc-no. I decided that darling, sweet and fun was good for me and that he probably would never live with me again in life and I wanted to be left with a nice relationship without lots of memories of fights over who took the garbage out. I have plenty of friends who \"can't live with their ungrateful kids\" who my son said their house was so tense all the time. Some friends of mine have a college graduate who is coming back to live with them and all they talked about was the talks they were going to have with her about leaving her stuff around etc. -This is not going to end well So my practical advice to you is :1) she moves out on her own and learns all those lessons you want her to and figures out how good she has it with you. or 2.) You create rules, assign chores and dates they need to be done, charge rent and stick by a business relationship In regards to those details. Kids can not anticipate your needs or figure this out on their own. (take my word for it, they can't) You knew practical was coming from me 😳 (not that I didn't rant to DH from time to time about Mr darling, sweet and fun).

Also ICUs are super stressful places to be and people often get ulcers when they stay there a while. If your brother knows he needs to make lifestyle changes that can be very anxiety provoking also.

Also a psychiatrist friend told me that my sister was aware of what she did- I couldn't blame her horrible behavior on mental illness or not knowing what she did. That is how I always justified it in the past.

I did not need that. Another time when I went in for one of my daily radiation treatments the receptionist said\" here's a pink bracelet for promoting early detection\" I blew up briefly- Look I've had an annual mammogram longer than you have been alive-early detection did nothing for me! Then, I regrouped and said-sorry, no thank you to the pink bracelet. And to the few people who know I'm almost always fine. (which is true in that moment in time) We all do what we hope works for us.

No one ever knows all the details and the loss of a mother no matter the circumstances is primal and hard and sad. I would thank your sister for her care over the years and let her know how grateful you are that she could do it when you couldn\u2019t. All caregivers need this. She may open up more about her delay in telling you. While i was on chemo and so sick, my mother got metastatic esophageal cancer and my older sister moved in with her and took care of her. Years later i heard some of the super hard days she decided not to share with me at the time- she felt i had enough on my plate- and maybe i did- but, she had a lot of pain i didn\u2019t know about for years. Some people say the right thing at the right time and sometimes those people are therapists-i hope you find that person. Your family does not want to lose you! Perspective is off when you feel as sick as you do right now. Lastly DS and ADHD- my DD1 has it also and struggled mightily when she went away to college. We kept her on a pretty structured rope at home and turored her in all subjects. Let\u2019s just say she took a crooked path to success-but, she is a kindergarten teacher now. Thinking of you and sending hugs.",

Your brain wants to maintain homeostasis- in general when you start losing weight it gets alarmed and wants to hold on to the weight. It does this by making you hungry, making you crave certain high calorie foods. Telling you that you are doing so well you DESERVE the high calorie food. I do notice this every time I lose a few pounds-the brain tells me to go out to dinner, have a hot fudge Sunday etc- you have to use incredible will power and remind yourself that this is a trick of the brain to not derail the weight loss at this moment. ( I'm not talking about when you are ill, depressed, side effect of drugs etc)",

I do have to take 2 weeks off before I can start the next cycle, but, my MO is not concerned with that at all. I got mouth sores on the top dose which did well with baking soda mouth rinses-don't really have them now and have stopped the mouth rinses. Anyway, so far my scans are looking good and TMs are coming down. I so hope that it works well for you!",

Besides cutting down on calories, I increased exercise and started some mild home weight lifting. you can also get stronger using your own body weight like push ups against the wall at first, plank pose etc. Some researchers believe that 10-20 minutes of exercise BEFORE breakfast leads to more weight loss. I did that with the exercise bike I have at home. The other important thing is to try to go 12 hours or more without eating. It restores your gut biology. So dinner at 7 pm and no food again til 7 am or later. no snacking etc in the 12 hours. The IV chemos slow down your metabolism which leads to weight gain for more than half the people who need them post diagnosis. I also gained 15# over the 6 months of chemo- did the same technique to lose the weight. For me it is important to cut down on carbs, especially sugar. For others it is cutting down on the fat that leads to weight loss. Keeping a food journal can help you pinpoint some of the food issues.",

I understand how hard it is to go through this by yourself- I wonder if a support group could help you in the interim? I wonder if a palliative care doctor could help find a treatment that you feel well with. I don't know how many treatments you have tried. It would be good to see if there is a passion or project or \"bucket list\" you have as planning for the future as if you are going to be here for awhile is vital to survival. Maybe a second opinion with someone you could trust at least for fresh eyes on your situation. It is said that people with ILC progress later- so several years doing ok and then start to go downhill. For me (bone mets) I also have bone marrow mets and before treatment I got very short of breath walking up hill because the bone marrow was filled with cancer and couldn't make cells- so very anemic (also they said that I had permanent bone marrow damage from my original chemo). I think that without treatment I would have had bone marrow failure- I actually don't know when the bone mets started since I was on Arimidex without any monitoring or scans or TMs etc. So, I don't know how long it would have taken for failure.
