      "Content": "Amour333 wrote: I want to say that my problem is having a lot of fibroids, especially in my right breast and under my arm, half way to my elbows. This year, when I went for my Breast Screening, it really scared me when I received a letter saying that \"Now, they want me to go for the Breast Screening every year instead of 2 because they found my breast have become very dense. I knew that I had a lot of fibroids since the early 2000. My doctor told me when he first noticed all the fibroids that I have, that he would have to keep an eye on them. But really, that was the only time really that he checked me for the fibroids. I became disabled in February 2000. First thing that came out was very bad trapezius muscle hardening along with bursitis and tendonitis. Right after that, they found that my left arm, was colder than my right arm. Seen the specialist and had the diagnosis of \"Thoracic Outlet Syndrome\". But, the specialist said that my diagnosis was mainly in the muscular skeletal, and that they should wait to operate. Back then, I was working at \"College Boreal\" and doing over 900 windows a day, many bathrooms, with washing the stalls (especially in the men's room every day) and the ladies once a week. I had to really stretch to be able to reach the mirrors (which we had counted 45 mirrors). I would do the garbages in the \"Pub, Cafeteria. Offices, Bathrooms, Library. In 1997, even though we did have the blue boxes for everybody especially the secretaries and teachers, they still threw out their books in the garbage bags. When this happened, we were two girls working, and when I lifted this one bag that was so heavy in our garbage bin, something dropped in my lower back and she even heard it also. There was such a loud crack sound. Within 2 hours, I had a hard time walking. I did tell my boss and it went in one ear and out the other lol. He was feeling very happy that day (which he was always lol), that he told us that he was going to go through the garbage in the big bin outside, that was over my head. I watched him doing the garbages, when it came to the bag that I lifted up, he had such a hard time picking it up and throwing it over in the high bin outside, and the bag even broke on him. When he came in, I told him that I had hurt my back on that heavy bag. He just said \"Yeh Yeh\". That day, was also Christmas Eve. I called my doctor as soon as I felt my back hurt and going down my legs. I had an appointment right away. When he checked me and told me that he was putting a claim in, I begged him to please not do it. Then he did explain it to me, that when you get hurt at work, that is why they have compensation and that he was putting a claim no matter what I said. The only thing that I had ever wrong with my back since 1992 was \"Facet Joint dysfunction\". Thank GOD in a way that it was Christmas Eve, because I was able to lay down and relaxed. I had 2 weeks off. That Christmas was so bad, I was laying down due to having a very hard time walking and even moving would cause me great pain. After my 2 weeks off, I was ok to return to work. Compensation did accept my claim, but were happy when I didn't miss any time off work. I explained to them, that for those 2 weeks off, I had to lay down and could hardly move. I was not able to go and visit my big family (we were 8 children in our family). It was a very bad Christmas and yes I did cry in pain and upset about not being able to walk and visit. After that happened, I noticed that every time I would vacuum or wash floors, within a couple of hours, pain would shoot down my legs and within an hour of having done the vacuuming and the floors. The big boss of all the contracts told my boss that that was enough of me doing the vacuuming and washing the floors, because he could see the way I would get. Went to see my neurologist and he sent me for an MRI. Results showed that I had 3 bulging disk at the L-3, L-4 and L-5 and damage at the S-1 Levels. For the next 3 years, I would suffer so much from my back, but I loved my job and also needed the money. So now, coming back to the year 2000. My arms, neck, shoulders and back was so sore. I could hardly lift up my arms anymore, but still kept on. The specialist that diagnosed me with Thoracic Outlet Syndrome told my doctor that I should get off work and give my body a rest. The same with my physio-Therapist. In late January, I got up from bed and couldn't stand up tall. I was bent over and didn't know what was going on. Went to see my doctor again, he checked me and told me that I should go and see a Chiropractor. Funny thing was, he told me when he became my doctor, that if I ever went to see a Chiropractor, that he wouldn't be my doctor anymore. I made sure that I reminded him of that. He just told me that sometimes, we do need to go and see them. I went for months and never got better. Then my doctor sent me to see a Rheumatologist. He checked me really good and saw my muscles were all getting hard, even on my wrist, down my arms, my legs and so on. He checked me for Fibromyalgia and I had it in all 18 points. Finally, my doctor sent me back to my Neurologist because I was still hunch over and had to walk fast because my legs would get numb so fast. He told me that before that before he operates on me, that he wanted to wait 3 months to see if it would place itself.  While waiting for the 3 months, my doctor told me that I should try Magneto Acupuncture.  I did, and within 3 months I was better.  I went back to see my Neurologist and told him that I did feel better but I was sore all over.  He sent me for another MRI, to make sure that my herniated disk was gone.  Results came in, and there was just a very small one, that didn't bother me at all.  Once I told him that I was also diagnosed with Fibromyalgia.  He got very upset and said that since I have Fibromyalgia and I'm sore all over, that there was no more needs to see him.  I was very hurt, but went on with my days in steady pain. Then in 2002, I had a seizure.  My husband came in the house and found me on the floor having a Grand Mal Seizure.  He was shocked and drove me to the hospital right away.  I know my town very good, but that night, I didn't recognized any roads that we took to go to the hospital.  Thank GOD, they took me in right away and the monitored me until very late that night.  After checking all the medications that I was on, they said that it was my \"Nortriptyline 150 mg\", that caused my seizure.  After a couple of years, I was so sore all over, that very often I would stay in bed for days.  My Seizure doctor had put me on Gabapentin 400 mg. 3 times a day.  I took them for about 2 years and stopped.  I just didn't like the feeling it made me feel like.  So I completely stopped taking them.  In 2005, my left arm was so sore, that I could hardly move it.  Went to see my other Neurologist who takes care of Thoracic Outlet Syndrome and I told him that I would like to have the operation, because I just couldn't hardly move anymore.  By then, I was put on Amitriptyline 150 mg.  Had my left rib removed and my arm felt so good.  Finally after so many years, it wasn't cold anymore, and not as heavy.  I was so happy.  After about a year, my neck started hurting me so much.  I could barely turn my head due to the pain.  I called my Neurologist and asked him to please remove my right rib because the pain I was getting in my neck was so bad.  Before each operation, they tested me again. So when I went to his office, the girl that did the test, went a bit crazy lol.  She told me that she had heard of people having a flat line, but never seen it herself.  So when she asked me to lift up my arm, she just told me all excited that my test had flat lined. lol. It was funny seeing her.  Having that operation in November 2006. That operation wasn't as good as the left one.  I was so sore.  (I still don't know if something went wrong, but the lung  X-Ray machine was done on me a couple of time in the recovery room.  Then, when I asked my doctor for the letter of my operation, (because with all the things my husband and I have wrong, I have a binder for each of us.  My doctor always gives me all my letters.  When I looked at it, there was something covered up with white out.  I asked my doctor why was there a word or couple of words that were covered up, and told me nothing and that's the way he got it.  I know that no doctor would send a letter with a word covered.  That still bothers me to this day.  The same month that I was operated on, my husband had a Union meeting.  I felt fine.  Our living-room was downstairs in our house, I had just finished a bowl of cereal on a TV table.  Thank GOD, I had finished eating.  When I came to, I was on the floor about 6 to 7 feet from where I was sitting on the couch.  My first thought was, \"boy, I guess I was very tired\".  Because you don't know nothing when you have a seizure.  It's just as if your world stopped for a bit, then you wake up not knowing nothing.  Anyways, when I got up from the floor, the TV table was flipped and the sugar and my bowl on the floor.  My forehead started to burn, so I went upstairs and looked in the mirror and was shocked to see that my forehead had a very bad rug burn.  My daughter-in-law came over and usually I would go right at the door to go and talk to her or tell her to come in, but not that night, I didn't want nobody to know that I had had a seizure.  The only one I told was my husband. I made my husband promise me that he wouldn't tell nobody.  The next day, my husband was calling me ever half hour.  I was fine.  When he was not even a minute away from home, he called me and said that he was only down the road.and would be home within seconds.  I told him ok, I'll start supper.  That's the last thing that I remember.  He said that when he walked in, I had a burning towel in my right hand and a butcher knife in my left.  He said that I was just turning around and around and he caught me just before I fell.  He didn't want to call nobody because I made him promise not to.  Well, when he did tell my daughter and son, they all started making him feel guilty because he didn't call the ambulance.  I had to intervene and tell them all that it was I who made him promise me not to tell nobody, because I had one the night before.  My mother was there, my kids and grandchildren.  Then I made an appointment to the doctor, because my hand was badly burnt, but the funny thing, it never hurt.  My doctor too started to yell at him, and again I told him that I made my husband promised not to tell.  I was out for 1 1/2 hours.  He said that all around my mouth was blue and my feet also.  My seizure doctor came down again and when he found out that I had taken myself off my Gabapentin, he was so upset with me.  Now, 2014, I take them steady, 3 times a day.  it took a lot of time for my right hand to heal.  After 3 months, it still wasn't healing at all, my doctor sent me to see a plastic surgeon because he thought for sure that I would need skin draff.  I didn't, he just told me to give it another 3 months.  By then, yes it felt better.  All through this my back was so bad.  In 2007 or 2008, I was downstairs in our living-room, when I went to go upstairs, I went to lift up my leg and the pain was so bad that I couldn't.  Then my husband went to lift me up to carry me upstairs, but again the pain was so bad.  I had to go up on my elbows and drag my legs.  We had 15 stairs, and I'm telling you that it felt like 50 of them.  I never went to sit downstairs after that.  Then in 2010, my husband had an appointment with my Neurologist.  I always go with him for all his appointments. When the doctor seen me, he just said \"Oh my GOD, somebody's having a very hard time walking\".  I told him \"Oh you noticed.  Now do you think that you could make time for me??\".  Yes, I was very upset with him, because I had been so sore.   He told me to get my doctor to refer me to him.  The next day, I went to see my doctor and told him about it, he was even shocked that he wanted to see me lol.  When he received the referral from my doctor, he just called me and said to go straight for an MRI.  I did.  About 10 days later, his secretary called me and said that the doctor wanted to see me.  He was very surprised.  As he's showing me my test on his laptop, he told me that they are going to start from the top of my neck.  He told me to look at the white because that's my spinal cord.  So we did.  As it's going down it turns black.  I do have a shocked face on and I ask him \"Where did it go\". Then he tells me, that's what's wrong, I really don't know how you are walking, because you have a cyst that grew around your spinal cord and it's so tightly around there, that that's why it turned completely black.  I was shocked, but not in a way, because of how I had been feeling. Within a week, I was being operated on.  After it was done, they brought me in my room and I got up and felt so good lol.  I unpacked my suitcase, the next morning when the doctor came in, I was washing my hair in the sink lol.  He looked at me and said, \"Wow, you're looking good, aren't you sore\".  I just told him \"having this operation, is nothing like the pain I was in\".  He doesn't know how long it took the cyst to start and get so big and so tight around my spinal cord.  I really wish I knew.  Did it start right after he didn't want to see me anymore???? I don't know??  Now, my right eye started to go right on the side by my temple.  Don't know what started it.  Went to see my doctor and he told me that I should go and see my Optometrist.  Made an appointment and got to see him within days.  I told him what has been going on, and that I did have an MRI from a doctor in Toronto.  They found that I had 15 white matters in round to oval shape all around the front and going a bit to the side, and that I have a lesion on the left side of my brain.  Don't know how that happened.  So my doctor told me that he's worried that I have M.S. or that I had a stroke.  So, he checked behind my eye and showed me the back of a person with M.S, which is all bumpy, thank GOD, mine wasn't.  Then he told me that he's very worried that I might of had a stroke.  Like he told me, if you have damaged on the left side of your brain, it will affect the right side.  So now, he sent me to see a new doctor that came to our town and I'm so so happy.  She is an Optometrist / Neurologist.  She has seen me and she said the same as my Optometrist told me.  Just waiting to go for my MRI on the 17th of this month (September).  I can't wait to hear what she has to say.   Sorry that this is so long, but I still didn't put everything in.  I've had so many things happening to me.  But, I would still appreciate it, if you would keep it and read it and let me know what you think ok.  Thank you so so much.  Jocelyne St Amour Log in to post a reply",
