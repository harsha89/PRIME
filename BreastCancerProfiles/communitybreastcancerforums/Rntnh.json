I had put it aside as I recovered from a heart attack and stent placement. I was focusing on becoming healthier , etc etc and neglected this area. Well I decided even though I didn't have symptoms , it was time to do it. Since this morning , I have ugly cried all day. They found a 5mm \"spot\" with a blood supply they want to biopsy. I'm scared to death. Youd think I would pull it together better being a nurse. Nope , I'm a basket case. Any words of encouragement much appreciated Log in to post a reply",
