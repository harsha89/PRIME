Has anyone else experienced this.",

Said could be from arthritis.  Not sure.  But I do have to have a biopsy on 08.28.  I attributed everything that hurt to my arthritis. Now, everything that hurts I attribute to IBC.  So scared it is because I ignored all types of symptoms.  I never did have pain in my breasts.  Now they hurt.  Don't know if my mind is playing tricks on me or what.",
