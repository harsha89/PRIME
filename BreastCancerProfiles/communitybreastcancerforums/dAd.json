In other words, if your mother's doctors feel it's necessary, there a number of avenues they may decide to pursue",

Is the cancer doctor you see every couple of months a medical oncologist or a breast surgeon who has been following you since the sarcoma?

She suggested a surgeon (one of the top BC docs in this country) so I asked her to see if he would take me. I received a call the next day from his office and had an appointment the day after that. My surgery was two weeks later. I don't know what the protocols are in the UK but isn't there any way around what seems to be an excessively rigid system? Are you too far from London to access care there somehow? Anne",
