Have to tell my daughter today, my son was with me when the onc spoke to me.  I had to state my end of life choices - at what stage do I want treatment to stop & they can let me go.  What level of quality of life do I want to stop treatment at etc. Started Halaven (Erubilin) last Tuesday & waiting for my 2nd dose to be given today. I feel empty & odd as I've never been in this situation before.  I saw the counselor yesterday & she helped me clarify my thoughts a bit more.  I don't feel as if I'm dying.  That's odd.  Thought I'd feel like I was so close to dying.  I'm pretty desperate to get out of hospital & back to my home, dogs & other loved & familiar things.

Do you have any pertinent info/advice/suggestions for improving my bone health? I'm now terrified of becoming paralysed.  I didn't have a problem with stage 4 Dx after the initial shock but this is scaring me into inaction & a great feeling of vulnerability.  Don't feel I have any controle over this although ... do we really have controle over our lives?

Had the PET suitable for that problem last Friday 4th Oct & am waiting for results. Since that 1st treatment I've just realized that I've been sleeping most of my 24 hour day & waking screaming. I didn't realize that the problem was so serious until a friend told me that she'd woken me up when calling me & I was screaming about my children (in their 30s) being kidnapped. My DD has been telling me that I've been doing this more over the past few days. She's spoken to a friend of mine who is supporting her. I'm waiting until my next appointment on Tue 8th in 2 days time. I can still walk & talk. Might this be psychiatric or a physical problem?
