I am one year out of the Onco test and I get it....the entire process from start to finish is like being in a bad dream...Just live it out...that is my advice. Waiting for that test was nearly as bad as hearing the initial news...Keep busy, enjoy the holidays w your family and keep positive. Mine was fairly good news and so we all live with this and it will get easier....you will adjust and take your life back. We are with you. What is, is...accept and do what you have to do...you will be a stronger person through it and you will receive many gifts...be open to receive them. I send you strength and peace....",

I took total control of my treatment. If you have not yet found Radiation-Canadian Method...please google it. If you live near a larger City, the docs are generally more open to helping you design your own tx plan. I had 18 rad txs instead of the usual double that amount. I did very well and 18 months out, I just received an all clear again. I hope this remains....We all seem to live from one mammogram to the next every 6 months... I am been on Femara....not ez stuff but some days are better than others. I tried the other 2 and no go... In addition to the shorter term rads, I also researched \"prone radiation.\" I had no idea such a thing existed so I went in search of the concept...If you have pendulent breasts (they are bigger and  hang when you bend forward) you are better able to have this treatment. Logically, I just knew somewhere in the world there had to be a special table that you can lay on with cut out for the affected breast. After searching far and wide, Bingo...a new table had just been purchased at a large teaching hospital close to home.  I was determined not to have my full body radiated. They are able to pin point where the tumor is as you lay on your belly and only radiate that part of the breast. It is a bit tough on your neck and lower back muscles but I was also lucky enough to have free massage at that same hospital as part of tx.  I had a technically good surgeon who was an absolute dolt. He was a good cutter, but did not explain much about the surgery--his entire practice was unprofessional. I wrote a letter after and told him exactly how I felt about the tx. It is important to do that. How else will medicine every change unless consumers say how they are treated and wish to be treated.  So, advice from this \"not so Newbee\" any longer is TAKE CONTROL of your own health care. These people are not Gods, even if they act like it sometimes. Do not be afraid to ask questions even when they are condescending. Become an expert around your own diagnosis. When things are so seemingly out of control once diagnosed...the best way to pull it back is self education and planning. You know your body and mind...you know what is best for you.  Luckily...I am a clinical therapist and college prof so I know how to research. If you do not, get help. Go to a library reference desk and ask for help or ask a close relative or friend who is computer savvy to sit w you and look up your exact diagnosis and learn best treatment for you.  Good luck to all...
