But when the doctor called me, I took it fine and since then, I have not even cried. Am I in denial? no way. I just kind of feel...like I have a lot of work ahead of me for the the next six months to a year. People around me are more upset than I am and my best friend sent me this horrible book titled \"Why Me?\" I looked at the title and said out loud, \"well why not me\" lots of women get cancer and I am brac 1 positive and five of my immediate family members had cancer. Don't worry about your response, it is, what it is. and that's ok.  ",

My sister had a very similar diagnosis and she did extremely well with radiation and chemo.  She was cancer free for seven years, had a minor set back and cancer free for three. You hang in there.  ",
