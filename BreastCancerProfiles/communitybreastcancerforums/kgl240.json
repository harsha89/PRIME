Anyway...I went back for my diagnostic mammo and the technician said, the radiologist thinks that what he is seeing, is just tissue that has thickened.  We are just concerned, as it has changed from last year...and has changed from the right breast.  Come back in 6 months...just as a precaution.  No US was done.  Actually, I was content and happy with that...and off I went to the grocery store.  A few days later, I went back to the mammo place and asked to see the written reports.  Well this is when I had the total meltdown.  I sat in the car, reading the reports.  \"Architectural distortion\"  \"Probably Benign\"  Breast is hetergenously dense.  Short interval follow up recommended.  I was also concerned because as I was reading the reports in the car, the report on the \"screening mammo\" recommended additional views and/or ultrasound.  They didn't do an US. All of this just wasn't sitting well with me.  I called my ob/gyn and asked the nurse if the doc would order an MRI.  She told me that insurance probably wouldn't cover it...and an MRI would probably come up with the same diagnosis...probably benign...follow up in 6 months.  Really???  She said to feel free to take my films, etc. to a surgeon for a second opinion. Maybe I am overreacting...but I just can't wait 6 months for another mammo...especially after googling architectural distortion.  I have an appt. with a surgeon next month.  I just need another set of eyes to look at all this.  We are supposed to go to Mexico on March 3...and I am thinking of cancelling.  My appt with the surgeon is Feb. 13th.  Thanks for allowing me to vent, on here.  I'm just so scared.  Having a hard time functioning or focusing.  I'm sorry to those of you, who actually HAVE breast cancer.  You must want to b*tch slap people like me.

The architectural distortion didn't completely resolve on the diagnostic mammo...that's why they recommended the 6 month follow up.  I'm a lot calmer, today. A close friend just got done with a year of chemo, double mastectomy...and now radiation.  That's probably why I'm so anxious.  I really do appreciate the feedback, though.  Thank you.",
