Yesterday the nurse in my primary doctor's office told me that \"things are probably fine or they would have called you already.\" This afternoon my primary told me that it's a cyst & that my gyn would tell me more.  Jule, I will return here to check on you. You are in my prayers. ",

My primary informed me that he received the mammogram results today & that we will discuss it during my annual exam. My gyn, who sent me to get the mammogram and untrasound, told me that they would get back to me with the results in seven to ten days. Overwhelmed with fear & anxiety, I have taken my gyn's 7-10  time frame as a positive sign. Have others had to wait that long when the results of a mammogram or u/s when results are of concern? Should I still be worried so that I am not blindsided by the potential results. Thank you in advance for any guidance you may be able to provide.  Log in to post a reply",
