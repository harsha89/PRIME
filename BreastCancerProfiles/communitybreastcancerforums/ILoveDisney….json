I think it's best to just have the thing out and try to remain hopeful.  My GYN told me he wasn't super worried due to no cancer or pre-cancer found during the core needle and also the appearance of the lesion.  My lesion is non-palpable and was found as an incidental finding while looking at another area that ended up being negative. ",
