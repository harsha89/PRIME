From HR very positive to barely positive so some TX didn't work very well. I was on Xeloda and it was minimal SEs. It's a pill which keeps life very manageable. I had to switch though because my new cancer had changed the receptor. So I recommend Xeloda and also a second opinion. It's need to be comfortable with your oncologist. Best wishes, Karen",
