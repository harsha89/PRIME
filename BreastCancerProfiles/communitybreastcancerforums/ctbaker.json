Now, I have been checking on the mirror my breasts every week or so, don\u2019t know if I had this shape always, since I lost weight or since when... I can notice a lot of stretch marks all over both breasts, they wrinkle also... But on the top of my left breast nipple I can see a more deeper line/ area when i raise my arms... I do have a lot of stretch marks in the area but it bothers me so much and makes me wonder if they missed something... The deal is that I got my mammogram copy and I did the worse by looking at it when i obviously don\u2019t know of the subject... I saw the scattered calcifications that they reported in the mammo but also saw a C shaped white form (easily seen because of the size, possibly the size of one of the round metal markers they put on the nipple for the mammo and you can only see it on the cc views) and you can also see it on the tomosynthesis cc image as a v or y... Like the children draw a seagull... if is easily seen, could the radiologist missed it or overseen it ? HelpPlease Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Jul 10, 2018 01:07PM - edited Jul 10, 2018 05:22PM by ctbaker After those tests, they did a biopsy on the RIGHT breast, where the suspicious mass/area. That was diagnosed as a fibroadenoma... After weeks, I guess I started to be more obsessed with checking my breasts... and now the deal i'm worried about is that the deep line/ stretch mark is in the LEFT breast (which only got a mammo and tomosynthesis images in APRIL 18') I cannot tell if the changes just happened because I wasn't that aware of my breasts before the mammogram, and I have been losing weight creating more stretch marks all over... So after I checked the images from april's mammogram/ tomosynthesis I saw in this LEFT breast images, a letter \u201cC\" or \u201cU\" white shape (line is rounded forming a C shape on the CC view only) and in the tomosynthesis CC images appear in a few of them like a seagull drawing. Thank you so much!!!",
