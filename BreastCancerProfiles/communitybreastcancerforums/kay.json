      "Content": "kay wrote: In 1995 my mom was diagnosed with bc and had a mastectomy and chemo. She has been in remission since then until 2 weeks ago. She was having pain that she thought was her sciatic nerve and went to ortho and had MRI. He then ordered petscan and she lit up in several areas. He then sent her to her onc who did bloodwork and a biopsy on her tailbone. He then met with her and told her that it was stage IV Metasis. It has spread to her lymphnodes, some small spots on her lungs, several bones in her spine, ribs, and femur. The most pain she experiences is in her femur and she has trouble getting up from a sitting position. She is going in Sat for another MRI of her legs to see if there is significant damge to the bones where she is having so much pain. Two weeks ago, I thought breat cancer was limited to the breast, so needless to say, I feel like we are in a whirlwind. I guess my question is, where do we start? I know that her onc will give us a treatment plan after the mri results and also after s test called\"Fish test\" But what questions should we be asking the onc? The terminology is overwhelming! I am trying to get familiar with it so I can help my mom ask the onc the right questions. Any suggestions from women who have been here would be greatly appreciated. Thankyou Log in to post a reply",
