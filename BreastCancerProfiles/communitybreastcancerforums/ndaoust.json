I had an episode of lymphedema a couple weeks ago.  I went for a massage and conveniently forgot to remind her not to touch my left arm.  I finally see a physical therapist tomorrow about this.  I'll let you know what I learn.  It's gotten a lot better, but today my arm is sore and tight.  Grrr... I'm mad at myself for this boo-boo! The itching I asked about went away when I remember to take my final dose of steroids.  And I have been taking Claritin or Benedryl to help with the itching as I guess it's an allergic reaction to the Taxotere.  My fingertips are really sore today, and I noticed some discoloration along all the nail beds that are growing out.  It's like a bruise, but in a line. Tonight I am going to the ACS Look Good Feel Better class.  I am taking some scarves with me so I can learn how to tie them.  I do have some hair growing back, but it's really sparse and sticks straight out since it's about 1/4 of an inch long.

Today I am a bit queasy, a bit headachy, and very tired, but I did make in into work.  My mind seems to be okay - not too fuzzy yet! Gail, that's great news!  I too was not supposed to do chemo, but my Oncotype DX test came back with a 30% risk of recurrence in the next 10 years, my tumor was 1 cm, so that put me in the category of should do chemo.  Congrats!!!

I am noticing my hair is starting to fall out.  And I also realize I am ready and not ready for that to happen.... K - I too am only having 4 treatments.  And I do find it very interesting how each doctor does things their own way.  Patricia - what an AWESOME outing you had!!  Bravo to you and your angel! I wish you all a good night. hugs, nolana",

I did some research, and the worst time after chemo with TC for the immune system is 10-17 days after - that's when you hit your nadir or lowest low.  And, as my doc explained, your immune system is still working, just not as well.  So I will keep my fingers crossed that you will not catch his flu!!! Donna - congratulations, that is WONDERFUL news!  A new life always brings hope to everyone surrounding him/her. Grannie - glad you are feeling better tonight.  :) Artsie - my eyelashes and eyebrows have thinned, but I still have some.  And I still have hair, albeit stubbles, on my head.  I wish that hair would fully fall out already!  Oh yeah - I still have to shave my legs LOL!!!

Well, I am feeling pretty okay (I only teared up twice today, no actual crying!).  I guess the steroids are kicking in.  I hope I am feeling this good tomorrow - I actually feel like a fighter and not a crybaby for once! Bridget - hang in there.  I had 3 surgeries in less than 4 weeks:  Dec 10 I had my mastectomy, and that was supposed to be it.  Then pathology found the 1 cm invasive tumor, so I had to go back under for the lymph node dissection on Jan 4.  In between, on Christmas Eve, I had emergency spinal surgery because somehow I herniated a disc and couldn't walk.  I am still numb in my right leg and have lost some use of that leg/foot, but I can walk and drive, and I am finally without back pain, so I really can't complain. Anyway, I'm telling you this because your body is incredible and strong and you have to believe in it's healing powers.  This is something I have learned over the past few weeks/months. I have packed my chemo bag:  peppermint lifesavers, ginger candy, water, pretzels, reading materials, puzzle book, a journal and my Snoopy.  People keep telling me I need to write things down and journal this part of my life.  The problem is I hate writing!  I'm taking it with my anyway, it was a gift from a co-worker after I shared my diagnosis.  Maybe I'll actually write something in it. Turns out my mom won't be coming.    She got called to jury duty today and got seated for a case that will last two weeks in argument, plus deliberation.  If she gets out early, she'll stop by (how sweet!).  So DH gets to come for the entire time.  At this moment, I am planning to have a head shaving party and invite my friends to go through this experience with me.  We'll see if I'm this brave in two weeks.  I should start losing my hair 3-4 days after my 37th birthday... definitely a birthday I won't forget anytime soon. Well, I am actually feeling like I'm coming down off the steroid high, so I think I may try to get some sleep.  Hugs to you all, and I will keep the good thoughts and vibes going out to each and every one of you. hugs, nolana",

Well, treatment 2 hit fast and hard, and I spent most of 4 days in bed.  But I also seem to be recuperating just as fast.  I have a sore mouth/throat, got some magic mouthwash for that.  Still having problems sleeping, but that's because of the leg and back pain (and my brain not shutting down).  Today I noticed my nailbeds are sore again, and the skin around the edges of my nails is dry and peeling.  For the most part, no issues eating, just a lot of heartburn/acid indigestion, but then I did have Mexican for lunch.
