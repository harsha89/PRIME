I am in the same boat: Under 40 and scared Shitttt! (36 years old) I read you are having a Core Biopsy. I just had one Wednesday morning. It really is NO Big Deal. I had it done by a radiologist. My hubs questioned that too- I saw a Breast Surgeon on Monday (2 days before the biopsy) and Hubs asked if HE could do it. The surgeon said since it is an Ultrasound Guided Core Biopsy, A Radiologist must do it. I am also Bi-Rads 4. They didn't put an A,B, or C category. I get my results tomorrow , well- Technically Today (which is why I am up still at almost 4:am). As for the biopsy- I didn't even feel the numbing needle- AT ALL! Not even a pinch! The needle was soooooo super fine thin- like baby hair. I did feel a warm sensation in my throat after- but could have been nerves. The clicks are loud. Not like a gun- but more Like a stapler. But the doctor prepared me. I didn't feel the first 2 at all- the last 4 was a little pinch. Not even enough to flinch. I didn't feel the titanium clip either. The worst part of the whole thing was having Yet Another person look and touch my Boobie. I am married to my highschool sweetheart and have been with him over half my life. 20 years actually - next month. Lol. So \"The Girlz\" have never seen this much action in my whole life! Lol Yes- this is scary. Don't let anyone tell you it isn't -except yourself. But hopefully you (and I) will make it to the 80% B9 Team. Those are really good odds. Hang in there- and PM me any time if you want to talk, vent , cry or curse the world. I will pray for you. <3",

I never had it done. I sat on it for exactly a year. My mom was having some health issues and like me, never gets her tests done. She needed a Mammogram since she is 70 and only had one 10 years ago. She said 'I will go, if you go with me\" So on Oct 18 we went together. I kept having a feeling like something bad was going to happen. I had a HUGE Lump for 5 years in my buttocks, so I finally had the surgery on oct 31. It came back benign, and I was very relieved. I got a letter on Nov 1 that my mammogram was abnormal. it suggested I have a diagnostic mammogram. It said focal Assymetry, Fibroglandular area right breast, lower inner quadrant. BiRads 0. My doctor ordered the Ultrsound.  I went to the Brest Center in my Local Hospital.  First they did a Diagnostic Mammogram.  Tech said \"You probably wont need an Ultrasound\".  She left, came back and did another set of pictures. Said I will probably need the Ultrasound. Then I waited in the Waiting room. A new tech came in and said I needed and Ultrasound.  She did the ultrasound.  Then sent me back to the waiting room.  She came back and said the Radiologist Doctor wants to do a Live View.  That means he wants to come in the room and witness / and or perform another ultrasound.  We went back in, and he came in a few min later.  He took over the U/S.  He said there is SOMETHING There. It isn't Fluid, so not a cyst. He didn't know WHAT it is. He said BUT You Are ONLY 36!! He mentioned Ductal Carinoma, and Lobular Carcinoma. But then said there are many Non Cancerous Masses. And again, I am ONLY 36. When I asked whats next, he said he was thinking of 2 things. First a \"Wait and See\" Approach where I come back every 4-6 months over the next 2-3 years. But then he said he should not put my age into the equation. If I were ANY older, he would immediately call for a Biopsy. Then he said, 'So, I recommend a biopsy\" So now I am scheduled for an Ultrasound Guided Core Biopsy on Wednesday. They will put in a titanium Clip Marker. I am now bi-Rads 4. And Scared Shitless. of biopsies are benign, but what percent of bi-Rad 4 Biopsies are benign? I know the 80% Log in to post a reply",

Thank you for the responses. I had an appointment with a Breast surgeon today as a consultation eventhough I didn't have the biopsy yet. He looked at my Mammogram- I was kinda expecting him to say \"Don't worry, Its probably Nothing\" But instead he said \"Yes, You Need to have this Biopsied!\" So I told him that the Radiologist doctor said that I am only 36, so chances are good. He said \"Age has NOTHING to do with it. You get that Biopsied\" I asked if it could be benign - He said \"There are other things it could be, including fibroadenoma\" I asked if I could have it removed reguardless of the biopsy results, and he said \"Lets get it biopsied, then we will talk.\" So, My Ultrasound guided Core Biopsy is in 2 days, on Wednesday. On another note, I found out that my Fathers Mother (Paternal Grandmother) Had Breast cancer. I never knew that. she passed away before I was born. I am told my Fathers Sister had breast cancer, or lung cancer. Not sure if it was spread from the breast or spread from the lung. She passed away in her 30's.",

Here is my issue: I finally felt good enough to feel around tonight as the swelling and soreness from the biopsy eased up a bit tonight. I feel the lump-and it is NOT where they biopsied. I understand they go in at an angle- but my lump is in the opposite direction. They did insert a clip and they did a diagnostic Mamm to make sure the clip was in the same spot as the Mamm spot- but that isn't where I feel the lump. (Looking down) they went in about 3 cm down/left diagonally from the nipple. They biopsied about 5 cm down/left diagonally from the nipple. I feel the lump about 2 cm down/left diagonally from the nipple. It feels like a little hard BB. Is it possible to have a lump that escapes mammogram And Ultrasound ? And does that mean the lump is safe since it wasn't detected? I really can NOT Wait for this to be all over with. Thanks in advance.",

Came back Fibroadenoma (that's what I was told). The tech was so nice- she did my ultrasound, assisted the doc for the biopsy and did my diagnostic mammogram after the biopsy to confirm the clip was put in the right spot. My docs office won't tell me the results over the phone, and she didn't want me to wait. So as soon as the results were in, she got permission from the Doctor (Radiologist) that performed the core biopsy and she told me over the phone. I am so excited, but I still can't shake this feeling that something is wrong. I am really tired, but after the amount of stress that I have been Under - who wouldn't be? My biggest concern is that I still feel the lump- and it is NOT where they Biopsied. They Biopsied closer to the lower inner portion on my right breast. My lump is in the same quadrant- but more centered and closer to the nipple. I would want to think that since this wasn't what they were seeing on ultrasound and mammogram, hat it SHoUlD be ok- but I just want to be sure. I have an appointment on Dec 4 with the breast surgeon. I will show him the lump I feel and also ask if he can remove the Fibroadenoma. After this kind of scare- I want to be positive about everything. Does that make any sense?",
