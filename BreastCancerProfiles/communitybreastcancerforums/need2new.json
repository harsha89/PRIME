There is an amazing amount of collective info there. If you join the moderators will usually send all the pertinent links that deal with Late Effects on treatments.   I am scheduled Jan. 19th for a BMX, hopefully skin/nipple sparing w/GAP flaps in New Orleans. I also had another late effect from radiation, a gastric leiomyosarcoma and had part of my stomach removed in Jan. 2010 and then this past Sept. 2011 a met removed from my liver. The fun never ends! Will look for you on the list, Karen ",

Most of the people are HD survivors and the info is amazing. You can find out what you need to do in terms of follow-up to stay as healthy as you can.  Many of us on the group have had beast cancer and other cancers from the radiation treatment. I am line for a BMX w/reconstruction with GAP flaps. Karen ",
