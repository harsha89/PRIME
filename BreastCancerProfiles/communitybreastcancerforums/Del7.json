If invasive means that it has the potential to invade vessels etc but that it may not have done, then I can understand that a bit better. I do get however that the biopsy is THE final test to tell me what is really going on. I was also told it was ER+ and PR+ and HER2-. The surgeon seemed very positive overall and very unexcited by my case as in ...why was I worried to death as this was early and caught before they could even feel a lump! They have no idea how I even managed to find this! The RO said I needed congratulated on finding it! So I suspect someone more powerful than me is guiding me at this time!! I shall most certainly make sure to ask for all lab results on Monday. In the meantime I am eating organic in every single thing. Cupboards were cleared of all foodstuffs the other week and I have joined the gym and getting out everyday for some form of exercise. Have also started yoga classes. My main aim is to lose weight, get healthy and de-stress. I am convinced stress is at the root of this for me. It is very helpful to have people like you who seem to be very knowledgeable about this as I get my head pretty confused by all the letters and tests and and numbers attached to everything. I think you need a PhD to be able to understand this subject!!",

I got a call from my BC nurse today to tell me that I was to go see the oncology department on Thursday about possibility of having chemo. However there are no results through even yet on my actual biopsy or SNB. My next question of course was how can you be thinking about chemo if you have not had results through...was told that it would just be good to see the doctor and find out and ask questions about this particular treatment. I got a vague feeling something was not right. Not sure if nurse had made some sort of mistake or was not too well versed on my details etc...seems strange to send me to a dept to speak about a treatment that I have not officially been told I am having yet. But maybe that is common procedure? I was initially told I would most likely be getting lumpectomy, radiotherapy and Tamoxifen. When I asked about chemo last week, my BS said he didn't know for sure til op was done and result in from that. So this call was a little distressing and upsetting. Not because I am worried about having chemo, just that this was a shock I had not been prepared for fully. ",

So can I ask then, would this come up during the biopsy pathology report or the pathology report AFTER surgery? I am confused as when I was diagnosed a few weeks back, I was told that it had not gone into lymph nodes and was not invading any breast tissue. I am not sure how they would be able to say this when all they had was mammo, biopsy and U/S results. Maybe I am wrong?",

I decided at the start to use the Paxman Cold Cap machne which is what we use over here in the UK. It was very cold indeed and can be a little uncomfortable but for me it worked a treat. Still to this day, I have friends and family who are still not aware I have had any treatment at all! My hair was pretty thick to start with, so if you have very thin hair, you may not get a very good result but if your hair is reasonably thick, then do it. 1. Cut hair before you start treatment. Cut it to just tidy it up as once treatment starts you won't want any hairdressers touching it or washing it etc. It becomes a very serious matter and only YOU are allowed to touch that hair!!! 2. Wash hair only once every 10ish days. Use a mild shampoo and I used a keratin based conditioner to help keep it nourished. 3. Pat dry with towels and dry on very low heat with hair dryer or if you can at all, let it dry naturally. 4. Buy a tangle teazer hairbrush. It is fabulous for chemo hair. You can buy on Amazon. 5. You will get your first shedding of hair at around day 16, but it will be a ball of light hairs, almost like a tumbleweed and then if all goes well you won't get any more big sheds at all but will just gradually lose bits here and there. 6. I lost about half of my hair - but again remember I had thick hair. 7. On th days you go to the hospital, ask them to give you a sedative to calm you down. I found this helped me with the freezing temperature. I only asked for this tablet at chemo number 4 and 5 and so did the first 3 without any pills but ask them. The sedative made my head appear to be warmer than it was! 8. Take a woolly hat with you, as your hair will be wet when you go home. 9. Grey hair is a horror - so buy 'Cover My Grey'. It is a powder like an eyeshadow that you brush onto your gray and it does not agitate the hair although it does make it fairly dry. I swear by this product and could not have gone out without it. It cost about $15. If you want I can send photos to you of my hair during the different stages....as I say, I have people who are not even aware I have had chemo. That's how normal I look. 10. For eyebrows, I have great videos for you:  This pen is utterly amazing and looks so natural - but you will find that cold capping also helps save most of the eyebrows too. 11. Eyelashes - I boughts fakes. Very easy to apply. Any qns - just ask",

I bought a very expensive shampoo and conditioner by Philip Kingsley on Amazon that is suggested for chemically damaged hair, I read somewhere lots of chemo patients use this. But really in all honesty, don;t go spending a fortune. Just buy a cheap baby shampoo and then maybe an organic conditioner (Burt's Bees was suggested to me by my ward nurse). Makeup is something you will gradually get to figure out. But I did a lot of stuff to make myself feel better. I used Estee Lauder foundation cream for base and then used my normal makeup. The only thing I eventually had to really pay attention to was the eyebrows and lashes. My lashed did not come out til the very very end, but I have to say they have grown back in within a couple of week. again, I think it's because CC helps preserve the hair on the entire head. My brows were similar. They came out a bit but not completely and so I bought a brow shadow (as she does in video) and applied a very light brush over eyebrow line and then used my dollywink pen to fill in the rest. My advice is to use a good moisturizer during chemo and exfoliate face once or twice a week. The nails can present a problem for some depending on the chemo you are using. I used to use t-tree oil (off Amazon again) and rub into the nails and then apply BLACK nail polish to the nails. It is something to do with some chemos (mostly the taxanes) attracting light or something...and so if you cover the nails in black nail varnish they won't hurt or fall off. My nails were absolutely fine throughout the whole thing, but then I was not on a taxane. Also keep nails nice and short too. Finally, depending on how you are getting your chemo administered...if you are having it given through a vein, you might find that your veins start to feel a little tender. I researched that rubbing sesame oil into the arm and massaging this in for a good 10 mins or so, helps reduce the pain. It is because sesame oil is an anti-inflammatory. I did this regularly and have to say that my veins got better. I am a big believer in keeping hair as long as you can as it allows you to put up in pontytail and hide any thin patches. Also you can do Donald Trump combovers. So have a few hair scrunchies around. DD, ",
