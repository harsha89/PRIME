      "Content": "Luckylee wrote: hi all I had my first stereotactic biopsy yesterday. Hurt like the dickens! This is one month since original mammo. I was called back for diagnostic and ultrasound right side. This has happened before since I have dense tissue but gyn said this is a diff area. Radiologist said she didn't like the looks of the cyst and wanted a biopsy. And while they're at it they'd biopsy the area they've been monitoring the past few years (architectural distortion they say). So we schedule the consult with Surgeon who can tell me nothing for certain. I picked up my report birads4. It was not further broken down to a b or c. So yest they did 2 incisions during stereotactic. He said it was very difficult to do because I'm so small breasted and the nodule is at my chest wall. No word of suspicion of cancer or not. The nurses told me path results take about 3 days but dr wants follow up in 2 weeks. I'm planning to call Monday but am dealing with all the what ifs right now! Also thinking to change drs because I was not too happy with the whole ordeal so far. Too long to explain but not sure if i can switch now before results or after? Log in to post a reply",

I hand picked him because he did my mom's surgery. But he seems uninterested and detached like this is no big deal. It is to me. My husband is also in a jealous rage over the dr being male (his crazy insane insecurities) so that adds to my wish to switch. He is distancing himself from me thru all this. It's crazy to be worried about the biopsy and then worried about the marriage. I have found great info on these boards and reassurance I am not the only one with these wild worries and unsupportive husband to add to it. Thanks again.",

Was disappointed to call orig dr today to find out he's had the results, signed the report already but no call to me. I wonder how long it would've taken them to call? I told the recep I'm switching drs and I'll have the report and follow up visit with that person. She said fine. As for husband. This insane jealous behavior is out of character for him. I think he's scared and not used to me losing my control. I have been a mess lately. I believe his real issue with this dr is that at our consult appt the dr did not acknowledge him at all. Later is when the jealousy comments came out. He has always had some jealousy but never to this extreme especially over a dr. It is something I will never forget. But right now I am focuse on getting these results!",

Feeling so relieved to have found her and regretful that I didn't check her out before picking the other surgeon so quickly. More mammos and ultrasound next month to determine need for removal. Plus keep an eye on a funny looking cyst. For now I will enjoy this moment!",
