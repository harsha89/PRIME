Anyway, I had my first TCH tx last Friday. I haven't felt too sick, but I haven't felt too great either. The nausea didn't get too bad but the constipation, cramping and diarrhea have been a problem. My stomach is so bloated all I can wear are my husband's sweatpants. I know chemo can cause weight gain, but I didn't think it would be so immediate.  Also, I'm getting mouth sores even though I've been rinsing with the Biotene. I read about the liquid maalox/liquid benadryl mix, but when I went to the store to pick up the liquid benadryl, I found out it had been recalled, and there were no generic versions on the shelf. Does anyone know of any alternatives? I ordered a wig on Saturday. I also got my hair cut really short. It is not very flattering, so I don't think I'll mind so much when it falls out. It sounds like some of you are having a really difficult time, and my heart goes out to you. Sometimes I think we are getting the  the message from the media that we are supposed to be pink ribbon warriors fighting with all our might against the enemy cancer, and some of us feel guilty for having  days where we feel sick and scared and angry instead of brave and positive. Does anyone else feel like this?  ",

Also, if the results are negative, it can give you some peace of mind.   Today I finally feel like myself again. The mouth sores are all gone and I can eat again and I don't have that chemical taste anymore. This is day 13 and my next chemo is a week from Friday. I'm hoping I'm not going to be sick for two out of every three week cycle. My mail just came and I received my free Gaila Fund hat/scarf whatever is is. It's really nice. I recommend that any of you who haven't yet ordered one go to their website. These normally cost $75 and are very good quality. I also got a couple of hats from Headcovers.com, and they are really cute. ",

It removes all of the loose prickly hairs and I don't feel itchy. What I hate is that I have these sideburns that are not going anywhere while the rest of my hair is almost gone. They stick out of the wig and other headcoverings, and it is not a great look.

Today I went to the grocery store and I wore a heavy winter hat because it is 8 degrees out, but after 15 minutes at the store I was so hot I thought I would faint, and I wanted more than anything to tear that hat off.

Apparently, they sometimes get clogged and she had to put something in that cleaned it out but took an hour and a half to do so. In the meantime, they stuck an IV in my hand for the herceptin.  JulieH - The onc said that people who get a lot of cold sores tend to have more problems with mouth sores when getting chemo, so hopefully the antiviral will help. I also have the magic mouthwash and biotene rinse. I can't stand gargling with salt water either. Thanks for the suggestion of the biotene gel.

I just got back from driving my daughter from Chicago back to her school in Omaha because she missed her flight yesterday (long story). I usually don't mind driving long distances but was a little worried I might get too tired this time; however, I was fine. I did have an episode of chemo brain, though. Last night I checked into my hotel and then went out for dinner with DD. After I dropped her at her place, I went back to the hotel. I could not get the door to my room open, even though I knew I had the right room number because I had written it down. I went to the front desk and told the clerk that my keycard was not working.  She looked at me kind of funny and told me it was because this was the Holiday Inn and my keycard was for the Candlewood Suites next door.  I was one very red-faced bald lady! In my defense though, the two hotels did have very similar interiors. MaryMeg, I thought about you when I saw the news about the earthquake. I'm very glad to hear you and your family are okay. Regarding the carboplatin, I'm on TCH and for what it's worth, though my first treatment was a little rough, after the second I just had a few days of nausea and have been fine ever since. My third tx is the day after tomorrow, so I hope it will be as easy. Amelia - I agree with everyone else who is telling you to go to Hawaii, especially if your oncologists approve it. I can't think of a more relaxing place.",

Anniemomofthree - I am also on TCH and my onc said something about lowering the next dose because of the SEs I had with the first. He says it is normal to adjust the dose after the first treatment. ck-mama - It sounds horrible getting stuck like that in the storm after you have just had surgery. You must be in pretty good shape to be able to push the car and walk all that way. My DH and I lived in Baltimore for a couple years when we were first married, and being from Chicago, we were amazed at how just a couple of inches of snow could shut down the city, because they didn't have the equipment to salt the roads or clear the snow. I can't even imagine how it is there with these mega-snows that have been hitting the area for the last few years.  Sciencegirl - I'm with you on feeling like I'm on a weight roller coaster. I think it has to do with the constipation,too. My weight has been varying by as much as five pounds from day to day. I had my third Herceptin infusion today. I didn't have any problems and I'm feeling pretty good right now.",

The trick is to highlight and save your text to the clipboard (control + C) before you go back, then paste it (Control + V) into the text box when you are ready to start typing again. At least that is what I have been doing. Someone else may know of a better way. Today my hair started falling out. I woke up and there was a bunch of hair on my pillow. So far it is just coming off the top of my head, so I have a small bald spot. Even though I knew this was coming (it is day 15) there is a difference between knowing it is going to happen and actually seeing it happen. I'm a little freaked out right now. We are going out for dinner with friends tonight, and I'm wondering if I will have to wear a hat or scarf. ",

I was very touched by the way my family and friends have rallied around me. I've talked to my brothers more in the last few months than we talked in the last 10 years. My son calls me from college every few days to check on me and tell me he loves me, which I probably hadn't heard from him since he was 5.  The biggest positive, though, has been with my daughter. Two years ago, at the age of 16, she became Every Parent's Nightmare. Drugs, drinking, staying out all night, shop-lifting, ditching classes. We went though a year of hell with her, and when it got to the point where we discovered she could no longer get through the day without smoking weed, that she smoked it before school, during school, after school. She also had a new boyfriend who turned out to be a heroin addict and drug dealer.   We realized last January that we had to send her away, first to a wilderness program and then to a therapeutic boarding school. For the first 10 months she was angry and very hostile to us when we visited. She ran away once when I was supposed to meet her at the airport and take her to her new school. That was the longest two days of my life until the police found her. She kept threatening she would walk out when she turned 18, which was last October. We ended up transfering her to a residential treatment center in in a state  where the age of majority is 19. When we went to visit her there on her birthday, she screamed at us that she hated us and was never going to have anything to do with us again. She refused to talk to us on the phone. When I was diagnosed in November I wanted to visit the school to tell her, but her therapist recommended against it. She was afraid for me because she didn't know how DD would react and it might be nasty. I ended up telling her in a letter which her therapist read with her. That night DD called me crying and told me she loved me and was so sorry for everything she put me through. She blamed herself for my cancer and promised she was going to really start working hard to show she still wanted to be part of the family. Since that day there has been a remarkable turnaround in her behavior. We talk almost every day, and I had a great visit with her right before I started treatment. She got her GED and is now taking community college courses online. Her therapist says she really is a new person. It looks like she will be coming home in the spring, and I am looking forward to having her here. I don't know what would have happened if i hadn't gotten cancer. Maybe she would have turned around eventually, but it's hard to say.  Her best friend started using heroin after we sent DD away, and I just found out she is now missing and thought to be living on the streets somewhere. That so easily could have been my daughter. Life can take strange turns, sometimes, so if going though breast cancer is going to bring me my daughter back, so be it. ",

Sherry -While I agree with the others that your daughter should know about your cancer, you also have to protect yourself. I think my DDs therapist had the right idea when she suggested the letter. We really had no idea how DD would react. In my worst imaginings I pictured her saying she hoped I would die. I wrote her a very short, simple letter, telling her I had breast cancer, that the prognosis was good and that I really hoped she would be able to give me her love and support. Fortunately, she came around, and hopefully your daughter will, too, but you have to be prepared for the worst. That is why a letter or having a close family member tell her are both good options while avoiding a confrontation that you just don't need right now. I really pray it goes well for you. Tidenott - Love the Jimmy Buffet quote! I hope everyone else is doing well today. Wendi",

Like several of you, I felt worse after my 2nd treatment Friday. The nausea was pretty bad and I pretty much slept the whole weekend. The good news is that today I am starting to feel much better. Last time the SEs didn't start until the 3rd day and lasted almost two weeks. Last time, though, I didn't get the Neulasta shot until a week later, when my wbc had already plunged and I'd developed mouth sores. Hopefully, this time I will avoid all that. {{{Hugs}}} to all of you who are having a rough time right now. It does help that we are all going through this together.  I am wearing my wig right now and trying to get used to it, but scarves are much more comfortable. I have a bumpy head that does not look good bald. I swear my dog keeps doing double-takes when she sees me because my head looks different all the time. ",

As women, our first instinct is to try to make our family and friends feel better, even if it means downplaying our own distress and putting on a pretend happy face. This can get very exhausting, though. Even if the prognosis is good, we are still facing a frightening disease and going through difficult treatments with many scary side effects. You are definitely entitled to these feelings. That is why support groups and forums like these are so important; they let us rant and cry among people who understand just what we are going through. ",

      "Content": "webu wrote: Hi everybody. I was recently diagnosed and I am scheduled for a lumpectomy this coming Monday. I had an abdominal CT scan last week which showed an enlarged gallbladder. I then had an MRI of the abdomen which shows that the gallbladder is grossly distended and that there is a large stone blocking drainage. My BS (who only does breasts) sent me to a general surgeon who thinks the gall bladder should come out. She said it is clearly palpable and has probably been slowly getting larger for a while now.  I have had problems with bloating, constipation and indigestion for several years. I was always told it was \"irritable bowel syndrome\" and there was nothing much I could do about it except try relaxation exercises. My internist never mentioned gallbladder disease, even though it always hurt when she poked that area. I guess I should have been a little more assertive before, because this is the last thing I want to deal with right now. The two surgeons have spoken and agreed that after the one completes the breast surgery on Monday, the other one will come in and remove the gallbladder. She is pretty sure she can do this laparoscopically, but she says there is always the chance she won't be able to get all of it and will have to cut me open. The surgeons agree that I'm better off having one surgery then having to come back a week or two later to take care of the gallbladder. They say the gallbladder definitely has to come out before I start chemo. I wish I had more time to decide. On the one hand, I hate the thought of going through 2 separate surgeries within a few weeks; on the other hand I'm guessing that having both procedures plus the lymph node biopsy at the same time is going to be hard on my body and will mean a more difficult recovery. I can't believe this is all happening.  Lumpectomy 12/6/11; TCH x 6, weekly Herceptin during chemo and then every three weeks for a total of twelve months - start date 1/14/11 - chemo will be followed by rads Dx 11/12/2010, IDC, 2cm, Stage II, Grade 3, 0/5 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
