It was not nearly as bad as I feared. The time leading up to it was the worst. When I woke up I was not in pain, my stomach felt just a bit achy. I had quite a long scar but it healed up nicely. I was up and walking the next day but the recovery time was about 5 weeks until I was back to my normal self. I could not lift anything for several weeks.  The only bad experience I had was my husband accidently tripped and his arm fell down on my stomach while I was laying on the bed 4 days after surgery and the pain was so intense I thought I was going to faint. Other than that if someone told me I had to do it all over again I could. It was not a terrible experience. I scared myself silly reading horror stories before but the technology we have now a days it was not bad at all. One thing I would suggest though is if you are on pain meds now tell the nurse thats the pain meds you want because they will give them to you before surgery. I am on hydromorphone and sticking with those meds at surgery helped. The last thing you want is to wake up sick because they gave you meds that you are not used to. If you are not on pain meds I would suggest hydromorphone and NOT morphine. ",
