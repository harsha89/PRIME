She's obviously someone who is happy in her own skin which is something I aspire to. :) I appreciate any sites I can research and appreciated the thread suggestions. (I didn't actually read the thread rules and wasn't sure if you were allowed to talk about specific Dr.s.) :) Nomatterwhat. I'm so with you there! I have a BCBS Traditional plan in PA and was told by my Ins. that if a Dr. in another state participates with his local BCBS, they're considered in network...so that will probably be the first thing I check in my search. Then once I know specifically what I want done, I'll make sure of what I'm financially responsible for. There are some Dr.s that say they \"accept your Ins.\" but aren't actually \"in network\" leaving you holding the bag for any price differences, which I can't afford...so thank you for the reminder.",

I look forward to learning more from Dr. Camal, but in the meantime a lot of women have been generous with their mastectomy stories and as much as I'd like to have everything done in one surgery...at least I know that a scar or dog ear revision down the road would only take a couple weeks to recover from and not be nearly as involved as the mastectomies themselves. So that's a relief too. :) I don't see the Dr. until April 1 but I'll be sure to keep you posted on my progress. :)",

I may still need a team that has one, but I'll now also be open to just an experienced BS. I'm going to try researching BSs and maybe breast centers and teams. I'm also going to point blank ask this current PS for some before and after images of other flats he's done. :) Is there a site or page that show's recommended Dr.s by geography? I'm in North East PA, so NJ and NY are also options. Thanks Glennie 19. I'll try mastectomy tattoo for images too. I know I need to see images of larger women so I have a realistic expectation of results. It's hard to find images of anything other than straight line scars, so I think this should become an up front question when I speak to potential surgeons. I agree Ariom, that reconstruction isn't a right or wrong issue, but simply an individual preference. I know, for me, that a sorta kinda, almost like breast that doesn't have the nipple sensation as before would only make me homesick for what I lost. I also know that an angry scar would make me feel like I was being punished. You ladies are invaluable in your encouragement not to accommodate my surgeon, but to keep looking until I find one that can accommodate me. Thanks again! :)    ",

Thanks to so many responses here and at the Flat and Fabulous Facebook page, I've come to understand that there are many surgery considerations, depending on how much needs to be removed, and how much there is to remove and if there are future cancer treatment considerations. Since I'm a \"G\" cup there is a much higher dog ear potential. When first researching my BMX I couldn't understand why, if a PS could do a breast reduction and make it nice looking all in one surgery, or follow a mastectomy immediately with a reconstruction, they couldn't just help make the mastectomy scar flat and even. I didn't realize how much healing needs to take place after a mastectomy and how that healing process can create additional bumps, and dog ears, or that reconstruction wasn't really as easy as they presented it to be. :) What actually surprised me the most was hearing from so many women that their Dr.s acted like going flat wasn't natural, right or healthy. I thought it was just that I was from a small town. It saddened me greatly to read that less than 10 years ago some women were actually told they had to take a psychological evaluation before being approved by insurance for a mastectomy no reconstruction, or even today Dr.s ignored their flat request because they thought the patient should have extra skin left behind in case they change their mind. I've also learned that even with the best of Dr.s you can have \"little barbie boobs\" at the center end of Masectomy scars, \"Pit tits\" or \"dog ears\" at the other end, and or bumps and dents anywhere from fluid that can build up after surgery. Having seen photos of just after surgery scars; after healing bumps scar tits and dog ears; and seeing the results of revision surgery; I've learned a great lesson from you ladies. Be up front with your Dr.; don't keep one with no understanding or experience in the kind of surgery you want; and once you have a good one you'll know that they will get you as close to the result you want as possible; and it's OK if that may include a revision down the road. :) Thank you for sharing your insights! <3",

      "Content": "Jan 20, 2015 11:25PM - edited Jan 20, 2015 11:31PM by Susan303 Thank you so much ladies! I really felt like I was from another planet, and thought I'd be lucky if maybe one person responded.....so what a pleasant surprise! I have seen both sights breastfree.org and flat and fabulous sites, but it's hard to find images of larger women going flat to show my Dr.s. I was going to instant message \"Sara\" from F & F on facebook but I chickened out. :) Arion I was hugely encouraged by the fact that your surgeon does 99% flat surgery. My general surgeon is a lady I respect as she removed a lunchbox size tumor from my husband's stomach and she works with this plastic surgeon who is well qualified in reconstruction but unlike Arion's Dr., I feel he's willing to make an exception to do the same reconstruction anchor cut on me just without an implant/expander he usually adds in as the first stage of reconstruction or in breast reduction. I get that a Dr. should do what they know best, but I think I may need to get a second opinion from a breast team that has actually already done what I want. It's just that if I go to any plastic surgeon sites (Other that sites for Female to Male transgender \"Top surgery\") I can't find Any that list flat reconstruction as an option. It's like I can't find the right words to put in the Google search command. I am very lucky that I have time to research...I don't know how to reply to all of you but just knowing you are there and understand is a huge weight off my shoulders. So many thanks. And Arion, thanks for telling me about your dog ears. I'm glad to know that even if they appear they can be dealt with in a much less complicated follow-up visit. And thank you for your good cheer...your destination revision party sounds great! :)",

I'm curious if there are other scar patterns available. I've read about the 2 straight lines that are I believe brought together as one line for large breasts. I've seen a \"D\" cut that's also brought to one line. I've seen the \"wise pattern cut\" that is used in large breasts reductions leaving an anchor shaped scar <--but I've not seen this on a flat person. Any information in this information void is appreciated greatly! As for tattoos, I have to laugh to share. I have one. My 2 grown daughters insisted that we get a tattoo together, so I said OK but I'm setting the parameters. 1. We all have to get the same tattoo. (we chose a heart) 2. It must be placed in the same location. (we chose the top of our left shoulders.) and 3. It can't be larger than an eraser head. :) So I bought a $60 family birthmark and two weeks later the center of mine fell out. It still looks like a heart, but when I showed it to a friend at church, she said it looked like a melanoma....to which I said \"I need younger friends!\" :)",
