I haven't been posting as much either...since the weather's been pleasant I spend most of my time out of doors... PORT UPDATE:  My port has been very painful since my last chemo...  I have to shield it the shower and guard it against, animals, kids etc.   I called my onocologist on Friday night and told him that even though I think I have a high tolerance of pain...I couldn't stand the thought of them touching my port.  He said it could be resting on a nerve which happened to another of his patients just recently.  So today I go see him have x-rays taken and we'll go from there.  I'm just hoping they don't have to go back in to reposition it...but alas, I'm not sure what my choices will be... I do think about you all...and keep this thread in my prayers...hope everyone has a good day. Janet",
