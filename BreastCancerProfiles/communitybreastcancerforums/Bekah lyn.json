I have no idea what it is or if it's serious enough to go see a doctor. I've only noticed it since yesterday so I don't know how long it's been there or if it will even stay. I'm only 19 so I realize that there's a very very extremely low chance that it could be breast cancer but nonetheless it's a little worrying.Â  Log in to post a reply",
