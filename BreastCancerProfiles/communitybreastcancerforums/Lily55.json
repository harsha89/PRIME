Best advice is to take your time on decision making and never make a decision based primarily on fear......trust yourself......some  women in your shoes have taken tamoxifen or aromastase inhibitors before doing any other treatment as this can have a very positive outcome but I am just sharing the info with you not recomending it.  Its horrible waiting for treatment plans isn´t it..

ILC tends to be very hormone dependent so that is an easier to manage systemic option than chemo should you decide on that route........also it is really important that you appreciate that right now you truly ARE at the worst possible stage as you are missing lots of information, missing the treatment plan and thus you are filling in gaps in your mind that are probably a lot worse than reality ever could be......I know its hard to believe but this IS the worst time emotionally........glad you are here.....take care......xx",

My understanding is that liver mets does not mean its an aggressive cancer, more that its a common place for bc to migrate to............. I hope this does not upset you but I do believe that what we think can affect the cells in our body so wonder if you can maybe find a way to do some visualisations during Taxol, to help with the zapping of cells you don´t want?

I finished radiotherapy in September 2012 so nearly 3 years ago. I had huge pressure on that side and could not expand my chest or lung, felt awful for weeks, in the end went to the doctor, had CAT scan showed nothing, but listening to my chest meant I was diagnosed with a pneumonia type infection on that one side only! Have taken antibiotics and am now on my second type of steroid inhaler. Even the doctor comments that side is the most affected and hardly anything on the \"good\" side...... So I am wondering if this is down to radiotherapy, have never had anything like this before but I can feel the huge difference between one side and the other.........and symptoms show that too.........

If she chooses chemo it heeds to be done in conjunction with her dialysis centre and would need to be a weaker strength. If the cancer is hormone positive then she may do very well on hormone blockers without chemo. There are many stage four women on this forumtaking hormone   blockers only. ",

If you are hormone positive you could ask about starting anti hormonals now, no its not standard protocol  but its not dangerous either, and its a systemic treatment......... I hate the way Oncologists scare monger and almost bully.........one of mine was so involved in protocol he did not even look at me once in my first consultation!!!!  He just wanted to process me, so please don´t forget that you also have some innate wisdom and know your own body  ...... Be careful with natural remedies and chemo as you need to investigate which are safe to use as  some counteract the effectiveness of chemo!",

I have no regrets, I did what was right for me at that time and would do the same again. There are no guarantees, friends who had chemo and were diagnosed same time as me with very similar cancers have died, I am still well. I have struggled a lot with anti hormonals, letrozole and anastrozole both increased my cholesterol by 25% but Aromasin does not do so. Maybe you could ask to start with that? I am back on it after taking a long break due to awful side effects, and I take a natural anti inflammatory which does help with joint pain as I cannot take normal anti inflammatories.......

I took weeks to make my decision as I had surgery first but I know without any doubt I made the right decision for me.  What no one tells you is that chemo cannot kill cancer stem cells and it is these that create all metastases.............what chemo does is kill all cells in your body, healthy and cancer ones but not the stem cells.   That is why there are hormone treatments and Herceptin over long periods of time, that changed survivabiloity. There are also proven natural compounds that help (like sulfurophanes from broccoli, turmeric, arteminisin,  etc) prevent stem cells from getting their own blood supply as well as boosting your own immune function.   We have more power over cancer than we believe - go to Youtube and look at the very powerful  video of our own immune cells killing cervical cancer cells, we do this to all types of cancer cells if we have the resources to do so, and often a mixture of conventional and naturopathic treatment  provide us with the strongest resources. ",

It is the doctor who decides which is the best kind of biopsy based on your tests so far......is there a Mexican or californian cancer organisation or registry that may list names of breast surgeons you can look up.......? Findings do not definitely look like cancer but could be cancer. The radiologist is concerned enough to recommend a biopsy. The findings in this category can have a wide range of suspicion levels. For this reason, some doctors divide this category further: Not all doctors use these subcategories. The findings look like cancer and have a high chance (at least 95%) of being cancer. Biopsy is very strongly recommended. Hope this helps.......",

I had a unilateral mastectomy in 2012, was refused reconstruction, BUT have to tell you that exercising by stretching your arm up even when it hurts like hell under your armpit really works. I have almost total movement and did have early on as I was determined not to lose anything more than I had, despite having 14 lymph nodes removed.......its actually the node removal that limits movement more than mastectomy. Did they remove some of your nodes too? I found that far more physically painful than losing a breast............ In your case you need to exercise one side at a time. Take painkillers first say one hour before and then do the crawling up the wall or door frame with your fingers to as high as you can go, several times a day....................even now 3 years on if I stop stretching my arm and shoulder it all tightens up............... I won´t go in to all my details but I had a massive infection after a fat transfer and was left with a lot of scar tissue and a concave pigeon type chest especially over the scar, but despite having an infection that nearly killed me I have had two fat transfers since and that sunken look and pigeon bulges in other places has completely gone. I am still flat on one side but that is because of the inhumane system in the country I live in.............so there IS hope, you will not be pigeon chested.......you have swelling still......hang in there and do all you can do right now which is make sure you exercise both arms and shoulders.............. It IS horrible, my heart goes out to you, big hugs................",

Waiting IS the very worst time of all, it really messes with your head and emotions but this could be anything, your providers are doing the right thing in my humble opinion as you need a definitive diagnosis of what is going on.

I don´t have a choice of Oncologist, or hospital or centre as its a public free service here....... I was told I would go on targeted therapy but when I sent to the medical oncologist appointment she told me there were no targets......BIOPSY REPORT SAYS THIS IHQ was done GATA 3. CKAE1/AE3 and CK7 positive (but what are these?) Oestrogen - positive but 5 to 8% and not enough to make a big enough target against the extensive mets I have Progesterone and Her2 - both NEGATIVE METASTASES - Shattered vertebra on T9 Fractured T 5 and T6 Multiple skeletal areas. Right parietal temporal bone in head Dorsal column, multiple anterior and posterior costal arches of ribs, right and left, Sacro iliac joints, both iliac bones and the proximal extreme of both femurs.. I can feel my ribs clicking against each other at times and hear it too and I have seen the scan.......I cannot actually be without the corset as there are too manty weak links and I am in more pain within ten minutes, even when seated..... I don´t think hormones are going to cut it against all this activity but was hoping for targeted therapy......this has all happened so fast I have not had time to assimilate it but my instinct is I do need some treatment fast.....I had radiotherapy and that helped but there are too many mets too close together to be able to do more of that right now i am shocked there was this much going on and no one knew..... I did add my Stage 4 diagnosis but its not showing on my info.....what could I have done wrong for it not to show?  ",

It is your life and body and you have to live with the consequences of your decision so do be guided by what will give you most peace of mind.  as your husband is so anti rads you need to factor in the stress his opposition might cause you so maybe a balance sheet of pros and cons for you would help?  Given that you are DCIS you do have flexibility in your choices and I do have to say that the risk recurrence you were given seems high to me for DCIS alone.  ",

He said I should take nothing for at least a month (I had taken letrozole for almost a year before I gave up) and then try taking Aromasin.  So I did that and here I am 4 years on.  I actually waited more than a month and then I took a natural anti inflammatory for a month first and I still take that anti inflammatory (boswellia serrata) every day and have far fewer side effects.  I also make sure I exercise as not exercising makes me worse, ven if it is just a walk and I am trying to lose a stubborn 14 lbs that puts me just over the border in to overweight on my BMI (although I only need to lose 4lbs to get in to normal range). Please ask your Doctor if you can change to another one...........they all have side effects but one of them will suit you more than the others, exercise regularly, take Omega 3 and try and lose any excessive weight as all will help you........but I know it is not easy.",

I have only had 3 sessions of TAxol,,,I don´t know how or when they will know if its working......I think it is doing something as I am getting a lot of pain afterwards....... Where I live there is no choice of oncologist,,,,,I cannot change the hospital or the doctor treating me.......today I feel angry that they had such a negative attitude to me.....I have a week off now and am spending it thinking of what i might be able to do..........and whether I am going to carry on with treatment.....someone said just count each one as a success ....

But everyone´s situation is different and although its scary you do have time to make decisions rather than rushing in then regretting it",
