I told the doctor that and after being shocked by my saying that she told me she wasn't surprised either. I don't know any details other than that I will be contacted again tomorrow morning to set up an appointment with a breast surgeon. I'm supposed to go on vacation next week and want to believe that is still going to be OK. With you for the long haul....
