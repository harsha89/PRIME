      "Content": "CHST wrote: My wife was diagnosed with breast cancer just over a month ago and has subsequently had two operations (lumpectomy and SNLD, followed by ALND) and we are now faced with treatment plan decisions.   I was therefore wondering if anyone has been diagnosed with a similar cancer to my wife (age 34, grade I/II, 1.7cm, ER+, Pr+, Her2-, 1/15 nodes, IDC) and has any advice on fertility considerations before we embark on the treatment plan. We are lucky to have a 10 month old boy, though were planning on having more children. We have just been to see the oncologist (unfortunately he was short of time to answer all our questions and concerns) who does not recommend IVF (due to the 7-8 week delay on staring chemo, the increased oestrogen need during IVF and success rates of IVF) and has suggested the following plan:  - Zoladex  - 6 cycles of chemo (FEC x 3 + TAC x 3) - 5 weeks radiotherapy - Followed by Tamoxifen for 2-5 years Any advice or shared experiences would be much appreciated! Many thanks, Chris Dx 5/6/2008, IDC, 1cm, Stage II, Grade 1, 1/15 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
