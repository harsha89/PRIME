While we may really love our primary care docs and OB/GYNs, they just don't have the expertise that a dedicated breast surgeon/breast center specialist has. My mom had BC, diagnosed at the age of 60. She opted for a radical mastectomy, had no more treatment or any reconstruction, and passed in 2009 at the age of 88, still no evidence of any more cancer. Me? In the back of my mind, I always wondered when my turn would come. I had heavy, droopy, dense fibrocystic breasts, full of lumps, yet every year when the mammogram came back negative (\"Congratulations! Your recent mammogram showed no evidence of cancer!\" read the postcard I would receive every year.) I begged my PCP for an MRI, or at least an ultrasound, and his answer was always \"Those are not screening tools.\" Fast forward to September 2011. I was sitting at the table eating breakfast when my nightgown felt wet. I looked down and saw two large bloodstains. My left nipple was bleeding. Well, THAT got the docs attention, and two days later I was in the breast surgeon's office. She reassured me that it was probably just a papilloma, but to be on the safe side, she'd order some other tests. My radiologist was awesome. She was like a pitbull, determined to find anything hiding in all that dense tissue. The ductogram was not exactly successful. First, we could not express any discharge. (It was dark reddish brown.) Then we got a little, and the cannula would not go in all the way. She kept trying and apologizing, and I laughed, because surprisingly it didn't hurt. Finally she got a bit of dye in, taped the cannula down, and rushed me over to the mammo machine. Well, THAT worked in expressing the discharge - I bled all over the machine. I went on to have seven diagnostic procedures in all. What they found in the beginning was DCIS - ductal carcinoma in situ - meaning abnormal cells that were completely contained within the duct. The ultrasound-guided core needle biopsies, though, found two micro-invasions of IDC, or invasive ductal cancer. I was very fortunate. It was caught early, and the invasive parts were very tiny. I had a bilateral mastectomy, only because of my age (60 - the same age as Mom when she was dx'd) and because the radiologist suspected there may be more in the right breast. There was no lymph node involvement, and all the margins were clear. I did not need chemo or radiation. I had my final reconstruction (implants) last summer, and I do have to say the New Girls look pretty darn good. Now, having said all that, keep in mind that I am quite a bit older than you are. And to ease your mind, you may want to search for other posts from women with DCIS. Just use the search feature - there are many informative posts. Beesie is a member here with lots of experience and info. Finally, I want to tell you that in Dr. Susan Love's breast book, she says that by the time most breast cancer can be either palpated or detected in biopsies, most likely it has been in the body for 8 - 10 years!!! That kind of took away my urge to go back and smack my PCP for not listening to me.  You are doing exactly what you should be doing....ruling out anything serious. Despite your history, the reality is that the majority of breast lumps/breast issues are benign...NOT cancer! So try to take a deep breath, and in the words of another member here (NatsFan) \"Don't go there until you get there.\" In other words, just let the docs do their job. Give them time to get more pieces of the puzzle in place before you panic. With DCIS, you are not in a huge hurry like you might be with a fast growing tumor, so let the process unfold. Soon you will have answers, and I am hoping they are good ones. Wishing you the best!",

But I remember her boyfriend ringing my doorbell at 8 the next morning, and fixing him breakfast....grrrrrrr I shooed them both out of there pretty quickly. As I recall, I just rested and napped for a day or so. I do remember the phone ringing on the third day or so, and running down the hall to answer it. About halfway there, I thought to myself \"this probably isn't a good idea....\". Your body will let you know when you've overdone it. The beauty of the LAVH is tha there are very few sutures and they are internal. You might have a stitch or two where they insert the scopes, but otherwise it's a MUCH easier surgery to recover from than a traditional hysterectomy. I took the maximum amount of time off work, not because I needed it, but because I could. Honestly, I think you may be surprised at how fast you recover. It's always good to have help lined up just in case, though, especially with kids. That way it's there if you need it. Wishing you the best!",

All I can tell you is what happened to me. You can see my dx in my signature line. Last fall I had some bleeding from my left nipple. The breast surgeon assured me it was probably a benign papilloma, but sent me for further testing \"just to be on the safe side.\" Seven diagnostic procedures later, it was finally determined that I had primarily DCIS with a microinvasion of IDC. The first few biopsies only showed DCIS. I was offered a lumpectomy with radiation, but since my cancer was multifocal (in two different places) the BS suggested a unilateral MX. Well, I considered this and all my other options very carefully. I had many, many risk factors, and my Radiologist was worried that something could be starting in the right breast, even though nothing showed up on mammography or US. I made the decision to have a bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction. Prior to my surgery I had a radioactive isotope injection. Then during my surgery, I had a SNB, which was sent down to Pathology, and came back clean. Had it not, the surgeon would have taken additional axillary lymph nodes. All the margins were clear, and there was no evidence of any cancer on the chest wall. The tough part is waiting for the Final Pathology Report. You think you have all your ducks in a row, but everything depends on that final report. Well, not only were all the margins clear, so were the remaining parts of the sentinel nodes that were taken, AND - there was no evidence of any IDC. They said it was so tiny that the biopsy had gotten it all. Plus - there was no evidence of cancer in the right breast. Had I been a younger woman, I probably would have chosen lumpectomy with radiation. But at the age of 61, I had been worried about BC since my mom was dx'd at my age. I knew BMX was right for me. I did not have the Oncotype test, nor did I have BRCA testing. Currently, my risk of recurrence (either local or distant mets) is 1% - 2%. I have lost a considerable amount of weight and started exercising. That has further reduced my risk to .77%. And when I start Anastrozole (generic Arimidex) in the Fall (because I'm ER+), that will reduce THAT tiny risk to 0.33%. Obviously, there are no guarantees when it comes to BC. But I get my new ta tas in 3 weeks (permanent implants) and I plan on being the oldest person in the nursing home with perky boobs. Wishing you the best......",

When I got to college, the campus doc immediately sent me to a surgeon, who removed a golf-ball sized tumor. Regular mammograms after that showed nothing. Now it's 43 years later, and I have been diagnosed with DCIS and IDC (a combination of non-invasive cancer and invasive cancer) in my left breast. It is very slow growing and was caught very early. It was not related in any way to my fibroadenoma. Having a \"risk evaluation\" sounds like a smart thing to do, if only to put your mind at ease. There are amazing diagnostic tests and treatments these days. Make a list of the questions you do have, and if you forget any, I'm sure you can call them back later.

I am married and I have 6 grandchildren. Are you completely healed from your surgery/recon?...or still in progress? I have healed really well from my BMX in December. All my sutures are healed, and I have just had my last set of fills, which have been extremely easy and mostly painless. My PS is very impressed with the lack of any complications. I now have a three-month waiting period for my exchange surgery. Describe being numb......I'm trying to understand.  1.  Are you describing  numbness as no feeling or sensation, as if that area is not attached to your body...completely void of touch? I have almost complete, normal feeling all over my skin - all the way down my chest, and over my foobs, except for small - VERY small - numb spots. As for feeling deep inside the breasts, I still have the rock-hard tissue expanders in, so I can't tell you what feeling I'll have after my exchange surgery. I have a tiny section - 1 or 2 inches - in my left armpit where my SNB was done, but complete feeling in the right. I do have some numbness in the IMF on the right.   2. Or - The numbness from nerve damage is a different feeling, one to be more concerned about..  Are you describing  a painful, tingling numbness like when your hand goes to sleep and you feel like ants are crawlling all over you? I've had absolutely no painful tingling numbness like that....no phantom pains, no sharp stabbing pains, no \"electric shock\" kinds of feelings....none at all. I do feel sore when I try to do too much, like working out in the yard. 3.  Are you describing the numbness of a recon breast, or the core of your body, like in the ribcage under the breast?  Up into the arm? My body feels good. I have full range of motion in both arms. I have no limitations on lifting from my PS, only from the PT who talked to me about LE. (Which I don't have.)   What I learned from having a cervical fusion years ago is that nerves can take up to 2 yrs. to heal after surgery.  If you are going through recon, this prolongs the healing until after 2 yrs. of that being done. It would be interesting to know how may STILL have pain/numbness 2 years after being completely done with all surgeries. I'll let you know in two years! Mallory - imbalance would be a BIG issue for me.  Thanks for pointing it out. Right now, my foobs are smaller, and symmetrical. This is a first! I am loving it! Risks - it seems like it is about a 50/50 split on whether to wait to see if more problems develop, or be proactive and reduce risk from the get-go.  That is a very personal issue, and I think the stage of life you are at plays a big impact.  For example, I am now 60.  In 10-15 years, do I want to go through this again at the age 60. The only complications I am thinking about now are whether or not my permanent saline implants will last as long as I do. If they need to be replaced when I'm 81, will I care? Or will I just say \"To heck with it!\" Recon - all of you who commented had recon surgery.  Just wondering how this all plays into your comments of numbness and pain.  For the first three weeks after I got home from the BMX, all I did was cry about the painful TEs. I think it was because there was a foreign body inside me. The prescribed narcotics and Valium took care of that. But soon, the awful pain turned into painful discomfort, and from there, to annoying discomfort. Now I pretty much forget about them, and am even sleeping on my sides again. Sexuallity - are you saying that the numbness and lack of sensation bothers you during sex?  Is this the real issue? DH was adamant that he would rather have  ME healthy, than breasts that weren't. He is still attracted to me, and ironically, I find I am much less inhibited now than I ever was before. He has been with me for every procedure, surgery, and fill, and is my biggest advocate. We're careful right now, because of the TEs, but we certainly have future plans!!!",

She strongly suggested MX. During this time, the radiologist was working diligently to dx the right breast. In her gut, she felt that there may be \"something\" there in the right, even though it was very heavy and dense, and nothing was showing up on mammograms. I thought long and hard about my options. I knew that I would not be pleased with the looks of the lumpectomy as the BS described to me. I also knew that a UMX would mean a lift and reduction on the right.....and the chances of making the girls match up were slim. There would also be the future worry about continuing diagnostics on the right. (My mom had breast cancer.) I'd always wanted a reduction, but this was a H#LL of a way to get one. Now, though, I've told my PS I wanted to be smaller, and he agreed, saying he was surprised that I didn't have more neck and back pain with my large breasts. Who knows...maybe I did! With all my risk factors (and I had a lot) I decided on a BMX with immediate reconstruction, and I have never regretted my decision for a minute. This did not guarantee I was \"cured\", nor did it guarantee I'd never have a recurrence, local or distant. Just having the BMX does not ensure you will not need chemo or rads - only the final pathology report and subsequent testing can do that. But my final pathology report came back good, my risk of recurrence is small, and my treatment will consist of Arimidex for the next five years. This is a really personal decision, and I wish you well with it!",

However, each time I had my mammogram - and I had one every year - I kept wondering \"Is this the year it will be positive?\" I had extremely dense, heavy, fibrocystic breasts, and my PCP refused to refer me to an ultrasound or an MRI, saying that they weren't screening tools. But when I had spontaneous bleeding from my left nipple in August 2011, THAT got his attention! Turns out it was multifocal DCIS (non-invasive cancer) and two areas of IDC (invasive ductal cancer). The tumors were very small and caught early, and I decided on a bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction as my treatment of choice. Luckily, I didn't need chemo or radiation. Now, having said all that, let's back up. You have BC in your history, so naturally you are concerned. You've been having symptoms, which naturally elevates your anxiety. HOWEVER - the problem with self-diagnosis (and this includes the notorious Dr. Google) is that unless the information we gather is SPECIFIC to our diagnosis, it does us more harm than good. Start small. Go through the steps that your breast surgeon (and I do hope you are seeing a breast specialist) recommends that you take. Start with the least invasive procedures, and work up from there if you need to.  This will give you the information that you need to 1) learn more about your condition, if there is one, or 2) give you complete peace of mind that what you are going through is not cancer. The reality is that the majority of breast lumps, problems, and issues are benign - NOT breast cancer. I'm praying this is so for you!",

In my experience, most people are not interested in any detailed medical information unless it pertains to them. \"How are you doing?\" is kind of a default question when you don't know what else to say. And those who interrupt and divert the conversation to themselves never wanted to hear the answer in the first place. If someone asks me how I am doing, then interrupts my answer, I just interrupt THEM and say \"Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you asked me how I was doing. Did you not want to let me answer?\" And then proceed to stare at them intently. Or if somehow my breast cancer experience turns into some dramatic response from them, my standard answer is \"I'm sorry, but what part of this is about YOU?\" And again, the unblinking stare. I'm particularly fond of the expression \"EXCUSE ME?\" along with the icy stare. Or there's the old Ann Landers/Dear Abby line: \"If it were any of your business, you'd already know the answer to that.\" I do give my loved ones a lot of leeway. Some of them are truly concerned, and just clumsy when it comes to using the right words. Every time that happens, it's a teachable moment.

She kindly pointed out that estrogen is produced in body fat - especially belly fat, of which I had plenty. I went on a diet and exercise program and lost 56 pounds and more than 65 inches. She said I reduced my risk of recurrence by 23%. And yes, I did start the Anastrozole. Interestingly enough, I haven't had any hot flashes. Absence of \"cold flashes\", yes, but no hot flashes. Is it because I was so ER+ the AI just hasn't had time to suck all the estrogen out of my body? Or is it because I'm so far past menopause and hysterectomy that there really wasn't much estrogen in there to begin with?",

I had heavy, dense, fibrocystic breasts, yet every year I asked for an ultrasound or MRI, my PCP refused it, saying that those were \"not screening tools\"... So each year I'd get a chipper little postcard telling me \"Congratulations...there is no sign of breast cancer in your recent mammogram.\" But a few months after my last one, I had some spontaneous bleeding from my left nipple. THAT sure got the PCP's attention! I was in the Breast Surgeon's office the next day. She suspected a papilloma, but referred me for more testing just to be thorough. After seven different diagnostic tests, they found invasive ductal cancer as well as ductal carcinoma in situ (non invasive cancer).  Thank God for a Radiologist who had the tenacity of a pit bull. Even though she told me that one tumor was acting just like a fibroadenoma, she wouldn't stop til she had a good tissue sample. Fortunately, what cancer they found was early and small, and I did not need chemo or radiation. What angered me though, was the fact that the Radiologist said she could make out the areas of cancer as far back as 2009. (But she said that was only because she knew what she was looking for.) The point of that story is not to scare you, but to urge you to find a professional who has your best interests in mind. It's true: the MAJORITY of breast lumps that women find are benign. But you want a doctor who will assure you of this after taking all steps possible to rule out anything else. Wishing you the best!",

One morning last fall, I was sitting at the breakfast table and my nightgown felt wet. I looked down and there were two blood stains, about an inch and a half in diameter each. I realized it was coming from my left nipple. This had never happened before. A day later I saw my PCP, who booked an appointment with the Breast Surgeon for two days later. When I saw her, she reassured me that it was probably an intraductal papilloma, a very common condition among women, but it would have to be surgically removed as it would only get worse. Just to be on the safe side, she sent me for some diagnostic tests. I had more mammograms (one where I bled spectacularly all over the plates), a ductogram (where the Radiologist could not insert the cannula into the duct), a few ultrasounds, and two US-guided core needle biopsies. It wasn't a papilloma. It was multi-focal DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ), with multifocal microinvasions of IDC (invasive, or infiltrating ductal carcinoma). Everyone was surprised except me. (I had many risk factors, including a mom with BC.) Because it was so small, and so early, I was offered a lumpectomy with radiation. But due to the multifocal (in two different places) aspect, my surgeon recommended a unilateral mastectomy. I made the decision for a bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction. I don't regret any of my choices, and now, four months later, am doing really well. I did not need chemo or radiation. I think if I were just starting out, and I had doctors who suggested diagnostic procedures, I would take advantage of them and have them done. There's no reason to be suspicious that every little thing is cancer (in fact, it usually ISN'T) , and it's great when a test can definitely rule it out.",

This is the breast reduction I always wanted, but never got At first, the TRAM flap and DIEP flap sounded too good to be true (Perky foobs!

I want the implants to remind me that I need to take care of my body, and get healthy in other ways, but I think the scars will also remind me of what a warrior I am. My mom had breast cancer when she was 67, and had the MX but no reconstruction. I won't have an oncologist AFTER the final pathology report is in. If there is no cancer in the lymph nodes, then most likely I won't need chemo. If there is no cancer on the chest wall, then most likely I won't need radiation.

Fortunately, we stopped buying presents for the rest of the family years ago. We said the best gift was the gift of time spent together. I did, however, already write our Christmas newsletter. I like it a lot. I talk about all our challenges and all our blessings in 2011. I've already described my cancer diagnosis, my surgery, and how \"because the cancer had not spread, I did not need any chemo or radiation.\" Ahhh....the power of positive thinking, eh?

I've had pretty severe fibromyalgia for the past ten+ years. I've been through an intensive pain management program, and while my symptoms are fairly well-controlled, all it takes is some episode of acute pain to throw me into a fibro flare again. So prior to my BMX/recon I did what I could to prepare a little \"nest\" at home....DH and I rearranged things so they were convenient for me to reach, and had plenty of little healthy, snacky things to eat, along with some toddler sippy cups so I'd stay hydrated no matter what. Then I ordered a fully-electric hospital bed.BEST IDEA EVER in my case. I have degenerative disk disease and some spinal stenosis, along with arthritis. I love my Tempurpedic mattress, but without the use of my arms there was no way I could get in and out of bed. I put a memory-foam mattress on the hospital mattress, along with my electric blanket. I got an over-the-bed table, and DH rigged up an remote control to my reading lamp. Prior to my surgeries, I was surprised at how little pain I experienced with all my diagnostic procedures and biopsies. In the hospital, I was adamant that I did not want morphine in my PCA, as I'd had a bad reaction to it with my hysterectomy. But that's what I got, and sadly, never got the full benefit of it as I only pushed the button once an hour instead of every ten minutes. When I was discharged the next day, I was still having trouble controlling the pain. The PS sent me home with Norco, which is the same as Vicodin but has less Tylenol in it. Really didn't help much. Ironically, it wasn't the mastectomy that was the most painful - it was the tissue expanders that they put in. It felt like my chest was on fire from the inside out. There were times I just lay in bed and cried because I couldn't get a handle on the pain. My PS told me to just keep taking the maximum dose of Norco, around the clock if I had to. DH even made sure to bring me my 4 a.m. dose so I'd have it in my system. I could only sleep for an hour or two at a time. I started to play around with the drugs that I thought might help. I knew that the TEs were pressing on ribs and nerves and muscles, and I tried Robaxin and Flexeril, along with some Aleve or some Motrin. Once I realized I had very little pain in the actual MX incisions, I started having DH do some trigger-point therapy on my back before I went to bed. Then I would take a hot shower with my shower massage directed at the sore muscles in my back. I took a Norco at 7 pm, another Norco at 8 pm, and an Valium at 9 pm. The first time I did that, I slept for four solid hours. It felt great. I also started doing my deep breathing, relaxation, and meditation exercises during the day. I was also pleasantly surprised at how good the hospital bed made my back feel. I raise the knees up as far as they will go, then recline the head back to about 45 degrees. It takes all the pressure off my spine, which is great. I agree with what your docs office said about the intensity of the pain. For me, I know my brain has trouble distinguishing between a friendly punch on the arm, and getting run over by a train. The pain signals go wild, and drugs don't help much. Everyone on the forum kept saying \"Just give it time!\" and each time I heard that, I wanted to scream \"But you don't understand....it's not discomfort, it's PAIN!!!\" Well, they were right. Today I went to a Post-Mastectomy exercise class. I am four weeks out from my BMX, I got my first set of fills yesterday, and get this - they actually made my TEs feel BETTER!!! I have great range of motion, and instead of feeling like I'll never make it 8 more months til exchange, I feel like I now have control over this. I didn't have a DIEP flap, but I don't think that just because you have FM it will take you longer to recover. Just follow your doctors orders (Seriously! ALL of them!) and don't try to be a hero about taking the pain meds. Your brain *may* process more pain signals because of the FM, but then again, you may be used to so much pain already, you may not notice pain that other women do. Here is the truth: This, too, shall pass!!!! Good luck and big prayers for your upcoming surgery!!!",

I'm still fighting this crud - whatever it is - and I think I'm going to need as much time as possible to get strong again for my BMX. It kind of makes me sad - I was SO energized last week - \"Let's go!\" \"Let's get this show on the road!\" and I felt strong and ready to come home and recover from the surgery. Now this stupid flu has sucked all the energy out of me, and I already feel like a patient. But things are looking up - I took a shower and washed my hair last night (woohoo!) and I just may actually get dressed today!!! Let's all hang in there, December Gals!",

This way we didn't have to explain things a gazillion times to each person who inquired. I kept everyone updated, and DH did it when I was recovering from surgery. The nice thing about Caring Bridge is that family and friends can leave you encouraging messages. Shoot, I've even been known to flash The New Girls to people who were curious as to what a reconstructed breast looks like. (Mine look pretty good...) HOWEVER - we are all different. When my friend got dx'd, she told her husband, her sister, and me. That was it. She wanted it kept totally private. ",

Fortunately, my appt with the Plastic Surgeon was right after that, and he reassured me that it takes as long as it takes, and what the BS said was really stupid (only he was more polite). He said I'd been through a lot, that this recon stuff was painful, and that he would be there to approve refills should I need them. And in that moment, he became Prince Charming.",

The truth is, we all react to pain differently. Our bodies are different, our treatments are different, our surgeries and our SURGEONS are different. There is absolutely no way we can - or should - compare ourselves to anyone else on the forum. Now, having said that, I DID listen to the wise women here who told me to take the pain meds if I needed them...which I did. It helped immeasurably, and allowed me to get back on track with my life. A body that is in pain is stressed, and a body that is stressed won't heal quickly. There is no shame in taking pain meds; in fact, it may ultimately help the healing process if you find you need them.",

When I was 18 years old, I had one the size of a walnut removed from my right breast. (That was a really long time ago, and I guess that was the only way they could see what it was. Sheesh - the olden days - no ultrasounds!) I never had any problems after that, and my breast cancer diagnosis at age 60 was totally unrelated to that. You said: I obviously need a follow up appointment with a real doctor, but the only one I can get is with the PA again. Could I please have advice about what to do? Why is it that you can't you see a doctor? Is it a matter of cost? There are many breast centers now that have services available for women at low or no cost. If it were me, I'd probably ask to see a Breast Specialist. Only a doctor would be able to request a specific kind of biopsy. However, it doesn't sound like the Radiologist who read your ultrasound scans was too worried.... I really wish we could give you advice here, but none of us are doctors. All we can do is tell you to take a deep breath, and if you feel you need to investigate this further, then go for it. Just remember that the MAJORITY of breast issues are benign - not cancer. Please come back and let us now how you are doing. Wishing you the best!",

Got my dx last September, but my surgery got rescheduled twice. Talk about anxiety! Finally had my BMX w/TEs on December 5th. Trust me on this: the anticipation is WAY worse than the reality! I was totally OCD about making lists of everything I would need in the hospital and at home. I packed an overnight bag that I NEVER EVEN OPENED in the hospital. I'd bought a boatload of special mastectomy camis, drain holders, etc., that I never even used. I woke up wearing a giant Ace bandage, and ended up just pinning my drains to it with cute diaper pins. Since I couldn't shower with drains in, didn't need a lanyard or shoelace for the shower. I got a bunch of front-zip and front-button tops, thinking it would be forever before I could use my arms again. It was only a few weeks. I wore a zip-front sports bra from JCPenney after the Ace bandage came off, and when I was done with my fills, I lived in my Genie bra. We have a Tempurpedic bed that is difficult to get out of sometimes on a GOOD day (like swimming in Jello), so I rented a hospital bed for the month after my surgery. Smartest thing I ever did! I am NOT a back sleeper, and that worried me the most. But I put a memory foam pad on the hospital mattress, and also had an over-the-bed table. DH rigged up my reading lamp (over on a bookshelf) to a remote control, and attached that to the bed controls. It was so easy to lay back at the correct angle, and raise the mattress up under my knees so my back felt supported. If I wanted to sit up and get out of bed, all I had to do was raise the back all the way up, and I didn't have to use my arms. I got some satin jammies at Sears for cheap, and they really helped getting in and out of bed. None of our recliners were comfy enough to sleep in, and I couldn't reach or manage the controls. We put snacks and dishes out on the counter within reach. I used my travel sippy mugs for at night, so I wouldn't spill. It's really important to keep good records, so we made a space in the bathroom for the \"Drain Station\" where we kept the alcohol wipes, the measuring cups, and the logs. We also had a log for pain meds. Ah....the pain meds.....I came home from the hospital in pain, because I didn't use the morphine PCA by my bed. I wanted to be one of those women who came home and took a Tylenol, then ran a marathon the week after my surgery. Alas, that wasn't me. I did have more pain than I should have, and it was all my fault. I had great pain meds, and when I finally started taking them the way they were prescribed, the really bad pain changed to annoying discomfort. DH even got up at 4 a.m. to give me my Norco dose. By the time I got to fills, I had no pain at all. And if you're taking pain meds, TAKE THE STOOL SOFTENER!!!! Seriously. You think you won't need it, but you will. And you do not want to get to the point where you need Milk of Magnesia. I got filled to 620ccs in five visits. I never had any pain associated with the TEs or the fills until I lost 50 pounds, Then it got hard to sleep on my side again. I'll be getting high profile smooth saline implants. Can't wait to cross over to the squishie side! Here is my favorite quote from BCO: \"I just want this breast cancer to be a bump in the road in my rear-view mirror!\" Feel free to PM me with any questions..... And big honkin' hugs to all of you who are just starting out on this journey!!!!!",

It's kind of an annual thing with us. The viewing is better in the mountains or way out in the country (much less light) and some years, there are hundreds of meteors per hour. Earlier tonight there was a cloud cover, so we're not expecting to see much. Hope everyone is enjoying their weekend!",

Mumtothree - I think that after a while, either some of  the numbness from the SNB goes away, or we just stop noticing it. Nine months later, I have tiny numb areas with larger spots of dulled sensation. YAY on your drain removal! SHABBY! Thank goodness you are o.k. from your car smash! Of all the time to get hit  Yeah, waiting for the final path is like waiting for the other shoe to drop. I think I stayed on pain meds around the clock for almost three weeks. It was better than hurting, and my doctor said a stressed body (as from pain) does not heal. Trinity - my MO said deodorant restrictions were only during rads (something about the aluminum). I had no underarm incisions...my SNB was done through my MX incision. GmaFoley - Oh, you had another LX, not MX on the 8th? Yeah, the waiting and watching and wondering are very stressful. That's why I made the decision for BMX even with the smallest cancer, and turns out the right one was a prophy. None of my annual mammos ever showed anything.  At least I'll have the perkiest Ta Ta's in the nursing home. Pointvalue - thanx so much for your kind words.  I chose my screen name because once I was diagnosed, I saw blessings all around me despite all the other crap. Still holding good thoughts for saving that nipple of yours....I don't think you got 700ccs in the OR - you might be referring to the size of your TEs - that could be their maximum volume. (Same as mine.) Damiana - funny - I was just the opposite. For the longest time, all I smelled was something \"hospitalish\" under my pits (didn't have chemo or rads) and then - my regular deodorant that I've used for the last 15 years stopped working! So I had to change brands....DH said he couldn't smell anything different, but I sure could! 301724's Daughter - Great news on your mom! She's had a REALLY big surgery, so it will take longer to heal. How good of you to keep us posted! We send our gentle hugs to her!!  HMP12IND - Don't be surprised when the tight gauze comes off, and the tightness is still there. The TEs felt like an iron bra UNDER MY SKIN at first !!! I think that was the thing that surprised me the most. All along I thought it was the bandage, but noooooo!!! Later on, though, I got used to it and forgot they were there. Christina - glad you got your drains out! Hi, melmcbee! Oh, Leah - HUGE honkin' hugs to you!!! I went through the same thing with my Exchange date. I was a little leery about the M.A, who was supposed to schedule me, but every time I called (three times), they confirmed 8/22 as my date. Then the \"Surgery Scheduler\" called and said she was calling to set up my surgery, and we were looking at either later September, or mid-October. I think I actually screamed \"NOOOOO\" in her ear. I explained the sequence of events, and my need for surgery ASAP. She agreed that a mistake had been made, and would look into it. Turns out the little medical assistant forgot to turn in the paperwork. Well, I don't know how the Scheduler did it, but she called back the next day and confirmed me for the 22nd. She must have bumped someone else. Last year, my BMX was rescheduled three times....October, November, and December. I am SO sorry this happened to you! Justegan - AWESOME TATTS!!!!!! What a loving family!!! Cherrie - so sorry about the delay. Prayers for good results on the suspicious nodule. Cottontail - I was going to recommend the JCPenney zip-front sports bra, but they may be discontinued. How long do you need to wear a special bra? Markat - keep healing.... Beckers - you sound like me! I'm a really nice person; all I expect of others is to DO YOUR JOB!!!! Is that so hard? Because if it is, perhaps you shouldn't be there in the first place. Grrrr! Hi, nbnotes, and welcome! I had my BMX with TEs last December. Now that seems like so long ago...I'm having my exchange on 8/22.  Please believe me when I say the anticipation is WAY worse than the reality. Hi to anyone I might have missed!!! ~~~~~~~ Me, I'm just hanging out, trying to avoid germs. Working in the garden, hoisting and lifting stuff I won't be able to after next Wednesday. Feeling the effects of not exercising....ow, my aching back!!! Looking forward to getting my new squishies, healing from the exchange, and getting back to water aerobics!

You can get them at Target, Walmart, Kohls,  Bed Bath & Beyond, and lots of other places. They are pull-over-the-head, or step-in. They were perfect for my SpongeBob Square Foobs as they got filled up, (disguised the weird shape), gave me the support I needed, and were comfortable enough to sleep in. I'd gotten really big ones before my dx, so they weren't too tight after BMX. It's a nice transitional bra until I need a more expensive underwire for post-exchange. They come with strange triangular pieces of foam that can be inserted in the pockets, but I threw those away. Funny Genie Bra video: http://www.youtube.com/user/geniebra Howhm021 - after my BMX, the surgeon warned me that I would feel all sorts of weird things - knife-sharp pain, dull ache, burning, tingling, numbness, electrical jolts.....and to not worry about it, that it was probably just nerves that had been cut or damaged. It gets less noticeable after a while, and now I really don't have any of that except some lasting numb areas or places with dulled sensation. June56 - Juicy!!! LOL!!!

Hi, wintersocks!  I was in the hospital for 24 hours. I could have spent another night, but a particular nurse was determined to get me to go home and recuperate in my own bed, away from any possible infections in the hospital. She was right. I did fine going home the next day. I did have my DH here to assist me; that was a huge help, but not all women have someone to stay with them except for that first night home.

I did get the high-profile Allergan smooth saline implants - filled exactly to 700 ccs. Not over-filled or under-filled. I also have a feeling he did a little nipping and tucking due to the weight loss. I seem to have longer scars, although my only view has been peeking down into my humongous Ace bandage, which stays on til Saturday. All in all, a very good experience. I didn't have that immediate \"Ahhhhhhh...\" feeling as I am really sore. But there is no constant pain at all, just when I move. Got Fentanyl and Zofran in the OR, and came home with Norco, Valium, and Cipro. God bless DH, who got up every four hours last night to give me my Norco! I slept in my recliner just fine, and this morning was up early to go out and get the paper. I let DH sleep in ! Thanks to all for your prayers and good wishes!

After being wrapped like a mummy in a very tight Ace bandage for 72 hours, the implants were shaped more like TEs, and had gotten a bit, er, dented at the bottom. But I took a shower......ahhhhhhhhhh.....washed my hair......ahhhhhhhh.....and then after I dried off, I put a Xeriform strip across each incision. I can't really tell if the PS extended them at all, but there was some recent bleeding on one of them and a lot of dried blood on the other. He said he had used skin glue on both, and to go ahead and get both wet, but y'all know how OCD I am about germs!!! So on went the Xeriform, and then we taped mini-pads inside my sports bra (sticky side against the fabric) so nothing would rub the incisions. Within about an hour, the bottom half of the implants started to fill out. I still have a tiny crease on the bottom of the right one, but I also have quite a bit of swelling from the additional release of the pectoral muscles in the IMF. I can also tell I'm pretty swollen in my upper chest (I think he did a lot of work up there,too), but once I get to the ol' Drop and Fluff, they should be lookin' pretty good. I definitely don't have stripper boobs! We didn't want to take a chance on uncontollable pain this time, so have been hitting the Norco, Cipro, and Benadyl on a regular basis. Cut back on the Norco today - I'm just sore, no constant pain whatsoever. I have been eating my protein (100 grams a day, girls!) and napping like a big old housecat. I figure I have a prescription for two weeks of couch potato, and I'm taking advantage of it!!! Sorry to be lazy, but I might copy and paste this post in a few other threads. Hope everyone is doing well and having a good weekend!",

I know in the past I've been able to respond to everyone personally, but since surgery, I've just been kind of lazy.... Tomorrow is two weeks since exchange. I'm doing o.k.; no real pain, but lots of soreness still. Am spending half the night in the recliner, and the rest of the night in my own bed. Neither one is too comfy at the moment. Will email the PS today to see if my restrictions have changed, and when I can drive. I'm anxious to start exercising again, although I plan to stay out of the therapy pool for several more weeks. Righty has been settling in well (\"Drop and Fluff\") but Lefty is still very swollen and sitting up high. Not sure if it's the implant, residual swelling from pocket work, or LE . Luckily, I see the MO tomorrow; she always does a full exam. Unfortunately, I think she tracked me down to make me start taking the Anastrozole now. I had a \"pass\" while I was on the Optifast diet; now that I'm down to 3 products a day, I think my time is up and I need to start the AIs. I do think she'll be pleased with my weight loss, though... So - today - hair color; tomorrow - MO and Optifast; Thursday - Quilt Class (and I get to show off the baby quilt I made this weekend); and Friday - a baby shower at the University. One of my former students met another student in a summer program, they both graduated, got married, got their masters degrees, became employed by the university, and are expecting their first baby - a little boy - next month. Do I feel old or what! I feel like I've been underground for a year. My BC dx was September 15, 2011, and my life has been all about procedures, surgeries, recoveries, and other medical stuff since then. Life came to a grinding halt when all this happened. (Plus, DH was dx'd with kidney disease...a whole 'nuther story.) So I'm ready. I am really looking forward to seeing my former colleagues, most of whom I haven't seen for six years. I'm ready to start living my life again - despite pain, restrictions, or whatever else might come my way. Hope everyone enjoyed their weekend.....and huge hugs to those who are facing big challenges or dealing with painful recoveries right now. xoxoxo",

Went to my Weight Management program tonite, lost another pound (not bad without exercising) and sat through class with some awesome folks who have become good friends since we started together in March. I am bound and determined to make this AI work for me, so I will change the time I take the drug to mornings, and will definitely get started on the fish oil, calcium, vitamin D, and magnesium. And hopefully, the PS will release me to go back to exercising next week (4 weeks out from exchange) and I can start getting back on track! Anyway, rant over.....

      "Content": "Sep 22, 2012 11:08PM Blessings2011 wrote: Beckers - I was blissfully ignorant when I first got diagnosed. I let that \"But it's a GOOD cancer\" statement lull me into complacency. The reality is that once you have invasive breast cancer, you have some risk - however tiny it may be - of it coming back again, either as a primary (new cancer) or as mets (metastasized into other organs). I was fortunate. My cancer was small, and it was caught early, and I had the maximum surgery for the minimum cancer. But the reality is, there are Stage IV women who started out with my exact same dx. THAT was a sobering realization. And the more complex your cancer is, and the more treatment you need, I think it's natural that your mind takes you to a place where the worst case scenario is staring you in the face. But here's the thing: I believe that most women do NOT go on to develop mets. However, it's just another one of those crap shoot things - you can do everything right, and for some reason, that tiny speck of cancer left in your body decides to mutate and grow. I decided that for me, I would take my 0.38% chance of recurrence and go with that. No, make that ZERO percent. My faith sustains me and gives me hope. I believe in my heart that I am healed of cancer. I believe I will die of something else. In the meantime, I have a responsibility to educate myself so that my future health is my #1 priority. With regard to my Stage IV sisters, I have just gotten back from a very angry place in my head. I have been reading posts for months about \"Pinktober\" and \"Pinkwashing\" and truthfully, have been horrified, shocked, furious, and just plain enraged about the fact that every October we have this tsunami of pink, and everyone and his dog wears a pink something, and that is supposed to create awareness of BC and make us all feel good that we're doing something positive. Well, HELL, trust me: I'm aware. Now where's our cure? What are your pink socks doing for MY breast cancer? (Among other snarky thoughts I've had.....) I had a great chat with my MO about cures, and her point was that finding a cure takes research, and doing research takes TONS of money. I've just emailed her to ask which organizations she feels are the most responsible and the most dedicated to actually finding a cure. I'll post her suggestions here when I get them. But for now, the anger has subsided somewhat. I will definitely resist the \"Pinkwashing\" and all my Facebook and Caring Bridge friends will get my \"Pinkwashing 101\" lecture. I will continue to walk in the Komen Race For The Cure, because I now understand better the motivation of some of the women I saw last year who freaked me out. Pink wigs, pink tutus, the whole circus atmosphere totally turned me off. I was two weeks post diagnosis and completely lost. My MO was the one who helped me put it into perspective....she said that many of those \"frivolous\" women had lost someone near and dear to them, and were expressing their grief, or their elation that someone had survived - in different ways. Many of them were survivors themselves. Our local support group will be having a team, and staffing a booth there. I've spent a year now on BCO, and I'm at the place where I'm ready to find a place to give back to my community. I read somewhere that if you're not giving, you're taking. So I plan to find my niche and start giving back. Am I worried about my future? Am I scared about the possible progression of my breast cancer? Not a bit. Like I said...I will be vigilant, but not obsessed. I am grateful for my BC dx - had it not been for that, I would not have made so many important changes in my lifestyle. Like Maya Angelou says: We do the best we can with what we know. And when we know better, we do better. And THAT, my sweet friend, is the end of my Saturday night soapbox speech. I hope it made sense. (And yes, you were absolutely right to eat those three cookies. It was meant to be.) xoxoxo",

I just figured with everything else going on this past year, I needed to give myself a break. But Kaiser is sneaky....if you don't follow up on your recommended appointment, they'll mail you a kit for a fecal occult blood test that you mail back in. I haven't even done THAT yet! Thanks for the reminder.....and hope you are feeling nice and clean and emptied out , and have nothing but good results from your test. Beckers - I started Anastrozole (generic Arimidex) on September 5th. (Kicking and screaming, I might add...I really didn't want to take it. But I had to do lot of soul-searching, and finally realized - as my mom used to tell me - \"Honey, you won't know until you try.\") So I put on my Big Girl Panties and swallowed the first pill, and the next day I did the same. I was like Alice in Wonderland...waiting for something dramatic to happen. It didn't. Now it's habit. I just don't ever want to get to a place where I'd be saying \"Oh, I wish I had taken it when it was offered to me...\"  As for the liver, what an awesome organ. It can take tons of abuse and still, it is the only organ in the body that is able to regenerate itself. Many things affect the liver - and yet it can still be repaired. When I was on the fasting phase of my diet, my liver enzymes shot up very high. I was terrified, not because of possible mets, but because I'd had HepB many years ago. I am VERY protective of my liver, thankyouverymuch. Fortunately, the docs ran tons of tests, showing that there were no lesions and no active disease. They figured that the high numbers were the result of the low calorie diet. I'm back on food now, and the liver enzymes have gone back down. But I do keep a very careful watch on them. And the Anastrozole = so far, so good. The only thing I'm noticing is that I'm no longer suffering from COLD flashes!!! I can sit in an air-conditioned room without my sweatshirt!  I do keep a log of possible symptoms for my MO, though. ~~~~~~~~~~ Yesterday we ripped out the pathetic, twig-like trees in our parking strip. We've been here for seven years. The first trees were planted by the developer....Crape Myrtles, I think. They never grew. Then we put in Chinese Pistache. Same thing. Skinny, sad looking trees. Then I decided I wanted Gingkos....I knew they were slow growing, but I didn't care. What I didn't anticipate was that they would get SMALLER...... So last week we went to a local nursery and picked out two large October Glory maple trees in 24\" boxes. The crew planted them yesterday, and showed us how to water them. In a few weeks, they'll turn the most gorgeous shades of reddish orange and gold, and it will be soooo nice to look out in front and see the colors. Can't say it's fall here yet (it was 104 last week, this week it's in the 80's) but one of these days!!!!!! Hope everyone has a wonderful, relaxing weekend.....just take a look at Mother Nature's beauty and don't forget to just b-r-e-a-t-h-e!!!!!!",

And so needed....I'm a retired counselor, and a huge advocate for seeking therapy when life gets challenging. We don't have to go it alone, and the truth is, not all of us learn good coping skills when we're young. Kudos to you for making your overall health your priority. Howhmo21 and other newbies - please believe me when I tell you that the anticipation of surgery is WAAAAY worse than the reality. Seriously. Find something you love to do, and do it. Stay distracted. Take deeeeeep breaths. The next thing you know, your surgery will be over, and the next step, either treatment or recovery can start. GmaFoley - \"See you on the healing side...\"  LOVE IT!!! Also love the image of being in God's lap, in His big rocking chair.... Tazzy - rant away. I think I cried every day after I got home from the hospital - mostly because I wouldn't take my pain meds (DUH) and felt vulnerable and tired and frustrated about being in pain. DH was wonderful. Sometimes he would just sit on the edge of the bed and put his hand on my foot and hold it there without saying anything. Once I started taking the pain meds, and gave up the idea that my recuperation would be over in 48 hours, I sort of relaxed into the routine and once again gave up the control I thought I had given up much earlier. It takes as long as it takes. Be kind to your sweet self. Beckers.....how long have you been in California? Girlfriend, we have earthquakes 24/7!!!!! Mostly they're too small to be felt, but they're there. However, I am absolutely certain there will be no shaking while you're on the table!!!! There!

Hi, Damiana9  - great news from the PS! Hope that last drain comes out soon. May you continue to heal well! I actually have quite a bit of sensation left. It's patchy, but there. Trinity0723 - Damiana is right. Anticipation of the unknown can be very stressful. And the truth is, it affects our immune systems, so we can pick up any random bugs out there. I was an absolute germ magnet during the 3 months my BMX kept getting postponed. Be careful out there. Shabby6485 - I'm so sorry this is taking such a toll on you! Definitely good to ask for the Xanax.  Big honkin' hugs to you! Leah - you are way ahead of the game. Shaving under the arms is risky on your lymph node biopsy side, so going au naturel is probably much safer! Looks like your TEs will be going in the same day as mine are coming out on the 22nd! June56 - taking  small steps instead of looking at the complete picture...excellent advice!!! ChristyRN - Congratulations! Can't believe you're posting so quickly! Hope you feel better very soon. Today was a busy day. Hope that Mumtothree, Staceynan, Justegan, GMAFoley, and leama had successful procedures and are resting comfortably tonight.

Most of you going through chemo already know that certain chemo drugs are tototoxic (can cause hearing loss). One of my friends (who had several different cancers and multiple rounds of chemotherapy) discovered too late that she lost a significant amount of hearing after her chemo, and needed hearing aids. Unfortunately, she had never gotten a hearing test before she started chemo, so there was no evidence that this loss was caused by her treatment. If she DID have a baseline audiogram prior to starting chemo, and followup audiograms showed hearing loss, then her insurance would have paid for her hearing aids. Sadly, she had to pay for them out-of-pocket - not cheap - I think they were about $3,400. Those of you who have started, or will be starting chemo might ask your MO about getting a baseline hearing test/audiogram. Just a thought....",

It was awesome, and made me so much more independent. It was fully electric, so I just raised up the back all the way when I wanted to get out of bed. Being able to raise up under the knees at night really saved my back, too. But don't despair. This disability and dependence are just temporary!

Then I'll put a memory foam topper over all, and make up the bed that way. Otherwise it will be too hard on my back. And with satin jammies, I can slide in and out of bed!

The next date was Nov 8th - but I got sick and had to cancel. Finally, I got it done on Dec 5th. I just knew that the core-needle biopsies had blown the cancer wide open, and that it was pulsing throughout my body, including my lymph nodes. The Breast Care Coordinator at the hospital sure had to talk me off the ledge about THAT...she said that's simply not the way your (my) cancer behaves. Still....waiting 3 months was Hell. Hi, Summer60, and welcome to the forum! This is the place no woman wants to find herself, but it is the very best place of information, comfort, support, and healing you could ever imagine. No matter what you are going through, someone here has walked in your shoes. Please believe me when I say the waiting is the hardest. And that the anticipation of surgery is WAY harder than the reality. I had a bilateral mastectomy last December. I had no idea what to expect until after the final pathology report came in. As it turns out, I didn't need either chemo or radiation. It's easy for someone else to say \"just relax\" when your head is spinning over the possibilities. But the truth is, you don't need to predict the future right now. You just need to make plans to have your surgery. As more information comes available to you, you will find out your treatment plan. Those details really do help you get a grasp on what is happening, and will allow you to take things one day at a time. We've all had our pity parties. We still do. Please keep posting here....this is a place where we all understand. Big hugs to you! Thinking of Onelife and cspreng this evening - hope their procedures went well today, and that tonight they are both resting comfortably. SHABBY!!!! Tomorrow is YOUR day!!! Keeping you in my prayers for a quick, successful surgery, and a comfortable recovery.",

One question: are you getting enough protein? Unless you have a medical condition that restricts the amount of protein you take in, most of us need at least 100 grams of protein a day to heal. My DH has kidney disease and is restricted to small amounts of protein. After my BMX, I was eating the same food he was. DUH! That was only about 25 grams. Once I upped my protein intake to over 100 grams (supplementing with whey protein drinks and organic turkey jerky) I felt much better. In the beginning, I needed help to walk the 50 steps to our mailbox. I leaned heavily on DH's arm, and would get back to the house exhausted. I thought the fatigue would never go away. A few months later, I was biking, power walking, and doing water aerobics. Hang in there! Prayers and good thoughts for all our August girls who have come home from procedures and are recovering.

      "Content": "Aug 3, 2012 09:54AM Blessings2011 wrote: Aw, Mumtothree - big honkin' hugs to you!!!! When I got my BC diagnosis last September, my first impulse was to call my mom, who'd had breast cancer and a radical mastectomy, with no reconstruction, at the same age I was. But then I remembered she had passed away three years ago (from other causes - she was 87, never had a return of the cancer) and that I couldn't phone her. I think that upset me almost as much as hearing the diagnosis. Eventually, I realized that she is with me every day, and all through this, I have heard her words of wisdom in my heart. You are going through a lot right now, and yes, it does feel like insanity at times. Please believe me that the anticipation is WAY worse than the reality. I think one of the worst things our friends can do in the way of \"supporting\" us is to make us second-guess our decisions. Somehow, they think they know what's best for us. Not true. Here's the thing about reconstruction - you don't have to do it now. Many women, for many reasons, have delayed reconstruction. Many are like you - they just don't want it. But years down the line, they change their minds for whatever reason. Others have to delay it in order to have treatments first. But recon is an option that is still open to you in the future. I had a bilateral mastectomy in December, with immediate reconstruction. Tissue expanders were placed, I was filled to 620ccs in five visits, and decided to wait til I had lost weight before I got permanent implants. My exchange surgery will be in three weeks. I knew there could be serious complications with recon, and if that happened to me, so be it. I was used to seeing my mom flat, and to me that seemed normal. But I'm 61, and I knew that I needed a reminder that I would have a new body to take better care of. The implants were part of that decision - I lost weight, started exercising, and got smaller, perkier boobs. (The Original Girls were 38DDD - droopy, heavy, fibrocystic, and painful. Now I'm thrilled to be able to see my feet again, and I've even gone braless - for the first time since 5th grade!!!) And please don't ever discount another intimate relationship in your future! I was single my whole life, and figured I would be so until the day I died. But when I was 48, I reconnected with a guy I'd known since I was four years old, and we married when I was 54. So never say never!!! About the pics - there is a picture forum that is totally separate from this site, and is managed by a BCO member. Because of the sensitive nature of that site, the general rule is that you have posted a while here, to show that you are supportive of other women going through this disease. I'm not sure of the number of posts you need to have, but you can PM either nowheregirl or Lilah for permission to get access to the picture forum. Hang in there, Mumtothree - your surgery is almost here. Find something you love to do, and go do it. Stay busy, stay distracted. I was OCD about planning to have everything packed, everything ready, everything planned out. Then the big day arrived and it was over so fast, I never even opened my hospital bag. I thought I'd be so disabled for so long after the surgery, and that wasn't the case at all. I was way more independent than I thought I'd be. I still can't believe my surgery was 8 months ago!!! It's really flown by. Wishing you the best......",

It will be a general anesthesia, but no tracheal intubation, just a laryngeal mask airway. (Not quite as invasive.) Much of the skin is already numb from the BMX, but he will be doing  some extra pocket work once he gets in there (separating more pectoral muscle), so it will take a bit longer than usual. Still, I'm staying positive! Markat - wishing you the best on Monday! Even with scar tissue, hopefully you can come out with no drains! Beckers - I took pics the night before my BMX - not because I was mourning the loss of my breasts, but to remind me how imperfect they were before I started this journey...but just in case I got frustrated by the outcome of the reconstruction. I also took pics every step of the way (post-op, fills, etc.). Looking back, I'm glad I had a photo journal of the whole process. YAY, Tazzy!!!! May you continue to heal well and rapidly!!!! ChristyRN - Welcome to BCO!!!! You don't need to stress about reconstruction right now; many women choose (or must have) delayed recon. You are in the absolute best place for information and support. August Sisters - You know, I forgot to say earlier about how staying home is actually a good thing to do right now. Last year, three days before my scheduled surgery, I got SO sick from a snotty, coughing, sick teenaged clerk in the Apple store, that I had to cancel my BMX and wait another month to be rescheduled. I stayed home recuperating that entire time. We called it my Quarantine. And after I came home from the hospital, we told family and friends that they were welcome to call, but couldn't come over, because I was on - you guessed it - QUARANTINE!!! (Our family is notorious for showing up everywhere, sick as dogs, insisting \"I'm not contagious!\" ) Now that I'm going in for my Exchange surgery in 3 weeks, I'm back to wearing my surgical mask to all doctors' appointments, practically bathing in hand sanitizer, and spraying the soles of our shoes with Lysol when we come back from the clinic or hospital. Even if you haven't had your procedures yet, it's time to start being safe around germs. O.K., so I'm a germophobe!!! Thinking about Marilyn113,  Damiana, and Secret Agent who were scheduled for August 2nd (and we've already heard from our Tazzy!) Next up is Markat, RobinJoy, and Pointvalue who are scheduled on Monday, August 6th... you are all in my prayers!",

I got Xeriform (that wet, yellow, gauzy stuff) then a dry bandage over that, then lots of padding, and then a huge honkin' Ace bandage wrapped around me. I didn't touch the dressings at all until my Post-op, when he did the Great Unveiling, then wrapped me up for another week. Once those came off, I was free of bandages altogether. Justegan - HOORAY for negative nodes! Morphine didn't work for me, either. So my PS sent me home with Norco (like Vicodin, only less Tylenol in it) and Valium. That combination worked very well. Abby20 - glad you are recovering well! Omeggo - Bless you for still working while you are going through all this. Part of the reason I can spend so much time on the computer is that I'm retired. Tazzy - thank you for your kind words! I love to learn about people... and have been on different \"medical condition\" forums for a long time. Some of my best friends are people I've never met in person. Damiana - sorry you are dealing with questions regarding treatment, but sounds like you have a good support team, and are ready for whatever comes your way. Glad you are healing well! Shabby - Tuesday is just around the corner! I have TEs; in fact, have had them for more than 8 months. What would you like to know? You asked about waking up from surgery...I honestly don't remember being in Recovery. I did get to my room about 8 p.m. (had a late surgery), and vaguely remember DH giving me some ice chips to suck on. But at 1 a.m.  I was wide awake and chatting up everyone who came into my room to check on me Britishlass - the \"back sleeping\" part of the BMX was REALLY annoying! I'm a side sleeper! When I saw my incisions for the first time, I told my PS that my sewing teacher certainly wouldn't give him good marks for stitching...but that it was o.k. because I knew they would settle down eventually. Happy to hear about your good SNB; prayers that the rest will be clear. Hi, melmcbee! You wrote:  I just wanted to tell everyone how much better I feel and the worrying and stress before the surgery was much worse than the surgery. That is SO true! May everyone waiting for their dates take this to heart! Glad you are home and recuperating... prayers for your next steps ahead. HMP12IND - OW! Haven't had torticollis, but I know what it is. If the chiro isn't helping you, then it's time for a specialist. I know it can be chronic or acute, and that often it can go away by itself. On the other hand, it can mask other, underlying causes and is worth investigating. I know they use muscle relaxers and anti-inflammatories, and sometimes Botox injections. So sorry this is happening - I hope you find a treatment that works for you, and relief very soon!!! Nancedawg - I always have lower back pain if I try to lie flat on my back. Have you tried putting some pillows under your knees? That takes the pressure off your lower back. Hope you get your drains out soon! Mumtothree -  sooo glad you are home and doing well!!!! Pointvalue - waiting for that final pathology report is like waiting for the other shoe to drop. You are absolutely right about drinking water! I had a boatload of antibiotics in IV during surgery, and in pill form for ten days when I got home. I didn't get a vaginal yeast infection, but I DID get one in a fold of skin under my very swollen stomach! Who knew!!! Hope you continue to heal well! OttawaMom12 - I had some extra swelling after the drains were removed...guess it had to go somewhere, and for me it was my abdomen! I looked 8 months pregnant for a while! Glad you are home doing well. Hoping that Mlo69 and Christina do well in their procedures today; big prayers for our Monday girl: Onelife2012. ~~~~~~~~~~~ Random thoughts on: Catheter - when I heard my PS was going to give me a bladder catheter, I loved him even more. No struggling to get up in the middle of the night to use the restroom!  Of course, it came out the next day, but still.... Constipation - when we go through general anesthesia, our bowels slow way down. And if we take any narcotic pain relievers, everything seems to come to a complete halt. Forget prunes and fiber - if your doc has given you Colace or a stool softener, TAKE IT!!!! Trust me on this....you do not want to resort to Milk of Magnesia! Couch potato - someone mentioned those having better toned muscles experiencing more pain with TEs than those who are flabby and out of shape. That's pretty much what the PS told me. I went from 0 - 620ccs in only five visits. My muscles were mush. NSAIDS - (anti-inflammatory meds like Motrin or Aleve). Just be sure your doc has said it's o.k. to take these. They do cause excessive bleeding in some cases, which is why you're told not to take them before surgery. Some docs don't want you taking them right after surgery, either. Mine didn't. Just check before you decide to take them on your own. Get your doc's permission. Pain meds - were given to you for a reason. If you don't need them, whoopee! But if you do need them, it's better to just take them around the clock as per the instructions in the beginning. You can always taper off. But it is very hard to \"catch up\" to pain.

You put it between the seat belt and your chest. Try it out before you go to the hospital to see which one fits best, and how to place it so you're not trying to do it after you get discharged.

Fortunately, my appointment with the PS was right after that. \"Well, that's stupid.\" he said. \"You need to take the meds as long as you are in pain. If you still have pain, keep taking the meds. Just let me know if you need a refill. Your body can't heal if it's stressed and in pain.\" REALLY love this guy! Oh, and congratulations on the, um, great exercise with your DH!!! Now THAT'S a great way to keep fit!!! June56 - don't be surprised if you do have pain with your fills, it doesn't come until later in the day. That's when the heat and back rub come in handy. OttowaMom12 - LOVE the deep breathing exercises. I don't think any of us really take deeeep breaths during the day...especially when we're stressed. We need that oxygenated blood to make our muscles hurt less, and our heart rates to slow down to stop the stress hormones. Melmcbee - hope you get more comfortable with your port....

I went to Candlelight Christmas Eve at our church, but I had on a big sweater and a knitted scarf. I was also in no shape to accept hugs, so it really didn't matter. Christina0001 - the morphine didn't work for me, either. But the Norco (Vicodin with less Tylenol in it) was great. Lisa2012 - I've had the same thoughts about what happens AFTER the exchange....just five years of Arimidex!!!! It feels weird somehow.... Britishlass - I never met my Oncologist until three weeks after my BMX. Infobabe - Just like you said, I got my zip-front sports bras at JCPenney in a size larger than I normally wear!!! Love them! I even slept in them after my BMX. Oh, TrailGirl - they warned me about that before my surgery! I told them that thanks to years of deep, diaphragmatic breathing, my breathing rate was very, very, slow and often shallow....sometimes six breaths per minute. The nurse warned me that if I didn't breathe deeply enough I would set off the alarms!!! Glad you are o.k.! Did you have to suck on one of those incentive spirometers? They sent one home with me.

The the area where they took 3 nodes was alternately numb, or tingling, or shooting with burning pain. I also had pain down the back/underside of my arm for a long time. Then I discovered a lump in my armpit (SNB side) that was later determined to be a seroma. But none of the docs was very concerned, and told me that it would disappear on its own. It did. In the beginning, I remember wearing my MX camisoles or other lightweight camis turned inside out so the seams wouldn't rub on me. I also remember wearing a light bra OVER a camisole or soft Tshirt turned inside out, so my skin wouldn't be rubbed too hard. The good news is that usually it all settles down. I have no more armpit pain, and the sensation on the back of my arm is just slightly dulled to the touch. Glad you are coming to terms with being in the chemo room.

Mooleen - I got a Panasonic Wet/Dry Electric Razor # ES2207 - described here: http://www.walmart.com/ip/Panasonic-Close-Curves-Women-s-Wet-Dry-Shaver/10841766?adid=bzv_fb_revshr_001 I've only used it dry; I keep thinking I'll get electrocuted from a battery-powered shaver. It really does a nice job and gives a close shave. Check out the reviews on WalMart - lots of 5 stars. And CHEAP! Hi, Gma Foley! Are you feeling better today? Christina - any more dizzies? How did the drain removal go? Melmcbee - glad you are doing well! Jill - mine were the same way. I was busy talking and not watching the PS. I asked when he was going to pull the drains out, and he said they were already out. OM12 - yeah, those 3 hour naps were pretty standard for me. Sometimes I'd wake up, have something to drink, then sleep right through the night. The part of the drain that is inside of you looks like a flattened sprinkler hose with holes in it, so the sensation of having it pulled out can be weird. Lisa2012 - sounds like you and the noobs are getting along well. I deliberately took pictures all along, even the night before BMX, because 1) I wanted to document the process, and 2) in case I got picky about the implants not being perfect, I wanted to remind myself of what the Original Girls looked like. NOT GOOD. Give the implants time...they need to do that \"drop and fluff\" routine, and that can take months. Thinking about 30174, dc126310, and howhm021 who had their procedures today - hoping they are resting comfortably tonight.

I did wear a camisole (not the MX one; the elastic bothered me) - a lightweight tank style. I turned it inside out so the seams wouldn't rub on me. As my fills got bigger, though, it felt better when I wore a bra. I lived (and slept) in my Genie bras. Plenty of compression and support for weird shaped TEs and growing foobs, and easy to step into and pull up. In fact, that's what I'll be wearing after exchange on Wednesday, until the PS clears me to go get fitted for an underwire bra. Note - didn't know Penney's still had the zip-front sports bra in their stores, since I do most of my shopping online! Good to know!",

I'm having a bit of a hard time sleeping at night - I spend half the night in the recliner, and the other half in the pillow fort in bed.

We've been through a lot, and while staying busy and distracted helps, sometimes ya just gotta let those emotions out. Big hugs!!! Cottontail - The reason I was told not to shave, specifically on my SNB side, is that the removal of lymph nodes makes us more susceptible to lymphedema. According to my BS, we need to avoid getting BP taken, or blood draws from the biopsy side, as well as being super careful to not get any kind of cuts or abrasions that could let bacteria into the affected arm. A regular razor leaves tiny cuts in the skin - perfect for germs to sneak in to. She told me to use an electric shaver. It's kind of a moot point, though ....after menopause, I was left with tiny little gray fuzz instead of armpit hair. But it's more than just shaving.....check out the Lymphedema threads! That was something all my docs minimized when talking to me. Pointvalue - doesn't it feel good to have your \"gut\" decision validated by real evidence? Hi, markat! GmaFoley - WOW! 113 in Oregon?

Damiana - I didn't have orange peel skin, but I did have \"chicken skin\" as I got my first fills. Seriously.  It looked totally weird, but the PS said it was normal. The first time DH saw my foob rise before his eyes during fills, he actually laughed out loud and said \"That was amazing!\" Mind you, he's an old fart - 62 years old.

Went to the hospice thrift store yesterday and got a bag of books...that should last me a few days post-exchange! Thinking about dc1262310, whose procedure was yesterday.

On September 15, 2011, I got the call saying I had breast cancer. I decided to celebrate today by going to a luncheon sponsored by an amazing group of women breast cancer survivors and their supporters. What an awesome, upbeat, funny, and proactive group of women! When you are dx'd with BC, you can call their office, or go on their website, and request a tote bag of information. Then a breast cancer survivor delivers it to your house personally. The totes themselves are so pretty....beautiful fabric, with an embroidered angel and pink ribbon on the front. Inside, the totes are packed with wonderful goodies, including Dr. Susan Love's breast cancer book. My survivor sister and I hit it off so well that she and talked for three solid hours. I was hooked. Now I think it's time to give back, so I will be thinking of ways I might want to volunteer my time. They have a monthly luncheon, as well as other activities during the year. All funds go to supporting local women who have been diagnosed, or need services. I even won two door prizes today! (One from a raffle ticket another woman gave me as an anniversary present ) Afterwards, DH and I just went for a ride in the foothills and spent some quiet time together.  We had told family and friends that this process would take at least a year....and I think we're right on schedule. When we sat down to dinner, there was a beautiful card on my plate. (One o' them WORDY ones that kind of makes you cry, it's so sweet.) He just wanted to honor this day, and he did. May all my August sisters have a restful, renewing weekend!!!! xoxo",

(I was a 38-40DD/DDD) I knew I'd never be able to wear them again, so they were in the \"donate one of these days\" boxes. But after my exchange last month, I got curious. I pulled out a few bras, and realized very quickly that regardless of how much the underwire fit around the implants, the cups would never be filled, and would always have wrinkly, empty spaces. I knew, though, from reading bra threads, that minimizers are good for women who've had breast recon but not nipple or areola recon. Just before my PS appt this morning, I dug through the box one more time, and sure enough, found one I hadn't tried on. It's a front-closing underwire with a racer-type back, size 36DD. IT FIT PERFECTLY!!!!   I haven't been in for a professional fitting because the PS wanted me to wait. But when I showed him this bra, he was VERY impressed, and wrote down \"minimizer\" to share with his patients who complained that they no longer could fill a bra cup. The underwires tend to be wider, and the cups are shallower. I've been wearing it all day, and it's SOOO comfy! Can't post the name yet because I'd have to take it off. Anyway, had a good one-month post-exchange visit. He says I'm healing well; his only concerns are Lefty, who still has a considerable amount of fluid in the upper region (he says it's NOT the implant), and also a tiny area of incision that hasn't quite closed. So no pools for me yet. Righty is looking pretty darn good, except for what I found out was a small stitch protruding from the incision. I told him I was tempted to pull on it, but then I had visions of ripping out the hem of my skirt. He said to leave it alone and it will resolve on its own. Yanking on it creates a pinhole, which - as we all know - can get WAY bigger and cause all sorts of issues. So tonight I'm a happy camper. There are some loose skin issues and areas he may want to address later, but for now, I go back to see him in two months. Hope all my August sisters are having a relaxing Monday evening!",

I think I cried every day for three weeks when I got home from my BMX last year. I just wanted it to be OVER. I didn't want a long recovery, I didn't want to feel disabled, I was tired of feeling weak, I just wanted to \"turn the corner\" on pain and be done with it. It made me feel like a big weenie when I'd read about someone who went home from BMX, took a Tylenol, then ran a marathon the next day. Well, that was not me. My PS put it into perspective for me:  \"Pain stresses the body, and a body that is stressed does not heal. Take the meds.\" I got Norco (Hydrocodone) (same as Vicodin, but with less Tylenol) 1 - 2 tablets every six hours. DH set his alarm to give me my 4 a.m. dose. I also got Valium, 10 mg, 1 tablet every 8 hours. One day we were driving somewhere (probably a doctors' appointment) and all of a sudden, I realized I was feeling almost normal. It will sneak up on you slowly, but that day will come. Don't rush it. Be good to your body and give it the time it needs to make a comeback. I promise you it will. Big honkin' hugs to all of you.

Like GmaFoley said, make sure you're getting enough protein - the general rule, unless you are restricted for some reason, is 100 grams a day. For me, it made a HUGE difference! I supplemented my regular meals with Trader Joe's protein powder shakes, and organic turkey jerky. AND - stay hydrated!!!! Water is the best. Keep drinking it; flush the anesthesia, drugs, and other miscellaneous toxins from your body. And naps - even better! Years ago, whenever I would tell my mom that I'd fallen asleep and napped for several hours, she'd always say \"Well, Honey, your body must have needed it!\" I still hear her voice today, and listen to it. This morning was my first Post-Op visit with the PS since Exchange on Wednesday. I could tell how he frowned that he wasn't exactly thrilled with some of the things that were going on, but on the other hand, he did say I was healing well. Thankfully, I've known all about \"Drop and Fluff\" since last December, and knew that the day would come when I'd finally get my squishies, and even if they weren't perfect, I needed to be grateful. He did a TON of pocket work when he was in there. He removed a boatload of scar tissue from around the TEs, released the pectoral muscles at the bottoms and the tops of each breast, where they had tightened up, and did lateral capsulorraphies (narrowing of tissue pockets) to enclose the new implants. I still have loose skin at the bottom, which I think pissed him off, since he had said he would take care of that during exchange. Now he's not sure if that will resolve or not. And I have a huge amount of swelling on the left, all the way up to my collarbone, where he did a lot of the reconstruction. He says it's filled with fluid, so it's larger than the right side. But all in all, I'm happy. They're the right size, they ARE softer than TEs, but I still can feel them in a very distinct way when I flex my pecs. I'm sure that will lessen with time. Can't even think about sleeping on my side, due to all the soreness, but that, too, shall pass. I'm giving it 3 - 6 months before I even consider any revisions. Who knows, I may be so comfortable with them at that point, I'll keep them no matter what they look like. To those who just had their big surgeries.....hang in there! I promise you the fatigue will get better!!! Seriously - all I did was sleep for at least a month after my BMX...then three months later I started slow, just walking around the block. Then I started riding my bike, doing water aerobics, and power walking. I was definitely not one of those ladies who has a BMX, comes home, takes a tylenol, then runs a marathon the next day. I was a total couch potato. But I did get my energy back eventually!",

Don't need the Norco or Valium any more...even though I still have plenty of soreness. And LOTS of swelling - especially on the left side, where the PS did a lot of reconstructive work before inserting the implant. I'm still puffy starting just below my collarbone, all the way down to the bottom of the implant. But every day, I see changes. The big huge crease at the bottom of Righty has now diminished into a much smaller, smoother, indentation. Lefty still looks a bit irregular, but again - that changes every day. And as the swelling goes down, the shape will continually change. The human body is a wonderful thing. I'm no longer taking 3 hour naps, and am trying to slowly build up my stamina. PS says no arms for 2 weeks - no lifting over 5 pounds, reaching higher than elbow height, or doing anything that would raise my heart rate or BP. Tomorrow, DH will drive me to my Optifast class. I think I've gained about 3 pounds back in two weeks. That's what not exercising will do, even though I'm still sticking to the meal plan. The only difference is that I'm bumping up the protein temorarily. GmaFoley had a point when she said to watch out for soy protein and soy protein isolates; I failed to mention that the Trader Joe's protein drinks were whey protein. But having said that, I also need to mention that my Oncologist says that even the soy protein and soy protein isolates are o.k. in very small doses (like waaaay down on the list of ingredients) - and I'm 100% ER+. I just realized that there are only three days left in August!!!! I just wanted to say that I have no intention of leaving this thread of awesome women (and now guy); how about you? Let's keep this thread going, August Girls!!!! Love ya!!!!!",

They range from pretty cheap to kind of expensive. You can check your local medical supply stores or online for those. I didn't have a DIEP flap, but I imagine it would be similar to having a tummy tuck? So you are basically limited in the amount of movement sitting straight up, or twisting around to the side? On other forums, I've heard the advice, \"go in the front door, not the back door\". In other words, lean forward and reach in to do your business, not twist around to the back. Other suggestions that come to mind: a squirt bottle of warm water, a ton of flushable wipes, or just regular baby wipes. And if you still can't reach, perhaps some kitchen tongs, and wrap the baby wipes around them to extend your reach. Hope this helps.",

Prayers for Lisa and Lisag46 who are next on the list. ~~~~ Got a disconcerting call from the Surgery Scheduler this afternoon, telling me that my surgery was scheduled for the end of September. Well, I pitched a HUGE hissy fit (politely, of course ) letting her know that two people in her office had already confirmed my Exchange date of August 22nd. She patiently listened to my story, said how sorry she was, and how she would try to make it right by bumping another elective surgery. Well, I'm sorry too....but it's not like I'm getting big ta tas for the heck of it. This ain't AUGMENTATION, it's RECONSTRUCTION! ~~~~~ On another note, some drain tips for the newbies: We need to be REALLY careful with our drains. They are open pathways for infection to enter the body. It's good to have a drain station set up in your bathroom ahead of time. You'll have your measuring cups, your log to write in amounts, and a good idea is to have some alcohol wipes on hand. DH actually helped me with the drains. I would unpin them from my bandages, and he would uncap them and empty them into the cup, then write in the amount. I would then fold the bulb in half horizontally, and then roll it up to get all the air out. That's how the nurse taught me to do it. Then DH would carefully wipe the cap and the opening with the alcohol wipe as I kept squeezing the bulb tight, and when he put the cap back on, I'd let go. Be sure to empty your bulbs when they get half full, otherwise they don't have the suction necessary to drain off the fluid. My PS taught me this. The tubes can be filled with all sorts of gunky stuff, but as long as the fluid is still draining into the bulb, you don't need to worry. If you feel there is a big chunk in the way, you CAN try to \"milk\" the tubing and move the chunk. First, hold the tubing very close to where it exits your body, and pinch it tight. Don't let it move. Take an alcohol wipe or even a wet washcloth, pinch that around the tube, and pull downward. Remember, your hand is holding the tube where it exits your body (and it is also stitched into place.) Don't worry about breaking the tube; that sucker can stretch. Again, you'll probably never have to do this. Stringy gunk can accumulate in the tube without affecting the drainage at all. If it's been a while, and you're still having lots of drainage, or what's draining out is dark in color, ask yourself if you've been taking it easy as instructed. The more you move, the more fluid can be produced, and the darker the color can be. This is also a good time to be a bit OCD about germs. I never let anyone touch my incisions except the PS, and I never let anything touch my body (towel, cami, sports bra, gown etc.) that wasn't freshly laundered. DH even wore surgical gloves when he emptied my drains. ~~~~~~~~~~~~ For all those worried about ugly button- and zip-front clothing, just remember, in no time at all you'll be able to wear your regular clothing, so don't spend a fortune on the other stuff. This is just temporary. I ordered some new summer satin jammies online...they sure help sliding in and out of bed without using your arms.",

Once I started getting fills, the TEs actually started feeling better. They moved off of nerves that had been compressed, I think. Valium seems to be a common Rx for muscle spasm....I also had DH massage my back muscles, and took a nice hot shower before bedtime after I started getting fills. I think you will probably always have some weird feeling (steel plate, iron bra, boulders) with the TEs, but your body and your brain do adapt to that feeling at some point. There came a day when I actually did NOT think about the horrible feeling in my TEs, only when I consciously did so. Then it was easier to stay distracted, and not feel like I could not possibly stand the fills, much less the 3 month waiting period before exchange. But that day will come! Hugs to you.....",

      "Content": "Sep 4, 2012 01:34PM Blessings2011 wrote: Beckers - no, I didn't have to lose weight before I took Arimidex - it just turned out that way. I lost weight for two reasons: 1) my TEs were inserted when I was much heavier, and they were huge. I asked my PS what would happen if he put in permanent implants to match the TEs, and later on I lost weight, and he said the implant size would not change. So I told him I wanted to stop my fills at 620ccs, and that I'd be back when I got to my normal weight, because I didn't want stripper boobs. When I saw him again, 50 pounds lighter, his first comment on examining my TEs was \"Whoa! They look so much bigger now that you're so much smaller!\" Ya think?   So when I got my permanent squishies two weeks ago, I knew that they were the appropriate size for my frame. 2) The second reason is that my MO wanted me on Armidex (generic form: Anastrozole) last March. (I'm 100% ER+.) I argued with her that not only was I post-menopausal, but I'd already had a hysterectomy, so there was NO estrogen in my body!!! She kindly pointed out that estrogen is produced in body fat, of which I had plently. So I joined the Optifast program at Kaiser and have lost 50 pounds so far. I still want to lose another ten pounds (I'm 5'5\", and want to get down to 140.) I wanted the MO to know I was serious about getting in shape, because if the side effects are too rough on me, I may decide to stop in favor of QOL. She said that by dieting and exercise alone, I have reduced my risk of recurrence by 23% - not bad, when you figure that my initial risk of recurrence after BMX was only 1% - 2%. I also want to lose just a bit more weight in case the Anastrozole does cause me to put on weight. But in any case, I will have to continue to keep my activity level up anyway if I want to maintain this weight loss. Then again, I could be one of those women who have NO side effects on Anastrozole!!!",

It's a tricyclic antidepressant at higher doses, but used for other issues at lower doses, such as pain management and in my case, quality of sleep. I'm off all meds now (due to Optifast) but I used to take 10 - 40 mg at bedtime. I'm still in the recliner for half the night, and in bed the other half.

I promise you, side-sleeping will be in your future again one of these days. ~~~~~~~~~~ I am two weeks out from exchange, and doing well, except for the fact that I thought yesterday would be the day the PS lifted my restrictions. Wrong! He INCREASED them. So no lifting, reaching, driving, exercising, etc. for another two weeks. He's just being very careful with the excess swelling on the left and wants to make sure all the internal sutures are healing properly. I've gained a tiny bit of weight, but not stressing about it. I've upped my protein to over 100 grams a day, and I'm not exercising a bit. So I'm not surprised. You can't be on this diet and NOT exercise! But I have more important things to do - like heal - right now. I also saw my MO yesterday. She was VERY happy with the weight loss, and VERY firm about starting the Anastrozole now. So no more reprieve. I took my first one last night. Just now, I was sitting here sweating and cursing the evil hot flashes....then I realized that I'm wearing my heavy, fuzzy, winter robe. DUH. So far so good! Ladies - please do not fall into the trap of comparing yourself to any other woman on BCO. Our bodies are all unique and wonderful and we heal at totally different rates. We react to different things. We respond to different meds. As I've said before, I wanted to be one of those women who had a BMX, took a Tylenol, than ran a marathon the next day. Well, guess what....I wasn't. I had to finally wrap my mind around the fact that I needed the pain meds, and that being in constant pain was just another stressor on my body. And a body that is stressed does not heal. It didn't mean that I was a big weenie, although in retrospect, I do think DH deserves a medal for putting up with nearly a month of my weeping..... So - we are who we are. Awesome, brave, and persevering....and let's get through September being good to ourselves and each other. (And come here for a good rant whenever we need it.)

I was such a weenie, I didn't even consider it. But the pain and discomfort you are going through now will give you a good, natural outcome in the future. Shabby - that TE tightness, unfortunately, can last til exchange. But not the constant pain and discomfort. You just always know they're there, just because of the construction (hard backs). But you get used to it pretty quickly. I found that a combination of Norco and Valium worked for me.....around the clock at first. Trinity0723 - you can be an honorary August Girl and hang out with us!!! As for your mom, maybe you could make up a list of ways she can help and post it on the fridge.  And as for middle daughter, well, I have six grandkids. We told them all that Grandma was in Quarantine both before and after surgery. They're always sick, and their parents are notorious for lying about \"not contagious\"... I couldn't take a chance on picking up any bugs. So no babysitting by us for months! Seriously - months!  Hi, Lisa2012! Christina - Did you take a hot bath last night? When we have general surgery, our blood pressure usually drops, and sometimes it takes a while to get the anesthesia out of our systems. When we take a hot bath or shower, our blood pressure can drop even further, making us dizzy, lightheaded, and nauseous. Be sure to drink lots and lots of water and stay hydrated! Hi, melmcbee! You're right. Those TEs are sneaky. They will tell us later,  in no uncertain terms if we've done too much. Mooleen!!! Getting ready? Hi, Houndmommy - we'll be surgery sisters on the 22nd!!! To all of you who are sleeping in recliners...how do you deal with the handles? I have one recliner that would be super to sleep in, but the handle is hard enough for me to pull back even now. I can't imagine doing it after surgery.How does that work for you? My PS says no using my arms for two weeks! Thinking about Kc2009, omeggo, and hmp12Ind, who had their procedures today. Hope they are resting comfortably tonight. Sending up prayers for our August 16th girls: 301724, Dc1262310, and howhm021 who have their surgeries tomorrow!",

I did keep a log when I got home from the hospital, because I didn't want to overdo it on the pain meds. But yesterday I bought one of those giant daily pill containers for each day of the week (has sections for each day, four times a day), and will put all my new meds and supplements in there so I can tell at a glance if I've taken all my pills or not. It's kind of weird - when I went on my diet last March, the docs took me off ALL my meds except for Synthroid. (I had been on about a dozen meds per day.) Six months later, all my bloodwork is normal, and I don't need any of the prescription drugs any more. But I do need to keep track of the Anastrozole, the probiotic, the baby aspirin, the fish oil, the calcium, the magnesium, and the vitamin D. How did your appointment go? Did you get your seroma drained?",

Using them was a pain, it took forever to clean, and I always felt guilty about throwing away all the pulp that collected. Then we got our Vitamix blender. That thing could pulverize concrete blocks!!! We put in whole fruits and veggies and blend them all up. They say the motor is as fast as a jet engine. It's about that noisy, so I don't doubt it. But everything you put in it is completely blended up - no nutrients are lost. And - this is another neat feature...you can put in raw veggies, and the longer you blend them, the more they heat up - just from the heat generated by the friction of the spinning blades...so nothing is cooked out like on the stove. DH has his fruit smoothies every day. He'll throw in whatever's in the fridge, or whatever we get at the Farmer's Market. I used to make my protein drinks in it....lots of water and ice and whey protein powder from Trader Joes, plus Greek yogurt and fresh berries. Now I make my Optifast shakes in it: for breakfast, 2 cups of water, 1/2 cup of ice, 1/4 cup of fat free cottage cheese for protein, 1/2 cup of frozen blueberries, and a packet of vanilla shake mix. OMG - YUMMY!!!! At night I like a bowl of ice cream....so I'll put a cup of fat-free Lactaid in a baggie and freeze it. Then I put that in the Vitamix, throw in some frozen banana chunks, and for fat, I have raw almond butter and if I'm in the mood, some sugar-free Torani syrup. It comes out soooooo yummy, and without the almond butter it's fat free, and no added sugar. This is the link to their home page. Warning - they are NOT cheap. We got ours at Costco after standing around like rubes watching a demo. After the first few samples, we were hooked. https://www.vitamix.com/ After I'm done with my Optifast plan, I will definitely be doing more of the anti-cancer recipes. I love my Vitamix because nothing is lost - peel, core, seeds, whatever you put in it is totally blended to a smooth mix.",

      "Content": "Oct 12, 2012 01:20PM Blessings2011 wrote: MUMTOTHREE - WARNING - BIG LONG HONKIN' POST!!! You asked about my diet. Unfortunately, it wouldn't be appropriate for you right now, in active treatment, but later on, only if you have 40 or more pounds to lose. I went into the Kaiser Weight Management Program. (Open to the public.) It was Optifast, basically a liquid fast for the first four months, for a total of 960 calories a day. It was intensely medically monitored every week, with regular blood work and physicians' exams. Weekly meetings with our \"cohorts\" were mandatory, which included picking up weekly products, and weigh-ins, plus an hour of classroom time and sharing/support. For four months, I had four milkshakes a day, one soup, and one nutrition bar (all Optifast products). I ate no other food at all.  We had to drink a gallon of water a day, and exercise was mandatory. We were given pedometers, and I'm surprised they didn't implant them surgically. Around week 3, the energy kicked in. My exercise prior to that had been sitting on the couch and reaching for the remote. I had severe fibromyalgia, and the few attempts I made to exercise had been rewarded with more pain, so I quit. My first attempt at exercise, I limped down to the mailbox and back, hanging on to DH's arm. Soon, I could do it myself. Not long after that, I went walking around the block, then two blocks, and soon I was walking for an hour. I have several neurological disorders that have destroyed my balance, and years ago I fell off my mountain bike and never got back on again. So DH bought me a bright raspberry colored adult trike, and it felt great to be able to zoom down the bike trails without fear of falling. But my best work was done in the Therapy Pool at our local Rehabilitation Hospital. The water is kept at 94 degrees (heaven for sore muscles and joints) and I found I was able to do 90 minutes of workout (cardio, aerobic, resistance, stretching, and strengthening) in the water. I could never do that on dry land. A wonderful benefit to the liquid fast was that my fibromyalgia pain nearly disappeared. It wasn't from weight loss, because it happened in the first month. It was from the fact that Optifast is gluten-free. In July, we completed the fast, and started the \"Transition\" phase, adding regular food back into our meal plans. We follow the American Diabetes Association's meal guidelines, and portion controls are strict. We weigh and measure all our food, and log in what we eat. We have a list of options to choose from. I'm still not back on any starches (breads, rice, starchy veggies, cereals) and I don't plan to be for a while. And when I do, it will all be gluten-free. We finished \"Transition\" two weeks ago, and had our graduation celebration. So far, I've lost 56 pounds, and more than 65 total inches. I feel better and younger  than I have in 20 years. I've gone from taking 12 prescription medications a day to two, and all my labwork is normal again. I originally went into the program as ammunition against my oncologist.   When I met with her after my BMX, she wanted to put me on Arimidex. I protested loudly. Not only was I post-menopausal, I'd had a hysterectomy, so there was NO estrogen in my body!!! She kindly pointed out that estrogen is manufactured in body fat, of which I had plenty. I called the weight loss program the next day. She was thrilled to see me again when I finished the program, and told me that my risk of recurrence had been reduced by 23% just by diet and exercise. (And yes, I did start the Arimidex....) The program is expensive ($4,300), long (82 weeks), and takes an incredible amount of discipline. We had several members drop out. I kept going because I looked at it as my breast cancer treatment. I hadn't needed chemo or rads, but I COULD control my weight, so to me, it was medicine. Cheating wasn't an option. Now we are in the \"Lifestyle\" phase, which means we meet once a week to weigh in and monitor our progress, and continue to learn in class and support each other.  Even though it's technically an 82 week program, it's really for life, and the support will always be there if we want it. I still want to lose another 10 pounds, though...they say Arimidex tends to put on weight, so I'd like a little margin. I also have to get cleared to go back to my water aerobics program. There's a tiny area in Lefty's incision that hasn't healed, so until that does, no 94 degree water for me! So there you are. What I did was drastic, but being 100% ER+, I thought it was worth it. There are many other ways to reach the same goal. The principle is the same = eat less, move more. I'd amend that to eat HEALTHY and move more. I used to tell my university students \"Sometimes you just gotta take care of business, and right now, school isn't your business.\" (They had other personal or health issues to take care of.) For you, going on a big diet right now doesn't seem like the smart thing to do. More importantly, I would think you'd want to make sure you are putting good, nourishing things in your body, and staying as active as you are able to. You are still in the healing process, so just be good to your sweet self. ",

Fortunately, I have a balance disorder, and have had lots of experience in falling.  I no longer stretch out an arm to stop myself. DH said I was momentarily airborn, then I tucked my arms in, fell, smacked down hard on my knee, then hit my shoulder and my head. He said my neck snapped pretty good, too. He was sure I'd broken my shoulder or my collarbone. Well, the good news is that I laid there and cried for a few minutes, just because it scared the daylights out of me, but I was able to sit up, and assess that nothing appeared to be broken. But when I pulled up my pants leg, it looked like I had dislocated my knee: there was a golf-ball sized swelling off to the side, and another one starting at the top of my kneecap. We packed it with ice, and elevated it right away. We called Kaiser and got in to see the doc and get Xrays....nothing broken but I did rupture the bursa in my knee. The bad news: no walking at RFTC tomorrow. However, I do have a wheelchair, so I will be WHEELING for the Cure tomorrow. DH will be my lovely assistant. I hurt all over today...and I think I have whiplash. But I did get a relatively good night's sleep last night (thanks, Norco and Valium!!!) and one more night should be even better.

I know I'm just an email away, and that I will have regular appointments with my Oncologist to monitor the Anastrozole, but sheesh....for over a year, my calendar has been filled with nothing but doctor and hospital appointments. For a brief moment, I had this \"NOW WHAT?\" feeling.... Since I didn't have rads or chemo, I think the return to just regular life might be easier. I think if I'd gone through treatment, I'd want to take some time to reflect...to heal....to be extra good to myself and let my mind catch up with my body as it recovers from the rigors of rads or chemo. I think there would be a big paradigm shift in seeing myself as a strong, healthy person who can do anything she wants without her body rebelling on her. I've gone through a bit of that, but not much. I can only imagine. Dear Omeggo, that day will come for you. You will have a chance to determine who and what you want to be for the rest of your life. I sure see things differently now...and I'm seeing how the choices I've made in the past have not exactly led to my being that strong, healthy person. Mentally I thought I was doing o.k., but physically, I wasn't my best. And that meant that mentally I wasn't my best, either. Sisters - we have it within us to create the lives we want, with what we've been given. Just know I think of you daily, and am keeping all of you in my prayers as we go through these challenges. xoxoxo",

Because of the way they are constructed, they have a hard plastic back that rests on your chest, and pushes all the saline out in front to stretch the skin and pectoral muscles. (Either that, or out to the sides, giving us those attractive \"side boobs\".) Have you been over to the \"Breast Implant Sizing 101\" thread? Whippetmom is our resident implant sizing guru. There are so many factors that go into choosing the right size of implant for you. Regardless of whether or not you choose saline or silicone, they will never have that forward projection that the TEs do, that makes you look you're a walking chest of drawers with the top drawer pulled out all the way. They will be softer, and nestle down into the pockets, and conform themselves to your chest wall in a much different way. That being said, there are ways to choose implants that give you a similar appearance and projection as your TEs. Like I said, Whippetmom is a genius. I went to my PS with her suggestions, and he used exactly the brand and type and size, and they are perfect for my frame. ~~~~~~~~~~~ nbnotes - The Roller Coaster of Emotion is a cruel carnival ride that no one wants to get on, and sometimes there seems to be no way to stop it. Please read Omeggo's eloquent words in support of counseling. It's one thing to have understanding friends, and to come here where all your sisters love you and support you, and \"get it\". But it's a wonderful gift to give yourself to be able to meet with a therapist once a week and just get it all out. Life is painful and confusing enough with cancer. If there is a chance that counseling can ease your mind just a bit, then it's totally worth it. Just be good and gentle with your sweet self. Love you and praying for you!!! ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Tazzy - happy retailing. We're on our way to the beach. I need beach therapy. Bad.",

Scrub up well, then with your left hand, grab the tube where it exits your body. Pinch it and Hold it tight. Then with your right hand, use an alcohol wipe, and pinch the tube tightly. Holding on tight at the exit site, use your right hand to pull down on the tube as far as feels comfortable. The wet wipe will make it slide easier. Don't worry about breaking the tube...those suckers are stretchy! When you've gone far enough, then move your left hand down from the exit site, pinch again, and with your right hand, repeat the stripping motion. (It's kind of like milking a cow.) Keep repeating until all the fluid in the tube has moved into the bulb. I will warn you, though, that there can be all sorts of stringy gunk in the tube that never moves down into the bulb. As long as fluid can get past it, it doesn't matter, and the gunk can stay there til the drains are removed. Here is a really key part: always empty your bulbs when they get half full, or there won't be enough suction left to pull fluid from your body. AND - after you empty the bulb, fold it in half horizontally. Then roll it up to squeeze all the air out. Use an alcohol wipe to clean both the opening to the bulb, and the little plastic cap that goes into it. Then insert the cap. This way you are creating the maximum suction for your drains. As for leakage around the exit site, you could possibly have an infection there, having nothing to do with drains themselves. After my drains were removed, the right side stayed open for a long time, and looked awful. But the PS said to leave it alone, and that it would close up when it was ready. I was armed with tubes of Bacitracin and bandages, but he said no. Always check with your PS if ANY infection is suspected! Good luck to you.....",

But my MO told me she wanted me on 5 years of Arimidex, because I was 100% ER+. Having read all the horror stories on BCO about the SEs from AIs, I pitched a hissy fit. I told her that absolutely no way was there any estrogen in my body - that I'd gone through menopause at age 47, and had a complete (ovaries included) hysterectomy at age 48. She very kindly pointed out that estrogen is still produced in the body, especially in belly fat, of which I had plenty. That's what prompted me to go on that Optifast plan. I wanted ammunition so I could argue further for no AIs. But somewhere along the line I had a major shift in my perception. Once I had lost the weight, my risk of recurrence dropped another 23% - down to 0.77%. Taking the Arimidex would further reduce that tiny risk by 50%. I thought about how I had dodged the chemo and radiation bullet, and how many women wish that taking one pill a day would have such a benefit. I heard my mom's voice (herself a BC survivor for 27 years) inside my head, saying \"Honey, you won't know until you try...\" Long story short - I am taking the AI. Started Anastrozole on September 5th. So far, so good. ~~~~~~ Yes - it's been quiet around here, and I, too, hope that everyone is doing well and just being busy with life. I see my PS this afternoon....Lefty is still having issues. Righty is behaving well...becoming nicely rounded, soft, and perfectly in place; Lefty is still swollen and higher up on my chest, plus there are some areas of thickened skin that are starting to bother me. There may be a revision in my future, but I'm just too tired to deal with it right now.

The PS said it was just excess fluid from all the pocket work he had to do, and that it might take 2 - 3 months for it to resolve. Well, tomorrow it will be 11 weeks out for me, and Lefty still sits a bit higher than Righty, which really isn't noticeable unless I'm totally topless, and pointing it out. (Which I'm usually not... ) A few weeks ago, I started noticing a thickening in the lower, inner corner of Lefty, near the IMF. I thought it might be scar tissue forming, and possibly preventing the implant from fully dropping into the pocket. I had all sorts of images in my mind about a possible revision down the road, and while I WOULD like more symmetry, I just don't have the energy for more surgery. So I saw the PS after lunch today. He said the thickening was just fatty tissue, and that he still felt the swelling in the upper pole was excess fluid that would eventually resolve. He didn't believe it was part of the implant sitting too high. He did say I could try to massage that area more to see if it would go down. I talked to him about symmetry, and that was hard, pointing out EXACTLY what I felt could be improved. After all, that's his creation I'm criticizing! He took it very well, and said that if I wanted a revision to make Lefty match Righty exactly, he could try to remove Lefty's implant, put in a smaller one, and overfill it gradually to see if we could make it match Righty. At that point, I said that 1) this would involve more surgery and more recuperation time (which I would DREAD); 2) when we start fooling around with MILLIMETERS of change, there's no guarantee it will work; and 3) I could end up with a worse result. He agreed. He knows I am a member here, and also on the picture forum, and am well aware of the difficulties some ladies have had just getting to where I am now. I said that while I was sad to hear there was no easy fix, I was glad to hear that there still could be normal changes down the road for me. I also told him that I felt blessed to have had the good healing I've had since the BMX in December, and that if these are the New Girls I'm supposed to have, I consider myself fortunate. DH says he only notices the differences in The Girls because he has taken numerous pictures of them (for my photojournal) ever since my surgery in December. Otherwise, he couldn't tell at all. So now it's time to move on...I've been released to exercise in the therapy pool, and can't wait to get back. I'm finding more of my old bras I can wear, only now they look GREAT instead of my huge old boobs being squished into them. And who knows....there may be a trip to see Vinnie next summer!!!!

Then I poke it some more (doing a \"more extensive medical examination\"), and a hard, yellow lump comes out, leaving a tiny gaping hole.  Of course, I was FREAKING OUT!!!!  Naturally, I poked it some more, got some more fluid out, then it bled a bit, and stopped. Brilliant researcher that I am, I consulted Dr. Google, and determined that I had a \"spitting suture\"... how lovely!!! Apparently, after surgery, not all dissolving sutures dissolve. Some of them can be rejected as foreign objects in the body, and they become inflamed or infected, and gradually work their way out of the skin, using the path of least resistance. In my case, it was my supposedly closed up incision. I treated it with hydrogen peroxide and Bacitracin, and emailed my PS. He confirmed that it was most likely a \"spitting suture\" and to keep doing what I was doing and to come in if the redness did not go away. I changed to alcohol wipes in order to dry things up, and now it looks pretty good. There was a place on Lefty that looked like it was going to do the same thing, but I took care of that with the hydrogen peroxide/Bacitracin/alcohol regimen. Well, I had planned to go back to the pool after New Years to work off some of this excess poundage that seemed to cling to my gut, but with the incisions springing leaks, no pool for me!!!

My mom was living at home until she fell and broke her hip, had a heart attack, and then before the hip replacement, needed an emergency quadruple bypass. She never lived at home again. She was end-stage Parkinsons and just needed more care. Taking care of our elderly parents is one of the most exhausting tasks ever - physically, mentally, and emotionally. But ya know what? It can also be the most rewarding. I had my mom in board-and-care for seven years, and in a skilled nursing facility for three years. I don't regret a single moment I spent caring for her. When she passed four years ago at the age of 88, I knew in my heart that I had done everything I could for her in her last years. I couldn't arrange for God to call her home and end her suffering, but I sure could direct her medical care so that she didn't fall through the cracks and get ignored. Bless you, Darlin', for what you are doing for your mom. You will never regret a minute of it. May she heal well. PM me any time.  xoxoxo",

As for me, I am getting used to the New Girls. I decided to stop calling them FOOBS. They are, after all, a part of me now. Except that I wish they FELT more like a part of me. At times, they still feel very tight inside, like an internal bra...or.....GASP!!! TEs !!!! But I understand that will pass .... eventually.... I signed up for the \"Restart\" program at Kaiser - that's eight weeks of Optifast products to get us in shape for the upcoming holidays. I stopped exercising after my exchange (Ps's orders, thanks to the pocket work) and the pounds came slowy creeping back. I made the decision to walk at our local Komen Race For The Cure in two weeks. Regardless of whatever political opinions I may have of corporate Komen, I adore the woman who is our local organization director, and appreciate the fact that around 90% of all funds raised remain here in our local area to benefit local women. To All My August Sisters  - I've been on other \"medical issues\" Internet forums for 11 years. Some of those folks are the best friends I've never met in person. We've kept each other sane through the darkest  times, and laughed and celebrated together during the best.   It's amazing what a bond forms when you are allowed to just be yourself in spite of your issues, and when you know in your heart that others understand. As for prayer - I do pray - for everyone here - that we all are able to deal with the challenges that come our way....and that - most importantly - we never let a bunch of statistics define who we are.",

Unfair as it is, we all get to deal with a new normal, and that can be a daunting process.

In talking with my MO this morning, she was telling me how many times women don't take the time to grieve the loss of their breasts, or their \"perfect\" health, until long after treatments - including surgeries - are all done. THEN they can stop focusing on getting through each tough day, and gradually, all the emotions begin to surface again. I had my BMX in December 2011. To tell you the truth, I've felt like I've lived in a cave since then. It's only been recently that I've had the drive or the desire or even the energy to get out there and participate in life again. When we went to my nephew's for dessert on Thanksgiving, I hadn't seen some of those family members for over a year. And we live in the same town! I just didn't have the energy to make the effort to keep connected. Yes - I'd say that baby steps are totally appropriate. Your surgery was relatively recent. Our \"new normal\" doesn't come easily. Be good to your sweet self, and if you still feel down in the coming weeks and months, please consider finding a good counselor to talk to.

He wears a surgical mask in public, we practically bathe in hand sanitizer, and when we come home from someplace, we always spray the soles of our shoes with Lysol. So do any visitors who come to our home, once we've made sure they're not sick.  Beckers - hadn't even thought of a cruise! Great idea! Completely staffed with medical personnel, too, just in case.

From November 5 to December 5, I didn't leave the house except for pre-op appts. And I always wore my mask. Same thing as for my exchange. Two weeks beforehand, I went into \"quarantine\" so that nothing would jeopardize my surgery date. For those of you going through chemo, I hope you are taking extra precautions right now... My DH has severe kidney disease and is on Prednisone and Cyclosporine. His immune system is destroyed, and he cannot fight off any infections. We buy our surgical masks by the case, and  practically bathe in hand sanitizer. Our social life has been curtailed, thanks mostly to ignorant people who show up everywhere sick as dogs and spread their germs around. Some family members are the worst! I caught a cold from my FIL, Mr. \"I'm not contagious\", and I was furious. He was coughing in our faces, not even bothering to cover his mouth. I made DH take the iPad over to his house and made him watch this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K_boO2oceI I also sent over some information from the web explaining that we are contagious for 48 hours BEFORE we show symptoms, and for up to 1 - 2 weeks AFTER our symptoms go away. DH and I also spray Lysol on the soles of our shoes before we enter the house - especially when we've been to the hospital or clinic or nursing home!!! In fact, my PCP was the one who told me that I should wear a mask any time I came to Kaiser....that there were lots of sick people there, and that many germs were airborne.

I saw my PS for the last time today (waaaaaa). It feels weird...I'm still having issues (\"Iron Bra\", muscle pain, etc.) but I think I've come to the end of his expertise. My TEs are swapped out, my permanent implants are in, the incisions are healing well, and except for the excess fluid from pocket work, and a new pinching pain under one incision, I think I am done with his services. He said he'd be available for at least another year, and if anything came up regarding the implants themselves, I could email him or come in for an appt. Unless I had something that needed surgery, he would defer my treatment to other departments, i.e., Oncology. Luckily I have found an awesome Myofascial Massage Therapist and LE Therapist who is helping me with my pain issues. I'm not where I want to be, but I'm getting there. Hope everyone is having a relaxing evening! xoxo",

Even though you didn't have chemo or rads, you've been through a lot. My SIL has MS - she has her good days and she has her challenging ones. It's a balancing act. I was fortunate that my dx came along 5 years after I retired. I really feel for all you young'uns that are still working! Tazzy - thanks so much for bumping this up!!! I tried that IDC 2013 thread, but all the posts moved so fast I kept getting lost!!!  Wishing you great news on the 28th... Hi, melmcbee!!! You're done with chemo - yay; done with rads - yay; exchange coming up in 3 months....more yay!!! You've been through so much....and working, too! No surprise about the low energy levels... here's hoping you feel better and stronger every day!!! nbnotes!!! So glad you were able to have an LAVH - that makes SUCH a difference in recovery time, and I know you've had multiple surgeries already.  Glad you are tolerating the Arimidex well so far. Hi, GmaFoley!!! Hope you had fun at the party. ~~~~~ Well, I had a mini-meltdown last month... it's been six months since my exchange from TEs to 700cc saline implants. I never once felt that \"AHHHH\" feeling you're supposed to get after surgery, and in fact, it got worse. It felt like a vise grip around my chest, and every time I raised my left arm (cancer side) I had a painful \"snapping rubber band\" sensation down the middle of my implant. I still had extreme swelling on the left side (up to my collarbone) as well as that excruciating \"Iron Bra\" feeling 24/7. I tried to talk to my PS, and he thought the New Girls looked good...what exactly did I want him to do?  I saw a Certified LE therapist/PT at the hospital who was totally useless - she ordered me $600 worth of compression garments that had no effect at all... Finally I found an awesome myofascial release therapist who got rid of the fluid buildup in only 5 visits. She also started reducing my pain and tightness from scar tissue and fibrosis. But then I got really angry and questioned ALL my decisions for reconstruction. I contacted Dr. Khouri's office in Miami for micro-fat grafting and implant removal. I wondered if I should have had a DIEP. I was mad at everyone on my medical team, when only months before, I adored them. I started thinking that they had only fed me minimal amounts of options in considering my reconstruction. Anyway, long story short: I went to see a terrific therapist who helped me see that I had a lot going on in my life before the BC dx (including my husband's kidney disease) and I never really had a chance to deal with any of the other stressors until now. She said that I just now finally allowing myself to acknowledge everything that had been going on, and that while some of my concerns were legitimate, (pain and stiffness, physical complaints, etc.) that I was being really hard on myself in second-guessing my choices. So today, here I am, six months out from exchange. The New Girls are not so new any more, the Iron Bra is loosening up, and I think I've decided that risking another surgery for revision is not worth it, considering that the outcome may not be better than what I've already got. I'm just SO ready for closure!  I'm tolerating the Anastrozole pretty well; I have a lot more aches and pains, but that just means I need to move more. I've kept off 50 of the 60 pounds I lost, but still fit into my size 8 jeans (WOOT!). All I can do is take it one day at a time. I think that's all any of us can do! I think of all of you often, and hope you all are doing well!!! xoxoxoxo",

I got my dx a year ago last September, and had a BMX with TEs in December 2011. In March 2012, I entered a weight loss and exercise program, and to date have lost 60 pounds and more than 65 inches. I didn't do it to look good; I did it to save my life. I am 100% ER+, and it was one thing that I DID have control over. I didn't need chemo or rads, so I looked at this as my breast cancer treatment. I had my exchange surgery in August 2012, and today, I look better and feel better than I have in 20 years. That BC diagnosis saved my life in SO many ways!!! It was definitely a wake-up call for me. And it made me reevalutate many things in my life. I am grateful for the little things, and don't give any energy to the stupid things. Yes, there are sad stories here. Women with metastatic breast cancer (Stage IV) can be very ill, and it is devastating when we lose a sister.  But in the year and a half I've been here, I've also read incredible stories of courage, perseverance, and bravery. Every single woman here inspires me in one way or another. Could I have a recurrence? Absolutely. But I'm not planning to. When I was working, I made a poster for my office that said \"It's never too late to become the person you've always wanted to be.\" That's what I plan to be doing in the next 30 or so years. It sounds like your life is in turmoil on several fronts right now. I totally agree with Wren - when getting through the day becomes impossible because of our thoughts, it's time to get help. A good counselor can be a wonderful gift you give yourself, and can help you learn new ways of coping. Oh, yeah....my mom had BC. She was dx'd at the age of 60 - same as me - and went on to live a very full life until she passed at the age of 87 from unrelated causes. Wishing you peace and comfort....",

She had a radical mastectomy, no recon, no treatment. Back in those days, it was either \"benign\" or \"malignant\". In the back of my mind, I always wondered if each year I had my mammogram, would this be the year something showed up? Ironically, nothing ever showed up on my mammos. Instead, I had some tiny bleeding from my left nipple one morning. Seven diagnostic procedures later, they told me I had multifocal cancer: two areas of DCIS, and two smaller areas of IDC (invasive ductal cancer). I was offered a lumpectomy and radiation, but because of my history (Mom's BC, 30 years of birth control pills, 10 years of hormone replacement therapy, and heavy, dense, fibrocystic breasts) I chose a bilateral mastectomy (BMX) with immediate reconstruction. At the time of my surgery, the Breast Surgeon (BS) removed all the breast tissue. During the operation, the Sentinal Node (lymph node that \"lit up\" when I was injected with a radioactive isotope)) was removed and sent to the lab. They sent back word that there was no cancer in the sample they looked at, so no more nodes were removed. (My final path report showed clear margins all around, no lymph node involvement, and no evidence of cancer in the right breast. My tumors were very tiny, and in fact, there was not even any evidence of the IDC - they said the biopsies had removed it all. I did not need chemo or radiation, but I will need to take Arimidex for the next five years to remove estrogen from my body.) After the BS finished her portion of the surgery, the Plastic Surgeon (PS) stepped in, and through the incisions the BS had already made, made pockets in between my pectoral muscles and inserted tissue expanders. TEs are like deflated implants. They have a metal port, and once you heal from your surgery, they are inflated every two weeks until there's enough room to insert a permanent implant (saline or silicone). I was sent home with two surgical drains, which didn't hurt a bit. They were sutured into place, and in my case, covered with an Ace bandage so the tubes never moved. DH was my \"Drain Man\", emptying them and keeping charts. When the PS removed them two weeks later, I didn't feel a thing. I hate pain as much as you do, and I have to tell you that none of my biopsies hurt more than a bee sting or a little pinch. The mastectomy itself wasn't all that painful because breast tissue is mainly fat and glandular tissue. I did have some pain right after the insertion of the tissue expanders, but my PS was awesome and send me home with wonderful drugs. I had no complications, and was completely filled in five office visits. Other ladies will say that these fills were painful, and they needed medication to get through the procedures. Some PSs will make you wait three months for your permanent exchange; mine will take longer because I am in a weight loss program to lose 40 pounds, so I won't have my permanent \"squishies\" until September. However, the surgery - for both TEs and implants - is relatively quick as long as there are no complications. Other ladies choose to reconstruct from their own tissues (LAT flap, DIEP flap, etc) so there is no \"foreign body\" like an implant inside them. These surgeries require PSs who have good experience in doing the procedure you want, the surgeries are longer and there are more phases, but there are also wonderful outcomes in doing it this way. Many ladies also choose no reconstruction at all and are very happy. I chose implants, because at the age of 61, I wanted my BMX scars to show that I was a warrior, but also that I have a body that needs taking care of for the next 20 - 30 years. I thought after a 50 pound weight loss, I would deserve to have perky foobs (fake boobs) even if nothing else on me was perky. If for any reason there are complications, or the implants fail, I would not hesitate to go natural. There is just no right or wrong, but there are factors that affect your choices. Will you have radiation or chemo? You may not know this until your final pathology report come in after your surgery. This can affect the timing, and the type of recon you have. Wishing you and your sister the best...",

The only thing they did differently on me was have me take Prednisone, Benadryl, and Tagamet the morning of, because I am allergic to iodine. Like you, I thought it would be pure torture. But I was pleasantly surprised. I never even felt the needle go in, because it is very small, and goes into a hole that is already in your nipple. Are you having this done because you have a discharge from your nipple? That's why I had mine...I had bleeding in my left nipple. In order to locate exactly where to place the needle, the tech did have to express a tiny bit of blood just to find out where it was coming from. Then the Radiologist put the needle in the same place, and injected the dye. She had a lot of trouble at first, because apparently my duct was almost completely blocked. So she had to keep trying over and over, apologizing the whole time. But you know what? It didn't hurt! And I am a BIG weenie about pain. When she did get a bit of the dye in, I told her when I started to feel a change in sensation, and she stopped. Then we went over to the mammogram machine and took pictures, with the needle still in. The idea freaked me out in the beginning, but it was no different from any other mammo. Talk to your doc. Not sure if they can put you out, but perhaps they can give you something to calm your nerves, as you do need to move from the table to the mammo machine. BTW, right after we were finished with the ductogram, I walked over to the Ultrasound room and had an ultrasound core-needle biopsy. THAT one I got a shot for, that numbed the breast. The ductogram doesn't feel anything like a shot. Good luck to you!",

I put a memory-foam topper on the hospital mattress, then a padded mattress cover, so it was VERY comfy. I used extra pillows to rest my arms on at my sides.  The best part was when I wanted to get out of bed - I would just lower the knees, and raise the back up to a 90 degree angle, then swivel my legs over the sides. Easy peasy. I had an over-the-bed table, and Dh had hooked up my reading lamp on the bookshelf to a remote, which he attached to the hospital bed remote. It made me feel very independent, yet I was able to follow my surgeons' directions to not over-exert myself. What also helped was taking my pain meds on a regular basis (Norco and Valium) and when I was able to shower after the drains came out, I would have DH massage my back muscles first. Then a nice warm shower, and sleeping was much easier. I would say that the best thing you could do would probably be to put soft pillows under your knees at night to take the pressure off your back. Did you get any muscle relaxers? Those might help. I finally WAS able to sleep on my side with my TEs. Then they got completely filled, I lost weight, and now it's hard again. But not for long! It will get better, I promise. One day you will find yourself doing things you thought you wouldn't be able to do for a long time. Wishing you good healing.....",

That was 3 years ago, after 20 years of regular, annual mammograms. The mammos never caught it. I was very diligent, and it did me no good. As I waited for my surgery, the breast surgeon told me that by the time they are detected, most cancers have been in the body for 8 - 10 years, according to Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book. Right now you don't have bad news, you just have news. Find something you love to do, and do it. Stay busy. The waiting is the hardest. But we are here for you. And Mom?

I was initially offered a lumpectomy w/ radiation, but after a LOT of research, discussion, and prayer, decided on a BMX. Influencing my decision were many factors - my history, my mom had BC, I'm post-menopausal, a UNI on the left would mean a lift on the right, and it would be hard to match them up, and my Radiologist really felt that there was something on the right even though mammography did not show anything. My BS was up front about the lumpectomy. She said that because of my multi-focal cancer, she would have to take a wide wedge of tissue to get clear margins, and I might not be happy with the results. She was leaning towards UMX. I told her I wanted a BMX, and asked  if she would recommend that. She said that she was not recommending that, but that it was certainly an option that she would fully support. (Sounded like a CYA situation, really....) Had my BMX with TEs in December and am awaiting exchange surgery for permanent implants in late summer/early fall. My whole medical team was very supportive, and I have absolutely no regrets at all.",

But the truth is, sooo many mammo call-backs are just for precautions, because the mammogram is not a very precise diagnostic tool. That's why they back it up with an ultrasound, just to be sure. Yes, there may be additional tests recommended, but you're not there yet. And - so many of these repeat procedures just verify the presence of benign growths. Look at it this way - the better image you get, the more reassured you can be. If it does turn out to be anything more than benign, then you will simply take it one step at a time. This is a fabulous site with awesome women and incredible information. We hear you, and we care!!!!

The tissue itself is \"cribriform\", as opposed to \"comedo\". The invasive cancer is very small, and they caught it early. The right breast was clear on screening mammography, but later showed some possible \"suspicious\" areas that would require additional testing. In the beginning, I had numerous options. I knew I could have lumpectomy w/ radiation, or a full-on, bilateral mastectomy w/ reconstruction. I did the research, read the forums, talked to women I knew who had gone before me. I did have that thought - oh, gee, a mastectomy would prevent me from having radiation or chemo....wrong! We won't know until after the final pathology report. I learned that several of my friends had undergone a lumpectomy, thinking that this was the least traumatic way to go...until they needed another lumpectomy, then another, then finally a mastectomy. I have other friends who had a single lumpectomy years ago, and have recovered beautifully. But the final factors for me were 1) in the grand scheme of things, how important to me are my breasts? and 2) how much worrying do I think I will do over the rest of my life (I'm 60) about what else might be going on in there? The answers, for me, were easy. I have very large, droopy, dense breasts. Self-exams are impossible, as the tissue is very fibrocystic. Mammography is at best a guessing game, and there still may be areas of cancer on the right that just haven't shown up yet. I always wanted a reduction, but never got around to it. I'm retired, and I have the time for recuperation from surgery and reconstruction. I don't have to take care of a family, and in fact, have a wonderful DH who will be taking care of me. I'll be having the BMX w/ immediate reconstruction on December 5th. A lot of emotion goes into making these decisions. Try to get at least as much factual information to back it up. Write it down, talk it up, and once you have made your decision, never feel like it was the \"wrong\" one. Best wishes to you!",

Each doc is different in the way he or she advises their patients, so don't try to diagnose yourself. I will say, though, that itching and rashes are not all that uncommon after surgery. You just want to be sure you're not looking at any kind of infection! The area where your former boobs ended and your chest started is called the Inframammary Fold (IMF). I know my TEs were pressing down hard on this area, and I could feel the bottom ridges of the TEs at first. This is where the PS is creating the pocket for your future implants. The other thing that can happen is that nerve endings that were cut during surgery often act up and cause tingling and other unpleasant sensations. I know the area around my IMF was VERY sensitive for weeks! Hope you feel better soon!!!!",

Here is some really good information about understanding your diagnosis: http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/diagnosis We all go through that anxious stage, wondering if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes and the rest of the body. In my case, my IDC was found through biopsies, and the tumor type was defined in the preliminary pathology reports. Generally, the spread of any cancer is determined if it is found in the lymph nodes. Some women have node biopsies prior to their surgeries, others have them at the same time. Mine was done at the same time as my surgery. You already have good news in that the tumor is not attached to the chest wall. The rest you will take step by step. What they will do is send the lump that is taken out for a final pathology report, and this will give you a better idea of the next step. Seriously, knowing the plan in more detail goes a long way to dealing with the unknowns. I was diagnosed in 2011, I am healthy today. Wishing you the best... please keep us posted.",

Here is just my opinion: a doctor would order a core-needle biopsy over a fine needle biopsy just because he/she can get more information from the core needle. The fine needle is great for withdrawing fluid from cysts, or getting smears of breast tissue for slides. But the core needle is able to get a much wider range of tissue to be examined. I don't think one necessarily spells BREAST CANCER more than the other. I had numerous tests and biopsies, and I've had two Ultrasound-Assisted Core Needle Biopsies. Here is my experience. Mine were done in the ultrasound room. My breast was exposed, and the tech put the gel on it so the radiologist could use the wand to see the tumor/suspicious area. Once the tumor was located, then the Radiologist gave me a numbing shot in the breast, which sounds way worse than it is. The shot stings for a very brief moment, then the tissue goes numb. When she was sure that I couldn't feel anything, she had the tech isolate the exact area of the tumor, and she inserted the instrument that has the core-needle on it. She put the tip of the needle into the mass, and counted to three. She explained that I would hear a snapping sound as the instrument took a tiny bit of tissue, but should feel nothing. She was right. She did this several times to get several samples, and even though I could feel pressure as she moved the instrument around, I didn't feel any pain at all. I could have looked at the ultrasound screen if I wanted to, or watched the needle go into my breast, but I chose not to. I figured if I couldn't see it, it wouldn't hurt. I was right. In fact, we were talking the whole time, and I remember laughing at quite a few things that were said. I was very comfortable. Afterwards, I got a bandaid, and an ice pack to stuff inside my bra for the ride home. I kept icing the area for the rest of the night, and except for a bit of bruising, had no after effects. If you ask for some anti-anxiety meds beforehand, you might get them, but you in that case you may want a ride home. Seriously, if you don't want to watch, just close your eyes and do some deep breathing. It will be over before you know it! Wishing you the best....",

There is a HUGE possibility of frostbite in those areas - especially if any fatty layers of tissue under the skin have been removed. I once got a sunburn through my clothes that turned my TEs a bright red. The PS said absolutely NO ice, but a cool, moist compress would be o.k. The same would apply, I think, to heat. Nothing HOT, but something gently warm to the touch on a normal part of the body. Sometimes it's just a matter of tricking the brain... often it has a hard time discerning two different sensations at once, and if it senses warmth, then that's what you might perceive instead of pain. Always check with your PS first. Hope this resolves quickly for you!",

There are other posts here on BCO dealing with radial scars...you can do a search for them using the Search feature on the left side of the page. I know you are nervous and scared, but it sounds like you are in good hands, and are having the appropriate procedures done. Please try to take a big deep breath, and remember that the majority of breast lumps (and radial scars) are benign. They just want to do the biopsy to make sure that's all it is. If nothing is found, then you will have peace of mind, and an idea of what you need to do to keep an eye on things in the future. If for any reason something else is found, you will have time to deal with it then. There are some wonderful women on this forum, and we are here for you. Praying for a quick and successful biopsy tomorrow, and good results for you! Please come back and let us know how you are doing....",

One thing you might ask the dentist is whether or not he uses PRP in his practice. This is platelet-rich plasma, which is made from a small sample of your own blood. It is spun in a special centrifuge, then inserted into the wound, allowing healing to take place at an accelerated rate.

The Breast Surgeon suspected a papilloma, but sent me for more tests, just to be on the safe side. The first thing she told me was to stop squeezing the nipple, as it may make it difficult for the Radiologist to express any discharge when needed to identify the duct. Within two weeks, I'd had seven more diagnostic procedures: screening mammogram, diagnostic mammogram, two ultrasounds, ductogram, two ultrasound-guided core-needle biopsies, and finally a screening mammo on the right. The ductogram was incomplete, as the duct was almost completely blocked and they couldn't get the contrast material in. The core-needle biopsies showed that I had mostly non-invasive cancer, with a micro-invasion of invasive cancer. I had a bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction last year. I had no chemo, and no radiation. But that's just me. You have to keep in mind that the MAJORITY of breast lumps and conditions are benign. I think it's a good idea to go to a breast surgeon, only to make sure that all possible tests have been done, and that you can get a clear diagnosis of a benign problem. If it IS a papilloma, it will have to be removed, only because they will continue to grow and cause problems. But this is not breast cancer. I think you are doing exactly what you need to be doing, if only to give yourself peace of mind. If anything changes, and you do find out there is something there, then you've already come to the best place ever for information and support. In the meantime, try to take a deeep breath and relax. Let the test results come in, and see what the surgeon says. Wishing you the best!!!",

I wondered why I got a numbing agent for the biopsy, but not for the ductogram. Well, the reason was that I didn't need it for the ductogram! Once the spot of blood identified the exact duct that needed to be examined, the Radiologist was very good about inserting the cannula (a REALLY tiny tube) into the duct. Because there was quite a bit of blockage, she had to try multiple times to get the tube in all the way, apologizing the whole time. I kept telling her it was o.k., because it didn't hurt. When she finally got the cannula in far enough to start inserting the contrast medium, I had a weird feeling for a few seconds, and then shortly I told her the feeling changed to a distinct fullness. She said that was her cue to stop inserting the dye. At that point, they walked me over to the mammography machine, and with the tube still taped in place, took several mammograms. Even that didn't hurt, considering how bizarre it must have looked. I think you will find that the anticipation is WAY worse than the reality!",

Grrrrrrr....  My reasons for BMX are similar to SheChirple's. I was dx with multifocal cancer in my left breast on September 15th. I had two areas of DCIS, and one area of IDC. The breast surgeon said she could do a lumpectomy, but that she'd have to take such a large wedge of tissue, I probably wouldn't be pleased. I also had very large, dense, droopy breasts - 38DD (more than likely DDD). I considered a UMX, and knew right away that no amount of reconstruction on the right would make it match up to an implant on the left. My mom was a breast cancer survivor - radical MX, no recon - so I knew I had multiple risk factors, and the thought of mastectomy was not foreign to me. Add that in with some \"suspicious\" areas on the right, and a wonderful radiologist who did her best to discover every tiny bit of cancer, and the decision was easy. On December 5th, I had a BMX with immediate recon (TEs). The DCIS was three times bigger in the left breast than had been seen on imaging (but that's pretty normal) and there was NO evidence of the IDC. There was also no evidence of cancer in the right breast. SNB was normal, and final path report showed clear margins everywhere and 0/3 nodes normal. I won't need chemo, I won't need radiation, and after I see the Oncologist on Friday, I will probably be on Arimidex for five years. I am so glad I made this decision. No more waiting and wondering from mammo to mammo - will this be the year they find something? It was always in the back of my mind. You don't need to suffer with this, chawkins. Depression really is a slippery slope. As a retired counselor myself, I am a huge advocate of therapy along with medication. Sometimes ya just gotta get it out of your head, and with someone who won't judge you, coerce you, or tell you you're wrong to feel what you feel. It's wonderful to not have to carry that burden around by yourself. First, see if any of your docs have a referral to either a medical social worker who specializes in cancer patients, or any other therapist who works with chronic diseases. There are many qualified professionals who counsel - Social Workers (LCSW, MSW); Counselors (MFT), Psychologists (PhD); and Psychiatrists (MD). In my experience, though, most psychiatrists do not do a whole lot of talk therapy. They are, however, the ones who can prescribe medications. You can also call your local hospitals and see if there are any breast cancer support groups. This is often a good way to get involved in a network of caring professionals who can help you along this journey. You are young, chawkins. You don't have to feel this bad. I am praying that you will find some relief from all this stress, and find the exact answers you seek for your future treatment. Big hugs to you!",

If you say it was the worst pain you ever experienced, I believe you!

It was multifocal, meaning that it was in two places in my left breast. The BS offered me a lumpectomy with radiation, but warned me that because of the two different locations, she'd have to take such a big wedge of tissue I might not be satisfied with the outcome. She said I may want to  consider a UMX. (Unilateral mastectomy) 2.  The \"original girls\" were big (38DDD) heavy, droopy, painful, and fibrocystic. I always wanted a reduction but couldn't afford one. I thought about the UMX on the left and how that would mean a reduction on the right...and how that would be a major surgery, and how difficult it would be to match them up. 3.  My mom had breast cancer, diagnosed at the same age I was. She had a radical mastectomy on the left, and no further treatment. I'd always suspected I'd get it some day, with all the risk factors I thought I had, and I realized that I didn't want to play the waiting game with my remaining right breast. I decided to have the BMX with immediate reconstruction (tissue expanders), and my medical team was very supportive. I had my surgery on December 5th, my SNB was negative, and all my margins were clear. That meant no chemo, no radiation. It did mean that my MO wants to prescribe Arimidex for five years due to my ER+ status. My BC diagnosis was a wake-up call for me. I have absolutely no regrets over the choice to have the BMX, and am looking forward to perky foobs. (Heck, I could have perky foobs when I'm 80!!!)   I delayed reconstruction until I could lose weight. This did two things - made sure I would get the correct sized implants, and reduced my risk of BC recurrence by another 23%. I've lost 45 pounds with 15 to go. I work out at the gym, do water aerobics, ride my bike, and walk. I haven't felt this good in over 20 years. Wishing you the best at your MO appointment!!!",

Then I pull them down to cover my toes, and my shoulders get cold! You are very welcome, Brandi. CoolBreeze - Oh, they're definitely washable (100% cotton only) and washing them only makes them softer and cuddlier.  You like to put yours over the top of you, so your shoulders and the tops of your legs are covered. Got it. Some of our quilts are rectangles, some are squares. I think I'd want one that was just big enough to not fall off or slip down, yet still be big enough to tuck in around me if I got colder. Kayfh - Wow...having someone just show up at my door because a store gave them my name and address would creep me out too! So glad you were able to educate the owner. And you ended up with a beautiful quilt! Yay! Thanks for your kind words... Lumpynme - I think 40 x 50 is pretty standard, but usually the design is up to the individual quilter. She can use blocks of whatever size, and add pretty sashing and borders to make the quilt a little bigger, so usually they're all a little different. I can understand about not wanting your PICC line buried under layers of blankets.  I wanted to ask questions because I didn't share the same experience you all do. Thank you so much for answering. ~~~~~ I received two gorgeous lap quilts when I had my surgery. One was made by a church friend, and had blocks that were signed by all my Bible Study sisters and our Senior Lunch Bunch. The other one was made by the ladies in my quilting class, and each one had made a heart block out of different fabrics, and signed it. In the beginning, each quilt graced my bed on different days. Now one is folded and hung over the back of a chair, and the other is folded and hung over the back of the loveseat in the bedroom. They are loving reminders that others cared. As for the quilts we donate, I always make sure I give them to a person (Breast Care Coordinator, Oncology Social Worker, etc.) who knows the patient they will go to. I give them free reign over how they are distributed. (For example, a tiny woman in a wheelchair may want a smaller lap blanket that won't get tangled in her wheels, so she can use it all the time.) One of our latest projects is making quilts for veterans who are being discharged from the local VA hospital to go home on hospice care. They will be getting quilts with a patriotic theme. I'm working with the Palliative Care nurse on that one. Ladies, thank you so much for your input! You are all in my prayers. Any more thoughts or suggestions? I'm passing them all on to our groups!",

I did find myself in the role of comforter, which - as sbelizabeth put it - wasn't fair. I finally had to let those folks go and find their own comfort. I told several friends in personal emails.

I've never heard from her since then. I don't have the energy to listen to excuses, so I haven't called her. Like MiniMacsMom I set up a CaringBridge account - with a password. Once I put the word out on Facebook, I let friends know the password, and I was amazed at all the beautiful responses I got on my \"Guest Book.\" Maria - can you talk to your parents?

Self-exams were useless, so I relied heavily on mammograms. When my mom was dx'd with breast cancer at the age of 60, I knew my risk might be higher. I begged my PCP to PLEASE let me have an ultrasound or MRI in addition to my yearly mammograms. He refused, saying \"Those are not screening tools.\" So every year, I would get a cheerful little postcard announcing \"Congratulations! Your recent mammogram shows no evidence of breast cancer!!!\" Except that 8 months after my last mammogram, in September 2011, I began to bleed spontaneously from my left nipple. THAT got the doc's attention! (I was 60 years old.) Two days later, I was sitting in the breast surgeons's office. She initially thought it was a benign papilloma, but ordered additional diagnostic tests just to be sure. After seven more procedures, they found DCIS, with two microinvasions of IDC (invasive ductal cancer). Nothing had shown up on the mammogram. Long story short - in December 2011 I had a BMX with immediate recon. I did not need chemo or radiation, and in August 2012 I got my saline implants. The point of this is not to scare anyone, but to make sure you are assertive with your doctor if you feel that just annual mammograms are not enough to give you peace of mind. And if your primary care doc, or your OB/GYN just don't get it, then go see a breast specialist.",

I'm so sorry you are going through all of this right now, and it's so hard to come to terms with anything until you have ALL the information in front of you, and can formulate a treatment plan. From your signature line, it looks like you have a smaller invasive ductal cancer, clear lymph nodes, and are Her2 negative. In the grand scheme of things, those are all relatively good things. ER+ means that there are additional drugs to treat you that other women may not benefit from. Most all women who have lumpectomies for IDC will also have radiation. If the posts you read here make you anxious, please remember that there are many women who do NOT have major complications, but they are not posting on threads dealing with problems. Do you know if you had the Oncotype test done? That usually gives good information as to how much chemo can benefit your type of cancer. I'm so sorry you lost a friend to cancer. Cancer does just suck. I think all of us go through the \"death sentence\" thoughts at one time or another. But that just isn't the case. We all deal with the reality of the possibility of a recurrence, but we get as much information as we can, go through the treatments we believe are best for us, then make the transition from cancer patient to living out the rest of our lives. If the cancer does come back, we deal with it then, but right now, it will probably be easier for you to take one day at a time. Yeah, people want to be helpful and tell you not to worry. Most of them don't know what else to say. Here is one suggestion I have: stay away from Dr. Google! In many cases, he is a liar and a fearmonger. And in the beginning, when we don't know what to expect, our minds can take us to scary places. I was dx'd with DCIS and IDC last September, and had a bilateral mastectomy (BMX) with immediate reconstruction (tissue expanders) in December. I'm awaiting a date for my exchange surgery. FOR ALL NEWBIES: I think joining this forum right after you've been diagnosed is the smartest thing anyone can do. In fact, this is the only website my MO will let me visit!!! But here's how I see it: there are thousands of women here, many of whom have been posting for years, and seem to have developed strong friendships. I think that's awesome, but for the newly-diagnosed, it may feel weird to just butt into a thread as a stranger. Butt away!!! You won't be a stranger for long. No matter what you are going through, someone here has experienced it. It's like being a brand new driver. You're comfortable on your own street, where you know the neighborhood and the lay of the land, and now you have to merge on the freeway? In rush hour? Are you crazy? Joining this forum can be like merging on the freeway. But come on in.....we'll make space for you, and drive with you down this strange and frightening road. We'll help you navigate the sudden turns. If your car breaks down, we'll be here to assist you. If you need a ride, you can jump in our cars. We'll get you where you need to go.

I was referred to a breast surgeon, who immediately suspected a papilloma, and told me it would have to be surgically removed, because it would continue to cause bleeding in the future, and would only get worse, not better. In the meantime, she referred me for extensive diagnostic testing to rule out anything else. My Radiologist was awesome. She had the tenacity of a pit bull. After 7 different diagnostic procedures (two screening mammograms, two diagnostic mammograms, a ductogram, and two core-needle biopsies) it was determined that I did not have a papilloma at all, but rather two areas of DCIS (non-invasive cancer) and two very tiny areas of IDC (invasive ductal cancer). Because of my history, I chose to have a bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction. When the breast tissue was biopsied the day after my surgery, there was no invasive cancer to be found! When I asked why, they said that sometimes the core needle gets it all. I was fortunate. The cancer was very tiny, caught very early, and I did not need chemo or radiation. It's been a year now, and I am finished with reconstruction. I am very pleased with the way the New Girls turned out. What I hear you saying is that you have had a biopsy, and a papilloma was confirmed. Now your surgeon wants to go back in and excise the duct to make sure the margins were clear. That makes perfect sense to me. When the contents of the core needle biopsy are examined, they know what they got, but not what was left behind. There's no real reason to suspect the worst here. The reality is that MOST breast lumps are benign! I would imagine that having this surgery would give you the peace of mind you need, knowing for certain that it was nothing more worrisome than a papilloma. It has been my experience (both personally and reading posts here on BCO) that most breast surgeons are usually VERY proactive in ruling out cancer... not because they suspect it and are not telling you, but because you deserve the most diligent care you can receive. Wishing you the best!!!",

It was the one thing I feared the most. The day of my surgery, I was taken down to the room where I would get the shots. The Radiologist kept apologizing profusely, telling me how sorry he was that the shots were so painful, but necessary. The Tech was glued to my side, clenching my hand as if I were about to give birth. I got no numbing cream at all, and while the shots (4? 5?) did sting, they were nothing compared to the huge cortisone shot I had recently gotten in the bottom of my heel that left me weeping and screaming for the doctor to stop. So with that as my \"10\" on the pain scale, those shots in the breast didn't even come close. This is not to minimize anyone's experience at all... we are all different in how we react to pain. (I think my foot doctor - who I love - said I was the worst patient he ever had...) But I think it's important for newbies to know that while some women do have a horrific experience, others do not, and those women generally don't post about it.",

I felt so popular! Then I remembered the Tech's advice. I started massaging my left breast like there was no tomorrow.  I don't know how long it took, but I suddenly realized that my Pre-Op cubicle was at the very end of the room, and my curtains were open. The ENTIRE ROOM - staff and patients -  could see me squeezing my left boob!!!

Gee...first time THAT was ever a bonus!!! I had tons of extra skin (and it would get looser after every fill) and my pecs were just, well, mush. I never worked out. I was a total couch potato. So after 180ccs of saline in the OR, I quickly got to 620ccs in five visits. I never had any of the pain or muscle spasms that many ladies experience. You just couldn't see the TEs very well, as they blended into my fat gut. Now, though, I have a different problem. I've lost a considerable amount of weight (and blubber, or, um, padding) and now my TEs seem huge and rock hard. I've also been working out frequently, trying to make up for lost time until I have my exchange next month. I know the PS will be doing a lot of pocket work when he gets in there, and I'm hoping to get back to exercising quickly after exchange. Oh, yeah....my other brilliant thought: never, EVER compare yourself to anyone else here! We all heal and recuperate at different rates. I had this ridiculous \"Today I'll turn the corner on pain!\" mantra in my head, and when it didn't happen right away, I was SO down! So don't do that, ladies.

You won't be allowed to wear any deodorant, lotion, or powder under your arms. If you do, then you'll be asked to go wash it off in the restroom. The mammogram room itself is private, you'll put your stuff on a chair (unless your facility has lockers) and you'll walk up to the machine. The tech will take off one side of your gown at a time. I think the weirdest part for me was having such huge breasts, and watching the tech trying to place them and turn them just right on the plates for the best views. Your arm may be raised and you'll be holding on to a bar or another part of the machine. Once your breast has been placed properly, flat on the bottom plate, then the top plate will be gradually moved down until it touches your breast. At this point, it's best to take a big breath and relax, because the tech will gradually tighten up the space between the plates, mashing your boob flat. It may hurt, but only for a moment. Keep in mind that the flatter they can make the tissue, the better images they can get. You'll stand very still, (can't remember if I had to hold my breath or not) and the tech will take the picture. As soon as it's taken, the pressure on your boob will be released. Then they'll do the other views, in which the plates are turned, and your boob will be placed between the plates on either side, and pressed vertically for a picture. Then they'll cover you up on that side, and remove the gown from your other shoulder, and repeat the procedure. It really is quick, and then they'll ask you to wait a few minutes while they show the images to the radiologist. If there is something that is not clear, you may be asked to repeat some views. Then when you are done, you get dressed and go home. If you're going back to work, or going shopping, I suggest you bring along some deodorant!!! ~~~~~~~~~~~ As far as the ultrasound goes, again, you will undress to the waist and wear a hospital gown. The US room is darkened, and you will lie on a padded table (ask for a pillow for under your knees if that's more comfortable.) with a pillow under your head. Depending on what your doc is looking for, you may be asked to roll slightly on your side, with your arm raised. The tech will be sitting at the machine, which is right next to you. You can watch the screen if you want. She will start by squirting some warm gel onto your breast, and then using a wand, move it over your breast to find the areas they want to look at. She may move the wand back and forth many times, and may press hard to get at exactly the right spot. She will hold the wand there, and key in instructions on the machine to take the picture and describe the location. Again, this doesn't take long, and afterwards, you'll be given a towel to wipe off the gel, and you can go get dressed and leave. The tech is not allowed to make any diagnosis; that all has to be run  through the Radiologist.",

The bad news is that tumors do not always show up on mammograms, and according to Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book, by the time most tumors can be seen on mammography, they have been in the body for 8 - 10 years. Now for the good news: It sounds like whatever is going on really could be in the early stages. Usually, PCP (primary care physicians) are quick to hand over breast cancer cases to breast surgeons, and rightly so. You should have gotten a written record of your biopsy report. Maybe it's too early for a printed copy, but someone should go over what details they have. Always ask for printed reports on any procedures you have. I would imagine that the BS (breast surgeon) will spend some time with you, telling you what information has been gained so far, such as what type of cancer, location, size, grade, stage, and any other information that has come back after testing such as estrogen and progesterone status, and Her2Neu receptor status. He or she will also talk to you about your options, and your best recommendations for the type of surgery that will be best for you. Sometimes they just can't get all the information from a biopsy, and have to wait until after surgery for the final pathology report. It's kind of like waiting for the other shoe to drop. Look at it this way - defining a breast cancer diagnosis is kind of like handing a 1,000 piece jigsaw puzzle to the surgeon, only with 500 pieces missing, and saying \"Now, put this picture together.\" They really do need most of the pieces of the puzzle to adequately create a diagnosis and treatment plan for you. So the wait time can be agonizing. Don't let it get to you. Find something you love to do, keep busy, and take things one day at a time. Soon you will have more information, and soon you will be more confident that you are making good decisions and are in the right hands. Wishing you the best...please keep us posted!!!",

I'd been a university counselor for more than 25 years, and loved my job, but my health issues (including increasing blood sugar levels) had started getting in the way. (BTW - my favorite job was being the Reentry Counselor - for older students returning to college to complete their degrees. It is an amazing spark of energy to recall the feeling of being, well, SMART and CAPABLE - things that vanish quickly as we grow older and life gets in the way. Congratulations on your accomplishment!) So there I was, feeling as if I was going through the motions....taking numerous prescription medications, feeling guilty that I didn't have the energy to make the kind of life I wanted to have in the second half of my life. I always had all the necessary lab work, took all the meds, had regular mammograms. But I was overweight, and nearly disabled with fibromyalgia. All my mammos were normal, but one morning I had spontaneous bleeding from my left nipple. Seven diagnostic procedures later, they found invasive ductal cancer. I was dx'd with BC just short of my 61st birthday. I had a bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction (tissue expanders) in December 2011. It was a small cancer and caught early. I could have had a lesser surgery, but knew in my heart I had made the right decision. The final pathology report showed that there was no lymph node involvement and no cancer other than what they had initially detected, and thus I did not need chemo or radiation. I recovered well from the mastectomy and expansion, but in the process, I learned that my cancer was estrogen-positive. I argued with the oncologist that I would NOT need the estrogen blocking medication because I was post menopausal and had already had a hysterectomy. She kindly pointed out that estrogen is manufactured in body fat, of which I had plenty. At that point, I made the decision to enter a medically-supervised weight loss program. It was basically a four month liquid fast, with a two month back-to-food transition period. Along with the diet, we had to exercise. Being a committed couch potato, I would much rather lie on the couch, eat chips, and watch mindless TV. I hated exercise. But I went into the program with the mindset that THIS was my medical treatment. And because of that, it worked. I started out walking - limping, actually, around the block at first, then progressed to power walking. I have a neurological condition that affects my balance, and had a bad fall off my mountain bike years ago. I never got back on. So DH bought me an adult trike, and off I went! Finally, I joined a water aerobics class at the local rehabilitation hospital, where the water is kept at 94 degrees. It all worked. I lost 56 pounds and more than 64 inches. Better yet, I went off ALL my prescription medication, except for thyroid. And the best part of all, was for the first time in my life, I felt strong and healthy. Even the fibro pain was gone, thanks to the fact that my diet was gluten-free. Last month, I had my exchange surgery. I have two new gorgeous noobs (new boobs) which make me happy. My risk of recurrence is very small. My life has changed in so many GOOD ways....none of which would have happened without the BC diagnosis. So here is my point: while this is the scariest thing you've gone through, and the waiting sucks, the reality is that the majority of women with abnormal mammos usually turn out to have benign results in the end. And if it does turn out to be breast cancer, you are in a wonderful place to find support and resources. No matter what the outcome, you will get through it day by day. (Hope this wasn't too much sunshine and roses...yes, there were weeds along the way, but today I'm focusing on the garden.) Wishing you the best!!!",

Getting a BC diagnosis is like getting the wind kicked out of you, getting run over by a steamroller, being sucker punched, and any other devastating thing that could happen. Everyone processes information differently. For me, I'm a \"knowledge is power\" kinda gal. Even though my background was in medical counseling, I learned almost everything I now know about breast cancer from the awesome women on this forum. Rozem and Denielle are right - all your treatments will be based on your individual diagnosis....and you may be asked to make some decisions that you don't feel equipped to answer if you don't have all the complete information. We all know what it's like to be in that hellish waiting period before we have an actual plan. But here's the problem with not wanting to know the details: our minds will most often take us down that scary, worst-case-scenario path. We will often imagine the worst, whether we want to or not. Sometimes knowing more information - including the GOOD news about how your BC will be treated - can help us stay strong and motivated. Your computer skills are just fine, ro-berta! Here, there are never any dumb questions, and no matter what you are feeling, there are plenty of women who have felt the same way. Even though I always suspected a BC diagnosis would be in my future (Mom had it) I remember the day I got the call confirming it. I kept thinking \"24 hours ago, I was a healthy person.

Everything was swollen, tight, and uncomfortable.  HOWEVER - You are doing all the right things by monitoring your temperature and taking your antibiotics. Now is the worst time for infection to set it, and if you have any questions about that, be sure to call your Breast Surgeon. Don't be shy... they get calls like that all the time. Better to be safe than sorry. Many of us found that the more we moved around, the longer it took for the fluid in the drains to go from red to that pinkish/straw color. The docs want you to be up and around to prevent blood clots, but not so active that your tissues are putting out more fluid. I never touched my dressings. Only the docs did at the Post-Op appointment.  Re the Sentinel Node Biopsy and Final Path report... The way my surgery was done, the SNB tissue was sent down to Pathology while I was on the table. The Pathologist took a slice of each node, and reported back to the surgeon that all was clear. Had the Pathologist seen any cancer in the Sentinel Nodes, he would have reported that back to the Breast Surgeon, and she would have removed more nodes during my BMX. However, that was just a small slice that was examined during surgery. The following day, every single bit of lymph node and breast tissue was examined extensively. Those were the tests that took a while to run, type up into a Final Pathology report, and sent back to the Breast Surgeon. I had my results within a few days.... I think.... and certainly before my one-week Post Op appointment. Did you see your Plastic Surgeon today? What did he/she say? Wishing you good healing!!!",

Last week, I was sitting there thinking \"What shall we have for dinner?\" and I realized that I hadn't taken any pain meds all day long! After my fills last week, I was told I could drive. I did - a very short distance - and realized I felt GOOD for the first time since my surgery! Today I'm having some discomfort, and there are days when I do too much and need a nice long nap. I had to get over feeling like a failure because I wasn't healing as fast as some of the other ladies here were reporting. It had to hit home that each person is so individual in the way they recover. Sometimes, there are complications that interfere with that process - and those are the times you really need to communicate with your doctor about what might be going on. Other than that, it's the old \"Give it time.\" I wanted to scream when I read other people say that, but it turned out to be true. The only difference was the amount of time it took for each individual. You'll get there!",

I felt cute and sassy and had rather fetching boobs and cleavage that I worked to my advantage.But eventually, that got very tiring, and very unsatisfying. I didn't marry until six years ago, at the age of 55. By then, \"looking good\" had more to do with feeling good in elastic waistbands and flat shoes than it did with a hoochie mama top. And soon \"the girls\" were swelling out of their 38DD confinement and pointing due south, ending up just north of my waist. Somewhere around that time, I had a monumental change in how I perceived \"feminine\" and \"womanly\".  After hitting menopause, I realized that among my friends, body image was fleeting, and finally we were putting more emphasis on things like character, personality, intelligence, caring, and humor. It also helped that I'd had a mom who'd undergone a radical mastectomy (with no recon) when I was just a young woman. It never changed who my mom was, except that I would always see her as a warrior. After my cancer diagnosis, my DH and I discussed my options. I asked him how much he liked my breasts. He said \"They're really nice, but I'd rather have you.\" And now this same husband has stood beside me every step of the way since my surgery. He loves my body for what it is, scars and all. I do too. I wanted to have the BMX because I thought it was the best course of action for me. I wanted to have the TEs and implants, not because I thought it would make me more feminine, but because I wanted to be reminded that I still have a healthy body that needs more attention than I've been giving it. If for any reason this doesn't work, then I have no problems at all going au naturel. I am who I am.",

Are your docs giving you only the options of hypervigilance vs Door Number Three? I can't respond to the issue of LCIS, because I had DCIS in the left breast. But I also had a microinvasion of IDC (invasive cancer) there as well. I was offered many options in the beginning, starting with a lumpectomy with radiation. But for MANY reasons (multifocal cancer - in two different places, Mom had BC, I had huge, dense, fibrocystic breasts that made mammos difficult and self-exams impossible, and my radiologist had her suspicions about the right breast) I chose Door Number Three. I took an agressive stance for a small, early cancer. In December I had a bilateral mastectomy, with immediate reconstruction. (The right turned out to be a prophy.) I had no lymph node involvement and all my margins were clear. Right now my risk of recurrence is less than 1% - 2%. Losing weight has further reduced that risk another 23%. And once I start the Arimidex in the fall (no guarantee I will stay on it) that will reduce this tiny risk by another 50%.  I had tissue expanders placed at the time of my mastectomy, and in September, once I've attained my goal weight, will have my permanent (perky!) saline implants placed. I've never once regretted my decision. I went into the surgery with great peace of mind, and that has never changed. I know it was right for me. For you, other options may be more appropriate. Read all you can, investigate all you can. There are SO many options out there, especially when it comes to reconstruction. If you have an anxiety/panic disorder, then you are probably already taking anti-anxiety meds or seeing a therapist. If not, now would be a good time to start. And give Marvin a big smack and send him back to his cage. Wishing you the best!!!!",

I learned that the hard way when I sunburned my TEs THROUGH a white T-shirt. I was bright red and miserable, and thought ice packs would help. Fortunately, I called my PS who read me the riot act.

But having said that, I do think there are things I can do to improve my overall lifestyle, and perhaps affect my total body health in ways that I hadn't done previously. Life isn't very stressful.... I've been retired for 8 years now. The biggest thing I did was to lose weight. I fought with my MO about taking Arimidex - even though my tumor was 100% ER+, I assured her there was no estrogen in my body.... I'd gone through menopause AND a hysterectomy... but she kindly pointed out that estrogen is still manufactured in belly fat, and I had plenty. So I went on a medically-supervised weight loss program and lost 60 pounds. That allowed me to go off all my prescription medications, and all my lab work returned to normal limits. (But I still went on the AI, darn it!) I also went gluten-free. I found out that in just three weeks on a gluten-free diet, my fibromyalgia pain of over ten years had nearly disappeared. So I just kept gluten out of my diet, thinking it might help the AI joint pain. It has, to some extent. We eat no red meat here; DH has kidney disease, and we focus on chicken and fish, or vegetarian meals supplemented with other types of protein. Neither one of us ever drank alcohol, so that wasn't an issue... We stopped with all the white sugars and high fructose corn syrup loaded foods... We read all the ingredients of each item we put in the grocery cart, and avoid any preservatives like the plague. Instead of processed foods, we stick to fresh fruits and veggies. And if we want to splurge, we splurge! Ice cream has become a treat, not a daily dietary supplement... and every once in a while I REALLY like fast-food french fries... I get weekly acupuncture sessions to lessen the AI joint stiffness and pain. We're trying to up our exercise, even if it is just walking every day. It sounds like a lot of work, but it has really just become a lifestyle. ",

Nat23 - Beesie is right. An MX is never something to take lightly. I had multifocal cancer in my left breast last year, and was offered a lumpectomy with radiation. However, since the BS would have had to take such a large wedge of tissue, she suggested UMX. The Radiologist, though, was never comfortable saying she'd found everything in the right breast, and felt I needed more diagnostic tests. Even though my cancer was small, my personal and family history made it very easy for me to choose to do a BMX with immediate reconstruction. The surgery was successful - I didn't need chemo or radiation - but the truth is there are no guarantees. A recurrance can happen no matter what type of surgery you choose. It's been a year now. I've had my permanent saline implants for two months, and I love the shape and size. They're perky, but not perfect. There are still issues that need to be addressed. This could take another year, with additional surgeries down the line. It's not like breast augmentation, and certainly not the \"free boob job\" that so many think it is. UMX or BMX are excellent options in many cases, but are really personal decisions that should be made only after careful research and consideration. Wishing you the best!!!",

I'd had it forever, it was huge, and I figured if no doctor felt it, and it didn't hurt, it couldn't be cancer. Duh, But finally a doc did feel it, and said it had to come out. I'm hesitant to even post my experience here, as this was 53 years ago, and there just wasn't the same kind of attention paid to breast issues then. I had no biopsies, just a surgery date, and not much other information. As I recall, the surgery today would be similar to a lumpectomy. The surgeon made a large incision - much larger than they do today - and removed the lump. I think it was the size of a large walnut....pretty big! My boobs were a 34C, and the reality is that even though I had a scar, and I could sort of feel the \"blank\" space where the lump used to be, my right boob continued to be bigger than the left for the rest of my life, until my BMX. And the left boob is where they discovered the cancer - 53 years later!!! So no, a fibroadenoma does not automatically predispose you to getting cancer. You ask great questions, and I'm sure the other ladies will be along to chime in, but you should definitely make sure your surgeon is aware of your concerns. Have him/her explain to you in detail what your surgery will be like, and what kind of outcome you can expect. One thing I will tell you - don't freak out the first time you look at your scar. You may swear your surgeon was some unskilled quack and settled for just sewing up your incision like a gathered piece of fabric, buckling and rippling here and there. Have faith - the skin does marvelous things as it heals. Those wrinkly, rough incisions eventually fade to almost nothing and remain completely flat.

My invasive ductal cancer was diagnosed on September 15, 2011. Because of scheduling conflicts, and a particularly bad case of flu, I did not have my bilateral mastectomy until December 5, 2011. Luckily, the cancer was small, caught early, and not agressive. I had all sorts of terrible images in my head that every day the cancer would flood throughout my body, and by the time it was removed, it would be too late. Thankfully, the surgeons and the Breast Care Coordinator talked me out of that kind of thinking. What you are talking about is essentially a matter of DAYS difference. According to Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book, by the time most cancers are large enough to be detected, they have been in the body for eight to ten YEARS. Does your wife like her medical team at Dana Farber? Then that's where I'd stay. Even after waiting three months for my mastectomy, the final pathology report was good. No lymph node involvement, so no chemo; and clear margins all around so no radiation. The extra waiting time made no difference. Wishing your wife - and you - all the best.",

My BS actually yelled at me when I saw her at my one-week follow-up, and told her I was still on pain meds. She lectured me and said I should have gone off of them days earlier.

He readily refilled my prescriptions for Norco and Valium. But I didn't take them as prescribed, as I wanted to be like \"those other women\" with no pain. Then a whole bunch of very wise sisters here on BCO asked if I were taking my pain meds at maximum dosage around the clock. I wasn't.

Do whatever you need to rest and recuperate, and make sure you are healing. Be sure to eat lots of protein in your diet - it helps with healing. Most people say get 100 grams a day. And stay busy doing whatever you are capable of doing, just so long as you are distracted and not focusing on your pain. Take really deep, cleansing breaths. I found that nice hot showers, and a back massage from DH helped relax me so I could sleep at night. AND - try not to compare yourself with any other person here. We are all so different. Be sure to let your doctor know about the pain. It might be time for some physical therapy or other intervention. Wishing you the best!",

Not my first choice, but I got used to it. Then they had to reschedule due to the need for both surgeons (BS and PS) to be present in the OR. So it got bumped to November 8th. Then I started to worry - o.k., I had INVASIVE cancer....wasn't it going to spread? And since they did a core needle biopsy, wasn't that really going to spread the cancer all over the place? And what if my lymph nodes had been clear on November 7th, but showed positive on November 8th, and that would mean the difference between no chemo and chemo? AYYYY!!! But as life often does when you're busy making plans, it got more complicated. Right before my November 8th surgery, I got sick. Really sick, with a horrible upper respiratory infection. I thought maybe I could call it a cold and squeak through the surgery anyway, but my docs were smarter than that. They gave me a month to heal before trying again. And my imagination went into overtime! However, my Breast Care Coordinator was wonderful, went over my biopsy results again and again, assuring me that the IDC was tiny and because it was slow-growing, very likely had been there a while. Although she couldn't be 100% sure until the final path reports, she also said it was highly unlikely that it would spread to the lymph nodes in just a month or two. So she calmed me down, and I actually used that extra time to heal from my flu, to decorate the house for Christmas, to order gifts online and get them wrapped, and to get the house all set up (my  little healing nest) for the day I'd come home from the hospital. I'm so glad I took the extra time. I was healthier, calmer, and more prepared. Had my BMX with TEs on Monday, December 5th, and an recuperating well at home. Don't have the final path report yet, but I do have my first Post-Op appointments this Tuesday. It was 11 weeks from diagnosis to surgery. Big hugs to you!!!",

I ended up with the worst upper respiratory infection ever... and a four-hour surgery would have been dangerous. I had no idea when I called that I would get that sick.

The only thing you can do is call your surgeon's office and tell them what's going on, and let them make the decision. Hope you feel better soon!",

And if this is the wrong forum, I apologize in advance! My question is this: What response would you be most comfortable with hearing from someone you just disclosed your Stage IV status to? I realize everyone is different... and situations are different.... The reason I am asking is that my husband spent every Friday for a month in the Chemo Infusion room at our local hospital receiving Rituxan infusions. We met many cancer patients and their families. One day it was taking forever to be called back... the computer was down in the Pharmacy. I went over and began chatting with a very elderly lady and her daughter. The  mom disclosed to me that she'd had BC years ago and thought it was all over, til last year they found mets everywhere. I just said something like \"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. So now you're on a maintenance program for chemo?\" And she replied that yes, and told me her drugs and rounds schedule. (I'd already said earlier that I had BC but no chemo or rads.) I told her she looked very pretty that day, and how was she feeling these days? She said she felt fine, and that her daughter was taking her out to lunch afterwards. I spoke to the daughter for a while about the long wait, and then we were all called back to the room. It hurts my heart to hear of sisters receiving that Stage IV dx, but stuff happens. It could happen to me; I know there are no guarantees. But in the meantime, all I can do is love and support those I know. So back to my original question.... from your point of view, what would be an ideal answer from a friend? From a stranger? (We've all seen examples of what NOT to say!)",

He looked at my records, realized I hadn't gotten the shingles vaccine, and sent me downstairs to get it immediately. Because we didn't know then what treatment I might have (rads, chemo), he said it was imperative to get it right away. (I was 60.) My mom had shingles in her scalp, and they were afraid it would go into her eye. It didn't. They started her on Valtrex (valacyclovir) and she had a terrible allergic reaction. (I've had Zovirax (acyclovir) for a possible herpes infection of the inner ear, and had no reaction at all to it.) Then they gave my mom Neurontin for the pain - that made her even worse. But in the end, she recovered completely, with no lasting effects, and never got a recurrence. My aunt had a terrible case of shingles many years ago, and still has post-herpetic neuralgia - the incessant pain that doesn't go away. I forgot to ask her if she ever got the vaccine. Shingles will follow nerve pathways in the body, which is why people's breakouts are so similar. According to the CDC, the vaccine is still appropriate for those who have already had shingles, and can not only lessen the chances of a recurrence, but the severity of any recurrences. http://www.cdc.gov/VACCINes/vpd-vac/shingles/default.htm",

Sometimes people just don\u2019t want to discuss personal issues in a public place, but in the Oncology Waiting Room, chances are, people are there for very similar reasons. I once sat next to one woman who was very stoic for the first five minutes, and we kept the topic very light\u2026 weather, etc. Slowly she opened up about her Stage IV dx and treatment. All I did was make eye contact, and let her know I heard her every word. Sometimes that\u2019s all you can really do. Thank you, ladies, for reassuring me that I didn\u2019t delve into areas that were none of my business. ",

She gave me a moment to let that sink in, then went on to tell me more information that would help me understand all the GOOD things I had going for me with my particular diagnosis. (She knew me well enough to know that I used to be a medical counselor, and could absorb the more technical information.) She couldn't have been nicer to me, and for that I will always be grateful. I already had a surgeon's appt scheduled, and she said my printed reports would be available then. I thanked her, went into the bedroom, closed the door, and had a good cry. DH came in and asked what was wrong, and I told him. He just held my hand and said \"No matter what happens, we're in this together. We're a team, remember that.\" He went to every appointment with me, and did pretty much what NatsFan described. He was my best caregiver and my biggest advocate. Since he couldn't \"fix\" my cancer, it helped him tremendously that I trusted him with the role of notetaker and intermediary. As I understand it, you still don't know if it's cancer or not?

The one thing I did that made a huge difference for me was to rent a hospital bed, because we have a Tempurpedic mattress that is like swimming in Jello, trying to get out of. (None of our recliners were comfortable enough to sleep in.) With the fully-electric bed, I could raise up the back so I wasn't sleeping flat, and raise up the mattress under the knees to make it easy on my back. When I wanted to get out of bed, I just raised the back all the way up and it was easy to stand up without using my arms. As for bathroom issues - no problem at all! Keep in mind you're reaching DOWN for that stuff....not up. I didn't shower for two weeks (as long as my drains were in) but I did use bathing wipes that made me feel fresh, and also took \"birdie baths\" as my MIL calls them.  DH tried to help me wash my hair in the kitchen sink, but I almost drowned, so the next time I did it myself. Some ladies go to the salon just for a wash and blow dry. The hardest part for me was pulling open the freezer drawer in the bottom of the refrigerator so I could get some ice. We finally used an ice bucket on the kitchen counter. I did have pain from the TEs, but I also tried to go it alone without pain meds. BIG mistake. When I started taking them as prescribed, the pain soon went away. I felt really crappy with no energy, and that was partly from getting the anesthesia out of my system, but mostly it was because I was eating about 25 grams of protein a day, when I really needed 100 grams. When I upped my protein intake, I felt better. I really did have a textbook recovery...no problems... and when the fills started, I had NO problems at all. My DH was amazed that I recovered, and became so independent, as fast as I did! He was prepared to be my nurse, my valet, my hairdresser, my driver, my pack mule, and my personal assistant for WAY longer than he actually was. Trust me: the anticipation is WAY worse than the reality!!!!!",

I didn't realize how unlikely that was, as my pain was never under control in the hospital... I refused to use the Morphine PCA at my bedside. Then I paid attention to all the wise women here who told me that I had been given pain meds for a reason, and to TAKE THEM in order to stay ahead of the pain. Once you have it, it's hard to catch up. I had a combination of Norco and Valium, which worked well. I took them exactly according to directions, around the clock. That broke the pain cycle, and I was able to wean off them. It just took me longer. If it were me, I'd get back on a regular schedule with the meds, then rather than skipping them entirely, just cut back on the dosage gradually until you don't need them any more. You might surprise yourself. Yes, PMPS is a definite possibility, but being only two weeks post-BMX with immediate implants, I would give yourself more time to heal. Be sure to tell your PS you are having pain. A good motto for post-surgery activities: Just because you CAN, doesn't mean you SHOULD.",

      "Content": "Jan 27, 2012 06:10PM - edited Jan 27, 2012 06:10PM by Blessings2011 I've been healing nicely and fills are going well....hard to believe, since I was such a big baby here when I first got home from the BMX! I just never thought the day would come when I didn't feel like I was dying from the TE pain. Now, it's - to use that awful word - DOABLE. I'm happy that I have good range of motion, but I still have quite a bit of underarm pain where they took three \"sentinel nodes\"...(not just one)...I didn't need axillary dissection, though. But this morning, stretching in bed, I felt something like a skinny rope deep inside my armpit. Yikes! Pleased as I am with healing, though, I was really ticked off that never in this journey did a medical professional stress to me the possibilities of LE. Oh, it was mentioned in the tons of literature I was given, but no one really talked about it. I even went to a \"Post Mastectomy Physical Therapy and Lymphedema\" workshop a few weeks ago. Huuuuuge waste of time! More blah blah blah about other stuff, and a two-page handout on where lymph nodes are located in the body. I think there were some minimal suggestions for massage. And there were only two of us MX patients there...it could have been SO much more personalized! So yesterday I got a referral to the LE \"Specialist\" at the hospital. I'll see her on Monday. Dang, sometimes ya just gotta keep hammering away to get what ya need!!! Big hugs to all my December sisters....and special prayers for all those facing challenges right now.",

As far as implants go, everything I've read here indicates that most ladies do wear a good supportive (underwire) bra after their exchange surgery, if only to make sure the implants are secure in the pockets as they heal. They may decide to forego the bra a few months afterwards, but initially, I'm thinking there's a bra in my future. There's lots of other threads here that discuss that... And yes!

Kaiser has a Weight Management program that lasts for 82 weeks. (gasp!) The first 16 weeks consist of medically-supervised meal replacement products, including shakes, soups, and bars. The next phase deals with building back in healthy home cooked meals. There are weekly meetings, lab tests, physician supervision, psychological supervision, and groups. Interestingly, a cancer diagnosis is NOT one of the medical conditions that preclude you from this program, unless you are actively receiving chemo or rads. I had signed up for an orientation session over a year ago, then cancelled, thinking \"Who am I kidding?\" But one of the ladies in my quilting class recently completed the program and has lost 70 pounds, and is off all of her diabetes, cholesterol, and blood pressure medication. I'll be attending the next orientation session in a few weeks. It's not cheap, but at this point, my health is worth it. Several things changed my mind: the fact that my cancer is estrogen-driven, and despite the fact that I've been post-menopausal for 14 years, estrogen is still made in the brain, and - in BELLY FAT! The other thing is that I have SO many other health problems, including severe fibromyalgia, that restricts my ability to get good daily exercise, even walking sometimes. My cholesterol is high, my blood sugar is high, and I have degenerative disk disease and spinal stenosis. Weighing in at 185 pounds on my 5.5\" frame has taken its toll. I am really afraid of taking the Arimidex - not because I \"could\" get the side effects, but rather because I already have so many of them. What if they get worse? I am too young to feel this old. I will be meeting with my MO again to discuss Plan A, Plan B, and so on, should I be totally unable to take the AIs. But I am hoping that dropping an excess of, say, 50 pounds, will make a big difference in my ability to even get moving daily, to strengthen my muscles to avoid falling, and to get my diet back to ground zero so that I may begin a whole new way of eating for the rest of my life. Will keep you all posted!",

I also have to have extensive lab work, an EKG, and a one-hour physical with the weight mamagement doctor next week before I can be admitted into the program. Hoping this works!",

(And on another thread there is a link to an article on exercise and reduction in risk of breast cancer recurrence.) I met with the Registered Dietician at Kaiser this morning and she gave me a 1200 calorie meal plan I could start on now, before the Weight Management program officially starts on March 14th. That way, I can maybe lose a little now.....she encouraged me to keep drinking my water - the WM plan requires that you drink a GALLON a day, and to get some exercise after every meal. She didn't care if it was just five minutes....she wanted me to start small, and pretty soon I'd have my hour of cardio a day. Still don't have clear guidelines from the PS on what I can do at the gym. The good news: I spent all afternoon yesterday baking for various functions. The bad news: I now have this occasional pain under my right TE....feels like muscle pain. I must have done too much reaching for pans and stuff yesterday. The other good news: I can finally sleep on my sides at night...not for very long, but I can do it. I'm at 480 ccs in the left, and 460 ccs on the right. Does anyone remember how much I whined about them when I got home from surgery? I cried every day, and told DH that there was no way I could keep these things in for the next several months....and maybe I should just have them removed NOW!!!! Well, I barely notice them these days. I guess you can get used to anything! Hope everyone is having a great evening!",

After three weeks of pure H#LL after my BMX with TEs, the annoying discomfort has disappeared....of course, they still feel like boulders under my skin, but I had one of those cami's with a built-in shelf bra, and wore it under my shirt as we sat in our lawn chairs down at the surf. DH was running the video camera of the waves, so we can have a relaxing DVD to play on our flat screen TV. While he was doing that, I took my shirt off, just had my cami on (and jeans), and went around taking pictures of shells and driftwood. (Couldn't take any with me, it was a protected tidepool.) Standing in the surf, taking pictures, enjoying the beautiful surroundings, I felt NORMAL! I did not feel like a breast cancer patient. I even had him take pics of me in all my pasty-white, pre-weight-loss glory. Of course, my stamina sucks something awful, but I have to say, I was NOT thinking about the TEs that whole time!

Keep us posted! ~~~~~~~~~~~ Optifast is going well.....last night was class, and I lost 4.8 pounds last week. The only glitch - my ALT (liver function) numbers have tripled. Somewhat worrisome....I had HepB in 1982 (almost died) and am very protective of my liver. Doc says he is more interested in symptoms than numbers (I have none) but is sending me for an US on liver and gallbladder tonight at the hospital. It was so weird - I mentioned it to a my friend in class who is a 3 year ovarian cancer survivor, and she asked \"Are you worried about liver mets?\" I just stared at her. Never crossed my mind. But there is a higher incidence of liver cancer in post HepB patients, so better safe than sorry, and run the tests now. I'll also have additional bloodwork. Come to find out, several members of the class showed elevated ALT numbers in the beginning, which came down on their own. This is what I am hoping for.....that it's diet-related. There is some research showing that Optifast actually reduces the size of the liver, and causes it to release fats into the bloodstream. Hoping to get to the bottom of this mystery, and that I can stay in the program because it really does work! I love the products, it's easy to stick to, and I'm never hungry. If I have to take a break I will, which just means the TEs will be in longer than I'd hoped. Got them in December, was hoping for exchange in September. The only issue I'm having now is that the smaller I get, the bigger (and harder) my 620cc TEs feel - especially at night - it's like rolling over onto a boulder! Other than that, life is good.

It's great to be able to do normal things.

Everyone on our block who had RVs were out loading them earlier in the week. Then they took off to join the thousands of others who were heading up to the lakes and streams and mountains and beaches to camp for the long weekend. We were glad to wave them off and wish them a good time! We did have some company on Friday - two of DH's former mentor teachers who were like brothers to him when he first started out. They've been close for nearly 40 years. It was a good visit for all of them. The weekend was quiet, we worked in the yard, then on Sunday went to church and the nursing home where my MIL is. My FIL spends all day Sundays with her. They are both 90, and Dad still plays in the local Military Band. In fact, he had a gig today at a local cemetery where they have a huge Veterans' memorial celebration. We're just spending today quietly reflecting on all those who bravely gave their lives for our freedom.....and we thank all military personnel for their service to our country.",

Fitzdc - YAY on the good outcome of your revision!!! And new nips? WooHOO! I'm still thinking of finding a way to go see Vinnie for 3D tatts. Hope your neck issues resolve soon! ~~~~~~~~~~~~  After my BMX w/TEs in December, I got filled to 620 ccs in only five visits. At that time I asked my PS what would happen if he put in implants the size of my Amazon-sized TEs, and I later lost weight. He said the implants wouldn't change at all. \"So I'd have stripper boobs?\" I asked. He kind of laughed and nodded. \"I'll get back to you.\" I told him. I could have had my exchange already, but I decided to postpone it to lose weight. After my surgery, my risk of recurrence was 1% to 2%. My MO wanted me on Anastrozole (generic Arimidex) right away. I said I didn't need it. I was post-menopausal (14 years) and had already had a hysterectomy. She kindly pointed out that estrogen was manufactured in - among other things- BODY FAT!!! So in March, I joined the Optifast weight loss program at Kaiser. So far, I've lost almost 50 pounds, and am aiming for another 10 - 15 pounds. I wanted to go a little lower, since I heard that Anastrozole tends to put weight on you. But the docs will tell me when I've lost enough. (And the MO let me postpone the AI until the Fall...) For the first time in years, I'm working out. I do water aerobics, go to the gym, walk, and ride my bike. My fibromyalgia pain (usually a \"15\") is now a 1 -2 on a scale of 10. Not because of the weight loss so much, but because I've gotten off all the white sugar, white flour, and gluten. Now we're slowly adding back in real food, and in another two weeks I'll be cleared to go into surgery again. As I lose more weight (and padding) the TEs seem bigger and harder. Sleeping at night is very difficult and painful. It's time for them to go. I see the PS on Thursday, and will ask for the next available date for exchange surgery. Thanks again to Kam for checking in with us again!!!! Later, Sisters....gotta go swim.",

Ginger -  I've had fibromyalgia since 2000, have gone through a ten-week Pain Management program for chronic pain, and have a standing order for Vicodin when the pain keeps me from sleeping several nights in a row. However,  one of the unexpected side effect of my four months on Optifast was a huge reduction in my fibromyalgia pain. I'd say on a pain scale of 1 - 10, it's been like a 1 or a 2 instead of the constant 7,8,9. What was different? Optifast is gluten-free. I'd always wanted to go on an elimination diet, but it was just too darn much trouble. But four months on the liquid fast, and my symptoms diminished so quickly I know it wasn't from just the weight loss and exercise. I've also been reading on the AI threads about how women with joint pain SEs have benefitted from eliminating gluten from their diets. Faith - That whole Brava thing is SO out there! I mean, who woulda thought of that? Creating the framework to inject your own cells to recreate a breast....amazing!!!!

Here is what I know: he will be using Allergan Natrelle High Profile Smooth Saline implants, in either 650, or 700 ccs. Each of these can be overfilled by 40-50ccs. (thank you, Whippetmom!!!) Currently, my 700cc TEs are underfilled at 620ccs. The fact that my TEs are wider than the implants won't be a problem - the most would be 2 cm, just one cm on each side. The TEs touch in the middle, and the implants won't. He won't be doing any suturing to make the pockets smaller, as that would cause a longer surgery and recovery time for me, and possible complications down the road. He wants the implants to move, and not be like the TEs. He did say that perhaps they may migrate slightly when I lie on my back, but they definitely won't point east and west, or disappear under my armpits.   Surgery will be outpatient, about two hours. General anesthesia but no intubation, just LMA (laryngeal mask airway). NO DRAINS!!! Two hours in Recovery, and home I go. Will get a big Ace bandage in the OR, a few days later I can switch to a sports bra, and then we'll discuss more supportive, underwire bras I can get. Tentatively, I'm scheduled for August 22nd.

Many people who are forced to take disability retirement do have to go through that grieving process, and often feel cheated out of being able to finish off their careers the way they wanted to. When I retired, I had been married for a year. My DH retired right before our wedding, after 33 years of teaching high school. He was SO ready. But I had a mom in assisted living, and the costs were very high, so back to work I went. When she went into a skilled nursing facility the following year, MediCal picked up the tab and I could afford to retire. I absolutely loved my job, my colleagues, and my students. My identity was wrapped up in being a counselor, and I did wonder who I would be after I was no longer employed. I gave the university six months notice. During that time, I made sure I completed the major projects I had started, so I could leave on a high note. While I knew I would miss my co-workers, several had already left for other jobs or retirement, and I knew we'd find a way to keep in touch. My first weeks at home were a blur. I felt compelled to stay busy; to be productive. I cleaned out closets, I rearranged rooms, I organized the junk in the garage. Then I realized I didn't have to do anything I didn't want to  You're right... you are making a very fast transition. It may take a while to realize the benefits. But I think especially since we've had BC, that makes us think about the way we spend our time, and just how much time working does take up.  I am so fortunate I retired before my dx. I can't imagine trying to make doctors' appointments at only \"convenient\" times, or begging for extra time off because I just wasn't feeling strong enough to go back to work after surgery. Now that I think about it, I don't know anyone who has regretted the decision to retire! I am happy for you. p.s. Are those your kitties in your avatar? CUTE!",

That wasn't always the best idea....staying late at night, working weekends, calling students from home when I was sick just to be sure they had their needs met... Now, six years after retirement, I can see that everything has progressed just fine without me. Because I have other chronic conditions besides breast cancer, I now see how little energy I had, and how little time I devoted to healing back when I was still working. I guess my point is that this may be the time when you need to make your body your priority. Workplace stress just follows you right home. I know that.

We had discussed the fact that I am rather, er, flabby in my muscles, and he said this could be an advantage when it came to placing the TEs. Apparently it was! Fills will start after the first of the year. The other good news was that despite the amount of daily drainage, he only leaves drains in for 2 weeks max.

I was wearing a tight compression sports bra after the bandages came off and the drains came out, but found they were way too tight to sleep in. Others I had were too loose. I compromised and wore my mastectomy camisole (which I never wore while I had drains) with a looser sports bra on top. Today I just have on a smaller MX cami, which is just about as compressive as a sports bra, with the added feature that the band doesn't roll up under the IMF. Ow.

I asked the PS if I were getting 50 ccs today, as that seems to be the standard here on the forum, and he said \"Let's just see how it goes. I don't have any preconceived amounts that I use.\" (And of course, I'm thinking, he'll just keep inflating me until I scream, or they pop.......) Well, he did the left side first. I felt nothing - not even when the needle went in! He filled very slowly, and kept asking me how it felt. Finally I said it feels kind of heavy....and he said that was good. Then he did the other side. THAT one I felt....a little bit of stinging/burning.  He said it was because the needle was going though the muscle to the port, and that next time, it may be completely different, or I may not feel it at all. Again, he filled it slowly, and when I said I was feeling some pressure, he stopped. He filled me with 100ccs in each side today!!!! Yowza!!! Right now, they just feel tight, no real pain except for one area underneath the left IMF. He said that this was where the pocket was beginning to expand. He said I may be sore tonight, but then again, I may not. I was hoping to see this big rise in my foobs as he filled, but remember, I have the Amazon size expanders in, and 100ccs spreads out over a wide, diffuse area. I think the other thing to keep in mind is that pre BMX I had so much loose skin, and such lax pecs, it may be easier for me to accept a larger fill than someone with a smaller chest area and tighter skin. I can now take a shower and let the spray hit my incisions, which are healing well. (I still can't take a bath because the drain incision on the right is still somewhat deep and trying to heal.) I can use soap and water on them, and lotion if I want. Tomorrow I'm going to a Physical Therapy/Lymphedema class at the hospital, and I can take notes, but he said to not do any of the stretching or other exercises until he sees me again. That doesn't bother me, as I don't seem to have much swelling/lymphedema that I can see, and I do have good ROM already. He said I could carry a purse that weighs less than 10 pounds (DH laughed out loud at that one) and that if I felt o.k., I could start driving again. On Friday, the Oncologist had been adamant that I lose weight and get in shape....DH and I belong to the Outpatient facility of a local Rehabilitation hospital, and the PS said it's o.k. to walk on the treadmill, do light lower body exercises, but no arm or upper body work. And - I can't go back to the therapy pool yet....they keep it at 94 degrees, and it's wonderful for my fibromyalgia, but even though they keep it full of chemicals, I can't take the chance on picking up any infections. SO - one more milestone achieved!!! If I keep going at this rate, I'll be done with fills and the waiting period, and can have my exchange surgery much sooner than I had imagined. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ AussieKate - so sorry to hear of your setbacks....prayers and hugs for you as you deal with this new information as well. fitzdc - will be thinking of you as you talk to the oncologist tomorrow. Please post what you find out! chrissilini - I had all sorts of hard places on my chest....around my foobs, underneath/inside my foobs, you name it. But that seemed to change every day. The skin got looser, and I think the TEs got more recognizable to me. I'm slowly learning exactly where they are, and what's happening with them. Of course, with every fill, that will change! I'm just glad you don't have an infection...",

Generally, drains can come out when the output is less than 30 ccs. That was two weeks for me. goldlining - As I understand it, staples are faster than sutures; involve minimal skin penetration which means less infection; and are made of stainless steel, causing fewer skin reactions than suturing material.

I see some of you on other threads, but have missed most of you. After recon, I started Arimidex, and lasted a whole year before the MO took me off for life-threatening SEs. She gave me a two-month drug holiday, in which ALL the SEs went away. Thinking I was done, I was really surprised when she put me on Femara... that lasted all of six months before the SEs came back with a vengeance. But in the very beginning, the MO had always assured me that if I were one of those women who could not take an AI, she would feel very comfortable letting me go off them (due to the size and early stage of my IDC.) Unfortunately, I had a bad fall in June, while we were on vacation, and now have a Traumatic Brain Injury to deal with. So I really haven't thought much about life after BC.....  with a TBI, it's two steps forward and three steps back. A cut on your hand, it heals. A broken leg mends. The brain just does whatever the brain wants to do. The Neurologist is not optimistic, but I am. I have faith that this too, shall pass. The good part is that if something makes me mad, I forget what it is almost immediately. And if I get stressed, I am just as likely to go \"SQUIRREL!!!\" and be totally distracted. I've graduated from my walker to a cane, so that makes it easier to get around. And like Roseanne Roseannadanna says, \"It's always something!\" I am hoping my December '11 Sistahs are doing well out there.... would love it if others would check in from time to time, especially as we approach the holiday season. xoxoxo",

I'd gotten the diagnosis of BC, and was waiting for surgery. I knew I had multifocal (in more than one place) DCIS (non-invasive cancer) with multifocal IDC (invasive ductal carcinoma). I'd had seven different diagnostic procedures, and had met with the surgeon. I was offered a lumpectomy with radiation, but since the cancer was in two places, the surgeon recommended a unilateral mastectomy. After much consideration of my history, I chose a bilateral mastectomy. I had my surgery on December 5, 2011. I was very fortunate. The cancer was very small and caught early. All the margins were clear, the Sentinel Node Biopsy (SNB) was clear at the time of surgery. Even better, all the nodes were clear in the final pathology report. What that meant was that I did not need chemo or radiation. I chose to have immediate reconstruction, by having Tissue Expanders placed at the time of my surgery. Last August, I had them swapped out for permanent saline implants.  In the process, I found a way to get healthy - which I hadn't been for years. I lost a lot of weight, started exercising, and today I feel better than I have in 20 years. My BC treatment consists of taking an estrogen-blocker for the next five years. Yes, the fear of BC can be awful. But you seem to have a partial plan in place already, and you will know more once you have met with your surgeon. There are many pieces of the breast cancer puzzle, and the more you know, the more powerful you will feel. But stay away from Dr. Google! He can be a liar and a fearmonger! Wait until you get personalized information from your surgeon. Wishing you and your family a blessed Christmas....",

My house was organized, I'd purchased all sorts of mastectomy-related items, including the camisoles with drain pouches, the Pink Pockets, and a ton of button-front clothes. My bag for the hospital was chock-full of everything I MIGHT need. Here's the thing - I never even opened that bag once when I was there. My surgery was late in the day, I got to my room about 8 pm, and when I was finally awake at 1 am, I chatted with the nurses, fell asleep, chatted some more, fell asleep, and later on that morning it was time to go home. I was wrapped in a giant, thick Ace bandage that would remain on for a week, so I just used my diaper pins to keep the drains pinned to the bandage. I dressed in what I'd wear to bed when I got home, had a nice fuzzy robe, and a pillow to protect my chest on the short drive home. But the smartest thing I did was rent a hospital bed for my immediate recovery. Our mattress is a Tempurpedic, wonderful to sleep in, but you really need the strength of two arms to get in and out of it. With the hospital bed, I could raise the head up to where it needed to be (they don't want you lying flat for a while) and because you need to sleep on your back (which is painful for me) raising the mattress up under my knees made it very comfy. DH rigged up a remote control for my reading lamp, and I had an over-the-bed table for all my \"stuff\". I also had a huge brass bell to ring to summons DH if I needed him, but that hospital bed gave me the independence I needed! The other thing I found handy was to wear satin jammies to bed....easy to turn, position, and slide out of bed to get to the bathroom. We had a \"drain station\" set up, with surgical gloves (DH is a former EMT), alcohol wipes, the measuring cups we got from the hospital, and the daily log. Make sure you empty those drains regularly - before they get full - and log in the amounts each time.  Fold the empty bulb in half, then roll it towards the top to squeeze all the air out.  Be VERY careful about wiping the plugs and the bulb openings with alcohol before sealing up again....this is an open pathway to germs to get into the body. We also kept a clipboard of the drugs I took, so I made sure I didn't take too few or too many. Many hugs and prayers to you, Kouragio!",

After BMX, I stood there and argued that because I was post-menopausal, AND post-hysterectomy, there was no estrogen anywhere in my body, so I didn't need any of THOSE drugs. She very kindly said to me \"Estrogen is produced in belly fat, even after menopause and hysterectomy.\" And there I stood, all 205 pounds of me, with nothing to say. The next day I entered a medical weight loss program and eventually lost 60 pounds and 65 total inches.

In the meantime, here's some info from BCO regarding different types of surgeries: http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/surgery/ Are you having a UMX or a BMX? (Unilateral or bilateral mastectomy?) Everyone heals at a different rate and everyone's pain tolerance is different. I wanted to be one of those women who came home from surgery and only took a Tylenol, and ran a marathon a few weeks later. Uh, that wasn't me. For me, I did need to take my pain meds. Prior to surgery, I had a little \"nest\" set up in the master bedroom where I could recover in peace and quiet. We had a \"drain station\" set up in the bathroom, where all the supplies we needed, as well as the logs for writing in the information were kept. We also had a clipboard for meds, so DH could log in what I took and when. As far as the tissue expanders go, they are basically like deflated implants, except they have a hard back. (Implants are squishie all over.) The expander has a metal port, which is how fills are done. More about this below. (Note: you cannot have an MRI with these metal ports in place!) During the MX, after all the breast tissue is removed, the plastic surgeon (PS) will separate the pectoral muscles on the chest, and make a pocket for the expanders to go into. He will suture them in place. Once the expanders are in place, most of the time, he will then fill them with a small amount of saline. (You may wake up from surgery with teensy little foobs.) Before you are sutured up, he may insert Jackson Pratt drains, which are long clear tubes that help drain any excess fluid away from your chest. The tubes are about three feet long, and the top 8\" is flattened, with holes to draw in the fluid. Then the tubing becomes round and clear, and exits your body through a tiny hole. The tube is stitched in place. At the end of the clear tube is the drain bulb, which collects the draining fluid. It really does sound gorier than it is. There is a whole procedure for emptying the drains and logging in the amounts. The nurse or breast care coordinator should show you how it's done. PM me if you want more info. Once the drains and the tissue expanders are in place, the PS will then suture you up. Don't freak out if this isn't the best sewing job you've ever seen....it's only temporary. You'll wake up in recovery. Be sure to let your anesthesiologist know in Pre-Op if you have any concerns regarding nausea or vomiting after surgery. There are wonderful drugs he can give you while you're out so that you don't experience any of that. Soon you'll be taken to your room. If you have pain, say so. Otherwise, you may have a PCA (Patient Controlled Anesthesia) machine by your bed. Use it if you need it. I read so many posts on what to take to the hospital - I came prepared for anything, and never opened my bag once. After my surgery, I was all set to go with a mastectomy cami, but when I woke up, I was wearing a huge Ace bandage...so I just pinned my drains to the bottom of that with cute diaper pins. Bring a pillow for the ride home. Not to snooze on, but to put between your chest and the seatbelt. Have a comfy place to sleep - you'll need to be raised up, and on your back. Lots of ladies use recliners, I rented a hospital bed. Be sure to stay hydrated, and TAKE THE STOOL SOFTENERS even if you think you don't need them. Like I said, pain tolerance varies so much......but if you are in pain, let your doctor know. You should be sent home with good meds to keep you comfortable. Watch out for foods that people bring over. I never had so much greasy, fatty, rich casseroles in my whole life! Set things down where you can reach them in the kitchen. Don't lift anything over what your doctor tells you to. Get up and move every day, but don't overdo it. Some docs let you shower with drains in, others don't. Be really careful emptying the drains....that's a direct path for bacteria to enter the body. After all the bandages came off, nothing touched my skin that wasn't freshly laundered. When your incisions have mostly healed, then your fills will start. You go to your PS's office, and lie on a table. Remember the metal ports? Since the TEs are located UNDER the pectoral muscles, he will use a small tool like a studfinder to locate the port. Then he will use a small needle and syringe and go through the skin and muscle, into the TE and being filling it with sterile saline. Don't be nervous. Most of the time you will have no feeling at all when the needle goes in, thanks to the nerves being cut during the MX. Sometimes, though, the TEs can shift a bit under the skin, and you may feel the briefest of little stings if the port happens to end up under an area with partial feeling. But usually it doesn't. The PS will have his own method for fills. Mine said he went by how the breast mounds looked and felt, and by what the patient told him. I just remember saying \"they feel kind of full\" and then finding out he had filled me to 120ccs. This was after getting 180ccs in the OR! If you've had radiation, or have any skin or healing issues at all, the best policy is \"Low and Slow.\" That means not too many ccs at once, and not too close together. They can also remove saline after they put it in, if you feel it too much. Later on in the day, some ladies feel muscle spasms in the back or shoulders. I never did, but then again, I was overweight, and had lots of extra skin and very loose muscles. At that point, muscle relaxers, Valium, and warm showers help. When the TEs are filled to the size agreed upon by you and your PS, then you wait to make sure everything is healed. Mine makes you wait 3 months. Your next surgery will be your exchange surgery, where your TEs are removed, and your permanent implants put in. Sorry this is so long..hope it helps!",

Mine were done in the ultrasound room. My breast was exposed, and the tech put the gel on it so the radiologist could use the wand to see the tumor/suspicious area. Once the tumor was located, then the Radiologist gave me a numbing shot in the breast, which sounds way worse than it is. The shot stings for a very brief moment, then the tissue goes numb. When she was sure that I couldn't feel anything, she had the tech isolate the exact area of the tumor, and she inserted the instrument that has the core-needle on it. She put the tip of the needle into the mass, and counted to three. She explained that I would hear a snapping sound as the instrument took a tiny bit of tissue, but should feel nothing. She was right. She did this several times to get several samples, and even though I could feel pressure as she moved the instrument around, I didn't feel any pain at all. I could have looked at the ultrasound screen if I wanted to, or watched the needle go into my breast, but I chose not to. I figured if I couldn't see it, it wouldn't hurt. I was right. In fact, we were talking the whole time, and I remember laughing at quite a few things that were said. I was very comfortable. Afterwards, I got a bandaid, and an ice pack to stuff inside my bra for the ride home. I kept icing the area for the rest of the night, and except for a bit of bruising, had no after effects. If you ask for some anti-anxiety meds beforehand, you might get them, but you in that case you may want a ride home. Seriously, if you don't want to watch, just close your eyes and do some deep breathing. It will be over before you know it! Wishing you the best....",

She was kind, nurturing, caring, informative, and only wanted the best for me. She was obsessed with getting me the absolute maximum amount of information about what was going on in my breast, so I could have the best tools to make a decision, should that time come. This woman not only took the time to call me at home (where and when I requested) with the results, her manner over the phone could not have been any more nurturing than if we were sitting face to face. It was more like a telephone counseling session, where she was concerned not only about getting me the facts, but also the good news, the decisions that would have to be made, the next steps in the process, the professionals I would be seeing and their roles in my treatment, and every few minutes she would just stop and ask me how I was doing. At the end, she gave me her pager number and told me to call her any time I had questions, or just needed to talk. She also came into the hospital on her vacation to reassess my films and diagnostic results to see if there might have been anything she missed - especially on the right breast which had shown up negative in the mammogram. She consulted with a colleague, and decided that should I want a lumpectomy on the left, she really wanted me to go in and have additional tests on the right, including an MRI. She called me at home to tell me this. By that time, I had decided on a BMX. She took a deep breath, and told me that in her opinion, I had made a very wise choice. I will always remember the way she made me feel - important, cared for, supported, and encouraged. A friend of mine who is a five year BC survivor, told me I would meet many wonderful angels (helpers) along the way. I think my Radiologist was the first one, and she definitely set the tone for what I would experience the during the rest of my BC journey. BTW, this was at Kaiser, where all my procedures and treatments are under one roof, and all the different professionals speak very highly of each other.",

I was a total space cadet the first two months after my BMX, I think...mostly because I had pain issues with my TEs, and was still on the pain meds. There are two things you can do to help the healing process along: 1) Drink plenty of water! The anesthesia and other assorted drugs do stay in your system for a while, and staying hydrated helps flush them out, as well as helping eliminate constipation and other pesky side effects of surgery. 2) Make sure you are eating enough protein. It has been suggested that after surgery, we need at least 100 grams of protein a day to heal. I wasn't getting enough, and when I upped my protein intake, I felt so much better! At 11 days out, you are still recovering, and will be for a while. Now is the time to be good to yourself... rest, relax, and nap when you need to. And when you start to feel better, don't fall into the trap that many of us do, and try to do too much at once. We still need to follow our doctors' restrictions, no matter how good we feel. Wishing you the best in your recovery!",

That part is a whole new world. I never knew I could hurt myself opening up a window. But I was standing wrong when I did it, and pulled a muscle. You'll learn safer ways to do things with your arm and chest muscles, but as for the implants, they really don't need much protection! Wishing you great healing....",

That way you will know that you are treating it correctly, and not just guessing. It needs to be seen to determine the best treatment. Memory foam conforms to the body, keeping air out.

(Not possible.) As long as there is a risk I want you on AIs.\" I gave it my best shot for two years but dangerous SEs convinced the MO to take me off completely. Risk is still extremely low - less than 1% - but it's still there.  And - I may be wrong -  I don't believe the type of surgery you have defines risk percentage.... in other words, BMX is really no better than lumpectomy with rads... it just happened to be the right choice for me.

But when I got to college and had a thorough exam, they said it must be removed. It was benign, I had a small scar (below my bikini top line!), and never gave it another thought. As I got older, I did develop fibrocystic breasts, where they felt like they were bags of pebbles. Now those DID hurt, but again, they were benign. It wasn't until I was 61 years old that I had any evidence of breast cancer. Good for you for being proactive and not burying your head in the sand like I did!

My drains were more under my arms, and I think this is mostly because of how the drain tubes are constructed. The clear tubes that lead to the plastic bulbs can be up to 36\" long. But the part that is under your skin is flat, with perforations, like a soaker hose. That part is about 8\" long. I don't think I know of anyone who had drain tubes exiting near the breastbone. That may make it easier to sleep on your sides, though, if you don't have TEs that cause pain.",

As for being incapacitated, the mastectomy itself is fairly straightforward. Breast tissue is primarily fat and glandular tissue being removed. It's the reconstruction process that adds time in the OR, and pain afterwards. Hard-backed tissue expanders are inserted underneath pectoral muscles and nerves that have been cut and sutured. I was suprised at how little hand grip I had when it came to things like opening jars. And the suggestion about moving needed items to counter-level was right on. As for taking care of personal needs on the toilet, no worries there. You can do whatever you need to do by yourself. I did a ton of laundry ahead of time so that I could go for a week without wearing the same pjs twice. I also had a week's worth of camisoles, but I didn't buy all the expensive mastectomy camisoles. I just pinned my drains to my camis with diaper pins. AND - once I could take a shower, I never used the same towel twice. Again, I was just thinking of germs. Oh - the best jammies I got were brushed satin. Nice and warm, and the satin made it easier to move around in bed. A note about stripping drains: it's RARELY needed. In the beginning you'll see a lot of dark fluid coming down the tubes into the bulbs. Make sure you empty out the bulbs and log in the amounts before they get half full. This keeps the good suction going. In fact, you can wash your hands well or use gloves, sit on the side of the tub or on a stool, remove the cap, empty the bulb into the measuring cup, and log in the amount. Toss the fluid in the toilet and flush it down. Then, before you put the cap back on, take an alcohol wipe and clean all around the cap and the bulb opening. With the cap still off, flatten the bulb, start rolling it up from the bottom so all the air is squeezed out of it, THEN put the cap back on. This is how the nurse in the hospital taught me to do it. As you start to heal, what you see in the clear tubes will change from a dark fluid to a more pinkish straw colored fluid. You will also probably see lots of strands of gunk in the tubes. While it's not pretty, it does NOT mean that the tube has to be stripped. If your bulb is still filling up, the fluid is being drawn out of your body into the drain. You can try to strip your drains by pinching the tube at the top where it exits your body. Don't worry - it's stitched in there. Hold it tight against your body, and use a wet alcohol wipe to pull hard and \"milk\" the tube down towards the bulb. What you will probably find is that nothing really moves. I tried the tube stripping thing once or twice, then called the PS who told me to forget it as long as I was getting drainage into the bulbs. DH told me he was very surprised that I became as independent as I did so quickly.",

So maybe exchange in September? I was fortunate. Did not need chemo or rads. So this four month liquid diet is nothing. I just consider it part of my BC treatment. (My MO is thrilled.)

There is no medication that will completely eliminate all pain all the time, but taken correctly, pain meds will take the edge off so that we can function during the day, and sleep well at night. A body that is in constant pain is stressed, and a body that is stressed cannot heal properly.

News like this just pulls the rug out from under us and sends us spinning. However, there are a few things I do want you to remember: 1. The MAJORITY of breast issues are benign - NOT cancer. 2. Many of the ladies sitting on the bench in the Mammo waiting room will be called back in for additional imaging, and many will be referred for ultrasound. Thank goodness our medical professionals are so diligent at doing their jobs. What they are trying to do is RULE OUT any possible abnormalities, not diagnose you with something serious. 3. The lady in scrubs sitting next to you sounded comforting, but a bit premature in suggesting that you will have a needle biopsy. She has no idea what your mammogram results showed. You may need something as simple as an MRI, or the doctor may just want to do some simple explanation to you in person. 4. Right now, you don't have bad news. You just have news. PLEASE take a deep breath, and find something you love to do, and do it. Stay busy. Keep your mind occupied, or else it will take you to dark places. (And stay off Dr. Google!!!! He can be a liar and a fearmonger!) 5. If you spend all your time worrying about the future before you ever meet the Breast Specialist, and your results turn out to be benign, then you will have thrown away valuable time in your life worrying about nothing. 6. I'm really sorry your Mom is in ill health. I know how stressful that can be. Not to minimize your situation in any way, I would be grateful that my mom had a 2 - 7 year life expectancy rather than a 2 - 7 week, or 2 - 7 month life expectancy, which many ladies here are dealing with. Sad as it is, you have the time to make the most of your relationship with her. 7. Congratulations on the birth of your newest grandchild - what a blessing! 8. Make sure you have someone with you when you go see the Breast Specialist. Have them take notes for you if you are too distracted. We can't always process ALL the information right away. Understand that if you miss something you can always call back. 9. Like I said in the beginning, the majority of breast issues are benign. However, if it turns out that there is more going on in your case, you have come to the VERY best place for information, encouragement, and support!  10. Please do come back here and post after you have seen the doctor. Let us know how you are doing! Wishing you the best......",

So much goes into whether or not there is a recurrence of cancer in the other breast! You need to know all the details of the results of your biopsy reports, your exact type of cancer (aggressive? slow-growing?), the IHC (Immunohistochemistry) details, BRCA status, etc.....these things are usually explained at the time you meet with your breast surgeon to discuss the types of treatment available to you. You may feel \"green\" now, but trust me, you will become an expert. Are you scheduled to see a breast surgeon? Is there a Nurse Navigator or Breast Care Coordinator at your doctor's office? Perhaps you could call and get more information before you see the surgeon. Personally, my IDC was a microinvasion from DCIS (non-invasive cancer) found in the left breast. Because of my history and risk factors, I decided on a bilateral mastectomy (BMX) with immediate reconstruction. I could have had a lumpectomy with radiation, but chose a different way to go. There are so many wise women here to share their experiences...I'm sure they will be along soon. Wishing you the best....",

Great idea in theory, but I only dozed between 6:30 a.m. and 7:30 a.m. and now I'm doing a few loads of laundry. Gotta love these steroids!

Hope you stay well! ~~~~~~~~~~~  Cookie Monster: whenever my BMX gets rescheduled, I'll be having TEs inserted in preparation for implants. I'm pretty large, droopy, and dense - a 38DD - and I told my PS I wanted to go smaller. He laughed and said that he didn't hear that very often. He said that based on my size, he'd recommend a C cup. I said fine. I hadn't been that size since 6th grade :-O I did a LOT of searching the Internet for pics! Just keep in mind that yes, there will be some scary ones, but all in all, I'm glad I did. I got a good look at what the mastectomy scar itself will look like (much smaller that the one my mom had in her day) as well as what a reconstructed breast looks like using the various options. Before we met with the PS, I had my husband look at photos with me. The next day, the PS handed me some copies of pics - DH told him we already looked online. The doc said that's where his came from , and DH said he thought he recognized some of the shots! (They were just \"medical\" photos, not prurient or creepy) Do a GOOGLE IMAGES search for things like \"reconstructed breast post-mastectomy\" or \"mastectomy with DIEP flap\" or whatever you are curious about. I understand that in one of the threads here, a member mentioned a separate photo gallery on another site, but I don't know anything about that. The other thing I wanted to say is that you are guaranteed by law to have matching boobs (as best as the surgeon can do.) Seriously. If you want to go smaller on the left, you can have a reduction and a lift to match the new right side. Hope you stay free of the germ bombs in your classroom and are well and healthy before your surgery!",

It's just that the women who had been hypnotized REPORTED less pain after the procedures. Looks like they still took the meds. I agree with the concept of hypnosis before surgery to calm anxieties, and to \"set up\" our minds to believe that our pain and nausea levels will be minimal. (Believe it, but can't say for sure, since I've never been hypnotized.) I'm wondering about the overall cost of surgery being \"significantly less\", though....certainly, you wouldn't be charged for as many drugs.....but unless the billing clerk was hypnotized to ignore some of the costs, I can't imagine the pricing would be all THAT different! (The study reported that on average, the hypnotized women took ten and an half minutes less in the OR, resulting in a $700 savings.) \"Overall, our results support the present hypnosis intervention as a brief, clinically effective means for controlling patients' pain, nausea, fatigue, discomfort, and emotional upset following breast cancer surgery beyond traditional pharmacotherapeutic approaches,\" stated the authors. This is very interesting to me because I participated in a ten-week Chronic Pain Management Program at my local hospital several years ago, and I am still practicing what I learned.",

But eventually, my breasts got very dense, heavy, and fibrocystic, to the point where self exams were impossible. They hurt all the time, and this was waaaay before I was diagnosed with BC. I did have to watch out for caffeine, because it seemed to make the pain worse. In your case, though, it sounds like you just need a different breast surgeon, or someone who can arrange for you to get the tests you need. Even if it's benign (hoping so!), you still need answers. Wishing you the best....",

My PS removed the drains once they reached a certain level per day (I forget how much) OR at the two-week mark. He felt that the possibility of infection outweighed the need for drains at that point. Mine came out at two weeks. What some women find is that the more they move their arms, the more drainage there is.  We have a saying around here - \"Just because you CAN, doesn't mean you SHOULD!\" What that means is that you need to stay active... walk, gentle stretches, etc, plus whatever the PS has cleared you for.  But if you are doing a lot of lifting and reaching and carrying and other exertions involving your arms, it could be increasing your fluid output. Try laying low for a day or so and see if that changes the amount of drainage. And remember: the drains are temporary! As crappy as it may feel to have to deal with them, it is MUCH better to have all that excess fluid drain out of you rather than build up inside, after the drains are removed.",

The \"discomfort\" I can take - those random pulling/aching/stabbing pains that are intermittent. But the constant burning/aching/throbbing pain that seems to be centered on my chest wall does keep me from sleeping and resting, so doc says TAKE THE DRUGS! However, I do feel like I should soon be turning the corner on pain. Every day I feel  bit more range of motion, even though I'm not supposed to be doing anything with my arms.  Drains are slowing down, gone from red to pink to pinkish-yellow. Thank goodness I'd read so many posts here about what to expect in the bulbs. Pre-op instructions said to empty them twice a day, morning and night. But when the PS saw me the morning he discharged me, the drains were full, and he said I needed to empty them WAY before that - at least by the half-full mark, or else there wouldn't be enough suction. In the hospital, the nurse folded the empty bulb in half, then rolled it up toward the cap, THEN put the cap back on. We adjusted the charts at home so we could write in drain emptying four times a day. I have a disposable pad I put over my lap and under the drains as DH unplugs and empties them. (The nurse said they could squirt across the room if you're not careful!) Having \"stations\" set up before I came home was a good idea. I took plastic trays - one for meds (pain, nausea, antibiotic, etc.) along with charts on clipboards to note what I took, how much, and when. DH is the keeper of the charts. I am capable of taking my own meds, but it helps to have one person in charge. I have another tray for drain care - it has the surgical gloves, the alcohol wipes, and the log for measurements. My cousin who is a nurse said to be especially careful with the drains - they are a doorway for bacteria to enter the surgical wounds. Sorry - I may be repeating myself here! Glad to see more sisters coming home from surgeries - sending hugs and healing wishes to you!",

I'm allergic to almost every antibiotic, including Keflex, and horrifically allergic to Clindamycin! I was afraid to take the Cipro they gave me IV in the hospital, and for ten days at home, but I did, and except for taking some Benadryl along with it in the beginning to prevent itching, I  never had any side effects! Good to know in case I ever get Anthrax! (Cipro is the drug they use for Anthrax...) Zofran has been around a long time. It was originally developed to prevent nausea and vomiting in chemo patients. Many years ago, I started to request it during surgery, and I no longer experience post-op nausea or vomiting. For at home use, however, I was given Phenergan. I've had experience with Phenergan suppositories, which are wonderful for uncontrollable vomiting, but for me, the pills had the annoying side effect of muscle twitching/spasming. Fortunately my cousin, an ER nurse, had warned me about this. The first one I took was also the last one I took. I started taking the Colace the day of surgery. Some ladies start earlier. I thought for sure I wouldn't need them, since my diet is fairly good, and I take a good probiotic. WRONG! Even though I was eating prunes and drinking prune juice in addition to the Colace, I still needed a day or two of the Milk of Magnesia. I might try the Valium for muscle spasms. I start my fills on January 3rd. I also asked my PS about Robaxin - a muscle relaxer I was prescribed for back muscle pain. He said it wouldn't hurt to try it if I felt I needed it.",

I did share with her how disappointed I was in how little emphasis was placed on LE, not only before/after my surgery ( I \"only\" had an SNB), but also at the workshop I went to where I got some ridiculous information. She started out by explaining LE in easy, understandable terms, and gave me more explicit info on how to avoid it, especially in my left arm. Just because I had only three nodes removed, and have no signs of LE now, I could get it anytime in the future, and it pays to be safe. She said one of her BC patients had no LE at all for ten years, then one day her garage door got stuck open, and she yanked really hard, repeatedly, to get it shut. Then the LE hit. She said that if I were to go back to the gym, the free weights were better than the machines....but either way, my maximum limit should be 5 pounds. (I think they had me at 40 pounds before surgery!) I asked about cording. She checked my upper arm and didn't feel anything, so I told her to check harder inside my armpit. She agree that I might have some minor cording (Axillary Web Syndrome) and that in the majority of cases, this was self-limiting - it would go away on its own. But if I wanted to, she showed me how to do some massage, with my thumb moving one way and my fingers the other way, to stretch it out. (It really hurt when she did it - but only because my skin is so sensitive, and she didn't use lotion. \"Oh my!\" she said when she saw the red marks on my skin. \"You need to be more gentle than I was, and use lotion!\" .....\"or do it in the shower...\"). I could still feel the area yesterday morning, but it felt like a wire instead of a rope, so I think it's getting smaller. She said that cording is an irritation of the lymph duct, and is not lymphedema. In my case, it was very small and would probably go away soon. But in the meantime, she encouraged me to keep taking the LE precautions. The seroma, which felt like the size of a golf ball after surgery, is now just barely perceptible. She said it as o.k. to massage that as well, to help it reabsorb into my body. I came home with a bunch of new exercises, and a whole lot better understanding of LE and cording.",

No one yet has said that this would be a problem....they said just avoid it on my left (SNB) side. Kam170 -  The LONG version of my story is on page 36 of this thread, somewhere in the middle. The SHORT version is that I need to lose at least 40 pounds, and Kaiser is offering an 82 week Weight Management Program. The first 16 weeks involve meal-replacements in the form of shakes, soups, and bars. I need to get this fat off for two reasons: 1) My cancer is estrogen-positive, and even though I'm post-menopausal, my big honkin' belly fat is still producing estrogen. 2) I want my PS to have the best material to work with at the time of my exchange. If he puts in 700cc or 800cc high profile implants just so I can have some projection over my big gut, and I lose weight later, I will end up looking like Dolly Parton. NOT for me!!! I already know he will be doing extra work cleaning up some of my side boobage, and armpit fat/spillover, and it would be better to have lost the weight prior to going into the Exchange Surgery. I was worried that my exchange might come sooner than I'd expected, because he was filling me so fast. But this morning I got only 80ccs on the left, and 60ccs on the right. I didn't tell him to stop; he just felt the TEs and said that was all for today. So actually, if we slow down, my wait until exchange (final TE fills + 3 months waiting period) may take me closer to my original date. The meal replacement plan is faster than WW. I love WW, but I only lose a pound a week and often hit plateaus. I am very limited in how much I can exercise, and my doctors seem to think this program is a good jump-start to getting down to a normal weight. I can count on losing up to 40 pounds in four months. Then we start easing back into home cooked meals. Sorry....guess my SHORT answer wasn't so short after all!",

They could have come out sooner had I not been putting out so much fluid, but my PS never leaves them in for more than 2 weeks, as he believes this increases the risk of infection. I agree with the other ladies! If by chance you DO have drains in, just tuck 'em in and go do your thing! And have a wonderful time at the concert!",

Last night I had to unwrap the big honkin' splint, (and soak the gauze in water because of all the dried blood) because the ortho doc told me to get the nail polish offa there ASAP. He said it would cause an infection. But after I took off the sticky brown wrap, the metal splint, the gauze, the stockinette wrap, the non-stick bandage, and the Xeriform, and soaked it in water, I was really surprised. I think the extra nail polish actually protected my nail. All the gushing  blood had come from underneath, and there was one large gash on the side, but I got the polish off, and cleaned everything up. My nail wasn't black underneath! (DH says it's probably because I left most of the blood in the parking lot! ) I put everything back on in reverse order, and this morning I woke up at 6 a.m. after the splint fell off. I guess the swelling is going down! It was three times the size of my left thumb. Ortho doc and DH both say the nail will fall off. Ortho isn't sure if it will grow back in right. Anyone have experience with this? Thanks for all the good wishes - y'all are the BEST!",

      "Content": "Dec 3, 2011 10:32PM - edited Dec 4, 2011 12:36AM by Blessings2011 Hello, December Sisters! So good to see those of you who have already had surgery here and posting! Hoping for a smooth recovery for you! Thinking about wrennest and vivirasselena who also have their surgeries this Monday... Well, my \"Things To Do Before Surgery\" list is getting checked off. They delivered the hospital bed yesterday, and I put it the sitting area of our master bedroom. I've made it up to be soothing and cozy. The reason for the hospital bed is that we have a Tempurpedic mattress on our bed, and while it's fabulous for sleeping with a bad back, it is sort of like swimming in jello when you try to get out of it without using your arms. This way, I can raise the head of the bed, have something under my knees to take the pressure off my back, and can raise and lower it to get out of bed by myself. We have recliners, but 1) they aren't comfortable to sleep in, and 2) I wouldn't be able to reach the handles to sit up again! I've cut back on my food intake - no meat since last week - and am keeping well hydrated. I've found that this works well for me before any kind of surgery. I'm getting my protein from other sources. Got some meals frozen, got my button-front clothes ready to go, got my bag packed for the hospital. While my pretty satin jammies might feel good, I think I'll use their hospital gowns while I'm there. I'm concerned about is picking up/bringing home germs from the hospital. Sad, huh? DH and I decorated the house (inside and out) with a FEW of the Christmas decorations we usually put up. Whatever WE put up, HE has to take down! Thanks again to those of you who posted that the anticipation was much worse than the reality of surgery! As long as I keep the focus off myself, and on Him, I'm o.k. Thank you, ladies, for being here!!!  ",

They told me to massage the breast to help dissipate the material and the pain, and it helped. BMX started at 3 p.m. and went fine - initial SN biopsy result was clear!!! Had TEs inserted, finally got to my room at 8 pm. Awake off and on most of the night, chatting with the nurse. Pain was never really under control after anesthesia wore off - I was such a weenie about the morphine pump (PCA) that I only pushed it once an hour instead of every ten minutes. Big mistake. Good news, though, never felt one minute of nausea! Was planning to stay another night, but the nurse talked me out of it. Hospitals are not the best place to recuperate, if you have someone to help you at home. She made my put on my big girl panties and get the heck outta Dodge. I was glad I did. The rented hospital bed at home has been a lifesaver! Started taking the max doses of Norco every six hours for pain, and have gotten some good sleep. Still on Cipro and Benadryl. Haven't had to take any nausea drugs. The ace bandage around my chest is so tight I thought my arms would turn blue. They didn't. Friends have been bringing meals. DH is on drain and med control. He likes charts. No constipation yet, but oh - the gas!!!! I feel like a Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade balloon with a small leak - sssssssssssss!!! SOOOO glad to be home, thinking about all y'all going in for your procedures this week. xoxoxo",

      "Content": "Jan 2, 2012 04:33AM Blessings2011 wrote: Ladies - here are some notes I took from my meeting with the Oncologist on Friday. I hope this post isn't too long. I thought about creating a new thread, but I'd promised to post here. If you think I should put it in a separate thread, I will. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Recap:  Heavy, dense breast tissue, normal mammograms every year for the past 20+ years. Bleeding from left nipple in September: two diagnostic mammograms, two ultrasounds, one galactogram, and two core-needle biopsies. Dx: Multi-focal cancer, mostly DCIS (one area of DCIS AND IDC, a second area of just DCIS). ER/PR+; Her/2/Neu -.BMX/TEs on December 5, 2011. SNB clear, final path report clear. No evidence of any IDC in either breast. So this is the information the Oncologist had when we met on Friday. 1)  First, she told me that she was very pleased with all the results of my testing. The cancer was small and caught early. (She, too, agreed with the idea that the core needle biopsy had removed all the invasive cancer so none was detectable on final pathology.) 2) She said that in cases like mine, chemotherapy and radiation would not be needed, but that she would offer me medication to prevent recurrence. (Later, it didn't sound like an offer at all, but rather a mandate.) 3)  Even though the areas of IDC were small - .5 mm ( grain of salt) and 1.5 mm (half a grain of rice) this now puts me at future risk for either a local or a distant recurrence. 4)  A local recurrence would mean that more invasive breast cancer cells could be found in the breast tissue. There is no way every single cell of tissue can be removed at the time of mastectomy,  and it could be possible that a microscopic invasive cancer cell could still be lurking there. We don't believe there is any, and the reports would back this up. 5)  A distant recurrence would mean that invasive breast cancer cells have spread (metastasized) to other body parts such as the lungs, liver, or spine. This would be very serious, and treatment options at that point would be very limited. She used the word \"incurable\", as treatment would focus on quality of life and minimizing the spread of the disease. We don't believe this has happened, or is likely to happen, as there was no lymph node involvement, nor any vascular involvement. 6) My particular type of invasive cancer is considered a microinvasion because it was so tiny. It is considered Stage 1A. And the IHC tissue analysis indicated that it was a very slow-growing (non-aggressive) type of cancer. So the odds of it spreading anywhere else in the body are very low at this point. The actual risk of recurrence is between 1% and 2%. 7)  The tumors were estrogen and progesterone positive. Even though I'm post-menopausal, the adrenal cortex still produces estradiol, as does cholesterol, and belly fat. Since I am not having chemo or rads, the next best treatment to prevent recurrence is to take either a Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM) like Tamoxifen or Evista, OR an Aromatase Inhibitor (AI) such as Arimidex or Femara. 8)  She is recommending Arimidex pending the results of the labwork she ordered. In particular she will be looking at bone density, liver function, Vitamin D level. Most likely I will need to take Fosamax as well. 9)  The most common side effect of Arimidex is body aches...because I have fibromyalgia, this may be a problem. I can try the others (Femara, Aromasin) but if I can't tolerate those, the only alternative would be Tamoxifen. 10) The purpose of this drug is not to prolong my life. The purpose would be to prevent a local or distant recurrence of breast cancer. 11)  I do not need the Oncotype test - the IDC was too small (< 1 cm) 12)  I do not need the BRCA test - there is no family history to indicate this. (Mom was post-menopausal when she was dxd.) 13)  I can still take Premarin vaginal cream for vaginal dryness - a tiny amount, several times a week and tapering off when no longer needed. She did say that this is a case of \"use it or lose it\" and that chronic vaginal dryness can be helped by intercourse, or other stretching of the vaginal tissues. 14) I don't have to eliminate every source of soy from my diet, I just need to not use soy milk as my regular source of milk. I'm switching to Lactose-free milk. Example - my fish oil capsules contain soy. I can still take them. 15) I can take vitamins, but I should NOT take any anti-oxidants. Recent studies have shown that they help ALL cells grow, including cancer cells. 16) For AI side effects such as hot flashes, Effexor is o.k., as is black cohosh, but no other herbal supplements can be used. I've said the visit was \"sobering\" because I was under the impression that my surgery was sort of the maximum treatment for the minimal diagnosis. I was really hoping that I could say \"thanks, but no thanks\" to a drug that would have no bearing on my future quality of life. Now I have a lot to think about. I've heard so many comments from people saying \"Oh, now you are cancer-free and never have to worry about breast cancer again!\" ....and unfortunately, this isn't really the case. Right now, there is no evidence of disease. I am praying that there will be no evidence of disease in me until the day God calls me home for whatever reason. There are no guarantees in this world. Stuff happens. Accidents happen. I could get run over by a truck tomorrow as I walk to my mailbox. Statistically, this isn't likely, nor is the chance that I will experience a recurrence of this breast cancer. So it's up to me to stay vigilant but not obsessed, and live the rest of my life committing to be the healthiest and happiest I can be. Not a bad goal for anyone, actually. Oh - almost forgot - the Oncologist asked if I did much reading on the Internet. She warned me about there being so much bad information out there, and if I WERE going online, to be sure to go to BreastCancer.Org - that they had the best, most accurate info of any of the online sites.  ",

Fever was 102 yesterday, but that didn't last long. Nothing looks odd on my body...no redness, no probs with incisions healing....just.....YUCK!!!! Missed my FIL's 90th birthday party today. Just stayed home and slept. I'm sure this, too, shall pass.....but in the meantime, GRRRRRRR!!!! p.s. Sure took my mind off my TEs. ",

I was the one who laid in bed and cried for two weeks after I got home from the BMX because the TEs made me feel like my chest was on fire from the inside out. Now I think that once my body has gotten used to having foreign objects inside it, the fills are going to be o.k. However - keep in mind that I am NOT a slender person...I have lots of loose skin, and very lax pec muscles. My PS says that may be a huge plus for me right now.",

So sorry to hear you\u2019ve had complications\u2026 I know it\u2019s a long wait, but hey, New Girls for the New Year! Big hugs to you.... Goldlining \u2013 let\u2019s see\u2026 surgery in December and a half marathon in January? I hope I have that backwards! Best of luck to you at Disney World, and with your fine-tuning! Ginger48 \u2013 I think PT ought to be a standard referral for anyone having surgery \u2013 sometimes it can make the difference between suffering in silence, and actually finding relief for problems we thought were here to stay. Hope you find relief. ~~~ Yep! Had I not been on this board for months before my BMX, I would have thought \u201creconstruction\u201d was a piece of cake. NOT!!! I dodged the infections, the necrosis, the botched procedures, etc., but after Exchange, I was totally disappointed in the outcome. Lefty was actually trying to crawl over my left shoulder. The PS said \u201cWhat is it that you want? I think they look great!\u201d Grrrrr\u2026 But a fabulous myofascial release therapist (who is also an LE therapist) worked on me for five weeks, and in that time, she got rid of the awful swelling I\u2019d had for five months\u2026 swelling the PS said may or may not go away. Now, a year later, I do notice the New Girls are a bit droopy, but considering that the Old Girls hung down to my waist, I\u2019m still thrilled. I do feel the implants every day, but as time goes on, my brain adjusts to the \u201cnew normal\u201d feeling. It sure isn\u2019t quick, though. This weekend will end my 8th week off Anastrozole (generic Arimidex). After a year on the drug, my SEs were so bad I begged my MO for a break. I was becoming severely disabled, and terribly depressed. As of today, the results have been miraculous. I have my life back. Now the question is, do I go back on Anastrozole? Try something else? Just stop the AIs completely? Such a hard decision, and even after considering it for 8 weeks, I still don\u2019t have an answer. Will see the MO on Friday afternoon. Guess I\u2019ll know then. ~~~ SO \u2013 hope our other December 2011 sisters see this thread and pop in with an update!!! Thinking of you all!!!!",

I  then went on to say that I understood that stats were what she did - that her goal was to reduce the risk of any recurrence in her cancer patients. I also said I hadn't asked the right questions so she could give me the right answers. I told her that it wasn't that I was afraid of GETTING side effects from the Arimidex; it was that I already HAVE many of the side effects...and what would adding this drug do to my QOL? She was very patient and listened well. Bottom line - I told her I would try the Arimidex and we would discuss side effects. Based on how bad they were, I could try another drug, or she would just tell me that the risk was not worth the benefit, and to stop taking the drug. I think that's what worried me the most.....that to her, QOL would not factor into the big picture, when it really does. She said that taking the Arimidex would lower my current 1% - 2% risk of recurrence another 20% - 40%, as close to zero as possible. I'm so glad we understand each other.  ",

I am now officially at 620ccs, with a goal of 700ccs. I still have Sponge-Bob-Square-Foobs, and all I can think of is that there is no other place for the saline to go except for under my armpits and up my neck. Now THAT should be attractive. We had to have a discussion afterwards about whether or not he should fill me to 700ccs, considering that I am planning on losing a lot of weight very quickly in the next four months. Finally he decided to go for it, and I will go back in two weeks for the final 80cc fills. Not really looking forward to it.....this last one was NOT fun! Right foob hurt all day and all night. But everything looks good, and my skin looks healthy. Optifast Program starts on March 22nd. Thankfully, we got to go on vacation before it started, so I had my one fabulous restaurant meal. The rest of the time I made smoothies and protein drinks, trying to get \"in training\" for the meal replacement part of the program. I'm just having such a hard time getting in that GALLON of water a day!!! Hope all my December Sistahs are having a great evening.....",

Welcome, Fytnlykeagirl! ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Yesterday, youngest son, DIL, and two granddaughters (8 and 6) came by to spend the day with us as they traveled to a mountain vacation. We hadn't seen them since they moved to Washington State two years ago! We had so much fun - we ate, we took pics, we ate, we walked to the playground (Grandma even went down the curly slide! Note to self: stuff dryer sheets in your underwear next time you do that.....) We came back, ate some more, played games, then while Grandpa, Mommy and Daddy sat and talked in the living room, Grandma took the girls back to her big Jacuzzi bathtub and let them \"swim\" with all the jets on. The room was soaked, as was Grandma. At one point, one of the girls accidentally opened the drain, and the water level got below the jets. So the room looked sort of like all the fountains at Versailles. But we quickly fixed that and refilled the tub. Then we played \"Beauty Parlor\" as the girls still had to get their hair dried and jammies on so they could drive up to the mountain house. Today I woke up at noon, feeling hungover from all the crap I ate that I'd been avoiding for the past month in preparation for Optifast. But I sure had fun!!! Hope all my December Sisters had a great, relaxing weekend and are doing well this week.",

From now on, it would be exams just like this morning's, although she didn't say how often. She was thrilled with my progress on Optifast (22 pounds lost on program for a total of 35 pounds down from my highest) and said that there was a study - I'll try to look it up - that linked weight loss and fitness to a 23% reduction in recurrence. That's good for my already low 1% - 2% risk..... We're also holding off on Arimidex til I'm done with the diet. My liver enzymes have been wacky, so she wanted to wait to make sure the origins of any side effects would be specific. So far, so good!!!!!",

It is now, but it is not what I focus on. \"Mortality\" was also something I never paid much attention to. I still don't. We just don't know what's around the next corner, and if I spend all my energy worrying about tomorrow's problems (that may never happen), it will just rob me of all today's joy. I just can't live like that. Part of it is my strong faith. I believe in hope. What I DON'T believe in is numbers on a screen. CancerMath has no useful purpose for me anymore. It is not a crystal ball, and it can't predict my future.",

It takes an incredible amount of discipline, time, and money to go through the program. But nothing else had worked for me.

I did have some side effects in the beginning, but those have subsided. I was never hungry, never cheated, and got my big energy spike somewhere around week 3. Even though it's housed at Kaiser, the program is open to the public.

I think my whole breast cancer experience (seven diagnostic procedures, a BMX, two surgeons, TEs, fills, an LE PT, and drugs) has come to a little over $200 out of my pocket. My Kaiser premium for me and my husband is $40 a month. A physician's visit is $15. There is no cost for diagnostic procedures, labs, Xrays, Ultrasounds, MRIs etc. The $50 inpatient fee was waived because I was a breast cancer patient. Drugs are either $5, $10, or $15 depending on the formulary. My exchange surgery is August 22nd. There will probably be a $15 co-pay. That's it. There were many times in the past when I thought about leaving my job, but it was a university position and we had a strong union. They bargained for our benefits every two years. For years, the university paid all our premiums; it's only been in the past few years that the amount has come out of my paycheck, and now my retirement check. My heart breaks for those whose bills are not covered, or are covered so poorly that the deductibles take every last penny they have. Bogie -  So sorry you are having issues with the TEs!!! I have heard of many success stories of ladies with DIEP procedures. ~~~~~~~~ Well, two things are official: my exchange surgery has officially been scheduled for August 22nd, but I won't know the time until they call me the day before. The second thing is that tonight was Optifast weigh-in, and I have officially lost 50 pounds!!! WooHOO! Now just ten more pounds to get to my goal. Wishing all you December ladies a good night and a great rest of the week.",

Yes, my exchange surgery is in 9 days - August 22nd (not that I'm counting ) and I had my Pre-Op visit with the PS this morning. We're all squared away on what I want and don't want. He's going to have to release more of the pectoral muscle at the bottom, near my IMF, so the implants fill the skin out better. And he might do a lateral capsulorraphy - narrowing of the pockets - because the implants I'm getting (Allergan Natrelle High Profile Smooth Saline 700ccs) are narrower than my current TEs. He'll see once he starts \"trying on\" different implants with different fills. The cool thing about the saline implants is that they can be deflated before putting them into the pockets, then individually reinflated to just the right amount. That means going in through tinier incisions in the old MX incisions. He said to expect about 2 hours in the OR (with general anesthesia), about 2 hours in Recovery, and them home I go with new Ta Ta's. Absolutely no using arms for 2 weeks, then gradually get back to reaching, lifting, etc. Will have an Ace bandage after surgery, then a few days later I can change to a sports bra or a Genie bra. He'll wait til I'm fully healed from the procedures before he clears me to get fitted for an underwire bra, which he says will help mold the pockets in the right position. How about you? Are you ready? (Silly question....) Hi, Moonflwr912!!!! Wow - you're doing good for just having your TE replaced today! Praying that this time things go smoothly for you, with no complications, and good healing!  Ginger! Ain't feeling \"normal\" wonderful? The first time you feel it, you realize how BC has taken over every aspect of your life. It gave me such a sense of freedom and hope. (FYI, I reconnected with my DH at our 30 year HS reunion. We'd gone all through school together since Kindergarten, then after HS I moved away for college, and started a career. He stayed put for college, and married and started a family. By the time of the reunion, his kids were grown, and he was widowed. We've been married since 2005.) Spunkyboobster - So sorry to hear you're having the blues. I've heard of this letdown period...kind of like a cross between PTSD and Post-partum depression. We are so focused on surgeries and treatments and everything BC....and then.......just a pill a day.

She told me that papillomas were very, very common in women, but must be surgically removed, as they almost always eventually cause bleeding. I had two diagnostic mammograms, two ultrasounds, a ductogram (which failed, as the duct was almost completely blocked), and two Ultrasound-guided core-needle biopsies. It was only the last two procedures that found not only DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ, or non-invasive cancer) plus a small microinvasion of IDC (invasive cancer). Even then, the Radiologist was still concerned about the right breast. Both screening and diagnostic mammograms were unclear enough that she wanted me to have an MRI. But by that time, I had already made my decision. Because of my history and my risk factors, I decided to have a bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction. I was 60 years old at the time, and it was the right decision for me. You are very young. You deserve the best, most agressive, determined specialist you can find - a breast surgeon, not a general surgeon. Hopefully, you will find that the causes of your bleeding and abnormalities are all benign, and that a simple procedure can alleviate your fears. But get yourself to a Breast Surgeon! ",

If the breast surgeon took a smear, I sure don't remember it, and I certainly never got any results back. But I understand that other women with bloody nipple discharge do get it tested. No,  I didn't have a lump, per se. My Original Girls were very large (38DDD) - heavy, droopy, fibrocystic, and painful. They felt like bags of rocks, and self-exams were impossible. But I passed every yearly mammogram I'd had for the past 20 years. Every year, I asked my PCP for additional testing, like an ultrasound. He always refused, saying that an US is not a screening tool. But when I showed up in his office with a bleeding nipple, THAT got his attention! Make sure you resist the temptation to see if the nipple is still bleeding by squeezing it. That could make it more difficult for the specialist to see it. I had a hard time with my ductogram, because we couldn't make the bleeding start. We had to have the mammo tech assist by \"milking\" the breast itself, not just the nipple. (We actually had a good laugh over that. When the Radiologist asked for her help, her reply was \"Oh sure, ask The Milker...\" a reference to her growing up on a small local dairy.... ) With a history of breast cancer in your family, you have a right to be concerned. However, try to remember that more than 80% of breast lumps are benign, and that your shoulder pain could be something as simple as the strain of being a nurse and lifting heavy things (like patients). Keep plugging away until you find a specialist you are comfortable with. Wishing you the best....",

Sorry you had reason to find us, but this is the best place to be in terms of information and support. Spiculated lesion just means that it is a lump of tissue with spikes or points on the surface. It's important to keep in mind that both benign and cancerous lesions can be spiculated. Right now, you don't have BAD news, you just have news. You will find out more at your diagnostic mammos and ultrasound. Your surgeon may even want to get a biopsy, but even that is no reason to panic. This is really the hardest part - the waiting and the uncertainty. Our minds take us down scary roads when we don't have enough information. I would caution you to stay away from Dr. Google - he can be a liar and a fearmonger. Stay busy and distracted. Find something you love and go do it. You'll have results soon enough. If there is, in fact, something to worry about, you will take it one day at a time, step by step. And there are a gazillion women here to help you!

A few suggestions: If you usually decorate your house, and you still want to do it this year, do it early. DH was a trooper dragging stuff down from the attic after Thanksgiving, so we could make the house festive. I didn't have a comfy recliner to sleep in, and our bed is a massive Tempurpedic memory foam mattress which is like swimming in Jello, so I rented a fully electric, fully adjustable hospital bed for a month. I covered the mattress with a twin sized Tempurpedic topper and it was incredibly comfortable for my back. (I am not a back sleeper, but that's the only position you'll be in for a while.) We were lucky - it fit in the sitting area in our master bedroom. DH hooked up my reading lamp to a remote control and pinned it to my mattress, so I could turn out the light when I was tired. We got an over-the-bed hospital table, and toddler sized sippy cups and little snacks I couldn't spill. If you have any pain at all - take your pain medication around the clock! You can't catch up to pain, and the fight isn't worth it. Of course, you may be one of those ladies who goes home and takes nothing stronger than a Tylenol. But if you do take the pain meds, TAKE THE STOOL SOFTENERS!!!! Seriously. Just do it. I set up a Pain Station and a Drain Station in the bathroom. DH kept track of every pill I took, and at what time. The Drain Station contained all my alcohol wipes, surgical gloves, the measuring cup, and the log of bulb measurements. I actually had no problem emptying my drains myself, but it gave DH (a retired EMT) something to do to feel useful. We were very cautious about letting me have visitors. Our family is notorious about being deathly ill, then denying they are contagious. So we just told everyone I was in Quarantine. Which brings me to another important point: now is the WORST time for germs out in public places. My BMX was scheduled originally in October, but cancelled by the hospital for scheduling reasons. Then I was scheduled for November 8th, but as I was out and about trying to do my Christmas shopping early, I caught the WORST upper respiratory infection that lasted for three weeks. They barely let me have my surgery in December. So we armed ourselves with surgical masks, giant sized hand sanitizers, large cans of Lysol spray at each door, where we would spray the soles of our shoes after coming in from the outside, Clorox wipes in case anyone came in the house - we'd wipe down surfaces afterwards, and - every time we went to the hospital or the doctor's office, we always wore surgical masks (on the advice of our doctors.) I know, sounds like we were crazy people, but we didn't get sick, and I didn't have some horrible infection while trying to recuperate from a BMX. So I wish you all the best - quick, successful procedures, no complications, and complete healing. And remember.... the worst parts of recuperation are JUST TEMPORARY. This too, shall pass.",

Now that the new year is here, I want to change my focus from being sick, to living well. I know there are no guarantees that a certain lifestyle will prevent cancer, but if I lose weight, get stronger, lower my blood sugar and blood pressure, and improve my immune system, well, I think that will go a long way toward my feeling like a strong, healthy woman. And just maybe I can kick those AI hot flashes to the curb in the process! Prayers for you on Friday. Keep an open mind, listen to all the details, and focus on the positive ones. Hugs to you!!!",

I never, ever got my pain under control in the hospital (refused to push the PCA containing morphine) and I hated to think I needed to take the narcotics around the clock, but I did. Many ladies here - AND my awesome PS - told me that. So it was two Norco every six hours, around the clock. DH got up at 4 a.m. just to make sure I got my meds. Some days all I did was lay in bed and cry. I was so happy for all the sisters who had come home from surgery and took just a Tylenol, but I felt like a failure because I wasn't one of them. I could only sleep for maybe an hour or two at night, so of course, I had zero energy during the day. I did try to get up and at least walk around the house, or in the back yard, so I wouldn't get blood clots. Everyone was saying \"Give it time!\" and I was thinking \"I already have!\" I just hadn't given it enough time. Last week, almost a month after surgery, I had my first set of fills (which is amazing in itself, as my TEs had felt like they were on fire inside my chest from the get-go) - and - incredibly - my first day without pain! DH and I try to walk around the block, but I still shuffle and lose my balance. It's exhausting. We're up to two times around, though, and we plan to keep increasing it. Going back to work isn't an issue for me; I'm retired. But I know I would never have the energy to go back now, and maybe not even in another month. I think doctors tend to underestimate the time it takes to recover; it's usually the nurses that set you straight.",

The Genie bra has double-layered cups, so that you can poke in these weird, hard plastic inserts. Needless to say, I didn't. I originally bought them when I was a 38DD, and they looked awful.

But I do remember that tightness in my throat many years ago, and for me, it was a symptom of a hiatal hernia. For my niece, it's a narrowing of the esophagus that requires stretching on occasion.

I think I posted here about signing up for the Kaiser Weight Management Program in order to lose 40 pounds by June...well, after I announced to the entire world that I was going to do this, the doubts crept in. People started telling me how harsh that would be on my body, especially after major surgery. I started to doubt my ability to stay on the program for the entire four months of meal replacements. I decided to pray really hard, and to get out of God's way. I knew He had a plan for me, but I sure was trying to control everything by doing research, listing pros and cons, and having a gazillion appointments with other medical professionals at Kaiser. So I just asked for a sign...something that I could take for certain that I was on the right path. I asked my PS if I were healthy enough to go on a 960 calorie diet. He said yes. I had all my labwork done and it was all normal. I spoke to a Health Educator who told me that exercise was 60% of the program, and that I could do it myself if I followed a 1200 calorie-a-day plan in conjunction with one of the Registered Dieticians. She said all I needed to do was get an hour of aerobic activity per day. (Yeah, right, with all my other medical issues...) I had an EKG done that showed PROBABLE LEFT AORTIC ABNORMALITY. Turns out the EKG tech knew nothing about TEs, and that they would cause an abnormal EKG reading. (Learned that after-the-fact from my PS) I saw the Weight Management doctor who was pleased I wanted to join the program, but was very worried that the very low calorie diet would affect my healing, especially since I was looking at a June exchange date. She referred me to the MO for approval. Amazingly, the MO was THRILLED that I was going to go through the program. She said that no, I could not have any surgery during the meal replacement phase, but during transition, where food was reintroduced, I would be fine at about three weeks in. In her opinion, losing 40-50 pounds right now would be the absolute best thing I could do for my overall health (cholesterol, blood sugar, blood pressure, excess body fat) AND the best thing I could do for my breast cancer. In fact, she wants me to delay taking the Arimidex until AFTER the four-month meal replacement phase, so that whatever side effects I might get from the diet would not be confused with the side effects from the AI. SO - I took that as my sign. The next \"cohort: doesn't start til March 15th, so I will sort of be in training to lower my food intake and up my water intake in the meantime. And finally, I realize that it's not a race to get my exchange. I would dearly love to have my squishies before summer, but the original date would have been in August anyway, had I not gotten some unexpected fills. So I will bide my time, follow the directions, and let the docs tell me when I'm healthy enough for my exchange. So thanks to all of you who have been telling me the same thing here!!!!  ",

Hi, Kam -  I made the decision to do Optifast on my own, because I asked my plastic surgeon what would happen if he put in permanent saline implants that matched the size of my TEs before I lost weight, and he said \"The implants would look bigger afterwards.\" Well, I have in AMAZON sized expanders, and if he did match up the saline implants to the TEs I now have, and I did lose the weight later on, I would have stripper boobs. NOT what I want! I have about 40 more pounds to lose. My goal is 135 or 140. The other reason is one I hadn't thought of. I had to get my MOs approval before being accepted into this program, and when she saw I had applied to it, she was THRILLED!!! She said that if I hadn't done it myself, she would have referred me. She told me \"The very best thing you can do for your overall health - AND your ER+ breast cancer - is to drop this weight, now!!!\" Estrogen is produced in body fat, of which I have plenty. After I get off Optifast, I'll be taking the Estrogen-sucking drug Arimidex for five years. Someone just reminded me that this drug alone can add the pounds. So I'll be on the liquid diet for three more months, then slowly transition back to food. Most people on the plan continue to lose weight as they add regular meals to their days. Once I have been off the fast for three weeks, I can have surgery again, but I want to make sure I'm strong nutritionally, as well as physically, so I'm back at the gym. I'm expecting to have my exchange surgery in September.",

Meeting with adults who either abandoned their dreams for a degree because of Life, or just postponed them due to other circumstances, I was blessed every day with the most incredible people with the most amazing amount of determination and gratitude that something they once had thought was impossible, was actually happening. I had many students with major illnesses and disabilities along the way. Most  major institutions are prepared to accommodate students in any way they can. Sometimes it's really not about the degree at all - it's about being in a learning environment,  being motivated and encouraged and excited that you are finding out that you are still the same SMART person you thought you were when you were ten or fifteen or twenty, before you became a wife, a mom, a career woman, an unemployed person, an person with an illness, a person with bills, a mortgage, kids needing braces, a person faced with incredible debt after owing just a 20% deductible on medical charges.... Education can be expensive. Financial aid in the way of scholarships, grants, and loans is available. Community Colleges have wonderful classes for not very much money. Online courses are offered for those who can be disciplined enough to do the work without sitting in class, but enjoy the freedom of taking a course sitting at the computer in their jammies with a cup of tea, at 1 a.m. Me, I always loved the give-and-take of the  in-person classroom. But these days, many profs offer a scheduled time for students to chat, as well as online-chat in lieu of office hours. Love of learning is a lifelong affliction, by the way. It is highly addictive. After my Bachelors degree, I knew I wanted my Masters because I wasn't done learning. It was just that simple. I would being by identifying the area you wish to study, find out what institutions offer that program, look up their catalog online, and see if taking the entire list of required courses is something you want, or if you would rather pick and choose what you study. The Major Advisor for that program usually has the authority to waive and make substitutions for degree requirements. And many institutions offer the opportunity to create a Special Major. Please feel free to PM me if you have any questions.  I am always a cheerleader for education. p.s. I was also the Director of the 60+ Program. You had to be 60 to enter, all fees and tuition were waived, and you had to be following a degree program. My oldest student was 93. It's never too late.",

Just because I am home from BC surgery, that doesn't mean I can skip my regular meds while taking the pain pills and antibiotics! Duh. 2.  Just because someone brings a meal to my home doesn't mean I have to eat it! Duh. I found myself doubling up on the Norco I brought home from the hospital. I had a lot of break-through pain, so I thought taking the maximum amount would be a good thing. Not necessarily so! I had the dreaded narcotic constipation and by Friday, took my first Milk of Magnesia. Yesterday I took another one. Last night I was feeling really nauseated, and took a Phenergan. Today, let's just say that constipation is no longer a problem. Before I had my BMX/recon, I'd made a list of the foods I wanted to have handy. Small, snacky things, like little containers of fruit cocktail, jello, tapioca, yogurt, crackers, etc. That was before I realized what a huge church family we have, and that we would be inundated with tons of food - and not neccessarily healthy stuff. A lot of it has been rich, fatty, and not what we usually eat around here. Instead of my little healthy stuff, I've eaten whatever friends have delivered. Yesterday, we got all the leftovers from a Christmas party I couldn't attend! It was a sweet thought, but.....ugh. So back to basics - get back on the probiotics I usually take every day, and the fewer additional prescriptions the better.....(still have 5 days to go on the antibiotics) AND - more healthy eating. Fresh fruits and veggies, and sincere thanks to all who bring food. Rather than dictate to them what to bring, we just freeze it in smaller amounts to eat later, and send the rest over to my 90 year old father in law, who adores it.",

I'd had it ever since I had boobs, and just figured that if it were serious, it would have caused me more problems than it did. (Ah, the wisdom of teenagers.... ) When they finally removed it, it was the size of a ping-pong ball...but the shape of my breast was not distorted at all afterwards. My mom had BC, and as I got older, I knew I was at risk. Had I found any more fibroadenomas, I probably would have had them removed, as I would have been paranoid that they were hiding areas of cancer somehow.  But I never got any more, and it was 42 years later I was dx'd with BC in my left breast, totally unrelated to my fibroadenoma. Wishing you the best!",

Some women can have a BMX w/TEs, come home, take a Tylenol, then run a marathon the next day. Then there's the rest of us. It takes TIME to recover from surgery, and for some, it takes longer than for others. Two months after my surgery, I was still weak as a kitten with no energy and a penchant for naps - frequent naps. That made me more depressed than anything. A few things that helped: Taking my pain meds regularly, and around the clock until I was certain I didn't need them any more. You can't \"catch up\" to pain, so take the meds. Move. You don't have to run a marathon, but start small and work your way up. My first exercise was limping down to the mailbox, clinging to the arm of my DH. Not tooo much longer than that, I was power walking. Make sure you are getting enough protein - \"they\" say we need at least 100 grams a day in order to heal. As soon as I bumped up my protein in the form of whey protein shakes and organic turkey jerky, my strength started to return. Stay hydrated. This was always a problem for me. I found that I could drink more diluted iced herbal tea than plain water. Get a good night's sleep. HAH! Easy to say, right? But if you are not getting enough sleep at night, you'll feel awful and wrung out the next day. Always check with your doctor if you feel something is not right. Ask if there is anything he can do to help you - especially in the area of pain or sleep meds. And many women find great relief from going to a physical therapist. Make an appointment and see if there are things that you can do to feel better. Wishing you the best....",

Here's the good news: the majority of all breast lumps, issues, and problems are benign....NOT breast cancer! But you are doing the right thing - letting a specialist check you out further to 1) get a baseline on what's going on in there, and 2) hopefully give you peace of mind that this is nothing to worry about. The mammogram should be brief, but don't freak out if you sit there in your gown afterwards while a radiologist looks at your films. They could call you back in for better views and clearer pictures.

He also put hand sanitizer in a little belt loop holder and used it religiously. He went off the steroids in December, and his immune system should be getting back to normal soon, so he's trying to go more places without the mask. I got sick a month before my BMX last November, so was in bed for a whole month before my surgery....I had been faithful about washing hands and using hand sanitizer, but the day I went to the Apple store for my iPad, the clerk was sniffling and coughing in my face. BAM. Down I went. My PCP reminded me that many germs are airborne, and to wear a mask especially to doctors' and hospital visits.  When I got home from surgery, I adopted the surgical-mask-in-public habit, too. Plus I use hospital-grade hand sanitizing foam in a little can from CVS. We also use Clorox wipes on surfaces that are touched, and whenever we go to the hospital for appointments, or the nursing home to see family, we spray Lysol on the soles of our shoes before we enter the house. We'll let up eventually, but in our case, a simple cold would have meant a very serious illness.",

He said \"I like them, but I LOVE you, and I'd rather have you healthy.\" He went on to say that no matter what happened, we'd do it together, because we are a team. While I was still in the decision-making process, I made him go online with me and look at pics of women who'd had reconstruction, and those who had not. He was fully prepared by the time we met with the plastic surgeon. My mom had BC when she was my age. She had a radical mastectomy with no treatment, and no recon. I was as used to her huge scar as I was the curve of her smile. In my heart, I knew I wanted to give recon (implants) a try, but if that failed, I would have them removed and go flat immediately. DH understood and agreed, and the hardest thing for him was my coming home from the hospital in horrible pain - not from the BMX, but from the expanders. We both questioned the wisdom of having them put in. He was my Pain Man (gave me all my meds) and my Drain Man (took charge of emptying and measuring all the drains.) He was right - we were a team. I'm fully filled now (620ccs) and they feel like boulders. DH seems happy with them (he always was a rockhound) and I have no shame at all walking around topless - something I never did when I was a 38DD/DDD.  He knows the reality of a breast cancer diagnosis. Things can change in a heartbeat. But right now, I think the sexiest thing for him is the idea that I have a new reason to take good care of my body. I think this whole experience has strengthened our marriage.",

Until you've been there yourself it's difficult to know how to respond.) I will continue to post Facebook messages throughout the month of October I hope they will be sort and to the point,so as not to lose the reader's interest. I will make posts on MBC separate because they are so important for others to understand. As for Pinkwashing, I've been posting about that for years - after one well-meaning friend, upon hearing I had BC, actually mailed me some cocktail napkins with pink high heels and pink ribbons. SERIOUSLY? That's how she showed her compassion? ARGHHH - I knew I had my work cut out for me. The reference to Pinkwashing in this year's FB post was a reminder from last year's which was longer. Ladies - with one in eight of us being dx'd with BC, we have a LOT of consumer power. There are a lot of ways we can protest - with our mouths, our letters and our wallets. I always take the time to complain to the managers of stores with huge pinkwashed displays. I let them know that I and my friends with BC will not shop there unless the display is tasteful and productive. I want to know where the money goes, and who profits by it. I let manufacturers know that I will no longer purchase their products as long as they are pinkwashed and do not reveal where the money goes. And I let them know there are a gazillion other women like me who will be boycotting their products until they gain some perspective and sensitivity towards breast cancer patients. O.K. Off my soapbox!!!! Hope everyone is having a great day, and enjoying these last few days of September! P.S. Never be afraid to speak up!",

Yes, I can use stats to educate, but as far as living my life day to day, they have no meaning to me. ~ ~ ~  On another subject, Ladies - please tell me what you know about this organization: Breast Cancer Research Foundation http://www.bcrfcure.org/ It has a maximum four-star rating on Charity Navigator. The wording on their home page (Blog) was especially poignant to me:  This October, join us and turn awareness into action! It all started in 1993 in Evelyn Lauder\u2019s kitchen. Over a cup of coffee, Mrs. Lauder and her dear friendDr. Larry Nortonbegan a conversation that, over time, would changethe history of breast cancer. Recognizing the power of research and its potential to change the lives of millions of women and men, they realized that to tackle this disease a new approach was critical. They believed research was the way forward and founded BCRF on the belief that funding research was the only obstacle between breast cancer and a cure. Today, we remain committed as ever to advancing the world\u2019s most promising research because we see its ability to transform lives each and every day. Evelyn\u2019s mission has become ours, and we want to make it yours. Everyone has the power to play a role in eradicating this disease. This October, we invite you to #BeTheEnd. Be the end of fear. Be the end of hospital visits. Be the end of side effects and needless suffering. Be the end of loss. The end of breast cancer begins with each and every one of us. Start a fundraiser.Share your story.Make a donation.Spread the word by sharing your commitment to BCRF with friends and family on your social networks. Honor someone you love who has been affected by breast cancer. Inspire your friends and family to #BeTheEnd. No matter what you do, when you support BCRF, you support research. And when you support research, you are making a lasting impact in the fight against breast cancer. Until the number of deaths from breast cancer is zero, we will not stop. Join us, and help fuel the research needed today to save lives tomorrow. Everyone can be part of the solution. We are all part of the cure. How will you #BeTheEnd of breast cancer?",

In September, 2011, I was diagnosed with Invasive Breast Cancer. I underwent a double mastectomy in December 2011, with final reconstruction in August 2012. From the bottom of my heart, I thank all of you who supported me on that path. Today there is no evidence of cancer in my body. God is good. As many of you begin to participate in the Annual \u201cBreast Cancer Awareness\u201d activities coming up, I just ask you to please consider these things: 1.  Does the activity TRIVIALIZE breast cancer? NOT GOOD! This is a very serious issue. 2.  Does the activity SEXUALIZE breast cancer? NOT GOOD! There is nothing sexy about breast cancer. 3.  Does the activity generate income to be donated to a reputable organization that provides direct services to women in need? GREAT! Low income patients need all the help they can get. 4.  Does the activity generate income to be donated to a reputable organization that funds research for a breast cancer CURE? GREAT! We all have \u201cawareness\u201d\u2026 what we need is a CURE. 5.  If you put a \u201cPinkwashed\u201d product in your shopping cart, have you checked to see exactly how much money from that sale is donated, and the name of the organization where the proceeds are donated? GREAT! If it is not stated, then the MANUFACTURER is making money off the misery of breast cancer patients everywhere. NOT GOOD! Pink ribbon advertising is not enough. Again, I thank you all so much for your love and support when I was going through this. As ONE IN EIGHT women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetimes, I also thank you on their behalf. xoxoxo ~ ~ ~ ~  I always want to be sensitive to those who love me and are just uneducated about the way they support breast cancer causes. I never want to publicly shame or embarrass those who love me. Their hearts are in the right place; I just need to get the info out to them. Last post was about MBC, this one is more about those stupid gimmicks that pop up everywhere.",

Ironically, mammograms did not find my cancer. I was diagnosed at the same age she was. She was my hero and my role model. She had her left breast removed, with no other treatment or recon. She passed at the age of 87 with no recurrence of the cancer. I wish I had some good advice for you.... just wanted to let you know I felt the same way you do. Maybe an ultrasound or an MRI?",

The Breast Surgeon (BS) does the Sentinel Node Biopsy or Axillary Node Removal if necessary, and has not been done previously. Then he or she removes all the breast tissue to make sure there is nothing left behind (except for possible nipple/areola sparing MX.) They then send all the removed tissue off to the Pathologist for the final pathology report. Then the Plastic Surgeon steps in and takes over. He or she creates the pockets where the eventual implants will go, and inserts temporary Tissue Expanders, to stretch and create room for the expansion process, and whatever else their preference is, like Alloderm, or other materials used in the recon process. They insert drain tubes. They then close the incision and apply the bandages. (Every surgery is different; this is just a general description of common \"immediate\" recon surgery.) So - the BS opens, and the PS closes. My medical team called it \"tag team surgery\"... While you are waiting, you may want to go back to the home page of BCO. They have wonderful sections that are chock full of information that explains the different kinds of breast cancer, surgeries, treatment options, etc. There is a lot of knowledge on this site. Wishing you the best!",

Oh - also, my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 60 - same age I was. In those days there were no fancy tests, no reconstruction, or a variety of options, so she had a single mastectomy, and no other treatment. Every year she would go in for a mammogram on her remaining breast and tell the nurse \"Now remember, you're only going to charge me half price for this!\" She passed away, 28 years later, at the age of 88 from other health issues.

Ten years ago (around age 50) I started asking for ultrasounds as well as mammos. PCP always refused, saying that ultrasounds \"were not screening tools.\" Every year I got a chipper postcard after each mammo - \"Congratulations! No cancer detected!\" Then ten months after my last one, I had bleeding from my left nipple. NO palpable lumps, no pain, no other symptoms. Turns out it was DCIS and IDC. Turns out it had been there a while.  Turns out you could have seen it on ultrasound. (Never got BIRADS.) THEN - I got seven different diagnostic tests. THEN - everyone listened to me. In all fairness, my Radiologist, who I love, told me what an inexact science mammos are. She said that she could see the beginning of the DCIS as far back as 2009 and 2010 in my screening mammos, only because she knew what to look for. She said if you put my mammos up on a screen in a room full of the best radiologists in the country, probably most of them would not notice such a small discrepancy. My invasive cancer was multifocal - one tumor was 1.5 mm (half a grain of rice) and the other was half a mm - a grain of salt. Actually, I think it's amazing that it was detected at all, but it was hiding in some larger areas of DCIS. They called it Stage 1A. Had BMX, no chemo, no rads.",

I was fortunate that I only had a SNB on one side - three nodes and none were involved. You had quite a few nodes taken, and from both sides....no wonder you are having more symptoms! I'm still numb in parts of my left armpit and the back of my left arm, and did experience a bit of cording and a seroma in the left pit, that both went away on their own. No lymphedema. When I got home from the hospital, I was totally obsessed with germs. I never touched any of my incisions, only dried off with fresh towels, and only wore freshly-laundered sports bras and nightgowns. Even though I did not need chemo or rads, I knew that having TEs left me open to all sorts of new kinds of infection. But the foob gods were gracious, and my incisions closed well. The stitching isn't great, and I told my PS that my quilting teacher would probably not give him an \"A\" grade, but it's temporary until my exchange. I was also lucky with fills. I am overweight and out of shape. This is the one time in my life where it paid off. I had lots of skin to work with and my muscles (pecs) were very lax, so I had no pain during fills. I now have 620 ccs of saline in each side, and they are like boulders inserted into my chest. Tough to sleep at night.... It's funny you should mention the tight bra feeling. So many nights (pre-BMX)  I'd sit there watching TV after wearing a tight bra all day (I was a 38DD/38DDD) and I'd reach back and unhook that bra and go \"AHHHHHHHH\"..... well, with TEs - and, apparently even without recon, there is no \"AHHHHH\" feeling. They do say that after exchange it gets better, though.... I DID have a rotator cuff tear...on both sides, actually, and I know that pain very well. Ten years ago I had a shoulder reconstruction done arthroscopically on the left side, and we left the right side, which wasn't as bad, to heal on its own. After my BMX, I was really afraid to move, but being the independent sort I am, I wanted to do everything myself. So even though I never went to PT, I have full range of motion in both arms. My stamina still kind of sucks. Some days I have energy; others, not so much. For the past two days DH and I have been digging up the garden and planting perennials. Just thinking about that reminds me of how far I've come! Normally, I would be having my exchange surgery in June, but I made a decision to take some drastic steps. Right now, if the PS puts in the permanent implants that match the size of my TEs, and I decide to lose weight later, I'll have stripper boobs. SO not cool.  So I made the decision to start an Optifast program at Kaiser, with meal replacements for four months. My goal is to lose 40 - 50 pounds. I can't have surgery until I'm out of the fasting phase and back into eating regular food. I really don't care how long it takes, but I'm thinking August or September. My MO was thrilled when she heard I was in the program. She told me that the very best thing I could do for my overall health - AND my ER+ breast cancer - was to drop this weight - NOW! So that's my plan. The truth is, breast cancer was always in the back of my mind. My mom had a radical mastectomy at the age of 67. It wasn't pretty, but her huge scar always made me think of her as a warrior. She had no recon and no treatment, and kept her sense of humor through it all. She died 20 years later, in 2009, still NED. When I made the decision to have the TEs, I had no problem with getting them removed if there were any issues, and just going natural. After all, that was my mom's normal. Cats134 - the only thing I would caution you about is comparing yourself to any other woman on this forum!!! I was so frustrated that after surgery, my pain continued for so long when others said all they took was a Tylenol for a day or two. But then there were the ladies who went through Hell with infection after infection, and my incisions healed up quickly with no issues. We are all SO different here! But I do understand....sometimes it's good to be alerted to possible complications, and it's REALLY good to read success stories! I have absolutely no regrets over my decision to have the BMX. No cancer was found in the right breast, but in my mind it was just a matter of time. I'd always wanted a breast lift, but never dreamed I'd get it this way! I'm in the process of getting healthier every single day, which wouldn't be happening if I hadn't gotten my BC diagnosis. And finally, I never would have met all the wonderful ladies here!!! Wishing you continued good healing...... (Just wondering....is your avatar one of your furbabies?)",

I had ultrasound-guided core needle biopsies on both of them. Most of what I have is DCIS - ductal carcinoma in situ - which is non-invasive cancer completely contained within the duct. On the larger tumor, I have two areas that are invasive cancer: one is 1.5 mm, and the other is .5mm (half a mm). Keep in mind that a millimeter is about the size of a mustard seed. So you can see that they can detect VERY small areas of cancer.  Now, having said that -  in the grand scheme of things, your suspicious area may be considered small, but there are so many other factors in determining what kind of tumor it is. There is more than just size to consider, and the fact remains that this may very well be benign!  You don't have bad news yet, you just have news. Wishing you well.....",

Because my TEs were so excruciatingly painful, I was on Norco and Valium around the clock for three weeks. Seriously. DH even woke me up at 4 a.m. for my Norco dose. It was the only way I could stay ahead of the pain. I was moving around the house, walking in the yard, maybe around the block with DH, but driving was out of the question for me until about a month after surgery. I even packed a soft little pillow between me and the seat belt, and turned the steering wheel with my elbows at my sides. (I never ventured very far...) I also remember LOTS of naps! We'd be talking in the living room, and the next thing DH would do was look up and I'd be gone...back in the bedroom, out like a light, snoring away. Wishing you pain relief, and a quick recovery period!!!!!",

Part of it is all I went through before my surgery (very sick, BMX postponed) and then the stupid TE pain after surgery, and now I'm on Optifast, so they warn us not to work out too much. O.K.!!!! Fine by me!!!!  Nooooooo problem!!!!! It's weird....some days are great....last weekend we drove up to the mountains, had a picnic, shopped in a little town, drove some more to meet up with our kids and grandkids, and spent the rest of the day and evening with them. We got back home around 10 p.m. I had energy galore!!!! Well, then the next day I slept til noon, and stayed in my jammies all day! One question: are you eating enough protein? My DH has kidney disease, and is limited to 25-50 grams a day. I was eating the same thing he was. Then I read here that in order to heal well from surgery, we need at least 100 grams of protein a day!!! So I got some protein drinks from Trader Joe's, along with some organic turkey jerky, and upped my protein intake to around 100 grams. It sure helped me feel better! You may want to check with your doc on that... You are doing SO great for just having had your surgery!!!! PATIENCE, my friend....HAVE PATIENCE!!!! ",

I'm so sorry to hear of your mum's passing, but please believe me, it will worry your dad MORE if you have something that needs looking at, and you don't tell him. I lived with my dad when I was 16, and sometimes it was hard to approach him with personal stuff. But a parent's job is to take care of their kids, not the other way around. Talk to your dad, make an appointment to see the doctor, if only to get peace of mind that your lump is nothing to worry about. Then please come back and let us know how you are doing!!! Hugs!!!",
