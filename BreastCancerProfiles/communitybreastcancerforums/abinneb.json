Sorry to hear that you've been through such a trying rollercoaster of a ride with this cancer sh&* - it is awful.   Bilateral is a tough decision to make and one only you can really make. My case was much less involved than yours and for me it was an easy decision because I didn't want to live with the 'axe waiting to fall' on the other side.  But each of us has to decide what we are able to do to have the best outcome we can.  I didn't have a choice on the right (cancer) side as it was all over and I am (well was I guess!) small breasted.  I felt strong that I had a choice to reduce my risk significantly by making having the bilateral.  I was blessed that I had overwhelming support for my decision and in the end, pathology on the 'non-cancer' side did show ADH.  So I feel even better that the choice I made was right for me.     I pray that you find peace to make your decision and feel strong and confident about your choice ~  feel free to pm me if you want - I'd be happy to share my experiences so far in relation to the bilateral. big hugs to you Amy ",

Had biopsy and dcis found in one area of right breast. Thank goodness I had a nurse who worked in that area who my hsb knew.  I asked her advice and she  'find a surgeon who will do an MRI'. As no doc had suggested this,  I went home and surfed for info.  So, at the consult with the BS, we were thinking lumpectomy with rads.  I asked her about doing an MRI and she said no problem.  Had the MRI and she called me the next day and said she was very sorry but they had identified areas all over the breast - no longer just 9'o clock, but 6, 12, and 3'o clock  and a large area behind the nipple. It was devastating to hear.  We talked she recommended mastectomy on R side.  The MRI on left side, radiologist determined was 'B-9'.  After that point I decided to go with bilateral.  And post op path showed ADH in left breast;so for me, the choice of bilateral was fine.   I have personally thanked that nurse for her recommendation of the MRI and told her that I credit her with helping me make a good decision based on the outcome of the MRI. I think the controversy lies with using the MRI as a standard screening tool.  It does have false-positives. In my case, it helped me avoid going through a lumpectomy, not having clean margins, going back in again.   And then I have no idea what would have been happening with the left side.  My BS said we would have been right back there taking care of the left side next.  I'm just hoping that for the future, they will either refine the MRI or develop a new type of MRI-related testing that can be more definitive in helping with diagnosis.",

Big hugs to you Amy",

I agree with you about getting the complete truth.  I don't know if it is so much a matter of not really telling the truth with docs, but I think a large part of the medical field has never been through some of this stuff themselves so they can only say what they know from books and such.  I think they need to ASK their own patients to be brutally honest about how things felt - physically, mentally and emotionally.  That way they would at least be able to say \"I have been told this..\"  I am lucky in that my BS did go through surgery and my PS actually said he couldn't say what it would be like on a personal level, he could tell me what his patients had told him.  Which I found honest and comforting.  Big hugs to you Journey - we've all been there and know what a crazy ride this can be..

(edited to add:) Sorry Firstmate - don't have an answer as to why they would appear where there wasn't sun exposure.  Who knows with cell growth.  Maybe it appears at a defect or weakness in the dermis?   Maybe someone else on the board knows!
