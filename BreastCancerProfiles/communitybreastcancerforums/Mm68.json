Had fatigue pretty much since 2nd week. Now have redness, itchy rash on chest area where I have not put Aquaphor, will definately start! I asked my RO about holding my breath as one of my friends read an article and told me I should...RO said it was not necessary as long as they are not deep breaths. Quiggy-I enjoyed your 2/25 post, I will copy and save. So many thoughts in your headand changes after this diagnosis. I wish everyone a good week ahead and keep one tackling treatments one day at a time!",

They were very touched, but they made it a bit easier for me since they were so nice. Glad to be done - meet with MO on Friday and get the Tamoxifen script.",
