      "Content": "Marybetz wrote: Saw this yesterday and thought I'd post and share... High-fat dairy foods raise death risk in breast cancer patients By Sharon Begley Reuters Women who have ever had breast cancer might want to walk away from  the brie, the butter and the black cherry (and every other flavor) ice cream. According to a study of 1,893 women, breast cancer survivors who average  as little as one serving per day of high-fat dairy foods have a 49 percent  higher risk of dying from breast cancer than those who eat little or no high-fat  dairy. In absolute terms, breast cancer survivors who consumed the most  high-fat dairy had about a 12 percent risk of dying of the disease. The  elevated mortality risk is therefore \"modest,\" said lead author Candyce Kroenke,  a staff scientist at Kaiser Permanente, the nonprofit healthcare provider. \"But  since it may not be so difficult to lower your consumption of high-fat dairy, I  think if you have breast cancer it's worthwhile.\" The research,  published on Thursday in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, is  notable because more than a dozen studies since the late 1980s have examined  whether consuming milk, cheese, ice cream and other dairy products is related to  breast cancer. The results have been a confusing muddle: Some studies found that  women who eat a lot of dairy have a higher risk of breast cancer, others found  they have a lower risk and still others found no effect either way. The  Kaiser study is the first to separate out the effects of high- and low-fat dairy  on women diagnosed with breast cancer. The hormone connection might  apply beyond breast cancer. A 2012 study found that drinking more whole milk was  associated with worse survival among men with prostate cancer, while skim milk  was associated with higher survival. \"This is a very well-done study by  highly regarded researchers,\" said Dr. Michelle Holmes, associate professor of  medicine and epidemiology at Harvard Medical School and Harvard School of Public  Health, who was not involved in the research. It advances scientists'  understanding of how diet affects breast cancer, she said, and presents women  with a simple dietary choice: \"It's for each woman to decide, but if you don't  eat high-fat dairy you can get the same nutrients from other sources,\" including  low-fat versions. Total dairy intake had no effect on how the women -  who had been diagnosed with stage 1, 2 or 3A invasive breast cancer and most of  whom were post-menopausal - fared over the 11.8 years, on average, that the  researchers tracked them. But high-fat dairy, which means whole milk or  cream and anything made with them such as cheese and ice cream, did make a  difference. Breast cancer survivors who ate one or more servings per day  (according to a 120-item questionnaire they answered) also had a 64 percent  greater risk of dying from all causes, but that was expected: A high-fat diet  has long been associated with cardiovascular disease, among other illnesses. The cancer risk was more surprising, if only because scientists have  speculated that the vitamin D and calcium in milk might protect against cancer. Instead, the estrogens in milk might be the problem, researchers say.  These hormones, which promote some breast cancers, reside in milk fat. Less milk  fat means less estrogens, so the estrogen content of skim, 1 percent and 2  percent milk and products made from them is relatively low. Another  reason to suspect estrogens rather than fat itself was that eating more  saturated fat of all kinds did not raise the women's chances of dying of breast  cancer as strongly as high-fat dairy did. That suggests that fat consumption per  se is unrelated to breast-cancer mortality: nuts, chocolate, coconut and  vegetable fats such as those in avocados did not increase the risk.

Going to onco on the 21st of Feb. for tumor marker check.  Have a feeling they're \"baaaaack\"  as am having stabbing pains there.  I don't regularly post but do check in a couple of times a week.  This site is such a valuable source of information!  Love each and every one of you ladies!!  xoxoxxoxox",
