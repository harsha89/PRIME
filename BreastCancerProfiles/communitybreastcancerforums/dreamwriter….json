I was finished my first round of chemo and thought that I was done with chemo forever.  I wore a pink baseball cap over my stringy hair/bald head (I couldnt even lose all my hair right).  I had a doctors appt and next door was a barber.  I took it into my head to have the uneven hair shaved to start growing in looking even and neat.  However I did not have any cash on me.  I stuck my head in to ask if they took debit.  Im talking to my husband on the cell to see that the money was in the right account.  The barber looks at me and asks who the one getting the haircut and what did they want.  I said it was me and I wanted a short shave.  He laughed so I took off my hat.  He finished with the guy he was doing then sat me in the chair. \"No charge,\" he said.  \"My wife, she had breast cancer and I had to shave her head.  And tonight when I tell her what nice thing I do for you - maybe I get lucky tonight.\" It was a wonder I didnt fall out of the chair laughing so hard.  Everyone has their motivations and he was up front and personal with his. edited for spelling mistake",

As for the freaking out.... how natural is that.... I do have a therapist and the hospital started me on anti depressants and anti anxiety medication but at very low doses.  The therapist helps me talk through... how long will I live, what will it be like when I die.... and even what happens after. And then there is here.  This has been a lifeline for the last year.  Strange that it was only a year ago and I have made so many friends (and I mean friends), had so much love and support, and been given the opportunity to support others (which makes me feel useful).  I have lost a few friends but their love, generosity of spirit and support were worth the pain.  I hope you find a home away that allows your stress to come out and your individuality to shine through this horror.",

To my knowledge both my adopted parents have passed away.  My birth mother passed away.  I have no interest in meeting my birth father - he didnt have the ability to care for my brother and me when we were young (something about horses and booze). I often laugh it all off as a three dimentional family tree - with some rather spoiled fruit and a few keepers. I do have a lot of friends collected from high school, college..... I seem to love teachers.... lol I take the loving of all of those that count and ignore the rest.  What a waste of time trying to get someone into your space.   Either they are there for you like the posters on the boards and in the chat rooms, or they're in another space - say hello and leave it alone.  I know it hurts but its better than hoping for what isnt gonna happen. ",

I too, loved my job - some of them still call me and check up on me.  Especially my bosses.  It took 6 months before I realized that I was not going back to work - talk about deNILE.  You will be busy taking care of yourself and mourning that interaction.  I found my solutioin by joining Gilda's.  Google it - there may be one near you and a program that interests you.  I also started learning new skills, quilting (my quilt is all hand sewn) and spending time on a skill I already knew - I crocheted 12 afghans that first year.  And then there are all the \"are you ok\" visits and phone calls.  Hope some of this helps.",

Edit:  I got to go to Los Vegas in 2008 and Florida in 2009 or 2010 and met some of the most wonderful women from the chat room in BCO.  It was the first time I travelled alone and meet people I only knew on the internet.  They were just as fabulous in person as they were in chat. Edit:  My name is Regina, dreamwriter is my girl guide moniker (been a leader for 15 yrs) ",

Since one of my medications is 3 times daily, I have 3 of them. Yellow for morning, pink for afternoon and blue for night-time. I have had problems with drugs before and my hubby could show that I had taken the right amounts for the right time period.  He also knows all my drugs, what they are for and can advocate for me should there be any questions.  Doing it this way also means that I only carry the pink tray with me if I go out. And I dont have to remember to checkmark a chart. Hope this helps.",

      "Content": "May 13, 2009 11:03AM - edited May 13, 2009 11:04AM by dreamwriter To the ladies with men with buzzsaw snoring. Get him to a sleep test. They are the most amazing soft beds and the wires and stuff keep you firmly in place. You will have the most wonderful sleep that night. The next morning, you get dressed, they take the leads off and give you a diagnosis. In Ontario, usually a salesman will come to your door. The machine CPAP (Continual Pressured Air P....) the mind is going. It is a machine that costs some $1600 but the Assistive Devices pays the first 75 percent. And if you have insurance they will pay 80-100% of the remainder. Mine was $1600, ADP paid $1200. My insurance paid $320 so I was left with a bill of $80. I had to pay by cheque the $400 but they had us post date so we could get the insurance portion into the bank account. The reason Im saying this is as we get older we can develop sleep apnea, causing the snoring. And it is not just the sound but the bed can vibrate too. If your man has sleep apnea, the first night with the machine will give him an adrenalin rush the next morning. He will finally have enough oxygen during sleep. I have a CPAP machine so that is why I know all this. Sometimes weight loss or quitting smoking will make the machine unnecessary. But dont throw it out..... weight fluctuates, and quitting smoking is hard to do.",
