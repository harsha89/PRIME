Since they don't do any testing or bloodwork,  I'm still kind of in the dark as to how useful it is. The idea of needing symptoms to present themselves to pursue a recurrance bothers me, but I guess that's how it works with most BMX patients. I have pain in my hands and feet which I saw my PCP for and all tests and xrays came back okay. My onc. beleives it is related to menopause. I just got my appointment today for my tattooing and small fat grating in early December. I will be finished at that point! What's the latest with you? Candi     ",

All my cancer tests, biopsies, both diagnosis and each mastectomy were in the fall, so BC Month is a mixed emotional bag for me.  October 17th is the 2 year anniversary of my first mastectomy. Last October we were thrown into crisis with dealing with the second cancer diagnosis, so the 1st \"cancerversary\" was rolled up in that.  Because it's Breast cancer awareness month,  there is a cancer walk here on October 17th. I should be celebrating, I know I am so fortunate, I just feel so much loss. I miss not being able to \"feel.\" you know? But, enough of that....how are the rest of you all doing?  Enjoy reading the posts....you all bring so much help and wisdom. Candi",

Because the DCIS was stage 0 and non-invasive my medical team said there was no need for further treatment. With the second cancer being only 1cm and stage 1 grade 1, the only thing my oncologist recommended was Tamoxofen.  I came right out and asked her if she thought my decision to not persue any further treatment would be irresponsible and she said no. The stats gave me a high rate of non-reoccurence and for the few points I would gain from the Tamoxifen didn't seem worth the potential side effects. Cancer comsumes your life when you are going through the testing, surgeries and decisions.  I hope the more my life moves toward normalcy in the next weeks and months,  the less anxious I will be about reoccurance.

All looked clear, but they always mention the dense breast tissue. In August my BS did a routine biopsy while cauterizing another cyst. She didn't suspect anything. It turned out to be DCIS. I'm fairly small so my options were mastectomy with reconstruction or lumpectomy, leaving me with hardly anything and having to have radiation. I chose the mastectomy. In just saying that doesn't mean it was an easy decision. But I'm fortunate that it was stage 0 and I didn't have to have chemo or radiation. I have the same concern as you do..dense breast..what screening really \"catches\" any possible cancers. Before I had the left mastecomy, they did an MRI on the right to make sure that one was clear. It was okay. Now that I've caught my breath a little from the whirlwind of last fall. I actually have a call into my BS to ask what screening method will give me the greatest peace of mind that all is okay? It sounds to me that because DCIS is microscopic it's hard to diagnose until it's in a further stage. I think the MRI is a good idea. Try not to worry until they tell you that you have somthing to worry about. With all the tests I had last fall on both breasts I had myself in a mental frenzy about the outcomes. WIth all that happened, I still feel I had good news.  Hang in there! Candi",

During my 6 month follow up in October 09  with ultrasound they found something and it was a 1 cm tumor. I had second mastectomy 11/9/09. I feel so thankful for my incredible breast surgeon and plastic surgeon. They are both top notch. I know I wouldn't be as well as I am if it  weren't for them. Because the second cancer was invasive they had me meet with an oncolgist. She said that with my stats she would suggest Tamoxifen. When seeing the side effects I asked her if it would greatly impact my chance of reocuurance if I decided not to take anything and she said no.    It's a personal decision for everyone, but for me, taking a pill everyday would just keep reminding me of my cancer and I would wonder what the medication might be doing to my body. I can't speak for anyone else, but I think once you have been diagnosed with cancer, you never feel totally safe again. Though you don't dwell on it, I think it's always in the back of your mind that a breast related cancer could crop up. I wish they would develop better diagnostics for these other cancers so they would not have the chance of becoming so advanced before detection. THAT would be a great gift for 2010! Best to you ladies! Happy New Year Candi",

It's like,what do you do with these new breasts? You have to relearn how to make love. Do you ignore them during lovemaking....do you try to let him enjoy them though you both know there is no feeling?. Like star said, it's hard to put aside the victim face. I am my own worst enemy, every time we get intimate I think about what used to be, how things are more limited now and what we both miss. Adding menopause to the mix doesn't help either. I have so much to be thankful for and I'm working on changing my attitude. I so admire the women that don't let this get in their way. I wish I had their makeup. It's amazing how different we all are. I know much of making this better is up to me. I also think the more time passes the easier it becomes.  Just know you are not alone. I just think it takes us all time to find our way.  ",

Because of two cancers they did the BRAC test which came back negative,   I asked her if she felt I would be irresponsible if I chose to do nothing for additional treatment and she said no, she was fine with it.    I feel fine about my decision.
