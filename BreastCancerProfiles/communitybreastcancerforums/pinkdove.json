My brother also wants to know because of the implications and if I know that I'm a BRCA1 or BRCA2 carrier the others in my family can make sure they have regular tests (i.e. mammograms or PSA tests if I'm a BRCA2 carrier).   Surely it's better to be aware and catch it early than not to know at all?",
