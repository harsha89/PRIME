In 2003 I had one lymph node removed from my left axilla, also negative for cancer.  I was told I would never develop lymphedema in the left arm. WRONG! In 2005 my left arm swelled up like a balloon and has stayed that way ever since despite therapy. In 2006 my motorcycle skidded on an oil slick at an intersection and I went down and slid with a 700 lb. Harley on top of me.  I sustained severe \"road rash\" to my right arm but recovered fully with only slight lymphedema.  Go Figure.   Barbara ",
