      "Content": "writesthings wrote: I'm 50 years old, married, no kids, in the last stages of perimenopause (haven't had a regular period since May except for a bit of spotting in August, night sweats, occasional hot flashes).  At my annual GYN exam at the end of August, my provider noticed a lump on my right breast.I had a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound on September 2, and the conclusion was just that it was a small cyst.  On October 2, I did a self-exam in the shower and everything still felt fine.  On October 4, I did a self-exam lying down and found a very palpable lump on my right breast at the 7 o'clock position, about 6-7 cm from my nipple and about 1 cm long.  Different location from what they'd checked before.  The lump was firm but I could move it around.  It didn't really hurt, although the area itself would get sore if I poked at it too much, so I had to slap my hands away to stop that!  Since it was Saturday and all the usual offices were closed, I went to an urgent care clinic to get it checked out.  The doctor could definitely feel the lump and thought it might be a fibroadenoma, but she went ahead and gave me an order for a sonogram (not a mammogram since I'd just had a clean diagnostic mammogram a month earlier).  I had that done on Tuesday. I could see the sonogram as they were doing it \u2013 I guess I was in the same room that pregnant women use.I could tell right away that this wasn't a simple cyst, since it wasn't hollow-looking and the edges were irregular (but not sharp).  They did a Doppler on it, but there wasn't any blood flow inside the mass.  The radiologist looked at the image and then came in and looked at the area again and felt the lump for herself.  She asked me if I was still having my periods, and I explained the bit about being in the last stages of perimenopause.  She said the lump might not be cancer, but I shouldn't be having growths like this at my stage of life, so she wanted me to get an ultrasound-guided biopsy.  In retrospect, that probably wasn't the most helpful way she could have phrased that, because of course I thought, \"It might not be, but it COULD be, and she's thinking it probably IS.\"  So I have that scheduled for Monday.  I wanted to get something earlier, but the scheduler said that was the earliest appointment, and I was actually lucky to get that, because usually they schedule 10-14 days out.  So obviously this wasn't something where they felt I had to rush through to get a diagnosis confirmed.  I'm glad that the opening was available when it was! Still, like so many others, I've been stressing out to a greater and lesser extent over the past couple of days.  My mother died of breast cancer at age 75, which all started with a lump she found a few months after one of many clean mammograms.  Of course, given her age and background, what happened to her isn't necessarily related to my situation; she was a lifelong smoker whose own treatment was limited because of heart disease/high blood pressure/respiratory problems.  And I know from reading here and elsewhere that something like 80% of biopsies show benign conditions.  The fact that the radiologist was asking about my periods makes me think that she, too, thought it might be a weird cyst or a fibroadenoma, but my age may normally preclude it.  They just want to make sure, and catch it early enough if it does turn out to be something else. But I've spent WAYYYY too much time on the Internet trying to find examples of things that are just like my situation, and images which correlate to what I saw (or are at least a close proximation), and I can't.  I know, I know \u2013 step AWAY from the computer! :-)  But it's hard.  I just want something to hold onto, to think positively about, so I don't stress out so much.  I do have a worst-case scenario plan in place - I already have a referral for an excellent breast surgeon.  But of course her office won't make an appointment until the results of the biopsy come back \u2013 how quickly they see me will depend on those results.I've gone ahead and gotten copies of all the mammograms/ultrasounds and their associated reports to bring to the surgeon if/when I see her, because if it does turn out to be cancer, I don't want to be running around trying to get everything together when I'm already upset and not likely to think straight. (I will probably see her even if the results are benign, because this lump is close enough to the skin that it presses against a section of my bra and is a bit uncomfortable).  I took a closer look at the sonogram images and the radiologist's report, which states that I have a \"hypoechoic wider than tall mass with mildly irregular margins measuring 1.3 x 0.6 x 1 cm\" with no flow noted.  She gave it a BI-RADS of 4, but no A, B, or C, so I don't know to what extent she suspects it might be malignant (I know a 4 by itself runs a large gamut).  I just wish she hadn't said that I \"shouldn't\" have these growths at my stage.  Everyone's different, and I've had weird, benign growths elsewhere (bone spurs, polyp) ever since I turned 40.  She didn't say anything on her report about a suspicion of cancer or anything like that \u2013 she just stuck to the facts of her findings (as she should).  I wish she'd just told me, \"There are things that suggest it's benign, and things that suggest it might not be, and the only way we can know one way or another is for you to have a biopsy.  So you should come in for that as early as you can.\"  Or even, \"It's unusual to see something like this at your age, so let's just set up a biopsy appointment to make sure everything's okay.\"  Instead, she started me thinking that I'm doomed. The worst part about this is that my 25th wedding anniversary is coming up in the first week of November, and we'd planned a trip to Florida to celebrate.  It would be wonderful to have good news from the biopsy, and then we'd REALLY celebrate, but if it turns out to be bad news, we'll need to cancel the trip.  I just want to scream at the universe, \"Why me?  Why NOW?\" Okay, I think I'm done with this tome, LOL. :-)  I have a wonderfully supportive husband who will be with me every step of the way no matter what the outcome, but as a homemaker/amateur writer/photographer, I'm at home alone a lot during the day while he's at work.  So this forum has been a Godsend, and any words of encouragement/comfort/hope while I wait on this would be very much appreciated!
