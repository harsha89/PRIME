I see where some of you are and I can remember feeling that this would never end. To recap my last year: I was diagnosed with DCIS in my right breast in August of 2016. One small mass less than a centimeter showed up in all testing - mammos, MRIs, ultrasounds, biopsy. I felt I had won the lottery in that I was lucky enough to find it so early (I had just t urned 40 and was doing all the precautionary tests my OBGYN suggested). I had a lumpectomy in September and thought I'd be doing radiation and hormone therapy immediately following. However, things did not work out as the doctors and I thought. My BS, who was amazing I might add, did tissue samples while he was performing the lumpectomy. Of the nine samples taken, four came back positive with DCIS. I was devastated - and terrified, too. All the testing I'd had done showed nothing else. So, I opted for a bilateral MX (the left side was considered prophylactic, but I wasn't about to leave it when I had no idea if all testing missed cancer there too). I had a BMX in November with tissue expanders to start the reconstruction process had my tissue exchange surgery in May and have one more week until I am completely cleared. I've learned so much from this forum. I'm so thankful I had great surgeons. It sounds like some of you have had horrible experiences! Activity levels shouldn't be questionable...communication is key here. They told me at what week/stage each activity was acceptable. The BS and PS were very conservative with my activity level - not even wanting me to go through PT- and I am thankful for that since I have healed so quickly with so little complications. I can't add any insight with chemo and radiation. I will say for those of you dealing with just the aftereffects of surgery, time is the best healer - both physically and emotionally. Try to find your new normal because this is an experience that profoundly changes you.",

My exchange surgery is this Tuesday (can't come soon enough). I created a blog entry for my surgery essentials and luxuries. I can't add the link for some reason, so message me if you are interested in reading it. I tried to include some items not discussed in many of the blogs and forums I had previously researched. Pinterest had a lot on post surgery lists. I ordered some front zip bras from Walmart or Amazon. I can't remember now, but I know I didn't pay much for them. I didn't feel I needed anything expensive and heavy-duty, I was so angry at the prices when I did searches for post mastectomy bras. They are outrageous.",

I honestly can't believe how little pain I feel. I'm a little achy, mostly in my upper chest above the implants. I have to make myself abide by the movement and weight restrictions. With my BMX, the major discomfort made me remember what I could and couldn't do. Not so now, and I am elated. Also, I feel like my breasts are so much smaller, but that's not the actual case. The expanders were filled to 540cc but were so rigid and out there that they didn't compress at all. My new \"foobs\" are 600cc and compress quite a bit, I assuming, with the bandage and bra. I can't take the bandage or bra off until Friday, but my husband is assuring me he can tell they are little larger.",
