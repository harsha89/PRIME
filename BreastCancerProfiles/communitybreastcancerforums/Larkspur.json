In my case, it was the MRI that revealed the tiny mass of invasive cancer (4 mm). My breast surgeon agreed with me that I should have annual MRIs along with mammograms, as each can detect problems that the other can't. Currently, I'm waiting for the results of the Oncotype test to see if chemo is in my future. If not, then I'll start radiation. The RO I saw thinks that chemo is unlikely, but I think we've all learned that there are no sure things in this experience. ",

I took a precautionary Xanax about half an hour before the MRI, which definitely helped. I lay there listening to all the bangs and bongs and pretended that I was attending an experimental music concert while mildly stoned. I also had a \"panic button\" to squeeze if necessary; I found I didn't need it, but as Janett noted, having that option was reassuring. The tech staff was very kind and helpful, asking me at intervals how I was doing. It was an unpleasant surprise to hear from my surgeon yesterday, saying that the MRI had turned up \"some things\" on both breasts that hadn't shown up in any recent mammograms, and that she wants to do MRI-guided biopsies on them on Monday. So back into the doughnut I go. \"We'll give you an Ativan!\" and \"There's no need to panic,\" she told me brightly, which of course triggers instant panic!--just as telling angry people to \"calm down\" only inflames them further. I'm reminding myself that the medical team is probably just trying to cover all bases, that it's good to have this technology that can catch things so early, and so on, but it was just one more piece of recent unwelcome medical news to deal with. I know that everyone here can relate!",

As with the MRI and the stereotactic core biopsy (SCB), you're lying face-down; you have local anesthetic, and they give you a relaxant beforehand--Ativan, in my case. ( I actually had both breasts biopsied at the same time, with a doctor working away on either side--probably the closest I'll ever come to a three-way.) They send you home with a cold-pack and suggest that you wear a sports bra, as they did for the SCB. Tylenol took care of any pain in my case, but if you had significant pain after your SCB, let the team know and maybe they can give you a prescription for something stronger. Really not a big deal; and in my case, it may literally have been a life-saver. My annual mammogram and the follow-up mammos and SCB revealed the presence of DCIS, but the pre-surgery MRI showed a couple of other suspicious areas, and the MRI-guided biopsy confirmed some invasive ductal cancer that the mammograms didn't catch. Luckily for me, it was small and slow-growing, and there's no lymph node involvement. Without the MRI & the guided biopsy, my story might be very different.",

Once you have the needed information, there will be a plan of action and it all gets simpler. I can imagine how scary all of this stuff is for you, especially as you recently lost a close friend to breast cancer. This is no time to play Superwoman. Ask your doc for some Xanax to help you get through this worrisome period. And good luck with the stereotactic biopsy! I've had two of them; one was fairly easy--I went on to work right after it--the other was a little more stressful, and I wish I had thought to take a Xanax before it. The surgeon who performs yours will very likely give you one, or something like it, if you ask. It's in her/his best interests to do it, as your being relaxed will make the procedure easier.",

I spoke to the rad. onc. nurse about this development; she thought it was unlikely that it was connected with treatment but urged me to get it checked out with my gynecologist, which I did.

In any case, I had a few episodes of this discharge, each lasting for a couple of days. They went away while I was still doing rads and haven't returned.
