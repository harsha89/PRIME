How high was your total bilirubin number?  I admit I'm relatively knew at this (dx less than two years ago) - but I have never heard of A & C given for mets - especially since you are ER+.  Did the doc have a reason why he started you on this and instead of continuing you on another hormonal?  (I am guessing you had progression on Femara.)  I'm having a very good response to Aromasin (even though Femara quit on me in six months or so.)  Hang in there.   ",
