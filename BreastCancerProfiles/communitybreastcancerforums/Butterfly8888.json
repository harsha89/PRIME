Well let me have at it then- In 2006 they found a lump behind my left nipple- fine- left her alone as I was having uterine issues! Now it's nine years later and they biopsied it via core method (5-8-13)which went simply- I was not worried! Healed fine- got lab results that stated probable stromal fibrosis, not able to read epithial cells, some cellular changes! I was pleased!!! Please come back in six months! Now however- my left breast is swollen- my nipple has gone hinky- and it hurts!!! I've never had breast pain and I no longer have periods due to my hysterectomy when I was 36 so it's not \" hormonal\"! I'm now 42- wondering..... What the heck is up..... What did they do in there??? Any help would be wonderful.... Thank you all again you brave ladies!!! Log in to post a reply",
