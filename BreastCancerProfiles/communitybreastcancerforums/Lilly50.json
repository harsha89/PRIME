Over these past 2 weeks,i've come to know you all so well,i've laughed,cried,waited with baited breath on your results,i've shared in your joy at the good times and have worried along with you all in the times of pain. I thank you all for giving me the opportunity to know each and every one of you and i think your all an inspiration to anyone that visits this site...i hope when you all meet up in Oz,you'll have the time of your lives. Best wishes to everyone xxxx",

All you ladies here have helped me understand this horrible Bootface,the types,the treatment and emotions thats attached to it,before my recall,BC was a condition i didn't want to know about but now that i'm more informed,i feel more confident in speaking about it to a couple of ladies i know thats going though what your going through. Sue,i live near Sunderland which isn't that far from you,in the cold northeast lol. all my best to you wonderful girls and once again,thanks for being here xxx",
