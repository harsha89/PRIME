Breathe.  That is what I keep telling myself, just breathe and pray all will reveal itself. ",

I biggest concern is my daughter.  Knowing barely where to go get our groceries right now (and I am a serious researcher and get things done kind of gal) I am trying to find that angel of light that will care for her and be able to handle what our family has to go through.  My daughter has never been away from me for longer than an hour and that has only been a handful of times.  We co-sleep (prepping now for that to change) but she is such a senstive, way too aware little soul that needs just the right nurturer to care for her.  It all scares me but mostly having to open up and trust strangers.  I am trying to step back and trust our military system, having put my 'feelers' out to friends around the world and release my planner, controlling self and hope this will all just play itself out.  Trying to \"prep\" for so much unknown is wearing me down and Tough as Nails girl I am this stuff (IDC) is in me and I need to rest, let go breathe.  How do I do that and 'get ready'?
