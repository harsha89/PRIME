May 2010 DCIS in right breast.   I had a double mastectomy June 23rd.  I feel like I am on a whirlwind.  I am having reconstructive.  I did so much rearch that I'm not even sure exactly what I'm having.  It is implants.  Hopefully I get my second drain out tomorrow. I am sore but I have great grown children who have scheduled themselves to me.  I can only imagine having babies or toddlers.  It must be tough. (Can't wait for the grandkids) I thought I would be back to normal by the start of school. (I think I may have just expected it.)  I am sore moving but it doesn't hurt...do i push myself or layback. Is there any problem with driving?  I hate relying on people. You guys are so brave and wonderful.  Reading your words are anxiety provocating and reasurringly calming at the same time.",

Are you using OTC muscle relaxers?    Does anyone have advice on the necessity of a bra ?  I had always hated bras but now feel i need one.  My mom has Alzheimer's, I bought her some front snap soft comfy bras.  I borrowed one to try.  I din't start the expanders yet.",

Anybody had issues with the reaction of  husbands, friends or significant others? Tamoxifen  I was diagnosed with LCIS in '07 had a lumpectomy and put on Tamoxifen for 5 years.  I didn't work I got DCIS in '10 resulting in a BMX.  I didn't find the Tamoxifen to be too bad.  I used it as an excuse for everything form weight gain to not remembering something;  Good luc!",
