I have been told that breast cancer is a very treatable disease and most women live to the five year mark. My mother lived for 17 years after her first mastectomy and just last year was diagnosed with bc in her other breast.  She sailed through that mastectomy too, at 86!   Still, from here on \"cancer\" will be a part of our lives.  Something that helps me might gross you out, but knowing this has helped me face the pain of my upcoming mastectomy.  John Adams's (our 2nd president) wife, Abigail, had breast cancer in 1811.  She had a mastectomy, at home, without any anesthetic!  I can't even imagine.  She was in her early forties and wanted to live so badly she endured the most horrific pain.   I think of that when I start to panic about the surgery.  I want to be brave and face this journey with dignity.  I pray to God that with his help I will.   Good luck to you and know that many of us will think about you and wish you well.",

The PS is making and closing the incision and then doing a right breast reduction. I saw the PS today. He didn't tell me anything about the surgery really. I was wondering about the areoles area. I guess mine will be reduced too (I hope). My breasts are huge. My bra size now - 34 i that's a b c d e f g h - i !). Even the PS was impressed. He said \"and you NEVER thought of having those reduced??!!\" We'll, no. That would have meant surgery and money. Anyway, he didn't tell me anything about a bra, or meds, or anything else. I go back the day before surgery to get \"marked\". He says my breast are too large to do the reconstruction during the same surgery as the mastectomy. He say wound healing is often a problem with large breasts and he wants the mastectomy incision to heal properly first. Yuck. That means three surgeries. I didn't even want reconstruction but the breast surgeon convinced me that I would be miserable with one huge breast on the right and no breast on the left. Geez. I haven't had so many people comment on my large breasts since I was 15 and in high school! Thanks for the good info.",
