A number of months ago I found an area of redness on my left breast with a small lump underneath it. I was referred by my GP to a breast clinic and was seen by a breast surgeon. He felt it was not concerning as he said 'it was in the skin'. I have bad acne on my breasts and I think he felt it was the same as this. I left the clinic happy with this but the months past and the redness was still on the skin and the lump was still underneath the skin. I was concerned and on a visit to my GP for a different reason and I mentioned it to her again and she said she would refer me for a mammogram/ultrasound(these were not done on the day I was in the breast clinic initially). I went back to the same breast clinic and had the ultrasound and mammogram and again I was told again it was not concerning and it is within the skin and is in keeping with a skin insultation/skin lesion (really not sure what this means?). I was delighted and left without asking any questions. I am now a few months later with the redness and the lump still there. While I have been given good news so far I am now starting to think that something has been missed on ultrasound - I have read lots of cases of this!. I know I have to go back to see my breast surgeon as he is the only person who can answer my questions, but I was wondering has anyone heard of a similar diagnosis. I can clearly feel a lump. If anyone has or knows of someone who has been told something similar, I would be interested. Thanks for reading, Sincs Log in to post a reply",
