Did you feel any sense of relief in finishing the treatments?",

Thank you",

I am sure I am rambling as my thoughts on all this have driven me crazy and the indecision is terrible.  So, I hope all is well and I hope the radiation went well.  I am curious how you finally made yourself do it when in your case you could probably have bypassed it.  I am so afraid of radiation because I know that it can cause long term side effects and one day I am ok with the thought of it and the next day I am terrified of the thought of it.  Any advice???",

I appreciate your honesty.  I am sorry we are all having to have this conversation but glad you are out there.  Nobody can help me the way people who have gone through it can.  I am sorry  solsticegirl22 for what you are going through and the truth is what you say is a real possibility for anyone and I thank you for sharing that.  I meet with a Medical Oncologist this Thursday.  I have already met with 2 prior to my surgery when I was trying to find a good team.  This one is referred to me by the surgeon.  They said no chemo and now I guess they want to discuss it.  Not going there.  I do have to discuss Tamoxifen so I will have my questions ready for that as well.  I just really feel at a crossroads. As of now I am supposed to follow the standard of care and do the radiation and then Tamoxifen for 5 years.  When I asked the RO this question , if you aren't sure if there is any cancer left floating around after the surgery, how would you know if the radiation was working, she said that's a good question.  Basically, it comes down to whether or not you have a recurrence.  Which by the way can happen whether you do the radiation or not. In the study I talked about earlier, out of 100 women that got radiation , one had a recurrence anyway, 4 prevented one and 95 had unnecessary treatment-the researchers words not mine.  I find that very interesting.  I am so glad I have options as I know so many out there are fighting one hell of a battle.  But the option is follow the standard of care or not and its in your hands either way, consequences or benefits. Nobody offers any promises.  In fact I was told I would have to sign paperwork acknowledging the things that could go wrong due to radiation!  Please continue to share ... Bless you all",
