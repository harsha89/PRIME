I pick her up today.  I am dreading telling her.  I know she will be more emotional and I do not want her memory of camp be that mommy got sick while she was gone.  Also my sugery is scheduled for the 8th.  Her birthday is the 6th.  I am trying to figure out how to make the 6th about her birthday not my illness.",

I am PR and ER + and HER -.  I am meeting with the oncologist next week to work out my treatment plan and I am nervous about the chemo",
