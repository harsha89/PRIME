The stomach cramps were the worst! I never felt like it was enough diarrhea to take Imodium. But yesterday, I started apple cider vinegar and then got some Kombucha. I'm not sure if you are suppose to drink Kombucha while on chemo, but I'll check with my MO. Does anyone know about this? After my surgery, I did experience constipation and I did use Phillips Milk of Magnesia - after trying ducolax, prunes, and everything else. That was the thing that worked. Since I am 8 days post my first treatment, I was considering cutting my hair. And so sorry that Jean and Lauren that you are on track with the hair loss. I think I will cut it in the next few days, just to have some control. I'm much better today than last week. Not sure what to do for that bone pain for next round. I know it does not last long, but it is quite painful. I'm not sure if my Claritin is working.... I did go to work today for four hours!!! I feel like that was an accomplishment! Hope everyone has a good week. Sorry so many are having SE's. They really suck.. But then - this too shall pass Hang in there warriors!",

I of course did not want to deal with my SE's following ringing the bell....it's really hard not to feel normal. I am looking forward to getting my port out on June 21! - I was planning on scheduling my second part of my reconstruction surgery for July - but instead, my husband and I are going on a cruise to celebrate that chemo is over!!!! But then I had to remind him that he will be going to the beach with a bald headed woman!! He just laughed and said - \"That's OK\"! He really does not seem to mind my temp new look! I know that I will have to reamin in the shade for the most part - but I just want a week with NO doctor appointments!! I have developed GERD!! - I'm currently on Nexium for that but the pain is pretty bad. I am hoping this is all chemo related and will go away soon. I still have difficulty drinking water!! How can water cause pain?? Hopefully the fatigue will diminish as well! Dawn - I do understand how you feel about not knowing all the details. I was told I just needed mastectomy followed by oral meds for 1-5 years. But then my onco score came back and it indicated that I had to have one round of chemo. It is what it is.... We adjust - we are strong - we are warriors!! I also understand about the drains - they are not fun. I came home with three. I never thought my husband could take care of me, but he was incredible! He emptied my drains and changed my dressings. (He was never able to handle anything medical with my kids or me before!). Thinking of all of you and praying for you often. Looking forward to next week since it will be three weeks post infusion and I should feel better. Hugs to all!!! - We are WARRIORS!!! - Sheila",

I had 8 lymph nodes removed and all were negative, unfortunately my onco score came back at 33 so my my oncologist suggested the TC protocol. I am scheduled for four rounds every 3 weeks. Apparently on taxotere, it is common for the hair to fall out between days 14-18, so I will probably cut my hair short one week after my first infusion. I think I am ready to face this journey, but sometimes get overwhelmed by all of the suggestions of what I may need.

My insurance denied Neulasta, but they will pay for Fulphila which is biosimilar to Neulasta. Hopefully it works. It would be nice if it does not cause the bone pain! I guess I will know on Tuesday. Hope everyone has a good weekend. Remember to get your rest! Hope everyone finds relief from the SE's. This is the part that concerns me the most (SE). I got up in the middle of the night (3;30ish) to let my yorkie out and had trouble getting back to bed. I almost passed out, which was scary. (I use to pass out often, so I know what to do). I think my blood pressure dropped - maybe from the meds given during the port placement. I eventually made it back to bed and my husband took care of me. It just seems so silly that the things that we do normally will take a different meaning of \"normal\" while we are going thru this process. We are warriors!! And this to shall pass! hugs to all",
