I would normally read through a bunch of the previous posts and get to know you, but I'm beyond exhausted, and I haven't even started treatment yet! So please forgive me. I have fibromyalgia and a bunch of other chronic illnesses, and I just did a road-trip to visit a dying aunt, and I'm trashed. First chemo is Monday May 15th. They installed a port--in my arm, to my surprise--last week. I hate it! It's on the inside of my upper arm, and rubs on my boob and gets in the way all the time. It hurts, too. Long story why the BS put it in the arm instead of my chest, but I may opt to have her get it out of this arm and give me a chest port if this one continues to be trouble. Chemo cocktail is CMF, cyclosomething, methotrexate, and fluorouracil, plus Herceptin. After the CMF, which will be 4-6 cycles, radiation will start. And herceptin goes for a full year. Usually my type of cancer gets a different cocktail, but they come with common SE of neuropathy. I already have moderate neuropathy in both legs, and can't afford any more. Thankfully, my MO realized that, and recognizes that I have tons of other things wrong with me and I take tons of meds, so he chose the \"old school\" CMF, which if I remember right, is not quite as effective as the more modern stuff, which is why I'll need more cycles. MO is pretty concerned that I won't be able to tolerate the chemo tho, and that scares me because of the aggressive, nasty cancer I picked. I'd been feeling pretty OK about everything until the last few days. Having this port poking me in the side all the time and having a massive bruise and pain... well, it's all becoming too real now. I'm making last-minute preparations for starting chemo on Monday at the crack of dawn. I have no idea how my body will respond, and I hate to be pessimistic, but i have a gut feeling I'm going to be sick as hell and flat on my back for a long time. But you never know. I'm already so used to feeling like shit most of the time that sometimes I don't think I'll notice anything at all from the chemo! Sorry to be so morose today. As for the discussion of hair loss (I glanced at a few posts), I saw the COOLEST thing in my Facebook feed awhile back. It's whole-head henna tattoos for when you're bald! I live near the beach (I see there are some other eastern NC people here, I'm in Carolina Beach) and if I remember right, the beachy tourist shops around here advertise henna tattoos in the summer. I bet I'll be their first head tattoo. But I'm always too freaking hot, and wigs and head coverings are not high on my list of cool summer outfits, so a pretty henna design seems like a great solution. TTY'all later.",

Oh boy, so many people to respond to! I'll see if I can do it... Notanisland-- I took the Zyrtec for one day, then got some Claritin. Took two a day for about 5 days. NO bone pain from the Neulasta! Yay! msrobin-- oh, sorry to hear about your hair loss. But nice coincidence that your hats arrived. I haven't looked into head coverings yet. Summers in NC are so freaking hot that I can't imagine wearing wraps or scarves or God forbid, wigs. Generally I hate hats, but they say we need to protect our delicate little bald heads from the sun. What did you get? Indoor hats? Outdoor hats? Very curious, if you don't mind sharing info. There's probably a forum here for that, lol, as there are forums for just about everything! I should go look. Hang in there, and enjoy your new fashion statements. Personally, I'm gonna look into getting a whole-head henna tattoo!! Bex1966-- Loved your detailed post! I, too, am going to set up a Facebook page. I not only have cancer, but a bunch of chronic illnesses (invisible ones). It's really tiring to type the same updates a hundred times to everyone who cares about you. Seems a FB page will save time, keep my family and friends up to date to the extent that they can handle, and maybe someday some other people can benefit from my blog. But yesterday I was trying to set up my new page and got so frustrated that I wanted to toss the computer out the window! Ugh. Will get back at it today, or um, maybe tomorrow, lol. Sorry about your constipation. I have the totally (and I do mean totally) opposite problem! The fiery diarrhea from hell! But as Shrek says, \"better out than in!\" LeesaD-- I'm sorry for laughing, but laugh out loud I did when I read what you wrote about your good blood counts and feeling every one of those blood cells being made! Good job, lady! (LOL) LovePugs-- I hope everything went well with your first chemo! Don't worry about being MIA...it seems it's pretty common around here...take care of yourself! Irwells50-- Regarding the neuropathy-- thankfully my MO respects the fact that I already have significant neuropathy in both legs (bummer! they still don't know what caused it or if it's permanent) and he chose a chemo cocktail they don't often use any more for my type of cancer. He went \"old school\" with CMF, which has less risk of neuropathy. One thing I found out is supposed to help a lot with minimizing/preventing neuropathy is CBD Hemp Oil. It's related to medical marijuana, but without the THC (which produces the high feeling). There is also CBD Oil from actual marijuana if it's legal in your state, and that's supposed to be even better than the Hemp Oil variety. I started taking it before I was diagnosed because it's supposed to help with a bunch of symptoms I suffer with from fibromyalgia, depression, chronic pain, metabolic dysfunction, poor sleep, and neuropathy. CBD hemp oil has neuroprotective properties, and research has shown it aids neurogenesis as well. I tellya, cannabis products are amazing! and it's just politics in recent history that has made cannabis illegal. It's been used throughout human history for a wide variety of things. Crazy versatile herb! While I was doing my cannabis research, I found that it's widely used for cancer patients, but for far more symptoms than just the widely known anti-nausea traits: Neuroprotection/neurogenesis, pain relief, anti-nausea properties, appetite and metabolism regulation, cancer cell growth inhibition (kills cancer cells, inhibits formation of blood supply to tumors), reduction of chemo side effects and depression, and geez, it does so much. Much of the info is anecdotal (but from enormous amounts of testimonials throughout human history), but there is actual scientific research on cannabis, just mostly not from the US. Big Pharma is even interested in getting in on the action, and has been applying for patents on medical marijuana (MMJ) products, and has been actively trying to prevent legalization so it can snatch up MMJ and steal the marketplace from the newly formed legalized pot industry. I know there are medical marijuana and CBD discussions on this board somewhere, but I'm already a believer and I haven't looked into them yet. Anyone who wants to talk with me more about this is more than welcome. I'm not into pot--have no interest in it as a recreational drug, as I don't like the high and it's illegal in NC anyway. But when it comes to medicinal uses, I'm totally sold! Oh, and if anyone decides to buy cannabis products... first, check to see if MMJ is legal in your state for cancer. It may be. Most states have some sort of legal MMJ, but only for specific medical conditions. NC allows exactly ONE condition: intractable childhood epilepsy. But I've seen cancer on other states. If MMJ is legal in your state, find out if you need a medical card, so some online research to familiarize yourself with MMJ, then GO to a local dispensary! You will be amazed at how knowledgeable the staff will be, and how many products are available for a wide variety of problems. If you're not in a legal state, you can get CBD Hemp Oil products online in every state. Some state, like NC and KY, have legalized \"industrial hemp\" production, usually in association with pilot research programs. NC just did this, and I am SO fortunate that the state's first dispensary is right in my town! And they just opened a second store yesterday. YAY! If your only source of CBD hemp oil is online, BE CAREFUL and do your research! It is an unregulated industry, so it's buyer beware. the stuff costs a bloody fortune (for a variety of reasons) and there are unscrupulous sellers out there to take advantage of it. Sorry I got so long-winded on this topic! It's just a suggestion! Altho I started taking the CBD hemp oil for non-cancer reasons, I'm so happy to have found that it's also such a good complementary treatment for cancer. I'm taking it as \"insurance,\" so to speak. Must say, a week after chemo, very little nausea from my first chemo. No problem with appetite, and no foods are making me sick. No bone pain from the Neulasta (but I also took Claritin), and no pain on top of the pain I already had, no mouth sores or dry mouth yet (all my chemo meds come with that common SE), minimal headaches first 3 days. I'm feeling pretty happy with the level of SEs, except of course, the fiery diarrhea. Oh my, I sure did go on and on about the cannabis. I hope I didn't offend anyone. It can be a controversial subject. Take care everyone, and DRINK PLENTY OF WATER!! LOL NCBeachGirl",

I did get some things--travel-size hand sanitizer, stuff to soothe a burning butt or girlie parts, crackers, green tea, bottles of water, BioTene toothpaste for sensitive mouth, Ensure, some bland convenience foods like the kind of rice you nuke for 90 seconds and voila it's done. I got a prescription for anti-nausea meds, and I have my CBD hemp oil to help protect my nerves and other things it's said to help with. Beyond that stuff, I'm just waiting to see what I'll need. Man, what a party this is going to be. I'll be at chemo for most of Monday. I guess that first day is a super long one. Will take my computer and iPhone, and some things to eat. ",

So I'm off to the store for cranberry extract, and massive quantities of Ben and Jerry's for my mom who just had painful eye surgery and is freaking out about her pain and my symptoms. Took the cranberry tablets in the parking lot--with WARM water that had been in the sun, as it's like 90 degrees out today--GACK!!! Picked up some dinner, and I've been on the internet ever since, trying to figure out how I could have all these symptoms but NO FEVER. No chills, nausea, cough, sniffles, nothing. I actually feel pretty good, except for the horrible tooth pain and the UTI pain. But amazingly the cranberry stuff is already working, and no pain when I peed a few minutes ago, but LOL, BRIGHT orange pee!!! Ugh, what a day! ",

I'm too spacey today to keep everyone's posts straight in my head, so I guess I'll just give a synopsis of yesterday's first chemo infusion. Apologies for not being more personal. I'm on so many topics and I'm pretty new...having trouble keeping people and threads straight. I spent 8 (count 'em, 8) full hours at the chemo clinic Monday! first a blood draw, then appointment with MO, then the long hours of infusion, then installation of the Neulasta cartridge thing. LONG DAY!!! but it went pretty well. Two of the meds (Herceptin and my iron infusion) made me hot and gave me a headache, but otherwise I was okay. Slept the sleep of the dead last night. Woke up with only one dog in the room (there should have been two--lol--how did that happen?) and with a sore throat (probably snoring). Later in the day some nausea started, mild headache continues, i'm feeling a little weak, and my tongue feels like sandpaper. Mom says I smell a little funny, and the dogs agree. My pee smells weird, too. But so far, I can't complain. The dose of Neulasta is due to dispense itself around 7pm. For those who don't know, it's supposed to stimulate the bone marrow to produce more cells, to keep up the blood counts. But has an unfortunately common side effect of bone pain. I hate bone pain, so I'm taking Zyrtec because we don't have any Claritin, and my MO said it probably doesn't matter precisely which drug we take. But I'm getting the impression he isn't a big fan of \"off-the-label\" uses of meds and supplements. He seems quite well-versed in mainstream medicine, but it's clear that complementary treatments don't impress him. As long as he doesn't fight me on it, I'll let him live. Again, please forgive me for not being more personal here...I was too tired to log on last night, and have been pretty overwhelmed today, and now I'm getting sleepy and it's only 4pm!

I haven't looked in awhile, but I'm pretty sure you can find info on the complementary and alternative forums. Cannabis--both legal and illegal-- is so common among cancer patients. I'm not proposing doing anything illegal. If anyone objects to our public conversations, just ask and I'll take it private. It's just easier to type stuff once. I can't remember our rules, seems we're not supposed to post links. I think we can mention companies tho. I started with Charlotte's Web CBD hemp oil products (CW is one of the original manufacturers, and well regarded), and then I added Palmetto Harmony. I know someone with fibromyalgia who is happy with American Shaman products. CW is both a company name and the name of a strain of cannabis they developed. There are many imitators, also many distributors of the real CW products. Same with something called Rick Simpson Oil (I know very little about Rick Simpson oils). Rick Simpson is an actual person who developed special strains and processes, but basically went \"off the grid\" and disappeared, I believe because of legal hassles associated with administering cannabis to people who could really benefit from it. People selling Rick Simpson oils may or may not be using his carefully honed techniques. Oh, before I forget, one of the best sources of marijuana info is leafly.com. Be warned--it's all aspects of marijuana (medicinal and recreational) and hemp! But they really know their stuff. I have lots of links bookmarked, BTW. And LMAO, my mom's computers and phones are all linked on the same network and cloud, and we keep getting each other's stuff, and LOL, often my cannabis stuff pops up in her Facebook feed! haha, I had to warn her when I first started doing cannabis research, and it's a good thing i did! I use the strongest varieties because it usually takes high doses of meds to reach effective levels for me, and my problems have been with me for many years. Everyone is different--there are many forms of CBD hemp oil products, in different strengths. There are tinctures (extracts to be taken by dropperful under the tongue then swallowed), vapes (like e-cigarettes, sort of), edibles, topicals (mainly for localized pain relief), and a type of concentrated paste taken orally. They even have gummy bear-type edibles! Oh, lol, and dog biscuits! I kid you not. CBD hemp oil is made from \"industrial hemp,\" which is different but related to the pot that gets you high, in that industrial hemp products contain a very small amount of THC, or none at all. You can't get high off industrial hemp products. Nevertheless, hemp isn't legal to grow in many states, and i'm sketchy on the laws exactly, but if it's not legal to grow, it's not legal to be sold in dispensaries or stores. However, it is legal to buy online and have shipped to any state in the US. Some states, like NC where I live, just legalized hemp farming and selling of products, in conjunction with university pilot research programs. CBD hemp oil is NOT regular \"hemp oil\" or \"hempseed oil\" that you find in health food stores. Those products don't contain CBD. Oh, CBD is short for cannabidiol, one of several types of cannabinoids found in cannabis plants. The human body is actually wired to use cannabinoids. We have an endocannabinoid system. We have receptors in many types of cells--don't quote me on this, but the brain, nervous system, and immune system are what I remember. So cannabinoids can help with all sorts of things, from regulating metabolism and appetite, stabilizing mood, protecting nerves, regulating pain, and a myriad of other things. notanisland, I can't remember exactly how CBD oil works to protect the nerves, but there is a ton of info all over google. Search for \"CBD and neuropathy,\" and then do variations, like neuroprotection, neurogenesis, cannabis, chemotherapy, radiation, cancer treatment side effects, you know, mix it up a bit. You'll find tons of info, some from mainstream research institutions, and lots from a wide variety of sources. I found a lack of info from human studies in the US, mostly our studies are on animals or cells. There is more human study info from outside the US. Look for sources that sound like our mainstream research institutes. Oh geez, there is even pro cannabis/cancer study info on our .gov sites.... or there WAS... the trump administration is deleting a great deal of that sort of thing from our .gov sites. Because cannabis is so controversial in our society at the moment, you will run into lot of conflicting viewpoints out there. Just try to figure out which ones are likely to be reputable and dismiss the ones that look too wacky. There are \"whole plant\" products and product \"isolates.\" Different benefits to each. Which also makes it really confusing to compare products. Some claim certain CBD concentrations, some use another criteria I can't pull out of my head at the moment. Whole-plant products are said to have the \"entourage effect,\" which is a way of saying it's best to use the whole plant and get the synergistic effects of a wide variety of cannabinoids and terpenes (terpenes are chemicals responsible for the fragrances in plants, and have benefits to our bodies). However, these products have lower concentrations of CBD. Product isolates have isolated the CBD and the products will be more concentrated, but lack the whole-plant benefits. That's part of why I combine two different brands-- one is a whole-plant product, the other is more of an isolate. Because of these restrictions, (sorry...this is a continuation of a much earlier paragraph--I don't know how to drag and drop paragraphs on this computer, so my writing is awfully disjointed, I'm afraid!) the US domestic industrial hemp supply is limited. Also, CBD hemp oil products can legally only be manufactured from certain parts of the plant, unfortunately not the parts with the highest concentrations of CBD! Hence, it takes a LOT of hemp to produce the products. And you know what that means--unscrupulous sellers and price gouging! Well, it is what it is. Sometimes, because our domestic hemp supply is limited, you will find that suppliers have shortages. Hemp is a \"bioaccumulator,\" meaning it sucks toxins up from the soil and stores them in the plant. Therefore, it is essential to buy only from organic sources, preferably from the US. But there are some overseas sources with clean hemp, mostly places like Norway. Everything I read said do NOT get anything from China or eastern Europe. There are different ways to process the hemp. The purest way is with cold CO2 processing, which retains whole-plant characteristics without destroying the delicate terpenes and such (this is what Palmetto Harmony uses). However, there is another process that sort of liberates substances...I'm not up on this method, but I believe it's what CW uses. You do NOT want anything processed with chemical solvents. Many sellers just want you to sign up as a wholesale distributor of their products, and they'll offer a free bottle or deep discount. Some are genuinely caring companies, and offer discounts and financial assistance or grants. It's an unfortunate situation out there--buyer beware. The best companies do 3rd party independent laboratory testing of each batch to assure a specific level of CBD. I wish I could be of more help with specific suppliers, but I got pretty overwhelmed myself, and then whoopeee! I discovered we have a dispensary downtown! I am SO envious of people in MMJ legal states where you can visit dispensaries and get the benefits of their knowledgeable staffs, not to mention the wide variety of actual marijuana-derived products. Oh geez, hemp info overload!! All this thinking has wrung me out! LOL. I hope there is info in here that helps. Oh, regarding dosing, it's highly individual. I was taking about 110 mg a day, divided in three doses. But it wasn't helping my pain, and I ran out of my CW a few days ago. Money is super tight right now, and I'm not sure I can afford the CW, but I'm for sure going to keep using the Palmetto Harmony (about 60 mg per day). I'm hoping that's enough to help with cancer-related stuff, and hopefully neuroprotection and neurogenesis of my nerve-damaged legs. Pain relief is just gonna have to wait. There's a tiny lady at the dispensary who uses just a few drops at a time to ease her menstrual cramps or anxiety. The friend who gave me my first bottle of CW was using it for cancer-related nausea. She only needed a few drops at a time, too. Some people use multiple forms of CBD products-- maybe they vape for one effect or speed of effect, and tinctures for their main amount, and a gummy-bear edible as an afternoon boost if they need it. Some people, like, I believe, the kids who use it for horrible epilepsy, use a great deal every day. But apparently it's a miracle substance for them, so their parents move their families to Colorado etc where they can get access to dispensaries and MMJ and the wealth of products and knowledge available there, and somehow they find a way. Oh my...somebody stop me already! Swearing I'm ending this post now! Hope it helps, and feel free to ask more questions if you dare, and I'll answer what I can. NCBeachGirl",

Some people have to drive back to the cancer center to get an injection of Neulasta instead. The cartridge makes that step unnecessary, as the cartridge automatically dispensed the drug 27 hours after your infusion was done. The cartridge thingy is really clever. They peel off a sticky backing and then they have 3 minutes to stick it on your body (either your arm or your tummy) before it automatically inserts its needle. It barely hurts, just a little snap. The thing inserts a needle in your flesh, then a tiny catheter stays in your flesh and the needle withdraws back up into the cartridge. So you walk around for 27 hours with this thing blinking on your tummy--it has a little neon green light that blinks every couple seconds to let you know all is working okay. If the light turns red, you're supposed to call the cancer center. There is a little window in the cartridge that looks like the thing on a pregnancy test stick. It shows whether the cartridge is full or empty. 27 hours after you finished your chemo infusion, the damn thing starts beeping at you!! (Surprise!!) then it starts clicking and the green light blinks faster. This is how it acts when it's dispensing the drug. Takes about 45 minutes or an hour. Then it beeps again to tell you it's done. You're supposed to check the window and make sure it indicates empty. The light will be solid green at this point, no blinking. You won't feel a thing. When you are sure it's done, you're supposed to peel it off like a band aid (make sure to look at the diagram they give you, peel it from the correct end first). When it's off your body, you can see the teeny tiny little catheter at one end of the underside of the cartridge. They tell you to check for any leaking, and let them know if it doesn't dispense properly or leaks. All in all, it's a damned clever little thing!! Oh, I have a picture of it. I don't know if we can post pix on here. If not, private message me and I'll send it to you. Everybody recommends you take Claritin for a day before and 5 days after the Neulasta injection to avoid bone pain. I did, and I had no pain whatsoever. I had them put my cartridge on my tummy because I usually sleep on my back.",

I'm going for my 2nd chemo on Monday morning. Not sure if they'll give it to me tho. My blood counts must have been super low after the first chemo because I got shingles and two other infections. I'm hoping the counts are up enough that they'll give me the chemo. Don't really want to drag this out any longer than necessary. So... when do we start losing our hair? Is it after chemo #2 or chemo #3? Ugh, not looking forward to it. And I'm getting icky moisture at my inner thigh creases...hoping I can manage to avoid getting some kind of infection. Geez, do these side effects ever end? Don't answer that!  ",

Indian women often decorate their hands for their weddings. I have no idea what it costs, and no idea how long i'm likely to be bald. So there's the thought that maybe it would be cost effective to just go ahead and get a regular ink tattoo--LOL--as the henna paint lasts only about 2 weeks. But then there's the immune system issues... would it be too dangerous to get a regular tattoo? My guess is that it's not a smart idea. The henna head tattoo I saw was really pretty. If I weren't always so freaking hot, I'd be okay with scarves and stuff. The henna tattoo seems like a very good option for me. NC in summer is miserably hot and humid!",

Apologies for not reading thru posts and being attentive to everyone. I've had a bizarre rash under the breast that had the tumor, and i don't know why i find this so bloody funny, but I have SHINGLES!! Yeah, guess my immune system took a very quick dive after that first chemo last Monday. All I can think of is those commercials and automatically felt 100 years old when the doctor told me I have shingles. Cracks me up. Anyway, it's not as bad as it could be. Kinda itchy, kinda painful. But nothing like the horror stories you usually hear about shingles. I may just be lucky, but it could be the CBD hemp oil doing its neuroprotective thing. Too tired to remember how the zoster virus works, but it has something to do with traveling along and damaging nerves when your immune system is down. Goodnight, ladies...I'm trashed!",

Get on the computer and try to figure out my symptoms and what to do about them. I'm frustrated that the cancer center didn't take a more active interest in my symptoms. So I'm going to the primary care physician at 1:30, and she's not gonna know if this is all just chemo side effects or if I have some kinds of infections. Ugh. I will call the cancer center again when they open and make a bigger fuss. Our town's new and wonderful cancer center is opening in the fall, and they'll have wonderful coordinated care teams and all sorts of services and resources....why couldn't I have waited a few more months before getting cancer? Ear hurts a lot now, throat hurts more, and the teeth still ache, and I had a little stuffiness in my nose when I first woke up. Still no fever, in fact it's only 97.7. But I did get immediate relief from taking the Azo cranberry tablets (the ones with urinary tract anesthetic medicine). YAYYYY!!! Great stuff!!! I'm taking an anti-viral and I've been using my CBD hemp oil topically on my shingles rash twice a day and I have almost no pain, only very little itching once in awhile, and the rash is shrinking, no more blisters or scabs (I never really had much of that anyway). The virus that causes shingles lies dormant in the nerves, and in a shingles infection, it travels along a particular nerve to the surface of the skin where it causes the rash and blisters. I'm attributing the very mild shingles to my use of the CBD oil (have been taking the tincture under the tongue three times a day for several months). It's supposed to protect the nerves, and I do believe it's doing just that! Well, I suppose I should log off and try to get some more sleep. But now it's 5:35, and our neurotic border collie usually eats about 6. My night may be over...sigh...DOGS...gotta love 'em, but ugh, sometimes you want to wring their little doggy necks!",

Or maybe it's just automatic. I don't remember. But it's a good thing they gave it to me, or heaven knows just how low my counts would have gone. Tomorrow (Monday) is chemo #2. We'll find out what's up (or down) with my blood before they'll do the infusion.",

Even tho you may hear some pretty scary stuff online, I am very glad I have been on this community so I am at least prepared for the weird variety of things that may or may not happen. And everyone is so supportive! it is so great to know you can get on here and complain about bad days or be happy about good ones. If you are not on other forums besides this one, check some out and see if there are others you might enjoy, too. Haha, \"enjoy?\" I don't know if that's exactly the right word! Many people follow more than one. You can search for topics and stuff. It can take a long time to scroll around through all the forums and topics, so doing searches can be faster. Even tho I had tons of side effects from Chemo #1, emotionally I felt really good. This time is different tho--chemo #2 has knocked me on my butt. And this is right after the MO's nurse assistant told me the first chemo is usually the hardest! Hah, oh well. So I'm stuck here in bed. Waiting on Chinese food and watching senate hearings on C-Span and wanting to throw things at the TV. Do I think I should get out of my nightshirt and put on some clothes before Mom gets home with my soup? Nah, I think not!!! Try to keep your sense of humor, if you can. It helps a lot. And have people told you these two things I've heard them tell all the newbies? Keep a journal of treatments, side effects, medications, how you feel, etc. And what's the other thing? Hmmm... chemo brain so soon? LOL. I'm sorry...I can't remember!!! This isn't it, but this is very important: drink TONS of water!!! All the time. Tons! You want to flush out those toxins. Take care, and good luck Wednesday!",

I guess I'm not freaked out enuf to call tonight. Frankly, I just don't feel like taking a trip to the ER with dirty hair. And I already took my evening meds and I'll be asleep in half an hour anyway. Ugh, it's like the worst case of PMS bloating you've ever had. I look like I swallowed a giant, semi-filled water balloon. Man, I don't want to go to the ER. Maybe they can clear it up with diuretics. Waaaahhh!!!",
