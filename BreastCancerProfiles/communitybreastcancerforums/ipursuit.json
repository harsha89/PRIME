      "Content": "Sep 24, 2009 08:01AM - edited Sep 24, 2009 08:04AM by ipursuit OMG, Amy that is so funny!  \"dance of the seven veils\"!  Maybe that would work for someone (?!) but I think my DH and I would die laughing! Asterix, thanks for starting this thread. Truly amuzing and interesting.  I hope this all gives you the solution to the bedroom problem and look forward to hearing more about you in future. I had a double mastectomy (one prophylactic) and immediate reconstruction with TEs in Feb 2009.  For a long time I did not let my DH see my foobs, but gradually it just got too inconvenient to keep hiding.  I always wore a tank top (can't remember what they call them these days that you wear under another layer and they are supposed to show - chemo brain...) to give the illusion of the real thing. I guess the suggestions by Cheryl are really the same idea, but with removable foobs, so that might work for you.  Over time, I just relaxed my guard and let my DH get a look and he didn't freak so now I make no efforts to hide.  I do still wear a pretty sheer sexy nightie and that works well.  I think time is the great healer for this.  Whatever you have becomes the new normal.  I do share C's (Connie?) sadness over losing the nipple sensation.  With a double mx I lost both sides and that was always my second  biggest erotic zone.  Pamela, you are such a hoot! (as they say here in the south) that I will just have to find those lost nerves!  C, I see you live in GA and we have some other things in common.  PM and let me know where you live, etc.  I am so sorry to hear about what a hard time you are having. All the best to such wonderful ladies.  This site is one of the few blessings to this terrible disease. E PS.  Sorry forgot to mention Barbe, I really enjoy your posts.  So sorry about you having to deal with both your own BC and your husband's tumors.  Hope the doc has some good meds for DH.",

HER2+ cancers grow fast. I had a digital mammo May 30th 2008 which showed nothing.  Something tiny showed in a digital mammo in early Dec 2008, and then when they excised my HER2+ BC Feb 3rd 2009 it was 1.2 cm.   Takeaway: Start treatment as fast as you can do so after doing your due diligence.",

On the other hand I was lucky because after a needle biopsy in May 2008 (which found atypia) I delayed having the recommended excisional biopsy (due to complacency -both mom and sis had \"indolent\" ER+++ BC and docs thought it was genetic) and when I followed up in early Dec 2008 docs found a \"new\" spot that wasn't there in May and turned out to be a rapidly growing HER2+ BC.",
