I was first diagnosed with liver and bone mets in 2012. It's not been easy, but it has been do-able, and life for me has been good these past 77 months--much longer than I thought I'd have. I don't have advice, because our circumstances and our bodies are all different, but I offer my support and prayers. I do find that living in each day as it comes (trite, I know, but true) has been my constant challenge and strength, and I am amazed at how those individual days become weeks, months, and years. (My oncologist told me yesterday I was in much better shape now than I was in July, 2012, which made me recall his comment to me when he told me of liver mets: \"We can make it better.\" I do so hope the same for you.

About the only things that rile me as much are these: 1.  PINK, in all its merchandised glory 2.  So and so died after a \"courageous battle with cancer\" I have turned into a curmudgeon tonight.  Whatever has happened to my attitude?",

I am Judy.  First diagnosed in 1987 with a 4mm. tumor (lumpectomy, radiation).  The thing came back in 1989 (termed regional metastasis, stage III--cytoxan, 5-fu, methotrexate).  Had bone marrow harvest in 1990, strongly recommended by oncologist.  Paid out-of- pocket--ouch!!  I asked the doctor directing the program at med center how long the harvest would keep.  His answered, \"Definitely at least five years, but don't worry, you'll need it before then.\"  I think that stuff is still probably in a freezer somewhere, since bone marrow transplants aren't done for breast cancer these days.  Took Tamoxifen for 11 years. In July, 2012 I had a routine physical.  (At husband's urging/nagging--just had been going downhill in energy)  Turned out I had anemia.  Further investigation, turned out I had bone and liver mets.  Yowza!!! Did not see that coming, but do any of us, really?  Started Femara, Xgeva, Faslodex the day of diagnosis.  PET scan in January showed bone regression, but liver progression, so have added Taxol and Avastin. I am 66--one of the elders.  I was 41 with a kindergartener when first diagnosed.  My heart breaks for the young women--if I could take your disease, truly I would.  I have had so much time that I never expected to have, and for which I am most grateful.  I would love more time, but I have been gifted beyond measure with life to raise my children and even to have grandchildren.   I have been married to a wonderful man for 45 years.  We have four children:  three of them are 38-years-old (they were quadruplets, but we lost a little boy at 8 days), and a 29-year-old (it took nine years to get up the courage to try that again)!  We have seven grandchildren, and another to come in May. I was a high school special education teacher (now retired), and LOVED it!!!!!  My husband is a retired professor who plays lots of golf.  His passion for golf is matched by mine for sewing.  I love to sew, and have made my own clothes since high school.  (Love dressmaking and tailoring.  A somewhat serious concern is what will eventually become of my enormous stash of fabrics.) We have the most affectionate schnauzer there could be.  His name is Arnie, and he loves without measure. I love to read, and my favorites are all of C.S. Lewis and very glad to have found Lady Julian of Norwich. So glad to meet you all.",

I thought time was far more limited when I first got the diagnosis, but here I am, and with a pretty good quality of life. I've had many lines of treatment, some worked, and more did not. It was always discouraging when a treatment was ineffective, and like all of us, I dread waiting for scan results and tumor markers. The tumors have never gone away, but blood work is always reasonably normal. Currently I'm on Halaven (past 6 months). My longest stretch of good response was with Doxil (20 months). I know we're all different in our responses to treatments--some promising ones didn't work for me, but others did. There is hope for more time. Wishing you well!   ",

Also, I have thought that I should write down some reminiscences and stories to pass down to my grandchildren, but I haven't started that either. It's probably time. I have reservations, though, that the recollections will be only as accurate as my perspective and memory allow. I guess, though, that's how any of our own stories must be. I have three teenaged grandchildren, and I have told them about my diagnosis (and they certainly can google and have googled, so they know). I plan to tell my 12 and 8 year old grandsons fairly soon. The little ones, who are 3 and under, I won't tell. Maybe???? Up to their parents. They know that medicine has made my hair fall out. When I don't wear my wig at home, one of the little girls says, \"Grandma, put on your 'lots of hair'.\" Such delightful honesty! and what a good name for my wig!

I know that all of that seems archaic now, and regional metasases are not what we are dealing with now.  Yet, I did feel that my future was very foreshortened and that I wouldn't be with my husband and childrern.  My youngest daughter was in kindergarten, and the recurrence came at the time of her school Christmas program (parochial school).  I went out and bought her Christmas dresses for  the next three years, labelled the years, and hung  them in her closet.  Small preparations, like that. After a few months, I got more levelled and decided I could not live in the future, only right now.  Each morning I thanked God for this day, and asked myself, \"Are you going to die today?\"  I'd think, \"NO, not today.\"  Then, somehow, I'd be happy  for that day.  Sometimes the dread would overwhelm me, and I suspected each ache and pain, but the good days grew in number.   After 22 years and 7 months I was taken by utter surprise with liver and bone mets.  (Clean mammograms--all three times, though!!????)  Most days I marvel at the enormous gift of time and life I had, and just think that my note finally  had come due. (Some days, though, it pisses me off!)   At any rate, what seems to help me was/is living in the day, not looking too far ahead.    Sending you good wishes and a heartfelt prayer.",

(First, a disclaimer: I have had trouble entering/updating treatment info, so there are missing dates and a missing chemo on the list as it appears, so I will correct those below. I guess I'll list meds and the strategy (as I perceive it) chronologically. Here goes: 11/21/1987: 1st diagnosis ILC, 4mm. lumpectomy, radiation 12/11/1989: recurrence, regional involvement, CMF (cytoxan, methotrexate, 5-FU) Tamoxifen from 1990 - 2001 7/31/2012: 1st PET scan: metasasis to liver and bones , Faslodex, Xgeva, Femara [Oncologist thought that hormonals would be a good start] 1/2013: 2nd PET scan: progression in liver, added Taxol and Avastin and continued the Faslodex, Xgeva, Femara. Oncologist still held some hope for the hormonal, but wanted to zap the liver mets with chemo. 6/2013: 3rd PET scan: liver and bones showed regression, but blood developed a form of myelodysplastic syndrome, so stopped Taxol and Avastin, but continued Faslodex, Xgeva, Femara. 11/2013: 4th PET scan: progression to liver and bones. started Abraxane, stopped Faslodex and Femara. 4/2014: 5th PET scan: progression to liver and bones, started Navelbine 7/2014: 6th PET scan: progression to liver and bones, started Aromasin and Afinitor 11/2014: 7th PET scan: progression to liver and bones (not looking too promising) , started Doxil 5/2015: 8th PET scan: regression in bones and liver, continued Doxil, had EKG, Echo, MUGA to assess heart--okay 8/9/2015-8/16/2015: hospitalized with Ludwig's angina (jaw infection), osteonecrosis of jaw 6/2016: 9th PET scan: progression to bones (a great 19 month run on Doxil!!!!), stopped Doxil, started Xeloda 12/2016: 10th PET scan: progression to liver and bones, stopped Xeloda, started Halaven 6/2017: 11th PET scan: progression to liver and bones, oncologist thought it would be worth trying Tamoxifen again since I'd had a long disease-free period on it years ago, even though none of the newer hormonals had worked for me since metastasis. We all thought, \"What can it hurt?\" So I started Tamoxifen! 2/2018: 12th PET scan: regression in liver and bones--tumors smaller--best PET scan I've had, continued with Tamoxifen. (I told my oncologist he's a genius,and he grinned and said \"I know.\" He is great!) 7/2018: 13th PET scan: progression in liver and bones. Started Verzenio.  If you have read this entire post, you must be exhausted. I will think about your other question about what might have helped me, and I'll collect my thoughts and post again (be forewarned!!!)",

Right now I'm taking 200 mg of Verzenio as a mono therapy. That dose is kicking my butt, but my scan last month showed some improvement, so it's worth it.

After progression on Halaven in 2017, my oncologist (whom I truly respect) said he thought it would be worth trying Tamoxifen again (it had been about 17 years since I'd had it). I was running out of options. There was Gemzar yet to be tried, and Verzenio had not yet been approved. Well, It worked very well for a little more for more than a year and I felt great!! If you do decide on Tamoxifen, I wish you good results, too. For me, it was a wonderful revisit! (And now on to Verzenio, which is rougher but I'm hopeful.)",

I feel a bit like \"What? She's still alive? I heard it was stage IV. She must not really be that sick.\" Like most of us, I haven't publicized my illness, but word gets around. I almost feel a bit embarrassed, and that is stupid!! I attended a class reunion five years ago, and several people knew then.

The mother of my daughter's best friend was diagnosed with stage III breast cancer two weeks after I was diagnosed with Stage IV. She wanted to rely on prayer and a strict diet. She did well for a few months, but sadly died 14 months after her diagnosis--on her daughter's birthday. She was a well-intentioned, devout woman, who felt that she would not be wholly reliant on God if she chose to combine her options with medicine. My heart broke for her daughter. Please, please do not feel that you are disappointing your parents. Perhaps they can pray with in concert with the medicines--pray for the specific medicines (by name, even) to work within your body. Use all the graces available to you, and the medicines and medical practitioners are major graces! Many good wishes and blessings to you.  ",

I'm sure that you'll be hearing from others on the forum--several different treatments and lots of information. Wishing you well!",

Certainly I have no answer--in fact, I just now had to read up on leptomeningeal disease. All I can speak to is the Xeloda. For me it was a very tolerable medicine (hands and feet peeled, but manageable). Is your doctor thinking that treatment will continue to keep symptoms at bay for longer? Is it something you might try, and if it makes you feel worse, you wouldn't have to continue? This disease is scary, and I see that you've been dealing with it for a long time (and also that you are ILC, me, too).",

The fevers do suggest the possibility of infection. If there is any swelling, please get her to the doctor immediately. I have had ongoing problems with ONJ since 2015. Most of it was controlled by antibiotics. However, in August, 2015,while visiting my daughter in Seattle, I developed swelling, and just felt unwell with a low-grade fever. After hoping it would improve, we finally went to a walk-in clinic on a Sunday (duh!!!) After a 3-hour wait to be seen, I was sent to an emergency room, where I was immediately diagnosed with Ludwig's Angina (had never heard of it), then sent by ambulance to another hospital where I had surgery immediately, and remained in the hospital for 8 days. Recovered well, but it was frightening and painful. Not suggesting this is your mother's case, but do be aware of it, especially with the fevers. Private message me, if you'd like. Hoping for the best for you and your mother. Judy   ",
