It actually came back as a fibroepithelial lesion (from what I read that means unsure of whether fibroadenoma or phyllodes). It was rated last ultrasound as bi rads 4 or 5 (don't remember which) . It has been 6mo since core needle biopsy. She wanted to see if it grew any more. It definitely hasn't shrunk but I am unsure it if it grew. I had been trying to forget about it the last 6mo. Has anyone else had a similar experience? Just wondering what I should expect tomorrow/what questions to ask. Tia! Log in to post a reply",

Ive been trying to go with natural remedies but nothing works. Obviously I've also tried otc pain medications. Ibuprofen and naproxen etc. They dont work. Ive had slight success with icing. But as soon as i unwrap my ice pack from my chest the pain is back full force. Its not realistic to think i can ice constantly. Been trying to stay away from narcotics but I feel like that may be my only option... Is there anyone who has any tips on managing the pain??? Please help!!! I'm not sleeping and can't make it through a full day at work. (Luckily, I have a very flexible job. And my boss is very understanding) Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Lacu wrote: hello everyone. I have posted a couple times about my experiences so far. (My questions are at the end). I'm 25 years old. Very dense /lumpy breasts. I have I think somewhere between 4-6 lumps. So before the doctors were sure that I had fibroadenomas. I did not like the general surgeon I had seen previously so asked my dr. To get a second opinion. Last week I had an ultrasound to prepare for the appointment today. After seeing that the \"lumps\" (they are no longer calling them fibroadenomas) have changed. They have decided i need a biospy. By changed here is what my surgeon said. \"They said it looks bigger but they can't tell but it looks different and it has changed\" I assume she was paraphrasing to protect my feelings. Don't really know. My surgeon kept saying \"Well it could be fibroadenomas or...\" then would change the subject. She also says there is not much of a permanent solution for the extreme pain I'm in. So that sucks. So a stressful day all in all. And I don't really know what to think about that but at least they are moving forward with biopsy. So I guess I'm looking for anyone with similar experiences. What others think my dr. meant. And what were other peoples experience with core needle biopsy? Painful? Not? I will not be put to sleep but will be numbed. Healing process? My mind went kind of blank during the appointment. Log in to post a reply",
