To bring you all up to speed - mom was pronouced in good health ( except for the BC of course) before starting treatment. No outstanding health issues were found and Mom got through AC treatment #1 on Jan 19th. Two days later she developed severe abdominal pain and was hospitalized for four days with a weird SE which involved inflammation of the pancreas. ( after days of tests, no cause was determined and she does not drink alcohol at all so that was ruled out). She recovered from that and then landed back in the ER three days later for chemo related gastro intestinal problems which caused a section of bowel to swell and press on a spinal nerve. She got over that in 24 hrs and then was told her next chemo would be delayed a week to give her body time to recover ( she's on DD AC x 4 and T x 4 ). She was supposed to have chemo #2 tomorrow but her last blood tests done Tuesday show elevated pancreatic and liver enzymes and rising WBC again so chemo is now off until next Tuesday and she has to have yet another CT scan tomorrow. Her oncologist seems puzzled as to why the rare and weird problems are happening. She's felt quite good for the past two weeks so the blood test results were unexpected. Has anyone else here had anything like this happen? Poor mom just wants to get on with it and setback after setback keeps happening.",

      "Content": "Feb 12, 2012 03:16PM - edited Feb 12, 2012 03:17PM by TryingToSaveMom Yet another update about mom. Her first AC chemo on Jan. 19 caused serious side effects (acute pancreatitis and gastro intestinal bleeding) and everytime she's almost back to 'normal', her enzyme and WBC levels go up and down like a roller coaster. Three times the second AC chemo has been scheduled and then had to be cancelled due to the same problems redeveloping. She had more blood tests and another CAT scan last week. Her oncologist seems to be getting frustrated and now they're planning an endoscopy this week to see if chemo may have caused small stones to develop in her previously healthy pancreas. Not sure what they'll do if they find them but once again everything is on hold. Also not sure what the oncologist will do about chemo. Mom is triple negative and there are no other chemos that work for TNs (other than the AC / T dose dense) and it's been nearly a months since mom's last chemo. It's been a very exhausting and trying month for mom and all of us in her family.",

Cats I saw your post about Milk Thistle and will mention it to mom and her oncologist. Actually the oncologist called today ( Yes on a Sunday believe it or not!) and says they'll do an endoscopy to see if there are any pancreatic stones - if there are and they're small they can remove them fairly easily without surgery she says. She also said last Fridays tests show mom's enzymes and WBC are finally stabilizing and AC chemo treatment number two should be able to go ahead finally - likely later this week. I'll think good thoughts for all of you guys too. Hopefully everyone's week will go well and no bad side effects or setbacks for anyone.... and if scientists or researchers are reading out there - hurry up and find a cure so no more people have to go through this stuff!",

She is starting to feel better today thank heavens but the doctors say she'll be in the hospital for several days yet while everything heals - and they still say they don't know why this happened but admit that the chemo probably caused it even though it's not a typical side effect. So far all they've told mom is that they won't be giving her the same drugs again but what happens next we don't know yet. I hope things will get better for you. Thanks for your comments,  Jenn",

So mom's not the only one. Mom came home today so at least she's managing to recover fairly well but I suspect that Leah is right and her oncologist will likely change her chemo. So far the oncologists have said very little - they seem a bit puzzled as to how this happened, so at the moment we're still in the dark. Next week mom has another appt with the head oncologist so  they'll probably outline the plan then. Bela maybe talk to your oncologist again about your concerns and hopefully they may have some ideas to help you ? Thanks again for the input everyone. I welcome more anytime.",
