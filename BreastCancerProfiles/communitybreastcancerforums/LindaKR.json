Carol - that sounds often(edited I think I meant awesome!), be sure to let us know when it's posted.  Proud - I just checked and if you've had cancer, except in situ, you can't donate anyway.  So sorry for your loss, may he rest in peace, and may you find peace also.

Purple - the diagram is really helpful to have, my LET drew arrows and adaptations that she wanted me to do on the diagrams.  I'm pretty sure that I couldn't have done the MDT without them.  She thinks that you should do the massage morning and night, just before you don your garment or wrap, and for night just before you go to bed (I usually try to wear my night garments too).  've found that I can do a lot of it in shower in the morning, kind of helps losen up for the day too.  I try to follow the massage \"moves\" with my washing and drying too.  And since I'm supposed to try to move some of the lymph fluid toward my spine, the towel works great for that when you're drying off.  Also, all I have to do is ask and she'll have me practice during my appointment, and show me if/what I'm doing incorrectly.  She's also suggested that I bring my husband in and she will teach him how to do it on me, but haven't managed to get him there, and my trying to teach him has kind of bombed.  Purple - the swelling in my knuckles and fingers is below the gauntlet, I'm worried that it will swell and not go down, so I'm waiting now, unless I wrap, to wear anything until I get the gloves.  But everything is making my fingers swell right now.  I'm not sure that it's not due to some arthritic type issue, but it does get worse when I swing or hang my arm too long, or even typing seems to be a problem - and the hand gets really stiff.  Better go DH is home for dinner - I better pull the leftovers out of the fridge.",

I consider getting one for symmetry and freedom from wearing a bra. I don't plan on recon, nor according to my docs am I a good candidate for it. I'm a DD on the other side, have a lot of residual pain issues. Though my BS agreed if I want it, I just can't bring myself to take healthy tissue, have more surgery, risk the scar tissue issues I have on the other side, or really want my whole chest to have no feeling (be numb).  That's my 2 cents!",

I never considered reconstruction, not exactly sure why, but it was just a no for me, also wasn't comfortable removing my healthy breast. I have several different weight foobs, I wear the one that works for my day, some days I go half flat. I never wear a prosthesis when I swim, maybe I would if we went to Hawaii or on a cruise, but at our local pool or at a hotel I just swim half flat. Happy with my decisions! My family has been behind me 100%. Remember there is no rush, if you decide you really want to reconstruct, that option will be there.",

Besides the wrist issues, my thumb joint is basically gone, so if there is too much compression it causes more pain and swelling. So my fitter measured a little loosed around the thumb and wrist and it worked great. She is in Portland, Oregon, I may have told you that before. It was worth driving 200 miles each easy to get a good fit.",

I figured it was worth a try, as they only thing that I've found that works for my pain is topical marijuana cream and oxycodone, and even that only takes the edge off - so what the heck, right? I decided that a Quell was worth a try, I've been using it for 10 days now, and let me tell you - IT\"S WORKING!!!!!! It's helping all of my pain issues, the post mastectomy, neuropathy, the arthralgias that are caused by the aromatase inhibitor, the osteoarthritis pain, the fibro pain - all of it. https://www.quellrelief.com/ The clinician tab has more of the technical info on the machine. I was initially wearing it 24/7, but the last couple of days I've taken some 3-ish hour breaks from it, and the pain relief continues, I've been able to cut my pain pill usage almost in 1/2 in a week. This is what I posted this on a FB forum, it tells a little about it. I'd like to talk a little about the Quell unit - it's very new on the market. It's actually quite different than a tens unit (the similarity being that they both use electrical current to stimulate nerves) Tens units work similarly, but if you go to the Quell website, under the clinicians tab, you'll see that the Quell unit works differently, implanted simulators work on only the dermatomes that nerves go to. The Quell unit works on the Gate Theory of pain management (check out on Google). I've had my Quell unit for a week now, I've been able to drop my pain pill usage almost in half, I think that I could drop it faster, but worry about withdrawal symptoms, my pain level has dropped by more than 50%, even with the lower dosage of pain meds. I'm able to accomplish a lot more, with a lot less pain. I can tell you over the last 6 years I've tried every pain med on the market, antidepressants, anti spasmodics, anti convulsants , all the neurontin type drugs, trigger point injections, neuroplastic brain techniques (which interestingly are sort of based on the gate theory too), several different types of PT (myofascial release is really the only one that helped at all). I've never managed to get the placebo effect with any of them. But by the end of the 1st day with the Quell unit on, my pain had already dropped, and now a week later it's still dropping. My physical therapists both said that they believe that the technology makes sense to them and are very interested in more info (they are researching it more for them selves). Hope my rant is ok.....but this is the first thing in 6 years that I actually think might work for me. I have chemo induced fibro, aromatase inhibitor induced arthralgias in all of my joints, severe neuropathy in my feet and legs, PMPS, osteoarthritis in all of my joints (thanks to the AI), and I'm sure a few that I missed, and this device is helping with all of my pains. I feel like I may be able to get my life back. OH, and I have tried TENS units and they only made it worse. And now I've seen my PCP and chatted about it with my old PCP, and they are both super interested, both knew alot about the Pain Gate theory. So for now, I'm going to keep wearing it, and hope that it continues to work for me. You're welcome to ask me any questions about it. Linda",

The lady that helped my was a lovely, little lady, probably in her late 60's with an old fashioned name (wish I could remember it right now), I know she wasn't the owner, but had worked there a long time.

Erica - My BS had me wear a binder for about 5 weeks, basically 24/7, he said that the MX heals faster (not sure why) and you have less fluid build up, not sure it was true for me, but that's his thinking, he  now allows you stop wearing the binder if you wear a compression bra. He also doesn't let you raise arm above shoulder level for 6 weeks, you should be moving it, but that's all.",

I didn't have much of a choice, but I'm happy with my MX, even though I have issues (pain, adhesions), AND I'm really glad that I didn't have reconstruction.  I had to have punch biopsies to rule out skin mets, which it did, and that triggered my LE big time, I can't imagine what recon would have been like with my scarring & LE issues. Right now (2 1/2 years post MX) When I have my camisole on with the prosthesis, you can't tell I don't have a boob, and it really is pretty comfortable, I love the camisoles they make, I haven't worn a bra since I got them. Though now I'm considering a prophylactic MX, I'm really lopsided, and was big busted, hated wearing a bra..... I think I'll be more comfortable w/o any breasts! ",
