    "Content": "ecampbell64 wrote: I had microductectomy on my left breast on April 17, 2018 with the diagnosis intraductal papilloma. Pathology came back clear. My symptoms were spontaneous bloody discharge and pain which began mid-March of same year. Mammogram and ultrasound prior to surgery showed nothing of concern. The surgeon (not a breast specialist) did not feel an MRI was necessary so that wasn't done. Discharge was never cultured. No needle biopsy pre-surgery. Don't have family history of breast cancer. I had no children so never breast fed. I have not had a period in 4-5 years. Limited caffeine use. I have large natural breasts - 36DDDD bra. I have been diagnosed with fibrocystic breasts, but it has never caused more than slight occasional pain due to hormones during my late 20s. Never had an abnormal mammo. I recovered quickly from the surgery and had no symptoms and felt fine until about mid-May. In mid-May the discharge came back. It continues to be spontaneous, is slightly less than pre-surgery, and yellow instead of bloody. (I think the discharge was also changing from bloody to yellow in the days right before surgery.) A very supportive sports bra worn 24/7 seems to reduce discharge which was also true before surgery. Supportive sports bras worn 24/7 also helped with pain pre- and post- surgery but not now. The pain returned around June 1. It takes a strict regimen of naproxen and acetaminophen to control pain to a dull ache. Follow up visit to surgeon on June 5, and he felt this would resolve on its own. If it didn't I should come back in 3 weeks and he would relieve fluid build up with hollow needle. He didn't feel it was called for yet because the breast was not distended with fluid. It still is not distended as far as I can tell, but the pain is increasing. My gut says no more with this surgeon. He is very cavalier about my concerns and is not a breast specialist. I have an appointment with a breast specialist but it isn't until August 2. That's a long time to wait - especially with pain. It would be great to have feedback from others who have had ductectomies. Should I wait for the breast specialist if I can manage the pain? Go to Phoenix (2.5 hours away) where I would have a larger pool of breast specialists and could probably see someone sooner? With a clear pathology report, I don't feel as much urgency as I did about the first surgery. I am also blessed to have good health insurance and a very supportive husband. Thanks in advance for any help you can provide! Log in to post a reply",
