I had a breast reduction a few years ago and and another biopsy last year. I had the clear tape in both of those procedures with no issue. When I tookthe tape off yesterday, I noticed I had blisters on the outer edges of the tape. Is it common to suddenly develop a reaction? Also, I put neosporin on it. Any suggestions?

Mammo report says BIRADS 2. After the MRI being denied numerous times, we were finally able to get it pushed through. He just called and said that the skin thickening that was seen on all of the other scans was confirmed on the MRI and the radiologist saidcancer cannot be ruled out. There were no underlying masses seen. He\u2019s having me scheduled for a biopsy. Any idea exactly what will be done? I have peau d\u2019orange on the inner left breast and crusting of the nipple. The entire breast is extremely itchy!",
