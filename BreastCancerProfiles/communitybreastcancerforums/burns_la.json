Many anti-depressants are effective on phantom nerve pain as well as different therapies and even accupuncture. The main thing I found is that you should get referred to a pain clinic if you have one in your area and keep the faith. The thing I found is - as you've discovered - it is much easier to avoid the pain than to alleviate it. I do my daily activities in short bursts with a lot of resting in between.

I guess because simple aging is inevitable, so the wrinkles and weight gain aren't as depressing. But, to look in the mirror before a shower (guess this is fairly common!!!!!) is still a time for tears over my loss. My scars, thinning hair, mis-shapen and mis-matched boobs, piled ON TOP of the normal aging issues, and I want to double up on the anti-depressants! And for some reason (as already discussed) the port scar is the worst because it is the most-often visible. A few days ago we were out to dinner with some old friends and new friends, and a new friend (a man) asked my husband how I was doing with my cancer because he recognized the port scar for what it was.

I had a RMast/Immed Tram for DCIS, but the mast path came back invasive, so had to have a subsequent lymph node dissection on the R side to check for spread. Too late for the SNB! Well, I awoke during the surgery with pain and have had it ever since (2004). Have tried the different modes of treatment, thanks to a wonderful PC. Combination of anti-depressant and pain meds works fairly well for me. However, the best way to avoid the pain is to avoid using my right arm or hand (and I'm right handed!). I found prevention is much better than dealing with the pain after it starts! Usually, this is called post-mastectomy pain syndrome or post-lymph node dissection pain syndrome, and it is caused by damage to the intercostobrachial (sp?) nerve during surgery. Feels kind of like wearing a hot barbed-wire bra to begin with, then the pain spreads all down my right arm, through my right axilla, and across my right foob. Do I get to be the first to say \"I feel your pain!!!!!\"",

The neuropathy I have is from a damaged/cut nerve obtained during lymph node dissection. I can tell you the pain I feel from each is very different. The LE pain is more like a heaviness and achiness.  The nerve pain is sharp and feels like I am wearing a barbed-wire bra. After overuse, my nerve pain is definitely worse, while the LE pain seems much more random. At this point, I use \"over-the-counter\" bras which are really shape wear. I get the camisole type garments that are snug - this seems to work very well for me and when the LE flares up, I even wear them to bed. Please work with the LE clinic, they helped me quite a lot. Hugs and prayers from a true sister. Soon you will get more advice, I'm sure.",
