BI-RADS 4. My doctor called me with the results and refered me to a surgeon.  well all the while i thought i knew exactly where this lump was i can see it and even more i had thought it got smaller.  i had my appoinment with the surgeon yeasterday and she examined me, and i felt so silly i told her i knew where the lump was and showed her.  well she said that wasnt it, that what i felt was a swollen lymph node and that my lump was near my nipple.  well i feel like a dummy because clearly i had no clue how big 3 cm was.  we set up a ultrasound guided core biopsy with a clip placement next thursday.  my question is, is it bad that i have a swollen lymph node along with my lump? thank you i appreciate any insight i  can get.  sorry my grammar is so bad. - samantha Log in to post a reply",
