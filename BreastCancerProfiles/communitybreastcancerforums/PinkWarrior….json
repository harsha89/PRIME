I had the usual things: Then the \"fun\" started: A week after that I FINALLY got to start Radiation, One week in I started developing fever again and my breast was still red from cellulitis, so I went back to the hospital for 3 days and after meeting with several specialists, including the CDC, they didn't think I had Cellulitis again but was burned from the rads. They took me off both antibiotics I was on and had been on for about 3 months. I developed nausea right away and felt sick after treatment everyday. Talked to Oncologist and she gave me Zofran and I was still having random fevers, so she told me take Tylenol as well. This worked great. I'm now in my 5th week of Rads and I've developed diarrhea. I can't find anywhere where people have reported this but I know it can't be a coincidence. My breast is blood red and my scars are so sore. June 15th is my last day and I'm really not sure what to expect after this. I know I will be taking Arimidex for 5 years and don't much about it. I hope my life will start to resemble something normal. I have maintained a positive attitude through all of this and I thank God everyday for his mercy. I have found many silver linings from all of this: I look forward to reading these posts, because I'm really looking forward to reading the \"after\" parts :)",

      "Content": "Feb 7, 2017 02:33PM - edited Feb 7, 2017 02:46PM by PinkWarriorPrincess  I actually just read an article that gave quite a bit of information about what medications to avoid. NSAIDS cause the capillaries to drain quicker and overload the lymphatic system creating more swelling in patience with lymphedema. No one has told me this!!! I'm so upset because I switched from Tylenol and Percocet since my reconstruction surgery back to ibuprofen and now my right upper trunk is full of fluid. Pass along information to everyone. .lymphnet.org/membersOnly/dl/reprint/Vol_24/Vol_24-N4_Drugs_LE.pdf",
