    "Content": "floridagal wrote: Two weeks ago-diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma. Pretty scared. Terror is a more adequate word. On Medicare so I can go anywhere that accepts assignment. Seriously considering M.D. Anderson. But which surgical oncologist should I ask to see? They all have excellent training I am sure but I hesitate not asking for a specific surgical oncologist...it would seem to me that to ask for a specific doctor would indicate that you researched the various physicians and decided to request a certain physician based on your research. So this is part of my research. Does anyone have any input as to which doctor to request? Perhaps I won't have a choice and they just assign you? I really don't know. Any help is so appreciated.
