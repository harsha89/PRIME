You have a few things on your side.  You are young.  Also, one thing that I kept being reminded of when I went through this 11 months ago, is that 80% of these things are benign.  That's a huge percent.  I was convinced that I was going to fall in that 20% that was going to be cancer, but I didn't. My lump did not show up on the mammogram, but it did show up on the ultrasound.  The breast surgeon (who did the ultrasound) said immediately that it had to come out.  I was in total agreement, and, in fact, that is what I wanted to happen.  As ladies on this site told me they won't know for sure if it is cancer until they can see the cells under a microscope.  Until you have a biopsy of some kind, they won't know for sure what's going on. I had an excisional biopsy, which is also called a lumpectomy, where they remove the entire lump.  It was NO BIG DEAL!!!  They knocked me out, and I woke up to an incision of about an inch and a half.  It was tender if I bumped it for a few weeks, but it was no big deal. Sometimes they can do needle biopsies.  There are lots of ways they can do biopsies.  Trust your doctors.  It sounds like they are taking good care of you. Hang in there. Shonda",

I can not even begin to imagine what you are going through right now.  Just know that there are a lot of people praying for you and Diane. Several years ago, this poem made the e-mail rounds.  It touched a lot of hearts.  Maybe it will touch yours... The Dash I read of a man who stood to speak at the funeral of a friend He referred to the dates on her tombstone from the beginning to the end. He noted that first came the date of her birth and spoke of the following date with tears, But he said what mattered most of all was the dash between those years. For that dash represents all the time that she spent alive on earth... And now only those who loved her know what that little line is worth. For it matters not, how much we own; the cars...the house...the cash What matters is how we live and love and how we spend our dash. So think about this long and hard...are there things you'd like to change? For you never know how much time is left. (You could be at \"dash-mid-range\") IF we could just slow down enough to consider what's true and real, And always try to understand the way other people feel. And be less quick to anger, and show appreciation more, And love the people in our lives like we've never loved before. If we treat each other with respect and more often wear a smile... Remembering that this special dash might only last a little while. So when your eulogy's being read with your life's actions to rehash... Would you be proud of the things they say about how you spent your dash? I can tell from your posts that your wife's \"dash\" has been one of great love and devotion to her husband and family.  I think you spoke of her coaching volleyball, so I assume she was a teacher.  As a teacher,  I know of the self-giving dedication it takes to be successful.  I'm sure she was loved by all she touched. Hang in there.  God is there right beside you, holding you both in the palm of His hand.  He is about to welcome Diane home.  Trust in the Lord. Shonda",
