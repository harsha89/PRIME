I feel like such a baby whining about needles when most of you have had so much done to you with chemo and surgery... thank you for your compassionate words, they mean so much. I'm trying not to obsess the next five days. Keeping myself busy with my Bible studies and house work and other projects..... oh and comedies. I was my mother in law's caregiver when she was battling ovarian cancer, her greatest way to deal with the pain and anxiety was comedy.... I'm yammering now. I took something for my anxiety and I'm watching 'The Wedding Date'. I'll write when I know more. I still can't stop thanking you.... your words, all of you, mean so much. ",

Probably since he got the ball rolling right away, meaning I have a mammogram and ultrasound today and immediate follow up on Friday, he's also contacted my surgeon from my lumpectomy (benign) in 05. These symptoms are so much different than the ones in 05... swelling, itching, and it 'feels' like something's wrong. Dr. also requested CBC labs today. This probably sounds really babyish, but the breast cancer I can probably handle, beat in fact... but the prospect of all the IV's and needles is scaring the crap out of me. I know I'll have a great support system, it's the pain I am afraid of, and the needles. Sigh....  Log in to post a reply",
