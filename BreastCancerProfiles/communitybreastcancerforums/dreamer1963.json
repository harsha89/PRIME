I am 45 Y/O who went to screening mammogram appt on 11/23/08. 1 week later, call from GP's Nurse,telling me I needed Diagnostic Mammo and possibly Ultra sound to clarify Asymmetrical Density in left breast. She said my GP just thought it was Asymmetrical Density, and don't worry about it! (Sure!) After several days of calls to Insurance Co, we finally got it scheduled, but at a different location, because Insurance Co would not pay for another Mammo at outpatient center. I picked up Mammogram records and took them to the new breast center so they could schedule appt. Of course, I looked at them! I saw extreme noticeable density in left upper quadrant of breast, nothing, no density at all on right breast. I spent a week researching images online of density, and of course, everything associated with it. Now, in the last week, the left breast feels really full on the left side and really tender to the touch, it may be coming from me constantly searching my breast on that side. The only history of bc in my mother's family is my mom's 1st cousin, she is a 4 yr survivor. However, I never knew my dad, he left when I was a baby, but this past summer, my sister met with him to get family history and we found out his mother and grandmother are bc survivors. So that would be my paternal grandmother and great-grandmother.   I am about to worry myself sick about this, as well as my husband. I have been sleeping only 3-4 hours each night. Then I feel guilty about being so petty about all of this worry, when I read all the info on the members here. So many of you have much greater worries than I have and you are all confronting your issues with such strength. I admire everyone who has ever been diagnosed with a life threatening disease. I just hope I can draw from some of your strengths to get me through the next few days until Christmas Eve when I go to diag. mammo.         Log in to post a reply",

Doctor wanted to be extremely sure of how both looked since they are so different. Great news, left breast has cyst only, actually it was 2cm large and she found another cyst in the same breast, both are fluid filled, no problem. The right breast was completely clean! Doc said if the cyst gets much bigger, or it becomes very painful, she would drain it, but at this point, she did not think it needed to be drained. She did recommend genetics apt for first of the year, they will call me with date of apt. I am so relieved now, when I walked into the mammo room, I thought I was going to have a panic attack from the anxiety, but I just told myself that what will be, will be. I then thought of the supporters on this site.   The support means so much, I just wish with all my heart that everyone here could get great report like I did. I will keep everyone in my thoughts and prayers. Merry Christmas! ",

I have been trying to stay busy since yesterday. I visited a couple of retired, widow ladies on my street, taking them a few Christmas snacks. The short visits turned into half the day, they love to talk and show off their family pics.  We had a nice visit, as always. It was a great way to get my mind off my breasts! I think I just got so upset since the density was only in one breast, with no density at all in the right breast. The more I read online, the more I began to imagine the worst. It is wonderful to have all of this info at our fingertips online, but sometimes I think we have too much info available! I am planning on visiting my grandmother tomorrow, helping her cook sweets for the Christmas holiday. We will have to take a break to watch her favorite show, The Price Is Right, I haven't seen that one since Bob Barker left the show. That should take most of the day. We will not be talking of my test scheduled for the next day since I have not told her or my mother yet, I am waiting until I know something is confirmed, positive or negative. I did not want them worrying during the holidays. My grandfather died just a few years ago of Parkinson's, and I lost a cousin to Non-Hodgkins lymphoma, so my grandmother still has a tough time getting through the holidays. I definitely did not want to add to her struggles. So, we will watch tv, cook, bake, decorate, and eat! Thank you again for the encouragement, I will post details of my appointment Wednesday.",
