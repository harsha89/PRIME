So, I made the decision to do a bi-lat with immediate recon.  Recon on the radiated side is much more invloved. Preferred methods are to use some sort of flap procedure. In my case, lat flap is best because I am rather thin.  I do not regret doing lumpectomy and radiation nine years ago. Unless there is extensive invlovement, lumpectomy and radiation is standard of care as far as I know. Most of what I read on the recon forum is positive regarding the flap procedures. So if you ever have to do it, it can be done.  Mine is scheduled for October 8th. Best wishes.",

I did lumpectomy with rads on the left nine years ago.  Now I have bc on the right.  Although highly recommended, I declined radiation for two reasons. One, the radiation waiting room is a very sad place to be.  While my prognosis is excellent, others there are fighting for their lives.  I felt guilty and sad. Guilty because I had a chance to live and sad because I could not help them.  The second reason is because I have breast implants. The radiation caused severe capsular contracture on the left.  I had the implants replaced but my cosmetic result in my opionion is poor.  I have been living with these water balloons for nine years and I HATE IT. Having radiation on the right is going to cause even worse cosmetic consequences. I have been told many times that the reoccurance rate without radiation is 40 percent. I agree that is high.  But there is a 60 percent chance that I won't get it back. I have not had the nodes evaluated yet.  That happens in three weeks.  Positive nodes would make me reconsider my decision. But as of now, no radiation for me. We all can make our own decisions.",
