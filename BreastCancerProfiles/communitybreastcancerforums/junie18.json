My breasts are quite dense and my age is 67. I haven't been back to Mayo since 2003 prior the this appointment  mainly because of location.  While there the Doctor examined me and sent me to radiology.  I bought my films with me and was surprised to find out they pulled my mammo from 2003 from  the archives!  There didn't seem to be much of a change , but I still wasn't satisfied with the difference in my breast.  I had an ultrasound the next day and was assured everything looked normal and yes the left breast was larger but attributed it age etc.  Being me I pushed for more and that is when we discussed the MBI and was scheduled to do the procedure, however my dad was very ill and getting worse so I canceled.  I am going to make another appointment tomorrow and return.  The cost is around 400 dollars out of pocket as insurance companies  aren't onboard. Since then I have felt a small lump with tenderness on the left breast close to the chest wall.   ",
