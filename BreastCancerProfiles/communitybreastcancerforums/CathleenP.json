I too have mets to the bone and spine, and have some involvement--the painful kind--with the kidneys. But, as our friends on this chain have said, it's not over. You can live for a long time as a Stage IV. And, you can have a high quality of life. I recommend antidepresants and something for sleep like Ambien. I can get through most every bad news day without falling to my knees. You also don't seem to have a supportive care group. Fire them and move on to another team. I have learned that the breast cancer patient is in charge of her life--you make the decisions, you are the CEO of your situation. I don't know where you live, but with your background, you should be able to call on the big guns in bc oncology and get some excellent referrals. Taking charge may be difficult at first with all the emotional stuff swirling in your brain, but start with the antidepressants, get some sleep, and then make some phone calls. You will start feeling better almost immediately because you've given yourself some power. We're all here to support you. Take care, Cathleen",

Does anyone else get bruised easily (sometimes for no explicable reason, unless I'm punching myself at night)? Also, when I bruise those marks stick around for weeks.

The best thing you can do for all of us is to live another day, and another one, and....I personally love the SGK organization. I love the day of the Race for the Cure--everyone in DC is in a good mood; the Metro is full of pink and white T-shirts, and a lot of buzz. The city blossoms on that day with hope and support. It's one of my very favorite days. If you have ever wondered what it feels like to go for a walk with 80,000 people who are all in your corner, come to DC on June 6.",

Sometimes all you have to do is \"ask for help.\" I am thinking of you and wishing our society wasn't so health care-stupid. Who is their right minds votes against hope for cancer patients?

Now it's on the list of possible side effects. Weird. Yes, even though I am Her-; I may be eligible for the F/L trial. I hope so. I never did well on AIs, that's the other trial, so Femara and Avastin doesn't sound as easy to me. Hope you are enjoying your long weekend! Cathleen",
