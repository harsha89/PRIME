I felt the lump in a self exam, had many diagnostic tests done and finally wanted to have a lumpectomy, but the Doctor wouldn't hear of it... Anyways, the surgery is over now. And I'm home now with a drain attached for the next few days/weeks. And many painkillers. Today is Day 5. My histopathology report should be ready by Monday. I'm hoping that that there is not much axilliary lymph node metastases. I will also know my stage then. And the treatment plan.",

My oncoplastic surgeon recommended chemotherapy followed by tamoxifen. However, my medical oncologist looking at my Ki-67 and hormone receptor status suggested that I take tamoxifen religiously but chemo for me offered minimal benefits. So I chose to forego it. Time will only tell if I made a good decision... Meanwhile, I'm recovering from the surgery. My range of motion is back by about 90%. Though I always feel like something is in there/moving under the arm when I lift it up. Also the surgical site is still numb and causes discomfort I can't stand to touch it. How are you all recovering? It gives me great comfort to know how everyone here comes out to tell their story, and offer guidance and support wherever needed. Good luck and best wishes to all.",
