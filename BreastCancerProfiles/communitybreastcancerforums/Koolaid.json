    "Content": "Koolaid wrote: I had a bilateral mastectomy on August 8th, 2017 for HER2+. I was given Taxol and Herceptin for the cancer. I started the treatments 1 week after my surgery. November 2017 I was hospitalized with blood clots in my lungs. I don't remember going to the hospital or being admitted for a week. When I came home I was so weak I could hardly hold my head up. I informed my oncologist I was stopping chemotherapy and Herceptin. Here it is August 2018 and I still don't have my energy back like I had before chemotherapy. I have Graves Disease which is a autoimmune disease and had to have my thyroid surgically removed 18 years ago. I was reading some of the posts and I was just wondering if anyone is still having fatigue this far out. Some of the things I have read said it could take quite awhile to recover and to feel better (I'm sure no where what I did). Log in to post a reply",
