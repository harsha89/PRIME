The procedure is not medieval at all. Yes, you do lie down on a table and insert your breast into an opening. There are paddles which are used to keep your breast from moving. The hardest part for me was to lie flat and keep my head to one side. Because I had two different lesions (multifocal), the procedure had to be performed twice. I was given the option to get up in between procedures because my neck was quite stiff. This must be a common side effect because I wanted to get it over with and they suggested I get up and have something to drink or just take a \"break\" from lying in that position. It helped a lot.  I regret that I did not ask for a mild sedative before the procedure. I didn't think about it until it was too late to ask. I sometimes use Ambien to help me sleep on the nights before I work (part time as a dental hygienist). So I took 1/4 of a tab (2.5mg) just to calm me and it worked. I told them this so that if I fell asleep, they would know why, but I didn't. So maybe you should ask for something. Actually, it gave me the wisdom to know to ask for a script to calm me before being prepped for a Sentinel Node Biospy.  The stereotactic biopsy sounds a little bit like a sewing machine. A small incision is made in your breast. The radiologist knows where to make this incision because there are two radiography machines aimed at the breast at 15 degree angles. Where they bisect, is where the radiologist uses it as a guide to the lesion and hence a guide to where to make the incision. You will feel a mild pinch from the local anesthesia and then you will be numb. The biopsy instrument, which is the diameter of a pencil is then inserted into the small incision. The radiologist will use the radiography machines to guide the tip of the instrument to the lesion. Then there is another injection of anesthesia. I was told that the tip opens and a small blade comes out and takes tiny ribbon-like samples of the lesion. They need at least 8-10. You will not feel any of this. The procedure is then basically over. A small titanium \"marker\" was left at the biopsy sites for the radiologists and the surgeon. I did bleed a lot afterward and it made it a bit difficult for the technician to take the follow-up mammograms to make sure they had gotten all of the microcalcifications. I was not sore afterwards and I went to work the next day. However, my breast was all black and blue. It looked bad but still no pain. I understand that this type of biopsy is superior to surgical biopsies since there is a small incision compared to a surgical one. Do not be afraid. Just ask for \"something\" to calm your nerves. If I didn't have the Ambien, I would have just had an adult beverage. My husband was driving so it would not have been a problem in any case. I hope this helps. ",
