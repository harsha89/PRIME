Even people on these boards who have had issues with SE say it is like the flu.  You aren't going to die.  Best of luck to you.  There are many people who went through this alone.",

They make fantastic products now for curly hair to look nice curly, or to straighten and smooth.

The facial hair is a little disturbing, so I'm cutting back on the biotin.  It's not like I should shave or anything, but still!  Maybe I just got used to being hairless.  Sunflower, I have to say I was in hysterics reading about your pirate look!!  Sorry about the ingrown lash, that must have hurt.  On Taxol I would get tiny styes and my eyes were very watery. I probably rubbed all my lashes out. For those of you considering henna, if you ever want to use chemical dyes again, I believe you have to let the henna treated hair grow out and get it cut off.   Right now I am hoping for any bit of length at all, and don't want to lose any of it!!  I got Natural Instincts semi permanent color to try this weekend.  I don't have enough hair to justify a trip to the salon, and this stuff evidently washes out after 28 shampoos.  Hopefully I won't look like Ronald McDonald.",

I used to dry my hair using a round brush, then I used a flatiron.  Get a good one (sedu, fhi) that gets nice and hot, and you can beat the humidity.  Use a barrier product like the Redken liquid silk stuff to protect your hair, or you can burn it easily.  I have a dryer that has a round brush attached to it.  I'm thinking if you can figure out what I'm talking about, that might be a good tool for you curly haired girls to try.  If you are embracing your curls, try Curls Rock products in turquoise bottles.    On another positive hair note, I cut myself shaving my legs today, LOL!  What memories!!!  Hurt like hell, but at least I'm growing hair!",

I got a whole full size set with day and night cream, cleanser, and eye cream on eBay for about $50 to try it out.  When it's gone I'll probably switch to Lancome.  I got some small sizes as a bonus when buying other stuff, and I like the fragrance better.  Of course it is probably 3x the price.  I got spoiled with the LGFB cosmetics. I think the worst part is the eyebrows.  I've gotten good at drawing them on, and thanks to Biotin (i think!) mine are now growing back, but the pigment in them is taking time.  My lashes definitely grew better, and they're definitely longer than 1/4\" now.  Oddly enough the last of my arm hair was gone about 2 weeks ago.",

I color it with Revlon Colorsoft (cheap and it lasts...I am not blonde and can't justify a $$$ salon color yet). It isn't even close to the hair I had, but it looks like I might have chosen this style. People compliment me on it, but it is still too short for my taste.  The best thing I can say, is when I ride my Harley it doesn't get tangled up.  That is a win.",

I had terrible migranes as a kid, and I swear they went away after i started birth control pills or maybe smoking pot.  I have done neither in recent history because pot just makes me stupid, and i had my tubes tied 19 years ago.  2 dear friends SWEAR by acupuncture (one for migranes), so I've been doing it before chemo treatments.  Something has clearly worked.  My only SE is weepy eyes, and of course baldness, but my therapist says hair grows back faster with continued acupuncture.  Anyway, you may want to consider that for your headaches and also to help control your SE.  It doesn't hurt, and you leave feeling very relaxed.   The hardest part for me has been the unknown.  I did the BLM because BC runs in my family (turns out i am BRCA1 and 2 negative), but even though this has not been an ordeal for me, I definitely don't want to go through it again.  My cousin had the lumpectomy and a couple of revisions.  You still lose the hair, and you have rads to deal with too.  With the Mx you don't have rads and that was part of my decision.  I just want to get this over with.  I have no breast tissue left, so in my mind, there's little chance of it coming back (Dr said 98% chance of NOT coming back, but it could show up in the incisions - that beats the sh!t of having a whole other boob for it to fester in). Beat of luck to you.  It really isn't that bad, but I do have a MS Project Plan with my end date, and I am now 54% complete!!!!  I probably have Scarlett O'Hara Syndrome, but I try not to read negative posts, I KNOW I will beat this, and I truly believe tomorrow will be a better day.  Expect the best and you sometimes get it.  Expect the worst and you get what you expect.",

Emend works wonders.  I felt queasy a few times, but was never really sick.  If you are sick, call your oncologist, and s/he can give you something else.  There is no reason to be sick anymore.   Best of luck to you!!  You can and will get through this! ",

For me, the BLM was an absolute breeze.  I was shocked.  Part of the reason is when they remove all the breast tissue, they also cut the nerves, so there really isn't a lot of pain.  I had nipple sparing on one side and skin sparing on the other, so I'm missing a nipple for now.  Immediately post-op, by boobs didn't look half as bad as I thought they would.  I had my first TE fill yesterday, and that didn't hurt at all.  Had a date last night (with the big reveal!) and it went really well! BLM was right for me, but I'm not the expert a lot of the ladies here are.  DCIS is usually localized, right?  If you decide to go the BLM route, I hope my experience gives you some comfort and insight.   Yes, the whole process is frightening and unfair.  I have a goal to be done with my treatment and reconstruction by the end of May, which my Drs think is doable.  I see the oncologist tomorrow and will find out when I start chemo.  Try to keep a positive attitude.  If you expect the worst, that's what you get. Best of luck, and let me know what you decide! Dawn ",
