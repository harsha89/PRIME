      "Content": "Apr 3, 2019 10:29AM - edited Apr 3, 2019 10:30AM by skitzblitz hi all! Well here comes a newbie. I'm joining the halaven group for what I hope is a long damned time. Don't we all! Here is my brief history. I just had my 3 year cancerversary march 25. Isn't that something to celebrate! I'm er+ pr - and her2 -. I started on ibrance/ femara and got a good 18 months till whamo, liver mets. I tried a short bit of Xeloda and then abraxane and neither did all that much. I just completed 7 rounds of ac chemo and have about 7% heart damage from it. Some of my liver mets shrunk and some grew a bit. This leads me to halaven. I had my first dose today. It was a small Iv bag full. Does anyone else get it that way? I also had premeds for nausea only. I started l-glutamine for the neuropathy on Sunday. I also had my Lupron shot today. So far I'd say i have waves of tired, I feel great, tired I feel good. Liver all of a sudden feels achey a bit. I had two spells in different spots where I felt like a needle was just poking away at me. I am sure I'll get the stupid mouth sores bc I did on ac every stinking time. I had two weeks off chemo from ac to halaven. My daughter was on spring break so we went to Colorado to see my son. My tumor marker, ca27.29, were 44 when I left and 47 today. Not to bad compared to some I've seen here. Of course the break raised all my liver bloodwork as well, ast, alp, alt. I did expect that. Grr I am hoping for more side effects! Who hopes that right? I have read that it seems chemo is working when you have side effects. I know it's early and any input on that would be good. Any other tips or info from anyone? I started from page one of this thread on vaca so kept leaving and only am to page 61 so far. Thanks so much, SarAh",

      "Content": "Apr 13, 2019 04:02AM - edited Apr 13, 2019 01:16PM by skitzblitz pajim- so I looked over bloodwork again. I had high baso% but then normal baso# but i see basost we're present in blood. I'm confused now more than I was, lol. I also looked back and my basos% was high when I was on ac chemo. Maybe I'm justnervous for nothing, I hope so. Wandering- I have no idea why my dr does not like any of the white blood cell stimulation shots. He feels the body should do that on its own. My first week of ac chemo my white blood cell count went deathly low and he wouldn't give me shots. I sat in the hospital for a week waiting for numbers to come up. Finally a different doctor did give me shots bc he said I'd never get out of there if I didn't! I guess he prob has a good reason and should ask again why he is so against them. Has anyone done halaven every other week? I'd like to stay full dose so maybe this would help my counts recover doing it that way? Well, I'll find out tues why the mystery blood draw? I normally go to have PICC line flushed and bandage changed but they called and said they were adding a blood test, the doctor wants to check my numbers. Have a good weekend Sarah",

      "Content": "Apr 7, 2019 05:32AM - edited Apr 8, 2019 01:45PM by skitzblitz hi all, hope everyone is doing well. I do not get steroids with halaven but did with ac. I'm not normal bc they didn't keep me awake at all! Steroid really made me groggy feeling. So i had first treatment tues of round one. First day I felt good. Second day, so so. Third day just blah. Nothing major. Fourth day, hello side effects! My back aches and had a slight burn. My feet burn like no other! I don't get this one. I had the issue with ac chemo but really no neuropathy with ac. It seems to go hand in hand with what I eat. If it has any slightly spiciness to it, these feet burn over night. Last night I wanted to go outside and stand on a cold sidewalk they were so bad. I bought l-glutamine powder and do feel that it must help. I drank a glass, ick, today. Tonight we had tacos and feet have a slight burn only. My back hurt yet today and my legs wereweek both days. Climbing steps or carrying something heavy kills my legs. I do not Taste anything. I could sense spicy food or sour candy but without taste. This is a new one for me too. Does that seem to go away before next treatment? Does anyone know of anything to take to help taste buds? If I sit around I'm ok. The longer I'm up doing things the more I ache. I'm not tired, no nausea, I have an appetite so glad for all of those. It will be interesting to see what happens to my hair. Of course it's gone from ac chemo. I always had a real small fuzz the whole time but side never grew really. I had a two week break between chemos so started to really fill in. I had a dirty blonde color naturally and it is now black. My daughter gives me crap calling it unicorn hair bc I have a real thick dark patch that grows at the front of hairline. Gee thanks! So I did start b6 and did take it with Xeloda and that and urea cream kept my feet pretty good. I do think, as said before here, keep up with l-glutamine. It just taste horrible in water! Dose 2 on tues, it should be interesting! Finally nice weather in Iowa! Going to the Amana colonies tomorrow for an awesome brunch buffet, that I prob can't taste. Taking my old Jeep Wrangler for our joy ride. Happy Sunday all! Do something enjoyable today! Sarah",

Does anyone get bumps? I got them on my neck after the first dose. Now round two, second dose I have them on my arm. Not red and not a rash. They don't hurt at all just small bumps. Ones on neck are still there and lots of lotion makes them smaller but when that wears off they are back. Lots of back pain and dry eyes after this dose. Still doing ok on the hair. It was growing back some so hard to tell if it is thinning. I don't think so bc I don't see any on clothes and it is black hair. Sarah",

I am very Achey but some days I\u2019m busy and that seems to set it off. I was on xgeva every four weeks but when I switched to halaven he switched me to every six weeks for the shot. I have been on it three years now though. I man also not going to get Lupron any longer. Not sure if it\u2019s wearing off and making me Achey or not. I\u2019ll ask about it tomorrow.

Since the numbers are up and i didn't get both doses the first round he said he wanted to check to be sure. After that I prob won't have another scan till numbers jump again. My ca27.29 was up as well. They called me late today which is odd. I normally know that before I leave the office. I asked about why I'm so damned achey and he said it could be from coming off the Lupron. I had that thought as well but wasn't sure. Between no Lupron and xgeva every six weeks inflammation could also be a reason my numbers are up. I have heard that before. Time will tell but I'm just not freaking out about it yet or four weeks until scam will feel like 6 months. I think they should call u the night before and say \u201cscan tomorrow\" so u don't have to sit and worry worry worry. I'm lucky though I get results the same day. My doctor goes down himself to look at them with radiology and then radiology reads the mail further. Have a good night Sarah",

I think jfl did for the short time she was on halaven. I get some joint aches and back aches and tired into my week off. Red blood counts stay good but whites tank by end of the off week. I do get neulesta the day after the first treatment and it lasts for ten days in the system. I\u2019m tired off and on. The halaven itself is fast, almost to fart. They mix mine in a small bag with fluid and drips in for maybe 5 min. Chemo is like me time and I don\u2019t get any time now with this one! I\u2019m in and out. It takes longer for the bloodwork.

I also read that it works better in people under 60, who knows the statistics on that really? I\u2019d be happy with stable for quite some time. This dang liver, nothing shrinks the Mets.

I was bummed. But it wasn\u2019t me! So I was off ac chemo two weeks, had one dose of halaven and off two more weeks. All my liver bloodwork was down some. Then came my tumor markers, they were down one number. I was shocked bc with all the time off and one dose I really expected them to be up some more. I\u2019ll take the good news for once! I did find out why I seemed to be getting halaven different than mostly everyone. Most say they get a push. Mine is added to some saline and then given al mixed. Still short, maybe ten minutes. Feeling good so far. Sucky neulesta tomorrow. I learned today that it stays in your system ten days and will take me through the day 8 infusion. It will hopefully keep my whites up enough. I\u2019m not sure what I was actually getting with ac but know i wasn\u2019t approved for neulesta. I\u2019m fearing the bone pain now with this. We shall see how this week goes. I\u2019ll keep you updated!  Sarah",

Neither of has told his mom, my grandma about our cancer. She is 99 now and worries about everything way to much. We didn\u2019t want her to have to suffer.

I did abraxane and it tanked all my blood cell counts. I had two bags of blood in one day. About five weeks later I started ac combo and day seven after the treatment I was in the hospital for low red and white blood cell counts. I did get another two bags of blood and a bag of platelets. Tomorrow will again be 7 days after my second ac treatment and when I get up I get short of breath and cough. I had the same deal with ice in the hospital. I hate ice and cold water too. All I wanted were cups of ice to suck on. I see odd cravings is on the side effects list like wanting to eat dirt, ice or clayso I'm glad I just want ice, lol! Transfusions are easy Peasy but just take long by the time they match it and check it. It's better to do lab the day before you go for the transfusion bc then the blood is there and stored and ready. Glad Doxil is going pretty well for you. I follow along with you since I'm on ac and look at Doxil as an option. Good luck and I know you will feel better afterwards.  Sarah ",

I do think they will read it before they actually see you and if it was any concern call you. Also does your blood work reflect any changes? If my ast alp and alt are higher than past appt. it is an alert there is something going on. I do not trust and have lost all trust in radiologist. I went for a cat scan and I got results the same day. My oncologist seems to read them before my full report. This new scan compared to past one of mine showed liver progression and then all of a sudden the doctor got a call and left. He came back and said well now they see a spot in your femur. I'll have to refer you to Iowa city and most likely a hip replacement. I was devestated, all this in one day. I really didn't care To do anything. So off to Iowa city I went for a second opinion and to check for trials. They had no answers for me bi to see a bone doctor who specialized in cancer. Off I go to him. He point blank asked me what made me come to him? I said both doctors I go to sent me. He tells me the spots/mets have been there since my first scan and are either inactive or no change. To me this tells me the radiologist did not read my past scans to compare, just the one prior to this. As far as I'm concerned the second set of oncologist should have caught this in Iowa city when going over everything. I felt stupid I had gone that far to a specialist. I don't trust either oncologist or radiologist to now read my scan appropriately. How do I know if they know dead mets from active? It's all a guessing game I think. What about northwestern for a second opinion, in Chicago. My uncle has nothing but great to say about them there for his cancer. Good to get your foot in the door there for trials as well. Sarah",

There is a doctor in town doing a trial at the local college about cancer and exercise. He has 60 enrolled and wants 80 people. The theory is it to keep exercisingto move the chemo through the body and helps it work better as well. I'm going to try as best I can to do something each day. Thanks again I'll keep posting!

I did abraxane and it tanked all my blood cell counts. I had two bags of blood in one day. About five weeks later I started ac combo and day seven after the treatment I was in the hospital for low red and white blood cell counts. I did get another two bags of blood and a bag of platelets. Tomorrow will again be 7 days after my second ac treatment and when I get up I get short of breath and cough. I had the same deal with ice in the hospital. I hate ice and cold water too. All I wanted were cups of ice to suck on. I see odd cravings is on the side effects list like wanting to eat dirt, mud or charcoal so I\u2019m glad I just want ice, lol! Transfusions are easy Peasy but just take long by the time they match it and check it. It\u2019s better to do lab the day before you go for the transfusion bc then the blood is there and stored and ready. Glad Doxil is going pretty well for you. I follow along with you since I\u2019m on ac and look at Doxil as an option. Good luck and I know you will feel better afterwards.  Sara ",

Are your still on ibrance? Gives me some relief. I feel it's working then I get all nervous when you think something is working and have a scan and it's not. At my point in this getting ride of any will help me!  Thanks for the reply! Sarah",

It seems like every time I have an extra break or week off chemo, even time between them, I have odd aches and pains. I sometimes wonder if chemo is just masking the aches and they surface when we are off them for a bit. I\u2019ve been more miserable and achey off chemo than on. I almost hate time off bc of this. It\u2019s so odd that even in the same chemo I have different aches each round. Just a thought. Grannax- before each dose of Xeloda, both morning and night, I took emetrol for nausea. It\u2019s over the counter and was once a prescription. I swear by it and use it still when I need it. I never missed it with Xeloda and had no problems. I started it the same time as my pills. I\u2019d take a dose of it wait ten min then eat and then take the pills. I also took a pill waited ten min and took the other one. I thought it would Be easier on my stomach doing that. 5fu chemo is the same and given over time so I didn\u2019t find any harm doing this. My doctor agreed as well. Sarah",

I myself was getting to the point my liver was so bad the doctors wanted to give me the end of life talk and one said I might be better off letting it ride instead going through more and more. I said well I just don\u2019t feel that bad! I\u2019m still fighting, what\u2019s next? I did go on a/c chemo and it has been a rough ride. A few times my mind wandered towards what my doctor had said. I might be better just living out life. I have blood transfusions and spent a week in the hospital with this. I am seeing the light and glimpse of hope. My tumor markers and liver blood work is going down. Look into a/c or doxil for some options. They are strong ones. I hope you start feeling better soon.

Someone once posted all their blood mArkers from a computer screen on the Xeloda thread. Was it blondie or jfl? They were on Xeloda quite some time and numbers were all over. High low high low.

I do think everyone\u2019s has the right to get all of their scans put onto a cd. I\u2019m not sure how much you can read or see on your own computer though. I took a copy of mine with me to mayo for my second opinion and was hoping to get it back but they kept it. My landlord reads scans and he said he woul read mine for me. He seems to be the one they call for second opinions. I need to get that done. I was so interested in y90 after this ac chemo, depending on what is left in the liver. It isn\u2019t sounding real good though and that\u2019s a shame! I feel I have agressive liver mets and will need to keep after them no matter what! Since it went to my liver, nothing yet has shrunk the mets. I know taxol is used a lot after ac chemo but since I have already failed abraxane I wonder if that would work? Anyone try both and one worked and other not? Kattysmith I wish your trial was closer to Iowa it does sound good! My liver numbers in bloodwork have been reliable as well as tumor markers as far as progression. The doctors act like they are high sometimes but from some I\u2019ve seen on here all my numbers are low, above normal, compared to some. I\u2019m ramping up my scanxiety! I told myself I know this chemo is working and I\u2019m sure it is slowly working bc markers are going down slowly but still above normal range. It seems though stuff works the first few treatments then fails me. I had odd sharp pains in my liver area after the last round. I then felt a lot better. I don\u2019t feel my liver is as hard and pronounced either. I\u2019m skinny and even skinnier now so can feel it easy. If this is working I\u2019d have two more rounds of ac and then maybe more or move on. I\u2019m just neeed tohave my next step ready. I\u2019m in need of a happy 2019! Let\u2019s all keep plugging away! Sarah",
