      "Content": "May 29, 2012 07:17PM gamma wrote: Hi everyone. Sorry for the delayed status report. Frankly I was a bit overwhelmed by the experience. Overall the hospital stay of 4 days was ok. great care the first 24 hours and then I felt like I was on my own which included getting to the bathroom on my own for the first time after the catheter was removed. It' amazing what you can do if you're pissed enough. Lol. So it was not surprising that I was happy to be discharged on Friday night. One of my biggest challenges is coping with 8 drains. I preordered pink pockets in advance and while the concept is good, the adhesive stays on the garment when you attempt to remove the pocket. I've tried pinning four drains to one of two lanyards but that's also uncomfortable especially when you are upright and trying to wash you face, brush your teeth or simply use the toilet. Long story short, even though the drains are temporary there should be better options that actually work because even shirts with inside pockets are a waste because the pockets are so shallow. I wouldn't mind paying more for some extra material? As far as pain is concerned I expected the tram side to be more painful but it's the tissue expander side that's producing the most discomfort - really tight with underarm pain. While the tram side is less painful it' s concerning that it has developed a blood blister. PS says it's not that odd, but I have necrosis on the brain, so I can't help but worry. I had 3 drains removed today (7 days post surgery) and I think I'll lose another tomorrow. They aren't producing much so I'm hoping to be drain free within the next week. Can anyone comment on their level of exhaustion and back spasms which I'm using a heating pad for. Hope everyone else is doing well. My level of respect for you all has increased a million percent now that I'm in recovery mode.",
