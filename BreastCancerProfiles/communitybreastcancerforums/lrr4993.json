You also can specify amount of hair, baby hairs or not,layered or not, etc.  It feels like almost nothing on.  Much more comfortable than the cap wigs, although those do not bother me tremendously.  It is definitely less itchy, if that was a problem for you.  Also less tight (no elastic used to hold it on) and more light feeling.  It is literally hair sewn into a fine lace - almost as light as super sheer panty hose.  It took about 7 weeks to get it because of the special order.  Now that I think about it, I think that is why it was my second wig - I waited until too late the first time and had to go with a premade one.  By the time I got it my hair was just starting to grow . . a little stubble.  I stopped wearing it when my hair got to about 1 inch long because I was having a horrible time with the glue matting my hair at the temples.  The glue is the downside to me - I really did not like having to deal with it. But I did get pretty good at it after a few weeks.  I still wear it on occassion though.  It stays on better than the caps because the glue is really strong (I used the 1-3 day glue daily . . . there are glues that last for weeks but I never tried them). The other wigs I have had are the Jon Reneu \"isabella\" wig.  Human hair.  Gorgeous.  Is a cap, but is a relatively thin one.  It was my first wig.  I moved away from it because it started getting tight as my hair grew in and it was starting to thin a bit too much.  I recently wore it again and loved it so much (don't know why it felt more comfortable this time) that I just ordered a new one. I got tons of compliments from complete strangers on how pretty my hair was when I wore this.  And the nurses at my cancer center could not believe it was a wig.  They said it was the most natural wig they had ever seen and even wrote down the name to tell other patients about. I have also tried a raquel welch wig (current one until new one arrives) - can't remember the name of it right now.  another human hair one that I like mainly because it came styled the way I like and it has a bit of natural curl like my own hair.  But the hair quality is not nearly as good as the jon reneau.  Wig.com sells both and if you keep an eye on their site, they run 25% off special regularly.  These are expensive wigs, so that discount is significant.  The lace wig was considerably less than the other two, but still pretty pricey as I recall.  ",

Good luck with the wig shopping.  I hope you can find one you love.   In the meantime, I am going to check out the beautytrends website suggested by suzanne.  A good return policy is a rarity and would be nice! ",

The second time my onco actually ordered the titration to make sure I had no problems with getting it (she really worked hard to calm all my fears, even though she was not worried about it).  I don't know why, but I did react the second time.  I first noticed a general weird feeling - I cannot describe it any better than that.  I just felt weird.  I knew from reading here that the reaction causes breathing problems, so I tried to breathe in deeply once I noticed the weird feeling. . . my chest felt very full or tight with a deep breath.  I knew immediately what was happening and told my mom to get the nurse.  They turned off the drip immediately but not before I started having a pain in my back.  Then it went away.  The whole thing lasted maybe 1-2 minutes. It really was not horrible, although it scared the hell out of  my mom, who was not as prepared for it as I was.  I could breathe fine, I just could not take deep breaths.  The back pain was certainly noticeable, but not unbearable at all.  I would guess that it gets worse the longer you let it go, so call the nurse as soon as you notice it.  I read here to pinch the drip line while waiting for the nurse, although I did not think to do that at the time.   Some people get benadryl or something else when they have a reaction.  I did not.  They just started it slower and I was fine. The downside is that the slower infusion takes about twice a long to do.  Mine took anywhere from 2 - 3 hours depending on how much I pushed them up on the dosage when I got impatient. Good luck! ",

I don't even bother with the rain). A big part of controlling curly hair is keeping it long enough that it weighs itself down causing the curl to pull out a bit.

Best hair product I have tried so far is Fekkai Glossing creme. Sephora carries it. If you need something less expensive, pantene makes a good defrizzant - don't remember the name but it comes in a small glass bottle with a pump top. Pantene \"women of color\" shampoo/conditioner line is fabulous for moisturizing and softening curly hair. I also strongly recommend a good hairdryer. Chi hairdryers are the best in my experience. They are expensive, but provide a noticeable difference in smoothing the hair when drying with a round brush.",

The first comment he made was that it \"could be\" a fibroandenoma.  But it was \"a little atypical.\"  I wish I had asked what was atypical about it, but I didn't.  From my view (which is far from expert), the mass looked round in terms of the shape across the width.  There was definitely some height to it and it seemed mostly rounded, although it came to a slight point in the middle.    Kind of reminded me of a spinning top (like kids play with).  It looked smooth on the surface, although not perfectly so.  It was a solid color with no obvious variances.  The edges appear well-defined to me most of the time, but at certain angles seems to blur - not sure if that was the equipment or a characteristic of the mass.  Man, I really wish I had asked more questions. He then later said \"this is what we call a round cancer.\"  I took him to mean that is what they would call it if it is a cancer, not that he actually thinks it is, but I don't know now.  He seemed to genuinely not know what it is and even said all I know is it is a solid mass of something.  Before I left he said \"I am not saying you have cancer\" and told me not to get panicked.  But at that point I was the verge of losing it and I think he said it just to settle me down. My mom told me that she and her mother both have fibrocystic breasts.  My grandmother had a very large tumor when she was just one year older than I am that was benign.  I do have painful breasts with my period, which have been worse than usual in the last few months.  This lump seemed to appear out of nowhere right after my period (two months ago) and seemed to get larger after my most recent period - but I could be imagining it.  I am hoping that family history governs here and this is just a hormonal thing.  No real history of breast cancer in my family - just a great aunt who did not get it until she was 92, beat it and is pushing 100 now.  God love her - lol.  Anyway - any positive stores about atypical fibroadenomas out there? or fibrocystic masses that had to be biopsied?  I could use the hope.  I am nervous, weeping wreck and fear I will stay this way until results from my core biopsy which is not scheduled for another 10 days.  Lisa Dx 8/6/2010, IDC, Stage IB, Grade 3, 0/5 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Otherwise I will never make it through the next 2 weeks until the results come back.   Or I may go the xanex route!   For now, however, I am going to take two excedrin PM and hope for sleep.  I am sure part of my hysterics are attributable to sleep deprivation.  Good night! ",

I thought I felt stubble, but I cannot see it.  I did not lose my brows, but did have some thinning of them and they seem to be bushier lately too. Those random crazy brow hairs that you have to keep plucking are now re-appearing.  I did not miss dealing with those! Kittycat and Marie - I have had the same thoughts.  How bad was my hair before?  Why do I get so many compliments now?  I would say sympathy or pity, but the compliments mostly come from people who don't know I had cancer. I am sure the wig is going to be a challenge once my hair grows back in.  I look terrible with short hair.  I did one of those video hair analysis things in college where they put different hair styles on you to see how it looks.  Short was BAD.  This was also when I started coloring my hair because it showed me what a difference a shade lighter made in my complexion.  So, of course, I have now been coloring my hair for 20 years.  I am sure I am going to be shocked at how much grey I have once it all grows back.  Ugh!   ETA:  PS Marie - your hair looks very nice like that.  Very elegant.   ",

(2)   Frederick Fekkai makes a wonderful glossing creme.  I buy at sephora.com.  I have tried every straightener, defrizzer, gel, you name it that is made.  Nothing comes close to this.  It is not really a straightner, but with my prechemo hair, this plus a round brush resulted in gorgeous, shiny, unfrizzy hair, but with the volume and very soft curl that you can only get from curly hair dried with a round brush.  I miss my hair.  :(",

About the lymph node biopsy, as it was explained to me, they harvest the sentinel nodes during surgery and those are tested by a team in the operating room while the surgeon is removing the lump.  If those come back negative, then that is the end of the node removal.  If they come back positive, then they pull more for testing.  I was told that the results during surgery are about 95% reliable, meaning that only in 5% of cases do they later find positive nodes upon closer inspection.  And in those few cases, what they usually find is only microscopic cells, not tumors, which my doctor said would not be counted as a positive node for the purpose of staging. Good luck to you and your mom in this process.  If you have questions, this is a great place to come as many people here have been through it and are well-researched and informed. ",

By thurs I was afraid to do my usual styling of my naturally curling hair which involved blowing drying it out straight with a round brush.  I was worried the brush would pull out the hair, so I let it dry naturally . . . lots of curls.  By friday morning, I was pretty sure the next shampoo was going to result in enough hair loss that it would be noticeable so I decided not to wash it.  I was trying to hold out until the weekend to switch over to the wig.  I remember I was wearing this cowl neck sweater at work that day.  I kept feeling this kind of heavy feeling in it and I finally reached back and felt what it was - a lot of my hair had fallen out and had slid down and matted in the curl so there was this weird sort of clump of hair all along the bottom edge of my hair, resting in the cowl neck.  LOL.  I immediately went home for the day and took a shower.  It was so matted that I had to just cut it off - I could not get the knots out and the more I tried the more hair that came out. It is funny to think back on, although at the time I was bawling.",

About the nausea meds, I was given zofran and compazine at first.  I have read that they do not give emend at first because it is so expensive and some insurance companies will not pay for it unless the lesser drugs fail.  I do not do nauseua very well and was not willing to \"wait and see how I do\" as my onco's nurse insisted when I started to freak out the week before chemo about not having emend.  Probably overkill on my part, but I ended up calling my nurse navigator (not the onco nurse who always just said no) and told her to get me a px for emend by 5:00 that day or I was moving to another oncology group (I am in atlanta and had several choices; this may not work in a smaller community  :)  ).  I got my px.  I was told I was overmedicated but did not care.  I would rather have too much and never be sick.  I don't mean to scare you, but there is no way I would have been okay with what your doctor has given you.  ",

I did not feel a thing.  They numb you beforehand, so the only pain was the little prick from the needle for numbing. I did not realize they did this until I got to the hospital for the surgery.  I had spent most of my time worrying about pain from the dye injection, which I read was bad, but it turned out mine too was done while I was under anesthesia.  I am glad I did not know about this ahead of time. One tip - do not look down while they are doing it.  I looked down while she was checking imaging for proper placement.  There were two huge pieces (several inches long) of wire sticking out of my breast.  No blood or gore, but still creepy looking.     Good luck. I know everyone has different experiences, but I found the lumpectomy and SNB to be very easy.  If it had not been for the exhaustion from the anesthesia, I would have been back to work the next day.  I never even filled my px for painkillers - just needed a couple of advil for the first day after the surgery. ",

My question is this, if you cannot die from stage 1, how does it have a survival rate of anything less than 100%?  Are those stats for original stage 1 . . . in otherwords, 12% or less of stage 1 end up at stage iv?  Is that just other causes of death besides cancer?   I hope this question makes sense.    Just trying to figure out some of the literature and what it all means.

I just had to post.  I had the same \"its probably a cyst\" convo that was \"definitely not a cyst\" once we did an ultrasound.  Like you, before I even had a diagnosis I knew all about penguin cold caps.  LOL.  I even had my wig picked out before diagnosis!  I had similar looking hair - long, dark, naturally curly (yours looks like it anyway) that, although I have complained about it all my life, the thought of losing it just killed me.  Yes, that was my biggest concern - what will I do without hair and how am going to go to work or anywhere else like that.  I was a mess before and after diagnosis.  I cried more than I have ever cried in my life.  I am not quite as young as you but still on the young side for BC (I was diagnosed 2 weeks after my 40th bday) and it is such a hard blow.  I was just like you - very happy, things were going great, and boom - breast cancer.  Never saw that one coming.  WTF?! Everything you are feeling is very very normal.  I know it does not seem like it now, but believe me when I tell you it will get better.  I was told that when I was where you are and did not believe it, but it is true that this is the worst part.  I did a lumpectomy first, so my course of treatment was a bit different, but by the time I got to chemo, I was emotionally fairly solid.  Chemo turned out to be a breeze.  It really did.  The only time I missed from work was my infusion days.  I had only one \"bad\" day after each treatment which consisted of muscle aches and a lot of sleeping - like having the flu.  Otherwise, I was fine.   By far, the hair is the worst part.  I cried for hours when it fell out.  I remember thinking that night that I was going to hang sheets over all of the mirrors because I could not stand to look at myself.  But you know what, by the next day I was over it and I never cried again over my hair.  I got a great wig that I love and that looked a lot like my own hair.  Really, it was my hair but better . . . only 2 minutes to get ready in the mornings and no humidity frizz!  It helped tremendously.  Other than a select few, no one even knows I had cancer.  You are stronger than you know.  Hang in there and feel free to message me with any questions or if you just want to vent.  And one last thing - see how things go before you decide on your trip.  I had a huge vacation planned for last fall that I cancelled because I thought, like you, that I could not work it in with all the time off for chemo.  Turns out chemo did not involve much time off and I could have taken my vacation.  And if you do have to cancel it, just move it until the spring.  The Keys are spectacular in the spring (I am a florida girl and did spring break there a couple of times in college).  I just got back from my postponed vacation two weeks ago and I think it actually worked out better because the areas we visited were so beautiful with spring flowers and perfect spring weather.  ",

I have done nothing all day but cry and research both fibroandenomas and breast cancer on the internet.  I feel nauseous from the anxiety. ",
