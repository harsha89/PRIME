It's deep in my breast and feels spongy in some places and hard in others. While I know many lumps are benign, this one is mainly hard, rough, and feels fixed (it's like hitting a brick wall inside my breast). My breast is also swollen and dimpled and everything I've read points to cancer. I also have armpit pain on and off and numbness in my hand on that side so I fear it's spreading. My doctor said she couldn't feel anything (maybe because it's so deep), but made a clinic appointment anyway (on Wednesday). I'm just scared of what they'll find. I know if they find cancer I'll be upset with myself for not being more proactive. Am I worrying over nothing? Could this be benign? Log in to post a reply",

Apparently my breast is tubular, which causes the different appearance and feel. (And what I thought was dimpling wasn't, just slightly uneven skin.) Thank you for your post, it helped while I was waiting.",

She said it was an infection, the spot was an abscess, and that she couldn't feel any cancerous lumps. The abscess cleared up but the redness didn't go away. I Googled and found that breast infections were usually only in breastfeeding women (I'm childless) and IBC was often mistaken for one. I brought IBC up but she just said come back in a month if I was still worried. I should have been more assertive. Over the year, my breast sometimes felt warm, sometimes didn't, armpit pain came and went. My breast was always redder and more swollen than the other one and the skin puckered easily. I sometimes saw doctors, but they didn't seem worried. A couple of weeks ago, I went to a doctor with \"lines\" in my breast (they felt like cords). She felt my breasts but couldn't feel anything and said if I pinched my breast (as I had done to feel them) I would feel things. She couldn't feel anything in my armpits either. I felt like I was worrying over nothing and put it out of my mind. Last night I had a headache and felt exhausted. I put this down to PMS, but when I went to sleep, it was awful. My head hurt much more badly when I lay down (sleeping on my side helped a little) and I felt nauseous. I woke up a couple of times. The first time I noticed I was seeing things (patterns) and the second time my top was drenched in sweat. I knew this was not PMS. My left foot also tingles a fair amount and my right ear hurts. I fear I ignored the symptoms with my breast for too long and it spread to my brain. The doctor can only see me in a few weeks, although she said to call for an emergency appointment if my nights keep being as bad as last night. Log in to post a reply",

No, I haven't had a mammogram, the doctors didn't seem to be concerned about there being anything wrong (beyond the initial infection). I didn't think of migraine, I don't usually get them, although they do run in my family. As does anxiety, unfortunately. Luckily, I'm less fatigued now, but if I have a couple more nights like last, I will push for the emergency appointment. Again, thank you, you did ease my anxiety somewhat.",
