Peace, Geena",

      "Content": "Aug 29, 2010 04:17PM - edited Aug 30, 2010 08:28AM by wabiwoman Lindainfl, I am soooo glad you wrote about this and asked this.  I have had reconstruction after a bilateral mastectomy, and the results haven't been so aesthetically pleasing.  I've been considering taking my implants out for a while, but I know the rub for me is about dating, or more specifically, sex.  I don't really care about having \"form\" in my clothes.  I recconstructed because I was concerned about finding a potential partner and being intimate.  At 47 and never having been married if I listen to society my \"chances\" of finding a decent partner are labelled as \"slim\".  I was afraid of turning \"slim\" into \"zilch\" if I chose not to reconstruct.  I say all this as someone who speaks to others (as a profession) about living with positivity, letting go of negative thinking, having faith, doing the best we can, letting go of the outcome of the path, being confident -- and yet in my smaller mind I get scared and don't believe this.  I can easily fear, unfortunately.   So now I have these reconstructed things, no nipples, no aereola, lots of rippling and one breast that seems to want to make its way towards my armpit, I'm wondering if it is indeed any better than having no reconstruction.  I am unconvinced.  I know when I had a BRCA test the genetics counselor said she had clients who chose no reconstruction and they continued to date, be in marriages, etc.  I may indeed follow the path you have chosen after all. I do think it is indeed an issue of faith, doing what we can to make things happen (the footwork), having confidence and being self loving.  This is \"thinking\".  My emotions need to now step up to the plate!!!
