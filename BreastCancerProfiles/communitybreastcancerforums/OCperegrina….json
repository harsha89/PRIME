I hope everyone is managing well enough. Day 3 for me was not too bad, but day 4 and 5 were pretty dark. Lots of pain - joint and body soreness that never seems to end, achy back/pelvis (bone pain, I'm guessing - I have been taking Claritin to offset), and low energy/exhaustion, like a terrible flu - combined with some really awful mental stuff (sadness / depression / anxiety / hopelessness) that I wasn't expecting to hit so hard and feel so real and intense. I was somewhat prepared for physical side effects, but hadn't really calculated or planned for the hormone/serotonin/whatever the else the chemo does to imbalance my mental state. At my husband's urging, I reached out to my MO/PA to check in, and it sounds like what I'm experiencing is not unusual at all, and we added .25mg anti anxiety and slightly higher dose pain meds to treat the bone pain. It was much harder than I thought to call for help. It feels very vulnerable to call someone that has met me for less than an hour and tearfully tell them my problems and fears and doubts and concerns and pain levels, but I'm glad I did. Ultimately, it was a relief to talk to her and get validation that what's happening is normal and temporary and manageable and has an end in sight. As my husband said, it seemed like some of my \"sparkle\" came back yesterday (Day 6). We also tested a \"only input that delights you\" rule for the day. So, happy TV (Mrs. Maisel), full fat ice cream straight from the container, everything crackers and cream cheese, and no googling side effects of medication/trying to figure out what was going on on my own. I also made a specific point to talk to a friend extensively about her life and work situations, so I felt like for a brief moment, that I was outside this bubble and engaged in the real world. I sometimes feel like I have nothing to offer friends other than a conversation about cancer and chemotherapy side effects. It was nice to be pre-cancer me for a brief moment. I got a good night of sleep last night, and am hopefully maybe today (Day 7) will be an upswing day. How is everyone else doing on their SEs? No changes in my hair status yet. The plan is to shave the short hair when it starts to fall out. Sounds like electric trimmer, then razor? @LillianGish, was it hard to shave your own head with a razor in the shower? No worries of nicks or cuts? I tried some wigs on that my sister sent me and they seem kind of ridiculous (as a glam wig will naturally seem when you are perpetually in pajamas without makeup or jewelry), but we will cross that bridge when it comes. Recommendations on youtube or websites for scarf tying videos? Has anyone from this cohort taken \"Look Good, Feel Better\"? @Cherd - the worksheet from the ACS for side effect tracking has been very very helpful to note what's going on, and what I've taken to counteract SEs. I keep it on a clipboard and update the prior day every morning, which is a nice little reflective routine. It also really helped me frame my conversation with the MO/PA in an efficient manner. THANK YOU! I got my first note from the Chemo Angels program I signed up for. It's not the kind of thing I would normally do, and wasn't sure what to expect, but it's kind of nice to know a kind stranger is thinking of you from somewhere across the country and wishing you well. I will take all the little acts of kindness that come my way these days. It's one of the many free services I found on the breastcancerfreebies website. I also got my free queasy drops sample in the mail, and was pleasantly surprised that they seemed to help. I've been taking the nausea medication semi-proactively, pretty much anytime I feel as much of a flutter in my stomach, which has kept most of it at bay. Hope everyone is managing well enough. One foot in front of the other, and we will all eventually get to the end of this very long journey.",

I thought of you all when the shortest hair was falling out and the dandelions and velcro comments. So true! The analogies brought some much needed levity to the situation for my anxious 8 year old, so thank you! I actually kinda liked the buzz cut while it lasted, so there was a silver lining there. Husband has been shaving his head for 20+ years, so I\u2019ve got a good resource for this new territory. I\u2019ve been told to moisturize, moisturize, moisturize! I\u2019m nervous about tomorrow and the side effects #2 will bring, but it\u2019s happening whether I\u2019m nervous or not, so onwards we go! Hydrating and hoping for the best! Thanks for the updates and tips from those a few days ahead. @LillianGish, I hope you are feeling better after a rough week! Stay strong and wishing a happy new year to all!",

Take a nausea med at the first sign of a flutter to stay ahead of it. Ask your oncologist if they aren\u2019t working. My observation has been that they started with low levels, but have lots of tricks up their sleeves (stronger meds) in case they are needed, you just have to speak up. I ate a lot of crackers and cream cheese. (I know that sounds weird, but somehow the creamy offset the super salty persistent taste in my mouth. And once that seemed to work, I also threw some veggies / flavors in it to keep it interesting and appetizing - lemon zest, canned artichokes, powdered veggie dip, olives, whatever flavors you like.) And I\u2019m usually not a sweet person, but ice cream also helped. I figured at least I was getting some dairy(?) and during chemo, anything goes as long as you find it appetizing! I also used queasy drops/pops. I\u2019m not sure how they worked but it seemed to help. Three Lollies will send those currently in treatment (in the U.S. only) a FREE 6-piece box of their new Queasy Drops Plus with honey and pectin for both nausea and dry mouth that often come with chemo. Email info@threelollies.com with your name and address. Mine came pretty quickly, and I also ordered the pops on amazon. For water, I drink mine out of a metal straw with a silicone tip in a resusable container. It\u2019s washable, reusable, and goes seemed to go straight down without too much tasting. And I could carry it around the house with me, so it was always at my side. And I hear you, I got very tired of water, but kept reminding myself that the drugs are flushed out through the kidneys, so the water was helping them get OUT of my body. I tried powdered Gatorade to see if it worked, but ultimately went back to plain water. I also tracked how many refills of my water bottle so I knew how much progress I was making each day on the water. It was mentally good for me to see that I drank so so much more water than pre-chemo. I even added water consumption to the chemo symptom tracker from American cancer society so I could track it as an accomplishment for the day. Got to take the wins where we can get them! Good luck and you\u2019ve got this! Keep us posted on how you are doing!",

This is the first time it\u2019s been exposed to so much so slather the good stuff on!) @christine your wig looks great! If I saw you at the grocery store, I would think you were very put together with a great blowout! :) I have wig appointment next week, and hope I can come out with as nice of an option! @becky way to own it!!! You are an inspiration! My daughter is still a bit sensitive about my big bald head (and to be honest so am I), but hopefully I can make the leap to embracing it with similar poise and confidence soon! I find it really uplifting to read the venting and stories and advice that are so very specific to our collective journey. I'm hoping a year from now this will all be a distant memory but at this moment in time it sure is nice to feel like there is a tribe that understands all the weird nuances and hard things we are going through on a daily basis! Wishing all a happy Friday and a low key weekend with tolerable SEs!",

While I don't have any specifics on a solution, I can completely understand the disappointment of drawing this thing out longer than you expected. I would only say if you like your MO, trust their opinions on next steps. While my MO is not necessarily the warm, friendly bedside manner guy (that's more his PA), I completely trust his recommendations and it's clear he knows the science and most effective next steps. They don't always align with what I want to happen (exhibit A - chemotherapy). But we all handle and process this kind of news differently, so listen to your gut, and curl up inside this weekend and make everyone around you wash their hands a lot. :) (I'm thinking of putting a sign on my door about this house is immunocompromised, and telling people to be prepared to catch their coughs and sneezes and wash their hands upon entry. Too much?) @LillianGish - a sincere thank you for mentioning your infection after round 2. I noticed some redness and a sore on my left breast (where I had surgery and the tumor was removed), and showed it to my PA while I was in the office for Neulasta. She thinks it is probably an early sign of infection, so she got me oral antibiotics ASAP, and hopes we can calm it down that way, and we took pictures and drew on my breast, so we knew where the redness was and could see if it expanded. I feel much more empowered since I know what it is, and under what specific circumstances to call the after hours / on call MO on the weekend. (For some reason, calling a doctor on the weekend is very intimidating to me. The whole idea of explaining my situation to a new doctor that doesn't know me makes me uncomfortable, especially if I'm not sure if it warrants a call.) So, needless to say, I feel empowered with knowledge, and would not have thought to bring this up to her had you not mentioned it in your post. Thank you!",

Bummer about your infection @LillianGish - I'm glad you figured out what it was and hopefully you can avoid the unhelpful nurse in the future! Day 15 for me and I got the dreaded hair shed, so it\u2019s been buzzed off. I\u2019m guessing I will need to razor it in the next couple days, but at least this will give me a chance to get used to what my head looks like!

I don't have a ton of advice to offer yet, as a Day 2er, but will share my experience thus far. Yesterday was my Day 1 of cytoxan and taxotere. With the exception of an initial reaction to the taxotere (flushed, tight chest, elevated heart rate), which was immediately addressed, and did not seem to alarm the nurses (apparently people like me with very fair complexions are often seen to have this reaction), it all went as expected. We were at the center for about 5 hours. Since I was being a good hydration patient, I drank a TON of water, so I was up and walking quite a few times to (literally) flush it all out. I had more Benadryl in my post reaction drip than I could manage for coherence, so I wasn't really able to read. WIFI was strong, and I mainly streamed TV, surfed the web, and took a short nap. The blankets really are as crappy as everyone says, so next time I will bring my own. (Like LillianGish I'm taking lots of notes so I can remember what worked for the next cycle.) I opted out of the cold mittens and socks based on some conversations with the PA and a friend that is a MO. For my course, it didn't seem necessary to add an additional discomfort to the pile. (They are now property of Husband for his plantar fasciitis - multipurpose!) Outside the reaction, I had a couple moments of general discomfort, but totally tolerable. My appetite has noticeably changed, not sure if it's mental or physical. Not that I can't eat or anything, but previously delightful foods (truffle potato chips and fancy sandwiches) did not delight as they once did. But I know I need to get the protein in, so I'm treating it like medication and something I've just got to do. My AM coffee is a little more bitter than usual, and I've had some constipation (sorry if that's TMI), but I'm trying to get ahead of that with Swiss Kriss. My memory already seems to have turned into Dory from Finding Nemo, but I'm hoping that's stress related and temporary. I've got my neulasta shot today, which I'm kind of nervous about since it can cause bone pain in flat bones, especially for women my age. I can't seem to find a credible source to describe bone pain and what to expect, but I suppose I will find out if it comes my way. I'm on Claritin already and ready to deploy whatever OTC or Rx pain meds I need if I happen to have that SE. I ordered my chemodiva wig today with my hair clippings (a kind gift from my coworkers), and have figured out that wine glass pens are great water bottle markers to track refills of my trusty RTIC mug. (I might as well use them for something during this time!) Hugs and wishes for minimal and tolerable side effects for all!",

I hope your side effects are tolerable and the pain is subsiding. And all the hats and earrings look divine. :) My final TC is tomorrow and the dread is really setting in. I\u2019m feeling pretty good, all things considered, minus some fatigue, which makes it even harder to voluntarily walk into an infusion and \u201cmake myself sick\u201d again. I know that\u2019s not the healthiest mindset, so I\u2019m trying to change the record in my head. Mental health has been a big thing for me, and my Dr put me on Lexapro last round, and we have found a really great family therapist that is specifically for cancer patients and their families. It was supposed to be to help my kiddo with some of the anxiety, but it\u2019s been helpful to me, as well, as I meet with her separately to debrief. Unfortunately Lexapro has negative interactions with hormone therapy, so I\u2019ll need to taper off in about a month, but we will cross that bridge when we get there. My main coping strategy has been riding my bike (reminding myself that exercise fights fatigue) and distraction, which includes tv, reading, and now we\u2019ve got a post-chemo, pre-radiation trip on the books, so I have something to look forward to and plan. And I\u2019ve been leaning into all the free cancer services at my hospital. Tonight is a drum circle for healing, which is not something that I would have done before, but why not? It can\u2019t hurt, right? Question for you all... my MO said normal recovery time is 6 weeks between last chemo and radiation. It surprised me that it was so long. (But hey, I\u2019m new to all this, so what do I know?) Those of you that move on to radiation next, is that consistent with what you are hearing from your MO? I guess it makes sense to build up proper strength again, but just curious. Thanks for the continued positivity! It really helps to hear how everyone in our cohort is coping, and to know we are not alone in the fight.",
