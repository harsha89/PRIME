      "Content": "Maryiz wrote: Duke University is doing research on why they believe oxygen encourages tumor growth. DURHAM, N.C. Because of the way solid tumors adapt the body's machinery to bring themselves more oxygen, chemotherapy and radiation may actually make these tumors stronger. \"In a sense, these therapies can make the tumor healthier,\" said Mark W. Dewhirst, D.V.M., Ph.D., professor of radiation oncology at Duke university Medical Center. \"Unless the treatment is very effective in killing many if not most tumor cells, you are shooting yourself in the foot.\" Dewhirst and colleagues Yiting Cao, M.D., Ph.D., of Duke Pathology, and Benjamin Moeller, M.D., Ph.D. have introduced this counter-intuitive idea at recent conferences and in a review article featured in the June issue of Nature Reviews Cancer. Radiation and chemotherapy do kill most solid tumor cells, but in the cells that survive, the therapies drive an increase in a regulatory factor called HIF1 (hypoxia-inducible factor 1), which cells use to get the oxygen they need by increasing blood vessel growth into the tumor. Solid tumors generally have low supplies of oxygen, Dewhirst explained and HIF1 helps them get the oxygen they need. The review article concludes that blocking HIF1 would provide a clear mechanism for killing solid-tumor cells, particularly cells that are proving resistant to radiation or chemotherapy treatments. As a part of this work, Dewhirst's team has been studying the phenomenon of rising and falling oxygen levels in tumors, called cycling hypoxia. Oxygen levels have been found to naturally cycle up and down in individual blood vessels as well as large tumor regions. This instability in the tumor's oxygen levels can increase HIF-1 production and cause radiation therapy to fail, Dewhirst said. \"It is my opinion that the whole tumor grows more aggressively because of this pulsation of oxygen at low levels,\" Dewhirst said.  Contact: Mary Jane Gore mary.gore@duke.edu 919-660-1309 Duke university Medical Center Source Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Feb 6, 2009 08:02PM Maryiz wrote: Hi, this article is from Science Daly.  It talks about nonhormonal treatments for metastatic cancer, so very successful in some cases for treating mets.  I hope this helps.  Maryiz ScienceDaily (Dec. 23, 2008) \u2014 Nonhormonal treatment regimens, including anthracycline-based regimens and taxanes, have improved overall survival in women with advanced (metastatic or recurrent inoperable) breast cancer over the last 35 years, according to a systematic review published December 9 in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. Numerous regimens have been tested in advanced breast cancer. However, each of the trials has compared only a few regimens, making it difficult for researchers and clinicians to know the relative merit of the individual regimens. To learn how regimens compare with one another, John P. A. Ioannidis, M.D., of the University of Ioannina School of Medicine in Greece and colleagues performed a meta-analysis of 128 clinical trials that included 148 comparisons between regimens and that enrolled 26,031 women with advanced breast cancer. The investigators used single-agent chemotherapy with old non-anthracycline drugs as the baseline for comparison within their meta-analysis. The use of anthracycline regimens led to a 22%\u201333% relative risk reduction in overall mortality as compared with older single agent chemotherapy. Single drug taxane treatment led to a similar relative risk reduction of 33 percent, while the combination of a taxane with capecitabine or gemcitabine led to a 51 percent relative risk reduction over the single agent chemotherapy. Most of the regimens appeared to have similar efficacy when used in women who had not been previously treated and in women who had had prior therapy. \"Our meta-analysis quantifies the progress achieved in the treatment of advanced breast cancer with nonhormonal systemic treatment in the last 35 years. Several regimens have shown effectiveness, and for some of them, the treatment effects are practically indistinguishable in magnitude,\" the authors write. \"Given that subsequent lines of treatment can confer similar relative benefits as the first-line setting, one can exploit the survival benefits conferred by several effective regimens used in sequential fashion.\" In an accompanying editorial, Philippe Bedard, M.D., and Martine Piccart-Gebhart, M.D., Ph.D., of the Jules Bordet Institute in Brussels, Belgium, note that there has been no consensus regarding the best dosage, timing, sequence or combination of therapies for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer because standard comparators have not been available. Therefore, the work of Ioannidis and colleagues is important. Given the investigators' finding that many of the regimens have similar relative effectiveness in previously-untreated and -treated patients, no clear order of use appears from the meta-analysis. Other considerations, such as toxicity, will continue to help drive the choice of regimen for individual therapy, the editorialists argue. \"Although this network meta-analysis is unlikely to alter routine clinical practice, it provides a solid evidence-based foundation to support the observation that the survival of women diagnosed with advanced breast cancer has improved because of more active systemic chemotherapy and targeted therapy,\" the editorialists write. \"This should provide hope to patients, investigators, industrial sponsors, and regulatory agencies alike that well-designed clinical trials with novel systemic therapies can further alter the natural history of this devastating disease.\" ",

      "Content": "Feb 4, 2009 01:36PM - edited Feb 4, 2009 01:37PM by Maryiz I will try again with the article.  I couldn't get rid of all of the ads.  Here it is.  Love, me   We Need a New War on Cancer An understanding of tumor genes and cancer stem cells offers hope for a cure By Bernadine Healy, M.D. Posted June 12, 2008 In early May, less than two weeks before Ted Kennedy learned of his brain tumor, he chaired a Senate hearing about revamping the war on cancer, a war he championed at its outset in 1971. Though acknowledging advances, several witnesses expressed impatience with the failure to achieve the central goal of the war: to cure cancer through a concentrated scientific effort akin to the ones that split the atom and took us to the moon. Some 37 years later, 565,000 Americans yearly are dying because of unchecked cancer, and their ranks are swelling. It is now the No. 1 killer of adults under age 85.  Video: Learning About Cancer People Who Read This Also Read   Several witnesses called for a new direction, if not a major overhaul of a system that may be too calcified to take strategic leaps however much money it has. As Gregory Simon, a former presidential adviser and now head of the cancer advocacy group FasterCures, said, \"We are not soldiers in a war against cancer; we are students majoring in cancer.\" Learning is vital, but it must translate into curing. Why should it take 17 years to turn discoveries into effective treatments? he asked. He's right\u2014and there's particular urgency now that the science is ripe to take on huge challenges as never before. To win the war, early detection of the deep and hidden cancers will be key. We have screens for only four or five cancers; the rest show up on their own to patients' peril. Finding ways to mel t away recurrent and metastatic disease\u2014the way cancer kills\u2014will be the ultimate gift of science. Strategically ramping up work in cancer genomics and a newer area of exploration, cancer stem cells, is what success will require, provided the money, talent, and technological resources are there. Deranged genes. Cancer is a disease of deranged genes. But as we've slowly deciphered them, we've been surprised. Many cancers that go by the same name and look identical under the microscope have different genetic profiles, explaining why some tumors respond to therapy while others of the same ilk do not. But more than providing a better crystal ball for what will work, tumor genomes are blueprints for new drug design. Herceptin, made to block a gene pathway found in up to 30 percent of breast cancers, helps women who have that gene. Gleevec, which targets genes found in chronic myelogenous leukemia, may not help all blood cancers but is a lifesaver for a rare stomach cancer that bears genetic similarity. The Cancer Genome Atlas program, started at the National Institutes of Health in 2005 to map individual cancer genomes, was envisioned as revolutionary: It would blow open the instruction book on cancer. There would be no more hit-and-miss therapies. But a cultural resistance to strategically directed big science and a flat budget turned the program into a \"pilot\" to decode just three cancers, leaving 200 others waiting in the wings. This is no way to win a war. Nor is it a way to break open the emerging domain of cancer stem cell research, which could be every bit as critical as cancer genomics. Adult stem cells are present in all organs for tissue renewal or repair, but a variant has turned out to be tumor-initiating. These cancer seeds were first identified in leukemia, breast, and brain cancers a few years ago and now have been pulled out of numerous cancers\u2014pancreas, prostate, colon, and ovary. Cancer stem cells spin off fast-growing tumor cells that make for the bulk of the tumor, and they can lie dormant and more easily evade chemotherapy or radiation. This would explain why tumors so inexplicably reappear years after successful treatment. Since cancerous stem cells have their own gene profiles that bring special properties like motility, they can roam throughout nearby tissue, into the bloodstream, and to distant body organs. With unique markers on their surface and a set of different gene pathways, which are normally turned on in embryos but silent in mature cells, these cancer stem cells offer a world of opportunities for both early detection and new cancer drugs. For the first time in a long time, cancer researchers are talking about a cure. Even for metastatic disease. Our nation needs a 21st-century war on cancer, with new commitment and bold strategies akin to those that enabled the realization of President John Kennedy's goal to put a man on the moon. Ted Kennedy's moon shot is curing cancer, perhaps more so now than ever.   ",

I am really mad about that one.  I started a list of those I knew with breast cancer and although there were a few curvaceous ladies, there were NO obese women.  I don't buy that one at all.  I think it is our food with all of its soy and preservatives.  Our food industry has changed significantly to ease stresses on family life and I think it is killing us.  Look at a package of crackers, cereal, cookies, etc. and you will find soy oil.  It is cheaper to use, so we use it.  I am sorry for the rant but how long will it take people to get it.  This disease is devastating, whether stage 1 or stage IV.  Thanks for not turning a deaf ear.  Maryiz",

In their press to Baltimore Sun they hope to have this vaccine available in the near future, but because of the vicious competition we do not always know of these treatments.  I feel JH is definitely cutting edge and wouldn't hesitate to go there if I need to.  I like that you are proactive and feel as I do that some hospitals appear secretive and sometimes act superior in espousing their treatment protocols. It is a shame that we have to be our own advocates, traveling on a wing and a prayer with no advanced medical training.  I want everyone out there to know that we should push for more monies to go into these vaccine trials, I don't believe they are getting the money and attention they need.  I believe in the future they may be able to stop the progression of the cancer and prevent the next generation from having to deal with this horrific disease.  Sorry for being so wordy, my point is thank you for being proactive and as Winston Churchill said, never, never give up.  Let us know how you make out Wendy on the 24th Love, Maryiz",

They have many drugs to fight her 2 cancer.  In addition, it appears super Herceptin is soon to come out and really whacks the heck out of Her2 positive girls.  I believe the super Herceptin attacks Her2 and Her 3, so it is a new formula.  I can't answer about the Taxol because I know it works differently for everyone.  I know 3 women in my chemo group who are on it and all are stage IV and doing well.  I believe of all of the breast cancers that Her2 will be the first to be cured and I don't believe that is too far off.  Doctors at Dana Farber are very optimistic about seeing that type being cured or kicked in the you know what.  Thinking of you.  Maryiz",
