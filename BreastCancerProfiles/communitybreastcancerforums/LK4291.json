So she made a 2nd surgery to take out 4 tumors. until that time were all GRADE I (bening).Then one month ago made a 3d surgury to take out 3 fullodes tumors. One of them the bigger one was malligant and the other 2 border line. So , 1 week ago did a mastectomy and a cleansing of the place that the started tumor was appeard in the chest wall muscle. The doctor says that it is very rare to have metastasis in this kind of tumors. Most likely they recurrect locally. So after mastectomy we hope that will not recurrent again. We have checked with biopsy 2 lymphs also and they were negative. Regarding your statement for 3 years life after diagnosis, it's not true. In a site says something like this but after a metastasis. All these years and especially the last months I'm searching in the web for information. My understanding is the following : Every case could be totally different than another depending on the person/body. So everyone must fight and live her/his life to the limits every day. Best wishes",
