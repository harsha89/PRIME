Its like dejavu all over again. Anyone have experience with male breast lumps? What could this be if its not cancer? What are the chances it is cancer? I would appreciate any Feedback you can offer.

The radiologist recommende a biopsy, but I got 2 other opinions from another radiologist and my surgeon. Both felt that it would be more prudent to wait 6mths and do another mammo then.They felt the shadowing was due to breast changes due to rads and surgery. My Onc agreed with their opinions and I decidede to wait it out. Anyone experience this and it turn out to just be landscape changes to the breast? What can I expect? Should I worry something is wrong if they suggest an MRI or sonagram. Would love to hear from someone who has experienced this. I just really don't know what to expect.

Radiologist saw something on film that he said could \"conceivably be a result of previous treatment but recurrent neoplasm could not be ruled out.\" I freaked when I heard this and brought my films to a friend who is a radiologist and he read them. He showed me the area of concern and asked lots of questions about my treatments and then told me not to worry to much about it. He recommendation would be to follow it up 6 mths from now with another mammo as rads and surgery can cause lots of changes. He also said he has never seen cancer come back in a radiated breast in 8 mths time (he has been a radiologist for over 20 years). Anyway, I went to my surgeon for a follow up and he said the area in question is not where the cancer was but rather under my arm. After a physical exam he said it lined up with the area where i had my snb. He also is considering it as scar tissue and says we just have to watch it and see. He also recommended a mammo in 6 mths. If it is scar tissue it should get lighter if cancer it will get bigger. Is this typical? What if it is cancer and I let it go for 6 mths. Can anyone offer advice or put my mind at ease. I am nervous about waiting 6 mths if something is there. Anyone with similar experiences I would love to hear from you.

So frustrated-why now is this rearing its ugly head. I keep trying to figure out what I did to cause the truncal LE. I know how the other one started, but this is a puzzle. I spose I could have cut myself shaving or pulled something in my sleep. Range of motion with my left arm was definitely affected by my surgery.  Also a question- I am due for my mammo soon. That always makes me a mess - how does that effect LE and does LE show up on a mammo-just want to be prepared. Appreciate the insight",

I finished rads just last August. I sailed thru with no problems or side effects at all. Now all of a sudden, I am experiencing breast tenderness in the radiated breast. Not bad, just noticeable. It kind of travels around a bit-usually starts by my nipple and then moves to side of breast or underside of breast. Nipple is slightly retracted due to surgery and rads(according to onco rad). I am just wondering why all of a sudden I am experiencing tenderness after so many months. My bc was not even near my nipple, but that area was heavily radiated. Any of you rads veterans expeience something similar? I'd love to hear from you for the peace of mind. Dx 4/10/2008, IDC, <1cm, Stage I, Grade 1, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

This past Oct. I injured my arm and developed mild LE. Went to a therapist and managed to reduce swelling by a cm but still can't wear my watch on my wrist. Anyway, long story short. I am wondering if this sounds like it could be LE or truncal LE from posts  read on other forums. For the past two weeks I have had underarm pain. On a scale of 1-10 it is maybe a one-not bad just kinda there and I notice it when I press my arm to my side or push myself up with my left arm. It is definitely not bone pain. I have felt and felt for lumps under the arm and on my breast. There is nothing. My breast is not enlarged that I can tell, not warm to the touch, not discolored in anyway. So I am wondering from you ladies that have LE and truncal LE does this sound like what I am experiencing- I am so new to all this LE stuff. The pain is kinda like being pricked by an underwire bra except i feel it when I have no bra on. Also wondered if scar tissue could be acting up. Ok LE sisters let me know if this is LE symptoms or if something more ominous is going on. Oh and if it is LE does tenderness go away or will I always have it. Thanks!

Maybe it was always present and the loss of motion or pulling i felt if i stretched too much was the beginning and i never realized it. Actually, I am just assuming these symptoms are truncal LE. I haven't actually been told by a dr. it is but i cant find anything else wrong-no lumps or bumps that should not be there and I have been checking daily.
