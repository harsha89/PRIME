I wasnt aware of the hormones released while quitting. thanks for that info!!!! but, YOU should quit!!! its probably important to maintain a healthy lifestyle once you are through treatment. That's what I try to stress to her. We dont want to go through this again!!!",

On the other hand, I know I may be a little too hard on her and thanks for putting that into perspective. I only want whats best for her and 2 oncologists have told her she needs to quit smoking. For the record, I felt she was being ignorant about the amount of alcohol she drinks, which is in excess of healthy amounts. I was not calling her ignorant for not \"listening to me\". I've already decided today that I need to be more supportive and less concerned with her habits. Thanks for the advice.",

The problem with that is she sees others who drink as much and more than her and they are fine. \"Why didnt they get cancer?\" she asks, which is ignorant and moronic. Deb, I am very surprised to hear the smoking suggestion. The oncologist told her if she doesn't quit, she will have a terrible time healing. you didnt get that? i do understand about the stress, i think thats why she wont quit.",

The doctor told its ok to drink alcohol but i dont think he realizes she has more than 1-2 drinks. she sees nothing wrong with it. from what i read, alcohol does not negatively impact A/C. does anyone know anything different and from what source? she can't quit smoking either and the doctor also didnt want her on any stop smoking aids/drugs. anyone hear anything?
