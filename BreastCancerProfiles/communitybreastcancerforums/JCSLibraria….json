The diagnosis progression was very similar to yours. My MO even told me that he is not a fan of ports, but it was put in prior to the MBC diagnosis. He is against any surgery or radiation of the primary tumor. Even though the surgeon is willing since the tumor has reduced in size by 90% with chemo. We are still in negotiation about this issue! Certain parts of this are not fun, but the support from family, friends, people on this forum and even the chemo nurses is wonderful! Do not troll the Internet too much. Get a second opinion if you need it. I have learned a great deal from the people on these forums about cancer treatments and life in general. I am a good bit older than you, but plan on living a long time yet. I call myself a healthy person that happens to have cancer. Good luck! Check back often and let us know if you need anything",

After a PET scan, the diagnosis was changed to stage IV metastatic breast cancer with nodules in both lungs. This has been quite a shock. I started Abraxane and will have my third infusion next week with a Nuelasta patch. So far no SE\u2019s orther than sleepless nights after the steroid. I am prepared for the bone pain, but have no idea what that means. Also think about the hair loss, but so far so good. I want to do everything possible to fight this disease. I am a healthy 65 yr old that has a lot left to do with her life. I do enjoy getting information from this forum and the many topics. As a retired librarian, there is no better tool than knowledge.

Any thoughts on how I can make that better? MO is saying wait two weeks and start the next round with a slightly lower dose. I am disappointed as I wanted this process to go smoothly and hit all the right marks. Guess I will spend this rainy weekend inside avoiding any infections lurking around.",

I hope for therapies to cure cancer. I hope for maintenance medications to assist in quality of long life for those that cannot be cured. Congrats to all that ring the bell!

I had to skip the last infusion of the first cycle due to a really low WBC. The MO lowered the dose and we proceeded. I was able to complete all three of the second cycle. Then could not start the third cycle as my creatinine count had gotten really high. I have had two rounds of IV fluids and am drinking 64oz of water daily at home. No one has any idea why the kidneys are being impacted other than the chemo itself. I am hoping to have a PET scan at the end of this third cycle to see if the poison is working it\u2019s magic on the tumors. Hasanyone else had this happen? Other than these two problems, I have no side effects. Hair loss, but no nausea, diarrhea or neuropathy. I am grateful for that, but would like to get the PET scan so I can relax a bit from the concerns and get some good news for once.",
