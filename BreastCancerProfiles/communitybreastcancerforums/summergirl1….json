I still feel like Im wearing a bra too tight even if I dont have a bra on, I havent suffered any intestinal issues TG no constipation but I swear by Brown Bread , Allbran and coffee for breakfast it does the trick everytime. Go for TX no 4 on thursday dont know why but feeling anxious about this one,  Robyn, Im surprised your Dr just passed  off the Lympedema issue if you check on the Lympedema site here, there are several people who got it even if they only had 1 or 2 noids removed, I truly think we should all take the necessary precautions \"better safe than sorry\"  once you get it its there for life, another nasty thing for us to worry about (sigh) ",

Both of these show a high level of activity when used as single agents in metastatic breast cancer. In reviews of reported studies, when compared with standard therapies Taxotere looks to be the most active single agent in treatment of metastatic breast cancer. There are some differences in the treatment schedules of the 2 medications, and there are some differences in the side effects of these 2 medications. I have listed the side effects of both medications. Taxotere: decrease of white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets, flu-like symptoms, fluid retention, numbness and/or tingling to fingers and toes, muscle aches or bone pain for a few days after each treatment, mouth sores, hair loss, decreased appetite. Uncommon Side Effects: allergic-type reaction, blood pressure and heart rate changes, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, skin rash usually occurs on hands and feet, nail changes, menstrual cycle may become irregular or stop permanently, menopausal effects including hot flashes and vaginal dryness. Decreased desire for sex during treatment. Taxol: decrease of white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets, allergic-like reaction, blood pressure or heart rate changes during the infusion of the medication, mouth ulcers, numbness and/or tingling to fingers and toes, muscle aches or bone pain for a few days after each treatment, mouth sores, hair loss, diarrhea.

I see myself daily becoming more miserabe as the weeks go on , and was always such an upbeat positive and happy person, but its a real challenge to stay positive on this journey anyway.  Debinutuah , I kinda agree about the rads and not wanting to do them, especially as I kinda went against the BS advice, over here in Ireland they dont typically do immediate reconstruction if u are to get rads but I kinda pushed for it and had TE's after my MX . didnt want to wake up to the trauma of having no boob and am glad I did it , but now he keeps telling me I will probably have complications and I am scared but I know in the USA many women have rads after having reconstruction.so Im hoping I will be OK. I think I will take the chance anyway as the %'s on nonrecurence of BC after rads look pretty good , so maybe just give it a try if it doesnt work out Im sure u can stop it,  take care everyone and I will fill you in after  mt TX today lets hope they do it.  Its 6am here wide awake due to the steroids and the 20 trips to the bathroom with all the water floating in my system,  ",

I think they would have just done a lumectomy on me too if my tumor wasnt so big. to all those who have started their TX good luck to you all I guess as everyone says to me the sooner I start the quicker its over , but Im still TERRIFIED.",

I have always had mine long so I didnt cut mine will wait till it starts falling out then will transition in my wig which is also long, I am counting down the days now tillmine falls out :( and 1 piece of advice I will give you is , if you decide to wear a wig do not just buy one over the internet as they look completly different when you try them on, your best bet is to go to a wig shop now while you have your hair and have them try on styles that will suit you , hope this helps !!!",

(sorry just had to vent) and my husband does not understand why I would be upset . I will never understand them at all. ( of rant over) MaryJRN : I was told that tamoxifen does not cause weight gain unless you change your eating habits and eat more than you would normally, I have actually lost 8lbs since chemo began and I cant afford to I am already underweight hoping I wont lose any more. or I will become invisible. Heading off tommrrow for TX 4 on thursday, I am feeling anxious about this one and in general feeling down this last week I hope I am not getting depressed had bad depression in the past and dont want to go there again. . ",
