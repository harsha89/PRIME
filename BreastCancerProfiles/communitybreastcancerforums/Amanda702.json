I had an ultrasound today of both breasts, the sonographer had me wait in the room until they were read by the radiologist. Is it standard they do not tell you of something was or wasn't found? After 15 mins she comes in and says I can get dressed. The sonographer said I had to wait for them to be sent to my Dr. If the radiologist found something, would she have came in and told me?
