I can barely eat and sleep. I'm H2 positive and the growth rate is 70%. I've changed my diet ever since my first treatment, going organic and less meat. I can't think of what I could do differently to prevent this. Is bad gene the one to blame. If so, what can I do now to fight it? I'm waiting for port to put in and treatment to start. can I do anything at all? Here are my questions - 1. Starve the cancer? I'm 43. I heard that the younger you are, the faster the cancer grow and spread. Is there truth to this? If I eat less, will it help to slow/ starve the cancer down? If not, what should I eat at least I don't feed the devil. 2. Increase Alkaline or Ph level in the body? I also heard the cancer can't survive in alkaline environment. Has anyone actually done that? I asked my oncologist today and she was strongly discouraging that. She said my body can't tolerate. The alkaline will mess up how my body absorb protein. 3. Take any vitamin or herbs? Has anyone tried dandelion? Many thanks.

I am 40 and thought I have an excellent health until my mammo indicated macro calcification found with two 2cm lumps and two UA nods all on the left side.  I too have a mother who went through BC three years ago and with two young children of my own (22 months and 8 years old), I am truely frightened.  I am exhausted from researching, reading and headache from feeling down.  I am still waiting on biopsy result to tell me what stage I am in and what the treatment plan is.  I know I am ready to fight but with so many things required to plan and do, I don't know where I should start.  But I know I would like to work with a different doctor and here is why - I am currently working overseas for a month and will be back Dallas by the end of April.  A Hong Kong sergeon referred by Metilda said that I may need a removal.  I don't have MRI yet but the sergeon's tone sound commercial and it was depressing to hearing him issuing the \"death sentence\".  There was little optimistic in his tone other than \"it is curable\" (but I feel I am a big $ sign to him).   My husband said he did not have a good bedside manner at all.  I don't need someone to make me feel more worst than what it has already been.  This doctor makes me feel sad and very scared.  Anyway, thank you all for listening to me as I am learning how to cope this myself and get through this. ",

Looks like you and I are both in the 40's group and get DX almost the same time.  So I will stay close and you and I will go through this hand in hand.  At least you have your surgery date lined up.  Get some rest.  I tried to think that when I woke up from the surgery, I would feel much better knowing at least the cancer source were gone from my body.",

The important thing is that we are making changes for good. I don't know how ready I am, I am not that strong. I lost sleep over thinking about all this. But I know that this battle has chosen me and I have no choice but put up a good fight to go through this hell in the next 7 months. AryaS, glad to hear that you will get these suckers out of your body soon. Me neither, I have never had any surgery. I pray for your successful surgery this Thursday. I actually cannot wait to do the surgery. I know it is much easier to say than done. I will probably be more freaked out when that time comes. I imagine I will have a deep nap and when I wake up, life is/should be better than what I am going through today...",
