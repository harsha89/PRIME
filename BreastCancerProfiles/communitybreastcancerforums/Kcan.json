I hope it continues to work for a very long time! As far as trials I was really interested in a combo of immunotherapy and chemo and was hoping for an immunotherapy called Maraba. It is still relatively new so something like keytruda and halaven may be a better option or atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel. Apparently Mets to the adrenal gland is relatively rare and it's more difficult to find info. Have a wonderful and relaxing time in Florida! Winning, i just got word that the hospital we were trying to get into does not have any trials for her and reccomended a different hospital. Now we are faxing her info over again. I just think we should start chemo. I feel like it's already been too long and I have no idea how long everything will take. My mom is pretty down right now. I think she feels betrayed by her body and really does not want to do any chemotherapy. I think she needs time to just digest and yet we don't have time. We are meeting with the radiologist on Monday to see if there's anything in the bones and weigh in on his opinion. I wish I could take this whole thing from her. KPW3, that is excellent news!! I am so glad for you! I hope the keytruda and halaven work wonders and get you to NED!! Has anyone had genomic profiling done with a liquid biopsy? Just curious how it works and if it was helpdul/ user friendly, easy to do/ affordable. Praying for you all and wishing you much health and peace, Katherine",

Mom will find out if she's eligible for a double blinded study for immunotherapy (atezolizumab or placebo and paclitaxel) on Wednesday. Not sure about the paclitaxel for stage iv tnbc. There's a 2:1 ratio she receives the immunotherapy, really hoping we get it. Always thinking about the next step here. Minxie, I wish you all the very best with Keytruda. I asked our trial onc about keytruda and she said that a single session cost thousands of dollars, we're in Toronto Canada. Has anyone heard of the immunotherapy Maraba? Or had experience with it?

Her first scan in November noted a reduction in tumour size. Still considering the foundation1 blood biopsy as a next step although I know our oncologist is not a huge supporter of this. Thriving, the Predict trial sounds great. I will look for something similar in Canada. Cronguist, sorry to read about your mom, that is such crappy news. I agree with Hartrish, sounds like a good option. Sending you positive vibes. Katherine",

My mom has a 7mm malignant node in her lung, the node grew 5mm in 6.5 months. We are meeting with the medical team next week to discuss next steps and therapry. Everything I have researched suggests a pretty grim prognosis. She is 61 and was initially diagnosed with tnbc at 59. I wonder are there any women in their 60's fighting stage IV tnbc? I'm just not sure what to expect or what direction to turn. I want to be as informed as possible and am wondering if anyone has advice on how to help navigate my mom's care? Thank you! Katherine",

My heart goes out to her and her family. Scans and waiting is definitely the worst. The last ct scan was of the chest.

Just returned from my mom's MO appointment. 3.5 cm lesion on the right adrenal, 1cm in lung and possibly something on the liver. Not sure, still too small. Our MO is giving us a referral to princess margaret hospital in toronto ON canada where there are clinical trials for immunotherapy and more specialized treatment. This however could take a couple of weeks. Currently my mom is symptom free. My question is do we wait for the trial? Or should we begin weekly taxol *sp* treatment at our local hospital. Obviously I fear significant irreversible advancement. Our MO said she thought it seemed safe to wait but who knows. Anyways, any insight or info would be greatly appreciated. This sight and the wonderful and powerful women here has been our source of strength. Thank you all and God Bless. Katherine",

We received our results last Thursday and Friday morning when I called to see if we could speed up the referral process the original hospital said they already sent the paper work. I will call the trial hospital Monday morning. In the meantime I have signed up on trial finder recommended by a woman on this site and hopefully will get in touch with them asap. Our MO said if she starts taxol she can't do the trial. However I already fear it's too late and she should start chemo this week...I don't know what to think...regardless I'm pushing for the trial. Mom says she feels something in her chest, the same location she had cancer and where the lumpectomy was preformed, this has been on and off for months but is worse now. She had a mammo there recently, MRI and her MO/ surgeon/ myself check and nothing has been seen. At this point she really doesn't want to do chemo. I'm trying to be as positive and forward thinking as possible. We go to a naturopath ONC as well, take rick simpson oil (which is very helpful for sleep if anyone is interested) and I just don't know what else to do. I am at a loss. This thread has been very quiet, how is everyone doing? I want you all to know you are heros. Through this wretched, unending battle your generosity in sharing personal experiences, advice and prayers has been the most powerful medicine. Sending lots of love and light, Katherine",

I know for sure our primary care hospital does not perform such procedures. We did have genetic testing done for brca 1/2 but both were negative. Thank you for the info on Barbara Bigelow, a little scary but very inspiring. Especially since I don't see much out there in regard to adrenal activity and tnbc. The hardest part is trying to get the referrals through! I am on the phone multiple times throughout the day to try to get her into a different hospital. The first, princess margaret said they had no trials at the time and now we are waiting on Sunnybrook (more clinical trial options there, wish I had known that before I requested princess margaret). I feel like this is waaay too long to be without chemo (diagnosed July 30th with 1.5cm lung met and Aug 9th with 3.5cm adrenal met and possibly liver activity still early to tell). However our primary MO said that chemo wasn't urgent (taxol to begin with) and that she had this cancer in her lung and adrenal for (quite possibly) a long time. Her lung and adrenal were suspicious prior to her lumpectomy 2 yrs ago. None the less I've asked our naturopath oncologist to further review her case to see what he thinks about beginning taxol asap or wait for that trial or both. We also have an appointment with her radiologist this Monday to get results for a bone scan. He's good and has some pull. This whole process has been pretty painful. Has anyone seen terms of endearment? When the mother is pushing for the pain meds for her daughter? I feel like the mother. I pray for all of you strong, amazing women every day/ night. Take care.
