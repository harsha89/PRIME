I am having mammosite/radiation done and taking femara or arimedex for 5 years. I did not want chemo. I too was told if not in the lymph nodes then we do radiation and take the femara. But then came back ER positive and they started talking chemo.The oncologist had told me from the adjuvent score on the internet that chemo would not make but a 2 -4 percent difference and I'm not going through chemo at this time for that small of a difference. Soo I am sticking with radiation and the pill for 5 years. I hope i'm doing right but feel the chemo causes more problems that the little percentage I was told it would help. But once again I did not do the oncotype scoring!!!  Good luck. I hate all these decisions and then once you feel like you know what you want to do they throw something else  out at you. I am 55 and through menopause so don't know if that makes a difference or not.",

I think the oncotype score is just something else to make your worry and get you to do chemo. Any input would be appreciated.",
