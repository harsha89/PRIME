And whenever I catch myself getting bogged down by what could happen, I take a breath and just remember to take this whole thing one day at a time.  Why ruin a good moment or afternoon or day by worrying about something worse that may or may not happen. (Yeah, sounds soooo mentally balanced, doesn't it...  I didn't say it always works!) Hugs to all who are having se's this week.  My next tx is this Friday, so I'll be with ya next week. Catherine",

I spoke with the nurse who did the infusion about some of the se's I had the first go round.  One of which was the constipation.  She gave me samples of Senokot and suggested I take them when I take vicodin for bone pain.  She also recommended Colace, so I went ahead and bought some of that.  The thing is that I didn't really have a whole lot of bone pain, and only took vicodin twice, so I'm wondering what else causes the constipation?  But she did say that stopping the meds for that as soon as I had \"movement\" was the way to go so that I could avoid the diarhea that I had last time as well. I know I'll get the balance of all of this right...yeah, as I'm completing the last treatment!  How about chemo fog?  Anyone getting that?  I know I am as my short term memory is just getting a little whacked.  This mornig I took my steroids and calcium with my breakfast.  As I was going for tx, I had to give it serious thought if I had taken the steroids or not.  Later at the pharmacy, I kept tellimg myself as I was waiting for a prescription to get filled to remember to get Tylenol.  The next thing I know, I'm the freeway...and no Tylenol.  Also, watching Jeopardy, I just sat there thinking \"Oh I know it's...uh...well...it's...ah well...what he said...\" Now I have post-it blocks in every room to either provide me with a new list, or to remind me of something.  Also noticed my tongue starting to have that numb feeling already.  Tomorrow is Neulasta shot day...At least I'll remember to have it in the stomach. Just need to remember the Claritin!  I forgot how the first days of treatment are filled with managing the meds...crazy...  Okay, now I'm just rambling, so...  Big hugs to all of us!",

I also developed hives while I was on Taxotere.  It was really bad after my second tx, but only managed to flare up sporadically after other tx's.  One place where I noticed it more often than not was on my hands.  I just had to force myself not to itch and used cortisone creme.  It's also something that hasn't come back since I finished chemo. No parades here either, I'm afraid.  Although a friend of mine ran in the LA marathon today, so a different sort of parade. And all of the mothers out there...seriously, where are you getting this energy?  I just finished rads last Friday, and I feel like a slug.

I know how you feel.  The freakouts are almost worse than the physcial side effects because you can't stop yourself from thinking.  Here's my take on the mets issue.  I asked my onc when I was first diagnosed how long it took for the lump to become cancerous.  I asked because I had discovered the lump on my own and it had a certain texture to it that was described as being benign in nature.  From the time I had met with my PCP about it and my scheduled mammogarm, I went out of town for a two weeks.  During that time, I noticed the nature of the lump had changed.  I freaked out becasue I thought that it happened really fast.  So I asked my onc when it was diagnosed.  He said that the cancer cells can collect and be \"dormant\" for years or that it could take years before a tumor becomes malignant.  So, if that's the case, and we have just come out of chemo which has zapped whatever remaining cancer cells may have strayed, I don't think the timetable is such that any of us would see mets at this point.  Now that's just my opinion...no basis in medical fact, but it just seems to make sense to me.   And while you may be paranoid...well, d'uh of course you're paranoid!  But just take a breath and try to work out some of your fears out rationally if you can.  Don't freak out because of information that you don't know. But know that if you do freak out, you can always do it here. Catherine  ",

For those of you still under the spell of chemo or radiation, let me just say that I'm a month post rads.  My energy levels have returned to normal.  Most things have normalized somewhat.  On the hair issue, I never lost all of my hair or lashes (4tx's of TC).  Now my hair on my legs grows like crazy.  On my head, my hair looks like a bathing cap from the fifties, only  made of hair.  It's very full, but also very soft, like a plush toy. The only off thing I've noticed are the resumption of my periods.  They're not really periods, but spotting that lasted for about two weeks last month, and now seems to have started again two weeks later, but still just the spotting. Now I'm just waiting for the tamoxifen to be delivered, and then that train will start. Wow...I still can't believe the Jewels are done.  I couldn't have gotten through it without all of you.  I don't know how others did before there was this website.  Every post from every one of you was either informative, insightful, inspiring, comforting, funny...  But most of all, the comfort of being surrounded by others and not feeling alone even when you knew on some basic level you were alone.  How can you even begin to quantify or even qualify how much of an impact that can have?  I have so much love and gratitude for all of my fellow jewels.

The first round?  Yeah, it kicked my ass a bit.  But it seems so long ago since I've recovered for the most part since then.  Also, there is some solace in knowing it could have gone a lot worse if I hadn't taken the advice I got from these discussion boards: Things like taking Claritin the day of the Neulasta shot.  Also had the Neulasta shot in the stomach. and disn't seem to notice too much of the bone pain I had read about.  Biotene...man, did that save me.  On the worst days, I was swilling that mouthwash 10-12 times a day.  Also, Dan Active yoghurt drink and organic yogurt with pro-biotics really helped with stomach issues.  What did and didn't help was taking Vicodin at the first sign of bone pain--it helped to offset the pain, but it brought on constipation.  I normally take Smooth Move herbal tea for constipation and it failed to have an effect.  I had to rely on Ex Lax, but that then brought on diarhea. At the time, I thought I had discovered Dante's lost ring of hell, but a week later, it seems like an episode that happened to someone else...only I know I'll have to get through it three more times.  And being prepared helps, if only psychologically. Right now I'm doing the countdown to hair fallout.  I already had my hair cut short as a transitional thing, but seeing no hair on my head is something I'll need to come to terms with.  I was sort of looking forward to buying all sorts of warm and fuzzy hats to wear...but then Los Angeles is in the middle of a heat spurt, so go figure.  I haven't looked into scarves, although a lot of you seem to be finding things that you like.  I've noticed that this week I've been getting headaches, which I rarely got before.  Could this be the beginning signs of hair loss?   Regarding the hair loss...I get the feeling that this part of the whole treatment is what is going to bring the breast cancer issue home for me.  Until now, all the appointments, tests, even the lumpectomy were relatively easy things to experience, although I would have rather not had to (well, you all know what I mean).  Even the chemo could be ascribed to one bad week of feeling like crap.  But the hair loss?  And while part of it is vanity, the major part of it is that it will be something tangible that I'll see everytime I see my reflection.  Intellectually, I know it's temporary and it's nothing to be ashamed of, and if I just sit and think it through I convince myself that it's no big deal, and it could certainly be worse.  Just typing it out now, it occurs to me that most of you have already had more challenges just with the surgery aspects of breast cancer.  Yeah, okay, I'll just leave it at that. Okay, I think that's it for now.  For the record, I'm 43, live in the Los Angeles area just south of Glendale.  I was diagnosed in October, had a lumpectomy in November...and started chemo this month.  Lastly, I am so grateful to have found this site. ",

Honestly, at one point I had all of this explained, and researched here as well, but as I type it out now, it still feels like a foreign language.  From what I understand, the main component that dictated my course of treatment was the Ki67 number.  There were two other factors, but for some reason, the Ki67 seemed to be dominant.  This week has been one of relative normalcy for me.  Are you still taking meds for side effects?  I hope not...really, the saving grace for me has been that the side effects all came in the first week, but by day 7, I was fatigued but things got better with each passing day.",

One thing I've noticed is that people seem to have different treatment regimens and prescriptions.  So I was wondering what the specifics were in the differences.  My onc said my treatment was relatively agressive because of my age and state of health, thinking that my body could handle it, but it seems like others have a stronger regimen than I.  So, I ws wondering what you all had for your treatment?  I'm doing 4 doses of Taxotere and Cytoxan every 21 days that includes emend and dexamethasone before during and after the infusion with Kytril also injected the day of.  Plus the nurses gave me 3 extra days of kytril samples to take with me(I called it my \"medical swag\")  Then the next day I have a Neulasta shot. My reaction and side effects seem almost textbook from what I've researched here, which has been great since I had been able to use a lot of tips to alleviate side effects.  Tonight I noticed that feeling in my scalp that resembles how your hair feels after you have had a ponytail all day and you finally release the hair.  This may be the weekend where I have my neighbor come in and shave my head.  Maybe I'll save that fun for Innauguration Day?",

I aslo wanted to give thanks for all who are a tx ahead of me.  LisaLisa comes to mind, but I know there are others.  It's nice to have a bit of a \"coming attractions\" in terms of what you are experiencing.  It also helps in being pre-emptive, which I've found helps a lot rather than having to play catch up with the various side effects. The hair thing...I have to admit that I also find that whole process weird and interesting in a clinical way.  Clumps of hair that simply come out when you run your fingers through it.  I hear Johnny Carson in my head saying: \"That is some wild stuff...\" every time I look at the hair in my hand. Also on the local news in Southern California, they reported the first case of this season's flu.  Just the news you want to hear when you know your immune system is compromised.  My onc gave me a bit of good news with my last bloodwork results saying that my levels were such that it was if I never had the chemo, so I'm hoping that continues.  As I go through this whole process, my heart and admiriation goes out to all of you with children.  I'm single and found that on the worst days, there was no way I could have handled the demands or the energy needed to deal with anyone.  I snapped at my cat once who wanted his daily \"treats\" and didn't appreciate them being late...and then felt guilty...okay, it was a really tired type of guilt, but the snapping was also really fatigued, so...  I was wondering if any of you had weird food cravings the day after the Neulasta shot?  On my first tx (on Sat), the day after, a friend mentioned to me that he had a Subway sandwhich for lunch.  It has been years since I had a Subway sandwhich and it was all I could think about.  Fatigue started to hit me as well, and my neighbor was nice enough to drive me to the nearest Subway where I ordered like I was never going to eat again...double meats, all the toppings.  It turned out to be the dumbest food choice I could have made with it sitting in my stomach just as I was feeling constipated from Vicodin which I took to ward off bone pain.  Well, if nothing else, it gave me a note to self:  watch what you eat on days 2-4 after treatment. Here's hoping for as minor se's as possible for us in the coming week! Catherine",

The big cumulative effect for me is the fatigue...and the heat flashes that emanate from my head and shoulders.  They're probably not as severe as what I think menopausal hot flashes would be, and I'm 43 so I don't know...maybe they are?  But I have always been temperature sensitive, and at night they feel sort of good when I'm feeling chilly.  Maybe this is also the way my body chooses to help to flush out the chemicals.  And, I've mentioned this before, but after catching up on some of the posts, I've got to send a big shout out, kudos, stadium wave, you name it to all of you who are doing this with families, or creating opportunites to turn this health lemon into lemonade.  LisaLisa...Best of luck with your latest, and I want to see you hitting the talk show circuits! My mom told me analogy that she applied to life, but I think also works for breat cancer treatment:  It's like a roll od toilet paper.  At first it seems to take longer to make a dent in the roll, but the more you use it on a daily basis, the roll gets smaller and smaller, and befroe you know it, the paper flies off the roll and then you're at the end. So, here's to everyone approaching the end of the roll...it gets faster and faster each day!",

Also, I noticed that there was talk of a get together.  Just an FYI, that there's also a thread called the Ta Ta Sisterhood something or other that is planning a trip to Vegas in September as well.  It wouldn't be as intimate a group, but there is the benefit of numbers for discounts.  Just putting it out there...   Catherine",

LisaLisa...just voted for you!  If they could only read your postings here on this site, then there would be NO QUESTION as to whom they should choose.  NONE!  Your essay was pretty damned impressive.  You should get this.  I want you to get this. About the meltdowns...Have them.  Throw yourself into them.  The amount of stress we have subconsciously repressed for ourselves, our loved ones...random strangers...  It needs an outlet.  My fourth week after my final TC treatment and about a week before rads were to start, I was an emotional  wreck.  I could only envision the negative outcomes to anything and I went from zero to sixty in seconds flat in what I imagined could be/go wrong with almost everything.  Intellectually, I knew I was driving myself nuts for no reason, but I couldn't stop it, which made me feel even worse and wondering if this was my new reality.  My energy levels were the lowest they had ever been on chemo and I had zero appettite.  I live alone, so there was no one to make me food, and I couldn't find myself to be bothered.  At the time, all I had any interest in was watching the Travel Channel, FaceBook and this website.  The only thing I didn't have apathy for was the fear that I was heading into this self-feeding decline, both mentally and physically.  Trying to explain this to people on the phone just sent me into tears of frustration and...well, fear.  I also lost seven pounds in the course of a week.  So, you see, I wasn't in the best of places.  I kept thinking of my surgeon and my onc saying how well I had fared through chemo.  \"Sailed through\" was one phrase that almost taunted me.  Here it was so far past my last chemo and this was the time I should have been really feeling good and healing before I headed into rads.  The way I was feeling, I seriously doubted I could have managed to have made it to the hospital everyday for tx. But it passed.  Even typing it all out here, I am amazed at what a bad place I was in at that time.  I was able to get my diet back on track.  I also had to have two wisdom teeth pulled since one broke and then turned black during chemo.  I think I may have been infected from that since my energy levels started to improve almost the day after I started antibiotics.  But I digress... As we near the end of chemo, it's hard to say all the things we managed to compartmentalize from the moment we were diagnosed.  And chemo is SUCH a big deal that we have all had our own demons with it.  It's been hammered into us from all directions.  I can remember watching Terms of Endearment as a kid and having the image of the dinner party scene where someone whispers something like \"she's got cancer...\"  Whether we admit or not, we all got hit with something that is easily most people's biggest fear if not just our own...and we are dealing with it.  It's HUGE psychologically.  We all know that we have worn that positive face if only to allay other's fears about us, and it's worked at helping us get through the worst parts of it.  But having the crying jags helps too, believe it or not.  Stress hormones are released through our tear ducts.  Sometimes that's the only way they can.  I feel for everyone that is having the meltdowns.  It was the one thing that really sort of broke me in my treatment.  But it turned out to be a temporary thing.  You'll see.  And if you feel you need to speak to someone, then do so.  But I found that just being on these boards and knowing that I wasn't a freak for how I was feeling, that there were others who had seen the other side of whatever I was going through helped to put the freak outs in perspective. Not to mention that our hormonal systems have been given such a thwack, that it's no wonder we can't control some of the thoughts we have.  It took me 10 days to do taxes that normally take a weekend tops.  Mentally, we're not at our strongest.  Acknowldege your fears, but also try to remind yourself that you're not in the best mental state to be giving it serious thought either way.  Ever since I started chemo waaaaaay back in January, the two phrases I've heard the most in my head have been my onc's voice saying \"blame it on chemo...\" and Scarlett O'Hara's \"I won't worry about that now, I'll think about that tomorrow.\" There is no standard timeline for recovery physically or mentally.  We all have seen that already.  And mental side effects are an important part of this.  We'd be inhuman if we didn't have the fears that we have.  It's never going to leave us, but it does get better.  We're all such strong women, we're just a bit compromised right now mentally.   I tell my friends that right now I'm an easy target for mockery with my chemobrain, but to watch out because this time next year, I'll be back to my full capacity and I won't let them get away with what they're getting away with now.  Of course it's all in jest, but you know what?  I should tell myself this more often as well.  This time next year, I won't be such an easy target for the emotional fears.  And I know that it's true. Okay, that was so much more than \"my two cents\" that I had planned on posting.  But with the economy the way it is, it'll probably only spend about as far as the two cents would have anyway.

Compared to what I've read, I've been fortunate(and grateful) that my se's were what they were.  Don't get me wrong, se's were a bitch, but by no means what some of you have endured.  Someone mentioned that their onc was of the \"blame it on chemo\" school of explaining all those little things that rear it's head while we are being pumped full of chemicals.  My onc is the same way.  During tx, I found this to be a bit frustrating as every time I had something new happen, it freaked me out.  However in retrospect, I could mentally calm myself down by telling myself that it was the chemo...just blame it on the chemo...and most of the \"out of left field\" things would pass or clear up on their own or with a simple OTC remedy.  Having said that, can we talk about chemo brain?  It's been two weeks since my last(literally) tx, and I don't know if it's the energy level thing...which fluctuates during the day or if it's one of those cumulative se's but sometimes it's really hard to keep focus on anything.  Seriously, when I come to this site and catch up on the posts, I find that I'm mentally spent after a few pages.  Composing this post alone has taken me a while because I'll find myself just zoning out.  Physically, I can sort of see the \"being normal\" light at the end of the tunnel, but mentally I feel like I've lost more than a few IQ points.  On the upside is that I've learned not to give too much thought to things that could be considered a waste of thought like negativity or fear of things out of my control.  But on the downside is that more and more things are getting pushed into that category of \"ugh...I don't have the energy to deal with this.\"  Especially things like taxes...ugh!  I've never been a numbers person, and I thank whoever created Turbotax, but, jeez even the trying to do a little bit everyday is a pain in ass...a taxing pain the ass. Also, the hot flashes and body temperature changes...annoying.  One of the hardest things about finishing chemo is that you know things will start to get better and better, and this is certainly true...but you just want it faster than it happens.  And you sort of feel like you're being teased by the better health fairy.  At least that's what I've been going through this past week. For example, I've had days this week where I felt what I imagined I felt before all of this happened, and then boom, this wave of fatigue hits out of nowhere or the flush of heat/cold goes crazy...or I find myself staring at a blinking cursor for who knows how long...  Okay, I think at the end of this I do want to say congrats to those of you who have finished your chemo(yay-clap clap).  For those of you still doing it, I am cheering for ya...hard because we all know that chemo totally sucks, the se's suck, hell, being in this whole situation...yeah, it sucks!  And as supportive as others are, unless you have been in our position it's hard to explain on the myriad levels just how awful this road can be.  But you know what...it does end, it does get better, maybe not as fast as we want...but it does.  And we have all been fortunate to have a place like this to connect with others who may not \"know\" who we are, but somehow know who we are and know what we're going through.

My sympathies go out to you married ones.  Even if your husband is a saint, you can't stop yourself from the thinking about the sexual issues.

Diane--Sorry to hear about the deflation.  But you know what?  This is just one summer.  It's gonna suck on some level no matter what our situations in comparison to what we thought it was going to be a year ago.  But it's just one summer.  There will be others. Also to everyone finsishing chemo and about to start rads, for some reason I went into a real dark funk in the weeks between.  Just an FYI.  I wasn't on tamox, I can't really say why exaclty, but there's something about doing rads that has a weid effect on some people.  I've noticed it on other forums with people who started rads in March and April.  Not all of us, but enough that you can't help but notice.  So, maybe that'll help in not making you freak out more than necessary because you find yourself in a bad place mentally.  Just an FYI. And yeah, it is nice to see the thread get less active.  Wow, January...can't believe how long ago that seems on so many levels. I couldn't have been able to say that with all of you Jewels.

I did want to mention to everyone to go to Lifetime.com and sign the petition about legislation pending about mastectomy and hospital stays.  They are trying to pass a bil making a mastectomy an outpatient procedure.  That seems crazy to me.  I had a lumpectomy, so I can see that being outpatient, but with ports and LE issues, this bill seems ridiclulous to me.  I believe the petition is to require a mandatory 2 day hosptital stay covered by health insurance. Okay, gotta take a neighbor to the airport early tomorrow, so I'm going to head out.

The responses about the petition have been illuminating and funny.  I have to preface that I didn't have a mastectomy, so I'm not aware of what post op was like, but a lot of people felt like they wanted to get the hell outta Dodge afterwards.  I totally understand that and felt the same way after my lumpectomy.  I just thought I would put the word out there...
