After I met with the plastic surgeon August 4th, they said they would talk with my breast surgeon and schedule me \"as soon as possible\". So I figured I'd be able to get in within a couple weeks of that day at the latest and hopefully be able to be healed enough to be able to perform at the end of September. When they called me on August 8th to tell me that my surgery was scheduled for September 19th, I actually asked them to push the appointment one more week if possible. I figured if we've waited this long, I might as well wait one more week so I could perform in this play I've been working on so long. I've been very thankful to have the play as a distraction for me all this time and it would pretty much crush me if I wasn't able to perform. I mean, given how cancer usually grows, by the time we figure out we have cancer, we've had it for years already at this point, right? What's one more week? Ha.",

Positive for cancer in both locations. By how quickly my cancer grew, they're guessing I'm going to be triple negative. The mass in my left breast is 5x5.3x3.2 cm. Especially huge when I am probably not even a full A cup gal. I see everyone's diagnoses and see their tiny tumor sizes and it makes me so nervous. The fact that my tumor in my breast is so large really freaks me out that the cancer has had time to spread throughout my body undetected. They're working on scheduling an MRI, but I know it's just looking at the breast area. My GP had me go for a chest xray when she first saw me for the lump, would that have shown if there were tumors anywhere else in my chest or in my bones? I'm 32 so they're also scheduling me for genetic testing. I have three boys, 6.5, 5, and 3 years old. I've never smoked, I'm not overweight. I want to be confident that I'm in relatively good health aside from cancer, so I want to believe that my treatment will be successful. Since my initial appointments for all of this mess, I've been trying to eat as healthy as possible because that's the only thing I have control over right now. Any words of wisdom are appreciated. I know we'll know more as additional details of my diagnosis come out, but of course I'm impatient. :) Dx 6/29/2017, IDC, Left, 3cm, Stage IIB, Grade 3, 2/14 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

I thought that was absurd, but they keep telling me how slow moving breast cancer is and because I'm not triple negative, they said there isn't any reason to rush. There isn't even any further testing to do. My appointment is just that far out. Drives me nuts but I'm just taking the time to clean the house and get everything set to prepare for being out of commission for a while.",

Nothing in the right as of right now. So she's planning on doing a mastectomy on the left side. Surprisingly, she offered me a nipple-sparing mastectomy. Oddly enough, I was excited to lose the nipple because I hate how nipples poke through shirts if you don't wear the right bra, so I told her not to worry about it. She laughed and looked kind of relieved because she said nipple-sparing surgery is more difficult because she has a much smaller incision to work with. I'm planning to get cool tattoos anyway, so the nipple wasn't a big deal for me. I wish they'd just remove the right nipple now too! LOL",

MRI this upcoming Saturday will hopefully show us that the cancer hasn't spread past the nodes. Because I'm 32 years old, they're probably also going to send me for genetic testing. My guess is that I'll have chemo prior to mastectomy (definitely mastectomy because I'm barely an A cup and my tumor is so large). If genetic testing is positive for gene mutation, I would imagine they'd recommend double mastectomy which I would be just fine with.",

      "Content": "ElleElleBee wrote: I am 32 years old, a non-smoker, breastfed my three kids. About a month ago, I felt a lump in my armpit. It took me two weeks to call the doctor (because I had had strep throat and thought naively that it could be swollen from that) and it took them another two weeks for them to see me. This past Monday (6/19/17), I saw my general practitioner and she instantly called in backup. The two of them were both very concerned. She then also found some concerning spots in my lower left breast. She scheduled blood work, a chest xray, a mammogram, and ultrasound. I had the blood work and chest xray that came back completely normal. Yesterday (6/22/17) I had the mammogram and ultrasound. Below are the results: At the 8 to 9:00 position at mid to posterior depth, there is a large grouping of pleomorphiccalcifications. This area corresponds to the provider reported palpable abnormality. The area of the suspicious calcifications span a distance of 5 x 5.3 x 3.5 cm (AP, transverse, CC). As this area was also reported to be palpable by the provider, ultrasound will be performed in the left axilla and at the 8 to 9:00 position. In the left axilla 12 cm from the nipple corresponding to the patient reported palpable abnormality, there is an enlarged, markedly abnormal appearing axillary lymph node with a loss of fatty hilum. There is minimal central vascularity remaining. The lymph node measures 3.8 x 2.3 x 1.9 cm. At the 8 to 9:00 position 4 cm from the nipple, corresponding to the provider reported palpable finding, there is a heterogeneous hypoechoic mass with peripheral vascularity. Numerous echogenic foci are identified within the mass. This mass likely corresponds to the suspicious grouping of calcifications on mammography. The extent of calcifications on mammography is larger than the measured mass on ultrasound. ASSESSMENT: Highly suggestive of malignancy BI-RADS 5 (OVERALL) Mammo Diagnostic Bilateral: Highly suggestive of malignancy BI-RADS 5 - Left. Mammo Diagnostic Bilateral: Negative BI-RADS 1 - Right. US Breast Unilateral Limited - Left: Highly suggestive of malignancy BI-RADS 5. My biopsies are scheduled for this upcoming Wednesday (6/28/17) which feels like forever away. I just need to talk to real people. Obviously the internet is full of terribly foreboding information. All of the above information looks really terrible. I have a regular annual checkup and my last one was only a few months ago and nothing abnormal was found during that exam, though because I'm 32 with nearly no risk factors, I'm afraid a thorough examination wasn't done.
