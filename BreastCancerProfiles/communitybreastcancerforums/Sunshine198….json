(What kind of treatment do you need?). Really happy that you posted a reply. Mine is also still sore and the operation was back in june... Is your ridge along the scarline or more perpendicular? My surgeon also noted up front that she would move things around. But after the surgery nobody felt the ridge. But it cannot be cancer, because the pathology and ultrasound in september was fine. I just really hate that i went in to remove a lumpy ridgy area and now i am still stuck with a lumpy ridgy area..... Just so frustrating.",

I dont think it changed, but only found it recently. I am sure the radiologist is experienced but you can never tell without a FNA. Do you have any experience with that? I would say; just stick a needle in it and then i know for sure, but maybe that is overkill for now. Is fna an invasive procedure?",
