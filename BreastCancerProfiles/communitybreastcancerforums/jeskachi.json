There might be other things at play here that she hasn't told you, but it all seems a little odd to me. Maybe she should seek a second opinion--on everything.",

Surgery is surgery. Radiation is no picnic (so I've heard), and can have long-term consequences that simple mastectomy won't. As for psychological health... who's to say that having a disfigured breast from lumpectomy isn't going to be more traumatic than total mastectomy? Or that having one natural breast and one reconstructed breast is better than having 2 reconstructed breasts?  Personally, the thought of going through life lopsided or noticeably different on one side was much scarier to me than doing both at one time.There's a loss associated with not having natural nipples, yes, but are doctors really that concerned about our sex lives? I just don't get it.",
