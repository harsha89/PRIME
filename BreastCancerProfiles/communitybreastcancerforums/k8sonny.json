I am seeking advice regarding my upcoming, and dreaded, surgery to swap out tissue expanders for implants.  My recovery from my bilateral mastectomy was far harder than I had been led to believe, and I am NOT excited about going through that again for the implant surgery, much as I dislike the rocklike sensation of tissue expanders.  May I have the benefit of your experience?  Do you stay over in the hospital again? Do you have the same pain and burning sensations (that have now subsided after the BMX -- don't want them back, thank you)? I was on Percocet for weeks -- difficult with 2 preschoolers who need driving around -- will I need it again for weeks? Drains... again? Thank you! Stage 1A IDC and extensive DCIS Feb '11, BMX Apr '11, 3 tumors (under 1cm). ER+/PR+, HER-. No nodes. Had 1A melanoma 2010 and 2A Hodgkins Lymphoma 1984, and benign thyroid (2008) and salivary (2004) gland growths. Cancer, leave me ALONE! Log in to post a reply",

I am not alone!  The weird cold sensation when drinking a beverage, the creepy burning skin sensation (like when you have the flu), super bothersome armpit pain (like razor stubble on a sunburn), and the strange lack of information from my otherwise fantastic surgeon.  Hello, gals!  So, my deal is: about 4 weeks post double mastectomy. Stage 1. This is my third time with cancer, different kinds, but I am told we got it all and not to expect recurrence.  Which is great, but I can't seem to get off the Percocet.  Not because I am addicted (though this worries me) but because the skin pain is so awful. I just returned to the Y for some working out, and this helped some.  Thanks so much for starting this discussion; I will read everything on here!",

But suddenly around 5 or 6 weeeks, I noticed it had subsided.  I am now 3 months out and actually pretty comfortable.  I have been doing a lot of stretching and arm exercises (lat pulldowns) and lying on my back trying to do snow angels.  Snow angels actually do still hurt a lot, but I had (unrelated) shoulder pain prior to surgery which I had mostly gotten rid of with exercise and stretching, so I think perhaps the current pain is that I had to take several months off from working out. Ditto on the swimmming issues though.  A year ago I could easily swim a mile freestyle.  Now i can only do a few laps freestyle.  I believe in my case at least that I regress if i don't exercise, so I just have to get in there and do it.",

I have to say that all of you were right; the pain after exchange surgery is far less than after the BMX.  But very stiff thru shoulders still.   I had posted earlier that lots of backstroke was helping my shoulders. I haven't been swimming in 2 weeks, and my shoulders actually feel better.  Now I wonder if I was overdoing it. I checked out a few websites (google:\"shoulder impingement\") and they all say to avoid raising the affected arm higher than shoulder height.  It feels like a quandary though: the injury remains if I don't exercise it, and if I exercise it, it hurts! Boo!  Now I am thinking to take your advice again and try massage.  After I recover, anyway!",

Like, is breast tissue particularly insulating?  I feel freezing all the time now, which exacerbates the fire ants and irritated skin sensation.  Bleh.",
