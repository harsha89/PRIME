I had right DCIS, lumpectomy, and now six weeks of radiation to be followed by 5 years of tamoxifen, which I'm still not crazy about. Yesterday I completed 10 of 30 treatments. I've been experiencing pain in the rib area (the ribs across the top of the breast - those are ribs, I'm told), skin is pretty red and woke up today with several blisters under the breast. I've been using a cream from the rad onc and he told me to use cornstarch. I've been using the cream but the cornstarch gets on everything. I'll try the aloe vera that you all have been talking about. I'm pretty frustrated right now. My breast surgeon wrote the tamoxifen prescription and didn't refer me to a med onc, just the rad onc. I've been trying for two weeks to get a call back from a med onc that two friends recommended independently. I hear he's great. I'd like to ask about the tamoxifen SE. I have too much uterine cancer in my family history to feel comfortable taking the tamoxifen. I don't know if I should go that route and have a hysterectomy (I'm 43 and done having children) or try a different drug. I'm not about to start the tamoxifen without talking to a med onc. Of course, I have four more weeks to figure it out. Any advice on drug therapy, anyone? I'm glad this is here. I work full-time and have a supportive boss but I also put in a lot of hours. I have three children and a husband whose job is also demanding.  I'm pretty tired today and although I'm going to our region's \"best cancer hospital\" that people praise, I'm saddened (but not shocked) by how impersonal all of it is.  I was told by one rad tech that she'd be \"my constant\" (her words) and with me the whole time. I saw her for the first two treatments and the one yesterday (of 10). I've had at least five other techs (they work in pairs) in addition to her.  It's a rather surreal experience. I lost my mom to breast cancer twelve years ago; she had it at age 45 (mastectomy), 56 (another mastectomy), and died when it moved from her bones to her liver at 61. I know great strides have been made, so I trust that her story doesn't have to be mine, though she was a very strong woman. Thanks for reading this.  God bless all of you.",
