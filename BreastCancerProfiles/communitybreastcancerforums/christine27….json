I am being fobbed off because my breast doesn't look overly different, but i know that it has grown slightly, feels heavier and hurts constantly and until i am told exactly why this is happening i will not give up. If you are not happy with how your situation has been left, seek a second opinion.x",

I myself am not convinced that its the case for me. It is affecting my shoulder and arm and i can feel it all rapidly getting worse and i find it hard to believe it could all be hormonal. It makes me so mad that they think because we are young it couldn't possibly be cancer. Surely we have the right to find out one way or another!x",

Have had problems with my left breast for nearly two months and i know there is something wrong and have been fobbed off with it being hormones which i know is utter crap. Keep pushing as i am.
