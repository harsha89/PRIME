I had bad pains (but no fractures) which I attributed to the double whammy of Zometa and Femara. We tapered off the annual dose where we started at every three weeks going to quarterly and biannually and annually. You have to weigh the risks and benefits in the context of NED and the fractures you already have. Definitely ask for PT and also get a second opinion. One opinion I had was to only go for Zometa two years. Now I am on Tamoxifen so probably won't be getting Zometa again. I did do a lot of weight training to strengthen my bones. I am still NED (with only one bone lesion before treatment) and my DEXA bone density scans indicate my bones are stronger than they have ever been where I was osteopenic before BC.

Another idea is something I just read about: an antimalarial drug called artesunate which may help shrink tumors. I read in your biography that you have Sjogren's. Artesunate is used for Sjogren's, so maybe it could kill two birds with one stone? Ask your doctor if this could possibly work for you. Maybe it's contraindicated, but asking won't hurt. We pay doctors to think about treatment strategies, not devise timelines! Love, peace and strength to get you through these difficult times, and maybe another 8 years!!",

This scenario, however, does not apply to immunotherapies because the immune system can \"replicate and evolve\". Hey, just like cancer. So there's hope there. Something similar to the mathermatical model for resistance used here might be developed for cycling through different therapies. Maybe the authors could come up with a predictive model to guide when a switch should be made. The model and article shown may take me a while to dissect together with a bottle of aspirin. Yes, this is my current combination therapy, which is supposed to be better than sequential therapy. Kidding aside, I wish they would get the data for breast cancer. For my n of 1 case I did cycle through 7 different drugs without any progression (taxotere, cytoxan, adriamycin, zometa in combination as first line therapy and femara, tamoxifen, arimidex, tamoxifen again, sequentially). I also took drug holidays every once in a while, to get back some quality of life and some estrogen. Maybe the latter also killed some cancer cells or at least resensitized them to antihormonals.",

Early on I did get a one-month break by changing from Femara to Arimidex then going back to Femara. That somehow helped. The next time I was supposed to take a break with Tamoxifen. I decided not to take anything instead for that month. That helped even more. These occasional breaks helped me to get through 4.5 years of mostly taking Femara. My onc then switched me to Tamoxifen after I told him I had to have surgery to re-attach the gel at the back of my eye. That lasted 2 years until I had to have surgery for the other eye. This time I was switched to Arimidex. Since then I've switched back to Tamoxifen because I felt Arimidex was responsible for my neck being so stiff that I overextended it while having a mammogram and was dealing with nerve damage and painful trigger points as a result. As for Zometa, I always felt it made everything worse so always tried to push back my appointments, going from every three weeks (with chemo) to monthly, bimonthly, quarterly, half-yearly, annually. For the regular aches and pains, ibuprofen has helped me. If it's possible to exercise, preferrably low-impact, this will help a lot for arthralgias. I used to limp to the gym but felt much better after moving my joints on an exercise bike or elliptical or taking a walk in the woods.",

In this case it was the greater toxicity of letrozole to blame. The solution was to switch from AI to Tamoxifen or vice-versa to reduce cumulative toxicity. Letrozole is a good drug so, personally, I'd go for PFS/DFS in general (like pajim's current onc editor) and switch before you have too much toxicity or cellular adaptations. We need to develop biomarkers for the latter, pronto!",

This seems to have happened in my case as I am aerobically fitter now than I was even before diagnosis. Perhaps this would not be true for everyone. We are all different. It's worth asking how much damage and how long before injury is healed. Our organs can regenerate under certain circumstances. Maybe consult a lung specialist as well? Wishing you all the best.",

This despite the fact that I got Neulasta one or two cycles and was injecting myself with Neupogen thereafter. For red cells I ate a lot of beef and liver. I would also go up to the mountains to raise my red cell counts. Garlic is good for fighting infections in general. Unfortunately I had mucositis so it hurt to eat anything garlicky. If you can exercise at all outdoors, great. If you can't, try deep breathing exercises outdoors. Exercise lets immune cells circulate faster, ie, be more efficient. So the few cells I had had to work much harder. Oxygen helps generate new blood cells. Supposedly acupuncture can also help with immune markers.

TNBC is believed to be more immunogenic. Herceptin for HER2+ is a targeted immunotherapy. Given long survival times/ high cure rates for early stage BC it would seem some kind of immunosurvelllance kicks in. It has been shown that BC patients who have an immune reaction to their tumor tissue are NED for much longer than those who do not have an immune reaction. I like the Stanford approach because it's local treatment and can be repeated. Recurrence in people after a long period of NED seems to indicate something can go awry with immunosurveillance. For those lacking t cells in tumors, maybe it's possible to engineer one's T cells and introduce those into the tumor, somewhat like local CAR-T therapy. In the absence of tumors (my case), early diagnosis of recurrence would seem to be a high priority or a vaccine.  ",

      "Content": "Dec 23, 2016 05:34AM - edited Dec 23, 2016 05:36AM by Heidihill I'd like to share here as this is my 10th Christmas since diagnosis of stage 4 de novo. I've stayed NED for almost nine years and that is I suppose the circular secret to my longevity. I do think NED is in many ways just a form of stable, but not visible to scanning. Maybe there are folks whose cancers are in a deeper sleep than others or unable to multiply for some reason or unable to develop resistance to treatment. I could be in any one of those groups. I believe bone, gut and liver health are important for us in addition to estrogen deprivation for ER+ disease to prevent recurrence/progression. On the latter, I've had Femara, Arimidex and Tamoxifen (after chemo, radiation and surgery), switching due to side effects. At the time, Afinitor and Ibrance were not yet available. For my bones and initial bone mets, I had 5 years of Zometa. I also started exercising daily, including lifting weights, to supplement the Zometa. I was worried that Zometa prevents bone breakdown but does not by itself build new bone, unlike exercise, and important for immune health. Exercise also regulates estrogen levels, as in women athletes who stop having periods. Some more recent evidence of that here: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/05/130507061143.htm. Also as a way of regulating estrogen I started eating 7-10 portions of fruits and vegetables daily. https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/09/140911135316.htm Which helped me lose some weight, another risk factor which I forgot to mention. Didn't have much room for sweets and refined carbs with all that bulk. At some point I tried intermittent fasting for a whole year except for vacations. I starved myself from 7 pm to 12 pm. I did improve my metabolic health, lowering my blood glucose levels as a result. I hoped to starve cancer cells and maybe some did get hit as this study suggests: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/12/161221111246.htm Tumor suppressors seem to accumulate in mouse liver as a result of food withdrawal. Together with a having a good diet, I also try to get 7-8 hours sleep and limit alcohol intake. From the NY Times: I'm not very good during the holidays but I do try to reset my circadian clock by going for long walks in the morning.",

The process made sense to me and probably made it more tolerable. I also exercised my arms and chest to get blood flowing in there. Exercise also helped relieve pain. You should ask your doctor first before starting an exercise program. Maybe he could refer you to a physiotherapist familiar with breast issues (including lymphedema). BTW both aspirin and exercise could also reduce your risk of recurrence!",

This is a shorter piece by the same author. http://noetic.org/noetic/issue-seventeen-december/unexpected-remission/  Spontaneous regressions have been documented in the medical literature, often in conjunction with fevers. Some examples, even metastatic cases: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3312698/  In my case (6 years NED) it could have been the many fevers I got while on chemo, the infections after chemo. It could be #1 the change in diet - more fruits and vegetables than I'd ever eaten in my life - and exercising daily. Vigorous exercises produces 15 to 20 times more heat than at resting levels.  ...Fever is a state in which body's own antigen recognition mechanism turns on to such a high level of activity that it becomes capable of recognizing cancer and microbial invaders. Specialized cells like the dendritic cells then communicate the identity of the pathogen to lymphocytes to establish active immunity against stealth diseases. Fever plays a beneficial role when body's immunity is challenged, and helps in the natural destruction of cancer cells. Cellular damage occurs only at temperatures above 108°F, but much good is accomplished at lower temperatures. Not to forget Femara and Tamoxifen as well as #2 to #9. Although I'm not sure about releasing suppressed emotions. Until they figure out how to induce a permanent remission, if there is such a thing, I'll have to hope my casting a wide net keeps working for me.       ",

It gives more information about what treatments a person might have had or not, survival and progression stats make more sense, it helps with gauging the aggressiveness of someone's cancer. For this Forum I think it should be up to the person if she wants to share all that information. So it should be fine to just put Stage IV even if you're really not. If you go for the unchanging stage, don't forget to put mets or add a new diagnosis with mets. As for all the cancers that arise from a primary, I think that in other parts of the world people say secondary bone or whatever cancer and sometimes leave the secondary out. Confusing if you don't know the context.",

I went several times to a place of pilgrimage and found peace there. It helped me to know that so many family members, friends and strangers were praying for me. A friend kept telling me to \"claim\" my good health from God. Can't say I really ever understood that part. But I claimed whatever I could for my 7 year old daughter. She is now 11. The one thing I changed drastically in my life was the amount of exercise I got. I used to go once or twice a week to the gym before cancer but as soon as I started treatment, I walked outdoors everyday or did some other exercise. This might help you too. edited to add: Sending prayers your way!!!   ",

      "Content": "Nov 16, 2017 03:07AM - edited Nov 16, 2017 03:08AM by Heidihill Congrats on being NED! Definitely, the drugs can kill cancer cells. Ovarian suppression with Lupron stops the ovaries from producing estrogen and helps \"starve\" cancer cells this way. Letrozole inhibits the enzyme in your adrenal glands (aromatase) that produce estrogen. But some cancer cells develop resistance to the drugs and mets can recur/progress. I am also one of those lucky people who has not recurred (for almost 10 years now). With my doctors approval and support I did try a number of things over the years, like aspirin, metformin, broccoli sprouts, steam rooms, massage, melatonin, intermittent fasting and exercise. With exercise being the one constant all these years. I did have a lot of circulating tumor cells at some point early in my remission but last time they checked, they had disappeared, at least from the small sample of blood taken. So I've concluded that my immune system learned how to deal with those circulating tumor cells then or the cells all entered dormancy and settled somewhere where they can no longer be seen or be bothered by the drugs given to us. I don't think I've reversed my BC but I do think that I've reversed my immune system from one that had aged and become slack to a younger, more dynamic version of itself. In any case I'm still here and doing quite well. I hope you will have a similar story to tell. Edited to add: I was on letrozole for 4.5 years.",

I also like the message being sent here so I would put them in a better category of pinkwashing. No pinkwashing to me means absolutely no profit being made from BC. Since their profit margin is probably greater than 8-10%, they may still be profiting. Glad though that you got to participate in the program, Nancy. Now I'd l ike to know more about that! ",

      "Content": "Sep 4, 2014 03:49AM - edited Sep 4, 2014 03:54AM by Heidihill if having a poor attitude leads to stress... then there MAY be a connection. ( Evidence is not that strong). Also not everyone reacts to stress in the same way. And we are not mice. http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/stress Excerpt: Evidence from experimental studies does suggest that psychological stress can affect a tumor\u2019s ability to grow and spread. For example, some studies have shown that when mice bearing human tumors were kept confined or isolated from other mice\u2014conditions that increase stress\u2014their tumors were more likely to grow and spread (metastasize). In one set of experiments, tumors transplanted into the mammary fat pads of mice had much higher rates of spread to the lungs and lymph nodes if the mice were chronically stressed than if the mice were not stressed. Studies in mice and in human cancer cells grown in the laboratory have found that the stress hormone norepinephrine, part of the body\u2019s fight-or-flight response system, may promote angiogenesis and metastasis. In another study, women with triple-negative breast cancer who had been treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy were asked about their use of beta blockers, which are medications that interfere with certain stress hormones, before and during chemotherapy. Women who reported using beta blockers had a better chance of surviving their cancer treatment without a relapse than women who did not report beta blocker use. There was no difference between the groups, however, in terms of overall survival. Although there is still no strong evidence that stress directly affects cancer outcomes, some data do suggest that patients can develop a sense of helplessness or hopelessness when stress becomes overwhelming. This response is associated with higher rates of death, although the mechanism for this outcome is unclear. It may be that people who feel helpless or hopeless do not seek treatment when they become ill, give up prematurely on or fail to adhere to potentially helpful therapy, engage in risky behaviors such as drug use, or do not maintain a healthy lifestyle, resulting in premature death. My comment: It could also be the cancer affects our brains and the more it advances the more overwhelmed we are.  The old which came first story, the chicken or the egg? Anyway it doesn't hurt it seems to use beta blockers and maybe antidepressants if that helps us relax, have a positive attitude. Maybe cannabis helps with this, too. Love your new avatar!  ",

Regarding Arimidex for Her2+, here's a blip from macmillan.org.uk: HER2 positive breast cancers tend to have less hormone receptors but some do respond to hormonal therapy. Drugs such as tamoxifen|, anastrozole| (Arimidex®), letrozole| (Femara®) or exemestane| (Aromasin®) can be used.  In the same way, some HR+ cancers have HER2+ cells and may respond to Herceptin. But I haven't really heard of anyone here doing that. My onc told me he has such a patient. Regarding inflammation, I do think it's important to keep it down once you already have BC as some studies have suggested it might improve prognosis. And it is possible to do it with diet. Certain foods (raw fruits and veggies, mostly, but also legumes, nuts and seeds)  contain salicylic acid, which is an active metabolite of aspirin. This is just one pathway against inflammation but I figured if I ate enough of those foods, lost weight, and exercised, this would really keep inflammation in check. I think there's evidence that chronic inflammation causes certain cancers, but they don't know the whole story yet. Good luck on your first PET!",

We cannot find a cure without basic science research including statistics. It's a valauable tool for science but not always helpful for patients. We don't know where we will be on the curve. That in itself can give someone plenty of hope. For example, I convinced myself I could easily be on the right side of the median. Once I was over that hump I looked at the stats and saw there was a good chance I could make it much longer and things got even better if I could stretch it to four years. Then I had a good chance if making it to ten based on the way the curve flattens. It's now been 8.5 years!! It looks more likely that I will live a normal life span or die of something else. How did this happen? It's reasonable to believe in the first two years the treatment helped most combined with chemopause. Chemo is more effective at killing rapidly growing cells and the lack of estrogen sent many cells permanently packing. As for dormant cells, people don't really know much about them. From what I've read they seem to be waiting for signals, asleep next to an alarm clock. Something wakes them up and they can go crazy. Is it likely that mine have all never gotten any signals all this time? I somehow doubt it. They were already quite expert at receiving them.

There'll also be a sound aid, a voice that says exhale, inhale. (Mine was in German.) They'll put something on your chest that detects your breathing. The theory is that you only get zapped when your chest is in the field. So if they forget to turn on the sound or the visual, don't panic like I did! But better make sure this is the case, just in case I got it wrong or I had a different system. It's been four years since rads for me and my heart and lungs are still ok.

Of 16 patients with invasive breast cancers smaller than 1 cm, 15 had complete tumor ablation with the technique, reported principal investigator Rache M. Simmons, MD, from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City. She spoke at a presscast today at the American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBS) 15th Annual Meeting in Las Vegas. The technique had an ablation rate in small tumors of 93.8%. \"It was quite successful,\" Dr. Simmons said in an interview with Medscape Medical News. The rate of complete tumor ablation was the primary outcome in the open-label single-group study, known as the American College of Surgeons Oncology GroupZ1072 trial.  Of the 99 patients enrolled, 86 women (with a total of 87 breast cancers) were evaluable. All patients had unifocal invasive ductal breast cancer that was 2 cm or smaller, an intraductal component of less than 25%, and no extensive calcifications. The overall ablation rate was only 69%; the procedure was much less successful in larger breast cancers and in patients who had some measure of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).---- Google medscape and the article number or title and you can read the full article.

Worth looking into as there seem to be several places in the US offering it. There is also the possibility of generating an immune response depending on freeze rate. It is imaging-guided and surgery can be performed if there is residual disease. I think this is an important step as it is akin to getting clean margins which is crucial for effective local control with surgery. http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/824379  ",

But the last time I went to the dentist's office, a woman appeared, my dentist's daughter. She was so nice and gentle. I think it is the combination of drills and testosterone that's evil. Speaking of infections I had two that had to be surgically removed, one in my groin and one in my nape. I know they used topical antibiotics but I also had pre and post treatment of oral antibiotics. Maybe they could do yours intravenously? If you still need it. Hope the vanco did the job all on its own.",

You will want to have the cutting-edge options, which may even have fewer if any side effects (targeted therapies). Go for more insurance if you can! I'm going almost 4 years NED. My insurance paid for a second opinion overseas. They confirmed my local opinions. Worth All the out of pocket expenses. If insurance is prohibitive, you can pay for second opinions and decide to have your local center do those protocols. My center does this as well. The disadvantage there is that they may not be as familiar in dealing with side effects for new protocols.",

My daughter was 7 when I was diagnosed IV at the get-go. I saw this from her friends. She used to bring home a bunch of boys for lunch regularly and I had to call an end to that. Partly because it was exhausting and I was afraid of all the germs. At 7 we did tell her about my diagnosis but not the dying part. Just that I would have to be in hospitals and see doctors a lot.  I showed her a comic book about breast cancer. It had funny pictures. Fast forward 3 years. It came as a shock to her that I could die from BC. She had a hint about that from what other people had said to her earlier on but it had never stuck. Until a friend of ours died of BC. Two years later it came as a shock to her that I still had BC, am still taking meds, still doing scans. Her visual of me has always been someone active, someone who got stronger as time passed, even with the aches and pains. In that sense it was easier to deal with the later shocks. To make a long story short, I think it's better to paint a not so dire picture, maybe just describe the changing landscape as matter of factly as possible, until they are able to understand more. Their growing bodies don't need any extra stress. School is stress enough (academically, that is). But that's another story. ",

I always preferred to swim in the river of DeNile for as long as I could between scans as I have both scanxiety and regular anxiety being claustrophobic in those machines. So I doubled the length of time required if I could. Three months turned into 6 months, 6 months into a year, etc. My last scan was 3 years ago because of nerve damage from a neck injury. I am also a hard stick so about 5 people had to give it a try before they had to call the anesthesiologist from the operating room. Plus I was allergic to the contrast.  While I procrastinate I try some \"alternative\" therapies on the off chance of killing cells before they can show up on imaging. Once I took aspirin daily, another time it was metformin, then it was broccoli sprouts, heat therapy (as in exercising in my steamed up bathroom), getting a massage, acupuncture, walking in the forest (forest bathing), intermittent fasting, etc. When I didn't get scanned, I got mammograms, lung x-rays and abdominal, breast, axilla and thyroid ultrasounds instead.",

I know that feeling. 3 months also sounds good to me for a follow up scan for you. I had a mastectomy and am NED 3 years now. There was no sign of any cancer left anywhere on PET/CT scans even before the mastectomy. Those days I didn't research anything, I had absolute faith in my doctors (after getting second and third opinions which all lined up nicely). So given that you still have residual disease, I would go for the mastectomy, avoiding opioids, if possible (as MJL noted).  I also had an axillary node dissection. They saw mets which were too small for the scans in two nodes. The latest research, however, shows node dissection may not be necessary in Stage I and II women receiving radiation postoperatively. With Stage IV everything is more confusing, so I don't know if this means you shouldn't do a node dissection. I also had radiation. In my case, the doctors adopted a \"wait and see\" approach, wait and see if the treatment doesn't kill her. ;-) They zapped your ovaries? That must have been tough. At 50 years, I had chemo to thank for my AI prescription. Good luck on choosing the right treatment for you!",

I think they now classify nodal metastasis (nodal m1) as either IIIB or IIIC and overall survival is similar to those earlier stages. Your surgeon should be able to explain it better than I just did. I'd make sure the m1 is indeed for nodal metastasis and not something else. In any case m1 still has a better prognosis than m3, multiple metastases in multiple organs. There is a chance she can be with you many years more. I am t2n1m1, with bone metastasis. I'm still around after 8 years and wish the same or more for your mom.",

Regarding \"curative,\" to me it sounds like the trial trifecta is not giving cancer a break and might be as curative as a harsh chemo regimen. I still have hope for a cure but not necessarily for myself. It could take decades. But then again it's been 7 years since my mets diagnosis (from get-go) and I've been 6.5 years NED. Our bodies can regenerate. At 7 years it is likely that most of my skeleton, lungs, muscles, liver is made up of new cells from when I was diagnosed, my blood cells have turned over three times. It's possible that these cells are stronger and my immune system smarter for the change. The opposite could also be true due to DNA mutations, but since I feel stronger and better able to fend off infections, I assume/wish it's the other way around.  I have hope that my body has learned something over time about killing pathogens, including cancer cells. According to one theory, patrolling cells of the immune system provide continuous bodywide surveillance, catching and eliminating cells that undergo malignant transformation. Tumors develop when this immune surveillance breaks down or is overwhelmed. (Source: NCI) Until they find a cure, I hope my immune cells and meds keep doing their job.  ",

With sternal mets that is more the case than with any other mets, just considering the distance from the breast, IMO (non-expert). Surgical resection, cryoablation, radiofrequency ablation, as well as radiation may be options. Seek a third opinion for more clarity. If you are still on Ibrance/AIs ablative techniques can be done after. In my case Ibrance was not available yet. I had chemo to kill the tumor and any microcells, followed by surgery, radiation and an AI to mop up.",

These CTCs were most likely not dormant and were the progeny of cells that had some knowledge of metastasizing. I did some research and comforted myself with the thought that it is supposedly not that easy for CTCs to go through the obstacle course of forming metastatic colonies. I did take the whole thing to mean I had some residual active, if still invisible, disease. Whether it would progress or remain stable was still to be seen. A year later, CTCs could no longer be found. This was a positive sign even if possibly just a sampling error. Whatever I was doing or had done or both seemed to have enabled my immune system to work better against cancer cells. They say chemo can reboot the immune system and teach it to recognize cancer cells they'd been previously ignoring. Radiation can also have an effect beyond the radiation field, like sending smoke signals to immune cells. I also believe exercise is very important in training and re-training the immune system. There are population studies as well as animal studies like this recent one on mice. https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/02/1602... They describe the mechanism of the exercise effect: \"Researchers found that the surge of adrenaline that comes with a high-intensity workout helped to move cancer-killing immune (NK) cells toward lung, liver, or skin tumors implanted into the mice.\" The author concludes: As someone working in the field of exercise and oncology, one of the main questions that cancer patients always ask is: how should I exercise? Can we do anything? While it has previously been difficult to advise people about the intensity at which they should exercise, our data suggest that it might be beneficial to exercise at a somewhat high intensity in order to provoke a good epinephrine surge and hence recruitment of NK cells. I'm almost sure hot flashes also helped me if this is true. The adrenaline must be going for my heart rate to go up and sweat beads to form. So apart from exercise and hot flashes, maybe watching scary movies, bungee jumping, race car driving, might help us live longer no matter if we are de novo or recurring earlier stage? ",

Treatment will have to rely on steady attrition, on slowly improving the immune response with a sustained multifactorial approach. Maybe waiting until cancer becomes resistant to a specific drug is not the right approach. Maybe we should be alternating a different drug every 6 months to keep cancer in check.

Long uphills as no lifts where we went for the most part, except for the first day where DH and I took the gondola to the middle station and biked to the glacier which was all wrapped up at the bottom to protect it from the sun.  Maybe the strategy is working as this glacier only lost 10 meters in a year as opposed to more than a 100 for some badly sunburned ones.

If you have don't have symptoms of lightheadedness, fainting, blacking out, shortness of breath, or chest pains, and your heart rate responds to exercise by increasing to meet the blood flow demands then kudos to you! The fainting spell you experienced may just be overexertion/ dehydration but might be worth dialling down to two sets instead of three to see if it makes a difference.  ",

Iwrite, hugs to you and the ponderosa tree.  Z, great to have a day off. Wishing you luck on the treatments. Thanks for the list, so on point. My comments with the voice of long experience; 1. Like Iwrite the meds gave me extreme hot flashes. Tamoxifen was the worst.  I am totally hyperthermically conditioned after 10 years. I don't like saunas though because it can send me to hot flash hell. The heat is abating though so I may have to reconsider my stance on saunas.  2. I do try to starve cancer  but not through any specific diet but through time and calorie restrictions with sufficient nutrition, i.e, I am not starving myself. I even managed to gain weight while fasting 17 hours a day. Obviously I was not restricting calories enough. I've cut back to 12-13 hour fasts. 4. Cancers could just as well be feeding on lactate as well as glucose, ketones, too. I was a little alarmed when I was told I was building up lactate too quickly during a treadmill test. So I won't be trying to break any world records. 6.1 Drinking wine may protect teeth by destroying bacteria that cause cavities and gum disease, new research suggests. 7. Point 6 (as revised) makes me very happy. ",

I could lift absolutely 0, not even my own handbag, so 4 kg is awesome. The weight will come off eventually but you will always have to be watching the scales. About seven years ago I started daily fasts of 17 hours but cut it down to 13 after I started gaining weight. I still had a net loss of maybe 5 kilos. I lost some more after the switch but have now gained back the second batch. The body just adapts to whatever you're doing and forces you to tweak either the diet or the exercise.

So far so good, but I need to progress my yoga practice and the video could be my ticket. Mara, I also do a lot of at-home jogging when doing chores. It makes the chores more fun to be able to get some steps out of normally boring activities. Divine, how are you doing with the foot issues? katyk and others, there's a thread called Wednesday Weigh In which is great for getting accountable. I think exercise and weight loss/maintenance are just as important as any of our meds. We may also not respond or stop responding to the anticancer benefits like any med. But still worth trying and keeping it up, particularly as, the way I see it, you get more bang for your buck in combination with our meds. So even if you were exercising and keeping a healthy weight before cancer, this in no way nullifies the benefit of continuing your healthy regimen after cancer. On the contrary. So let's keep at it, everyone! Hope Z checks in soon. ",

Z, I would guess (wildly) it's the Ibrance in many cases hindering muscle development. I think aromatase inhibition could actually increase testosterone and help muscle building.

My voice got deeper, too, among other virilizing effects. Although I can't say with certainty as my testosterone levels were never measured.

It will remind me of her. https://www.breastcancer.org/community/podcasts/exercise-metastatic-20190222 More on how exercise is good for us, just to keep Z's spriit alive. I like the three exercises recommended by cancer exercise specialist Sami Mansfield for everyone as excerpted below:  I think there\u2019s really three things that are really key to exercise and where I feel it\u2019s safe and effective when we have the right stimulus. Number one would be some form of a chair sit-to-stand, also known in the exercise world as a squat. Because everybody is going to need to use the toilet, get out of bed, you know, get their socks and shoes and pants on. So having the ability to have those muscles strong is really key, and no matter where the metastasis locations are it\u2019s still a very safe and effective exercise.  Improving the core or the center of the body is another really important and underutilized exercise and can be done as simple as sitting at the edge of your chair, throwing a timer on, and saying, \u201cOk, I\u2019m going to sit here for 20 to 30 seconds at a time, using my muscles. I\u2019m not leaning on the back of the chair, but I\u2019m really engaging the center of my body.\u201d That\u2019s going to help everything from walking to turning a corner or carrying a purse or a child.   The other thing that I really encourage people to do is to continue to be able to lift their arms all the way overhead to a full extension. That\u2019s of course known as a shoulder press in the exercise world, but it\u2019s really important for activities like washing your hair, or putting a coffee mug on the top shelf, or being able to reach your arm in full extension if you\u2019re reaching around the seat of a car, etc. So a great way to do that is to sit on a chair if that\u2019s more comfortable or stand against a wall, put your arms at 90 degrees, and then work on stretching your arms all the way overhead, so that the inner part of the arm is close to the ear. And you\u2019ll realize that maybe you have compromised posture or haven\u2019t been working those muscles due to surgeries or treatments that those muscles get really tight and then lead to a lot of other concerns orthopedically like shoulders, etc.   So no matter where your location of metastases are, those three exercises done even every day, will make a huge difference in mobility and function, and anybody can do them safely.

I have a rash, too, but it is on my radiation field and comes and goes. In general our meds tend to dry us out. I treat rashes aggresively with coconut oil, an aloe vera cream, a cream with cortisone, if necessary, and something called Linola Fett. My onc also says I can take up to 4 Zyrtec antihistamine tablets a day. One is enough to tire me out, so I haven't done that high a dosage. A few days ago I saw my breast specialist and she said to stop wearing black, which may be irritating my skin. I've been invading my daughter's closet since. Oh, and my BS gave me the all clear on my breast ultrasounds.  Still recovering from a milonga (tango dance party) last night. I will do the gob squats, yoga poses and pushups later.. Can't wait for the dive or beach pics from Mexico, Iwrite.",

Unbelievable. I will never complain about traffic in Zurich again. Great to see everyone moving. My tip to prevent injuries is to get any specific muscles you intend to move warmed up first. I learned this the hard way as well as at a fitness course for seniors. An overall warmup is not enough. Of course any warmup is better than none but still presents some risk to estrogen deprived muscles and joints.  As far as detoxing, I found a high intensity interval training routine in a steam-filled bathroom did the trick as far as producing buckets of sweat (jumping jacks, speed runs in place, high legs, push ups, etc.) The best was I could take an immediate shower to wash off the sweat before the toxins dried on my skin. Somewhat obsessive, I know. Post scans, eating fish is detoxifying, too. The rawer the better. Yes, a good excuse to have sushi or sashimi. The selenium in fish is beneficial for this purpose. Good luck on the 5K, Illimae.",

Also in order to produce and store Vitamin D, you need fat. So I moisturize before I go out. Today there`s no sun but will pile on some coconut oil anyway. Shetland, that bath sounds very restorative. Maybe I will do the same on a rainy day like today. Will go out first to get some humidity into my lungs.",

Some people use emu oil. I massaged my whole body with argan oil everyday. I must say my skin was glowing with the daily oil teatment. I also regularly took non-steroidal anti-inflammatories and corticosteroids. These dampen the inflammatory processes which mediate HFS.

I would ask the radiation onc which foods might best prepare you if you are really interested in going this route. As for strength training, I hired a personal trainer as I knew zilch about exercise and had very weak muscles and lungs. (I also had been diagnosed with pleural effusions right before my BC diagnosis, but no mets could be seen in my lungs, only in the spine.) My advice in terms of lymphedema prevention is to start easy and progress very slowly. Your lymphedema risk may be different from mine though. Check out the lymphedema thread here at bco. I believe contracting muscles and strengthening them actually prevents lymphedema. Laura, love all those bells and whistles on that seated trainer. I want one, if we only had space.  Z, sorry about the gastro issues. I wonder if it isn't some kind of autoimmune response. You may want to see a rheumatologist or an MO familiar with immunotherapy side effects.  I just read a study that high salt intake induces the gut microbiome to become inflammatory. It was probably a mouse study but could be applicable to us and wouldn't hurt anyway to cut down on salt.    ",

I had mets on my upper spine which was very painful. After treatment I still had residual muscular pain. Exercise helped a lot with that but it took a long time before I gained flexibility.

Glad you are coming along for the 10K and pushup ride. DG, I can imagine the yoga helped. In my case I was in major pain before diagnosis and during treatment and was so stiff for years after chemo. I am still not the most flexible but I am getting there. Apg, several years ago I saw a Zumba trailer with a testimonial from someone who also had BC bone mets. I had just started to try Zumba myself. My knee was the first casualty, but after training to strengthen my knee I could start again and have been doing it for more than 5 years, although now I am also doing salsa, tango and Body Jam. I was also one of those who could not run for 5 minutes. But I have managed to improve on that as well. I used an app/program called Couch to 5K. It's supposed to be an 8 week program but I'm sure I needed a few months more.  Started with yoga yesterday, ran 2K and did weights again. Doing inclined pushups (pushoffs?) and will slowly reduce the incline. Walking around a lot to do errands as roads are too icy for biking.",

Rest is important, as I've mentioned before, but it seems also getting enough carbs. https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/02/170216103926.htm Eating carbohydrates during intense exercise helps to minimize exercise-induced immune disturbances and can aid the body's recovery.

I was overall caregiver to my father overseas but my treatment is pretty tame now and for the most part I was able to delegate specific care to paid caregivers. Fortunately he had enough resources of his own for me to do that because there are no government services available where he lived. In your case it sounds like you will have to take advantage of government services to the max and probably will need to rely on a social worker to coordinate her care onsite.

Not that it was easy on Femara, but I somehow managed to lose most of my chemo weight the first few years, then reached a plateau. Maybe it is just the cumulative estrogen deprivation. I exercise daily. Sometimes I have to exercise two times a day just to get rid of excess weight before a weekly weigh-in. I'd hate to give up wine, cheese and chocolate, so vigorous exercise is my go-to fat blaster. But going for longer walks also helps. As for juicing, this may be adding calories without the fiber depending on how you juice. I drink a glass of orange juice, but everything else I eat as whole fruit or vegetable (8 servings a day). The fiber helps to stabilize blood glucose levels.  So far I am still maintaining a Size 6-8.",

Coincidentally I had my second opinion at MGH and the doctor echoed the recommendation of neoadjuvant TAC chemo, surgery, radiation and endocrine therapy in that order. I was initially metastatic so there were no issues of chemo resistance. I was also symptomatic which meant chemo would provide faster relief. That was 8 years ago. So far, still NED. I had all sorts of infections with chemo but managed to get through 6 cycles. I was told I could have more cycles depending on the results of surgery, even though scans showed NED after the 5th cycle. Fortunately, didn't need more chemo. There are real risks to heavy chemo and not just those in the future. Doctors have to weigh how well they think you can handle those risks. I'd guess stage iv is more problematic than earlier stages, as our bodies are under greater stress. Performance status probably counts more. Also, the younger you are the better.",

Looking at it (http://www.ibcsg.org/SiteCollectionDocuments/Presentations/35-07_Presentation_StGallen2007.pdf), it would make sense to try to follow the protocol of the trial with the intermittent letrozole until progression. Since I am not yet 56, I would have to do tests for estradiol, FSH and LH to confirm postmenopausal status. A Femara break for 3 months of the year would resensitize the cells to when one starts taking the Femara again for the next 9 months. I guess the alternative is to take Femara continuously until progression. At that point it may be too risky to try to re-sensitize. Maybe I could also take metformin during Femara breaks.

I was NED after the fifth cycle and have remained so 8 years on. Zometa or a newer drug, Xgeva, is an important part of the cocktail. A good friend of mine who was diagnosed with extensive bone mets 5 years before me had Fluorouracil (sp?) instead of Taxotere. This was her choice as she preferred to have something less toxic being a single mom to two young children. She lived 11 years after her diagnosis. I did ask my doctor if a lower dose (30% less than suggested) would be appropriate for me, but he nixed that, saying they were ready to fight the fires should I be more susceptible to adverse side effects.

Too much of a good thing, I suppose. Having learned to live with so little, they can't deal with having more. The drug holiday is not a holiday for cancer cells in this case. The questions may actually be:  is 3 months long enough? will I produce enough estrogen? I suppose the ones you don't kill in the first round can be taken care of in the next rounds.

Ideally the doctor should give a prescription/recommendation for a physical therapist. But I think doctors don't want to bother, relying just on bisphosphonates to do the job. Walking is great exercise, walking uphill even better, walking with weights uphill will really build bone fast. I would try walking on flats first and build up very slowly. Any activity you do upright with as much of your weight bearing on bones as possible is good for building bone density. Improving range of motion is also important. Yoga would be good for adding directional variety to movements, and gentle dancing moves, too.  Swimming is not ideal as the water carries your weight. But if it gets you moving, great. After all, you are on bisphosphonates and exercise is not just about bone health. Although I like the idea that with weight-bearing exercise I am building new bone, not just retaining the old, creaky ones.",

Regular gym classes were too unpredictable in terms of the movements. I didn't have the agility and the flexibility. I joined a class for seniors. Pounding and resistance is good for the bones so I biked off-road and uphill. It was rather jarring at first but you really do feel stronger over time.

Ideally, I'd like to live in such places, but can't at the moment. Go for the raw vegan diet, but maybe you can find something else from the lessons taken from these places that could work for you as well.

One hypothesis is that the perfume/essential oil molecules in the soap cause blood vessels to enlarge. Maybe try unscented soap next time in the interest of science. Lol.",

I'd try upper body exercises on the water or with an arm bike (assuming you don't have problems with lymphedema) at least until you get the pain under control or get a green light from your onc. My gym is closed all week due to a water pipe break. I probably will be walking outside more as running in the cold is not my thing. Or I may try out other gyms. Will do bodyweight exercises at home and go to tango tonight,",

It's like a huge burden has been lifted from my shoulders, most likely from doing a number of lat pulldowns and cleans and presses. I've been having some breathing problems which would get better with exercise for about a month now. I was starting to suspect it had to do with very late radiation side effects, with muscle tissue hardening or doing something around my lungs. Somehow with all the contractions from lifting, something was released inside and my breathing was completely normal today.

There were two breast cancer cases with bone mets and both had significant to complete regression. I quote the case study of one: This is illustrated by the case of a 59 yo postmenopausal female with ER/PR positive,   ERBB2 negative breast cancer with biopsy confirmed metastasis to the left ischium   and right adrenal gland (Figure 3A, Figure 3C, Figure 3D). She had been previously treated with radiation therapy to the left ischium, had   received five different hormonal manipulations (tamoxifen, anastrozole, exemestane,   fulvestran and megestrol). She had also received capecitabine, which had been discontinued   because of gastrointestinal side effects. The patient was examined only once. In June   2006, at the time of treatment initiation, the patient complained of severe left hip   pain, which was limiting her mobility despite the intake of opioids. Within two weeks   of experimental treatment initiation with breast cancer-specific frequencies, the   patient reported complete disappearance of her pain and discontinued the use of pain   medications. She also reported a significant improvement in her overall condition.   As seen on Figure 3B and 3E, PET-CT obtained three months after treatment initiation showed complete disappearance   of the right adrenal and left ischium lesions. The complete response lasted 11 months.   Intriguingly, the patient had developed intermittent vaginal spotting in the months   preceding experimental treatment initiation. A minimally enhancing uterine lesion   was observed on PET-CT prior to treatment initiation. Upon follow-up, FDG uptake increased   significantly (Figure 3B) and the patient was diagnosed with uterine cancer by hysteroscopy. The patient underwent   hysterectomy, which revealed endometrial adenocarcinoma. Hence, while treatment with   breast cancer specific frequencies resulted in a complete response, it did not affect   the growth of endometrial adenocarcinoma. This observation suggests that breast cancer   frequencies are tumor-specific as a response of the metastatic breast cancer was observed   while a uterine tumor progressed.  I don't know understand the way the treatment works, but it sounds promising, although I hope the wrong frequency did not encourage the growth of that uterine lesion.",

But after 4.5 years and exercising daily, I actually feel stronger than before my diagnosis. Femara has kept me NED so the struggle has been worth it in that sense. But who knows what the long-term effects are. Edited to add: I just read you can't take Zometa. Sorry to hear that. It does help with bone thinning caused by Femara. Actually I am now on Tamoxifen since last week because it's supposed to be better for the bones. ",

Even if you had the best habits before, estrogen can still act like a wrecking crew. Janette Wakelin's story (thanks for the heads up!) is fascinating, but notice that she was 52 at dx and probably was just about to hit menopause, which surely helped her. I also think endurance exercise does allow more oxygen into our cells and is probably the reason daily running is associated with massive reductions in BC mortality post-diagnosis (i.e., after anti-estrogen therapy?). I want to be a runner like her. Maybe hyperbaric oxygen could do the same thing? That would be an interesting experiment. I think genes definitely play a role, but it is sometimes possible to influence the behaviour of genes through diet and lifestyle. So I wouldn't give up hope because of genetic heritage. ",

A circulating tumor cell is not necessarily going to cause metastasis so it may or may not be something to worry about. Also the results are from 7.5 ml of blood, so even a 0 does not tell the complete story from the roughly 5 liters of blood in our system. ",

Got pricked to test blood sugar which was 5.2 (European measurements) and deemed perfect. Got the tracer injected. Hate that part as they can never find a proper vein. I am still black and blue on my arm. Then it's relax time while drinking the licorice-tasting radioactive glucose for an hour. I hate that, too. Wish it were vanilla flavored. Then onto the machine. The brochure on the new machine said it would take 5 minutes, the tech however said 20 minutes. In reality it took 10 minutes. I was really tense and freezing and my arms were falling asleep. After the photo shoot, I saw the doctor who reads the pictures and tells me the results. Still NED! PJB and cookie, good luck on your scans!! lovinmama, hope insurance pays for yours!",

I haven't done any homeopathic stuff, but i'm open to learning more about it. I think the Issels approach sounds a bit hokey in general but there are some things which look pretty conventional or harmless, could be worth a try. I exercise everyday, including lifting weights. I can do the latter now but it took a lot of work to get to where I am. So I would suggest walking daily outside if walking is all you can manage for now. A physical therapist is a good idea. I had one in the beginning then graduated to a personal trainer. Now I exercise on my own in the gym as well as go hiking, skiing, biking, snowshoeing, kayaking.",

In my case I did have some kind of pinched nerve (torticollis) after scans showed no mets on the cervical spine. I had strained my neck while having a mammogram and had gotten myself almost paralyzed. My onc prescribed corticosteroids, muscle relaxants and painkillers and I also got physical therapy, acupuncture and massage. I was running from appointment to appointment for about three months. Insurance paid for all of it except for the massage. I should have made the hospital pay but was just so happy it wasn't mets. Hope your scans also show no mets!",

I just saw this article and thought it might help in understanding your onc's strategy (although he may have other, totally different reasons). I found it positive in that we can essentially multiply our treatment options. The study was done on HER2+ but could also apply to others. http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/02/120227162603.htm In the fight against cancer, the combination of treatments is highly common practice. However, the concept described is different: it is not about seeing the results of combining drug A with drug B, but, when A fails to work, B is administered, and if this also fails we return to the starting point and initiate treatment with a combination of the two (A + B). This strategy could offer an unprecedented key to multiplying treatment options. ------- I hope Xeloda works like gangbusters for you!",

Brandall, since you are a runner, this Canadian study might be of interest to you.  Exercise Boosts Health by Influencing Stem Cells to Become Bone, Not Fat, Researchers Find  Sep. 9, 2011 \u2014 McMaster researchers have found one more reason to exercise: working out triggers influential stem cells to become bone instead of fat, improving overall health by boosting the body's capacity to make blood. The body's mesenchymal stem cells are most likely to become fat or bone, depending on which path they follow. Using treadmill-conditioned mice, a team led by the Department of Kinesiology's Gianni Parise has shown that aerobic exercise triggers those cells to become bone more often than fat. The exercising mice ran less than an hour, three times a week, enough time to have a significant impact on their blood production, says Parise, an associate professor. In sedentary mice, the same stem cells were more likely to become fat, impairing blood production in the marrow cavities of bones. The research appears in a new paper published by the Journal of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.  \"The interesting thing was that a modest exercise program was able to significantly increase blood cells in the marrow and in circulation,\" says Parise. \"What we're suggesting is that exercise is a potent stimulus -- enough of a stimulus to actually trigger a switch in these mesenchymal stem cells.\" The composition of cells in the bone marrow cavity has an important influence on the productivity of blood stem cells. In ideal conditions, blood stem cells create healthy blood that boosts the immune system, permits the efficient uptake of oxygen, and improves the ability to clot wounds. Bone cells improve the climate for blood stem cells to make blood. But when fat cells start to fill the bone marrow cavity -- a common symptom of sedentary behavior -- blood stem cells become less productive, and conditions such as anemia can result. The findings add to the growing list of established benefits of exercise, Parise says, and suggest that novel non-medicinal treatments for blood-related disorders may be in the future. \"Some of the impact of exercise is comparable to what we see with pharmaceutical intervention,\" he says. \"Exercise has the ability to impact stem cell biology. It has the ability to influence how they differentiate.\" (Sorry about the formatting.) ----- We are not mice, obviously, but other studies have suggested that exercise is comparable to pharmacological approaches. Who knows, maybe even to stem cell approaches? ",

Looking at the charts, even if they don't say anything about NED states, I would keep taking Herceptin for another year, better yet two. And see what new research brings up.  I've been NED almost 4 years and my onc told me to look at the trials of letrozole extension. He says I don't qualify (being metastatic, I suppose?) but in this trial patients who have been on femara for at least 4 years start taking it cyclically -- 9 months on, 3 months off. http://www.ibcsg.org/Public/Health_Professionals/Open_Trials/IBCSG_35-07/Pages/IBCSG35-07(SOLE).aspx Maybe you could find a similar protocol for both the Femara and the Herceptin with shorter breaks, and alternating which drug you have a break on? Personally, I'd feel better with one crutch than no crutches at all since there is a choice. I have taken short breaks from Femara in the past and the side effects were always less on resuming it. My current break actually involves taking Arimidex for a month and going back to Femara, as per my onc. It has helped. Maybe the toxins of one drug haven't kicked in while the other one's toxins are being cleared out? Or a weird placebo effect? Just guessing. Good luck on your decision-making!",

My bone density scans still show pretty healthy bones. If my values start going down I intend to resume the Zometa. For you, since you are premenopausal, Zometa's antitumor effect may not be enough, although the Zoladex may help. I would still supplement with exercise. It also helps immensely with the joint pain and stiffness.",

Possible clinical cure of metastatic breast cancer: lessons from our 30-year experience with oligometastatic breast cancer patients and literature review.

Abstract BACKGROUND: Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is generally incurable. However, 10-20-year relapse-free survival of MBC is approximately 2%, implying that at least a small subset of MBC patients achieve prolonged survival. We therefore analyzed long-term outcome in a particular subset, i.e., oligometastatic breast cancer (OMBC). METHODS: Data of OMBC subjects (N = 75) treated in our institution from April 1980 to March 2010 were retrospectively analyzed. OMBC was identified as: one or 2 organs involved with metastatic lesions (excluding the primary lesion resectable by surgery), fewer than 5 lesions per metastasized organ, and lesion diameter less than 5 cm. Patients were generally treated with systemic chemotherapy first, and those who achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) were further treated, if applicable, with local therapy (surgical or radiation therapy) to maintain CR or to induce no evidence of clinical disease (NED), with additional systemic therapy. RESULTS: Median follow-up duration was 103 (6-329) months. Single or 2 organs were involved in, respectively, 44 (59%) and 31 (41%) cases with metastatic lesions, 48% of which were visceral. In cases where effects of systemic therapy, possibly in combination with other treatments, were evaluated (N = 68), CR or PR was achieved in 33 (48.5%) or 32 (47.1%), respectively, with overall response rate (ORR: CR + PR) of 95.6% (N = 65). In cases receiving multidisciplinary treatment (N = 75), CR or NED (CR/NED), or PR was induced in 48 (64.0%) or 23 (30.7%) cases, respectively, with ORR (CR/NED + PR) of 94.7% (N = 71). CR rates (60.5%) with systemic therapy and CR/NED rates (79.5%) with multidisciplinary treatment were significantly better in subjects with a single involved organ than in those with two involved organs (P = 0.047 and 0.002, systemic only or multidisciplinary treatments, respectively). Medians estimated by Kaplan-Meier method were: overall survival (OS) of 185.0 months and relapse-free interval (RFI) of 48.0 months. Estimated outcomes were: OS rates (OSR) of 59.2% at 10 years and 34.1% at 20 years, and relapse-free rates (RFR) of 27.4% at 10 years and 20 years. No disease progression was observed after 101.0 months as RFR. Cases with single organ involvement (N = 44) showed significantly better outcomes (OSR of 73% at 10 years and 52% at 20 years, RFR of 42% at 10 years and 20 years). Those who received local therapies (N = 35) also showed better prognosis: OSR of 82% at 10 years and 53% at 20 years, RFR of 38% at 10 years and 20 years. Three cases (4%) survived for their lifetime without relapse after achieving CR or NED, our definition of clinical cure. Multivariate analysis revealed factors favoring better prognosis as: none for OS, and single organ involvement with metastasis, administration of local treatment, and shorter disease-free interval (DFI) (P = 0.030, 0.039, and 0.042, respectively) for RFR. Outcomes in OMBC in literature were OSR of 35-73% at 10 years and 26-52% at 20 years, and RFR of 27-42% at 10 years and 26-42% at 20 years. CONCLUSIONS: The present analyses clearly indicate that OMBC is a distinct subgroup with long-term prognosis superior to MBC, with reasonable provability for clinical cure. Further prospective studies to better characterize OMBC are warranted to improve prognosis in MBC.",

I don't know exactly if this would be for you but it sounds like you would be a good candidate for radiation therapy. I had radiation but not what they're talking about since mine lasted almost 6 weeks. http://news.ufl.edu/2012/02/02/tumor/ Targeting tumors may help stop spread of breast, other cancers Filed under Health,  Research on Thursday, February 2, 2012. GAINESVILLE, Fla. - Cancer that has spread from the site of an original tumor to other places in the body is often viewed as a death sentence. But if there are just a few of those secondary tumors, called metastases, some patients have a good chance of survival if treated with a type of radiation that precisely targets small tumors, researchers at the University of Florida and the University of Rochester report online and in an upcoming print edition of the International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics. \"The dogma is that this type of disease is incurable and that if there's a metastatic tumor in one organ, then others must be present throughout the body,\" said investigator Dr. Paul Okunieff, director of the UF Shands Cancer Center and chairman of the UF College of Medicine's department of radiation oncology. \"It's considered an all-or-none phenomenon, but the fact is this view is probably not correct. We need to think about metastasis like we think about the primary tumor: determine how much it has spread, then decide whether it's treatable based on existing technology.\" Nearly 1.6 million Americans were diagnosed with cancer last year, and nearly 600,000 died from the disease, according to the National Cancer Institute. Experts estimate that up to 90 percent of those deaths were from metastases. The researchers studied 121 patients who had five or fewer tumors that spread from areas such as the breast, colon or lung, to up to three additional organs. Tumors were treated with a one- to two-week radiation course strong enough to kill them and prevent their recurrence while sparing healthy tissue. In about 20 percent of the patients, who were enrolled from 2001 to 2006, long-term follow up revealed that the treated tumors did not return, nor did new ones pop up elsewhere. Very few regrowths occurred among patients who made it to three years. Breast cancer patients fared even better, with one-third of patients being free of tumor regrowth after three years. Six years after treatment, almost half of breast cancer patients in the study were still alive - five times the survival rate for people with forms of metastatic cancer other than breast cancer. In addition, for more than one-third of breast cancer patients, the cancer did not become widespread after six years, whereas only one-eighth of people with other forms of metastatic cancer did not see their cancer spread. In general, survival was greatest among patients whose secondary tumors were relatively small and responded well to chemotherapy or hormone treatment given before radiation. \"Our results suggest that patients with metastases that are limited in number and extent should be considered for potentially curative radiotherapy, said investigator Dr. Michael Milano, an associate professor of radiation oncology at the University of Rochester. \"Further studies are needed to ascertain which patients are most likely to benefit, either through prolonged survival or, perhaps, a cure. We need a better understanding of the biology of cancer, and what makes one person's cancer behave so differently from another's.\" Some patients in the study had recurrence of a small number of tumors, and retreatment with targeted radiation controlled their disease. The researchers call for further investigation into the most appropriate types of treatment for cancer that has spread to limited areas, and the types of cancers most likely to respond. \"Given the promising results of precisely targeted radiation in controlling the spread of disease, easing pain and even unexpectedly extending patient survival - as we've seen in our own clinical experience and in the published literature - we must pursue research that advances our understanding of the mechanisms at work,\" said Dr. Raymond B. Wynn, executive director for stereotactic radiosurgery at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Cancer Center, and a clinical professor of radiation oncology at University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. \"Fortunately, we are more than halfway there.\"",

The lack of extrogen supposedly means the fat from your hips (and maybe elsewhere) moves to your belly. So even with all my efforts I still don't have a totally flat belly. But my hips have gotten smaller. My theory (no double-blind, randomized trials) is you need to exercise everyday even just a little. Ultimately, the goal is not to be sitting for too long periods without moving. Sitting exercises are also OK. From my experience, you also have to ramp up the intensity as time goes on. Exercise increases the amount of irisin in our bodies which raises the body's metabolism and glucose tolerance. Just what we need to counteract the lack of estrogen.  http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2012/01/11/newly-discovered-hormone-boosts-effects-of-exercise-could-help-fend-off-diabetes/ It helps to eat lots of fruits and veggies.

There are many risks, but again in hindsight, these were worth taking particularly when combined with lifestyle changes (diet, daily exercise, etc). It's been a long process to heal from chemo, rads, surgery, zometa and AIs don't help with all the side effects. I would try chemotherapy if I were you but can't really say that this would work for you or fit in with your work situation. the immune suppression is a worry. if you are not having symptoms, staying the course is a valid alternative.",

      "Content": "Apr 10, 2013 05:31AM Heidihill wrote: Chemo can kill breast cancer cells in the breast. I did chemo before surgery and had a complete response in my primary tumor and mets as far as scans could tell. But we never know if there are any microscopic \"seeders\" left. Some cells can become dormant and not be affected by chemo or any treatment. They can be hiding amongst healthy tissues and wake up at a later point to wreak havoc again. Surgery has risks and those have to be calculated in, as well as the likelihood that it will be done optimally, I'm guessing. (Not a doctor here, just someone who has a lot of time to research and actually has fun doing it as I used to do this in a former life.) In my case I doubt they got clean margins even on a mastectomy, which is probably why they also recommended 28 radiation zaps. So there has to be a plan B for those hardier cells not removed by surgery and not affected by chemo and doctors need to be aware which of their patients can get through the whole plan and not just part of it, with some quality of life left. This is how my doctors explained it to me. In their minds I was a good candidate for an aggressive approach. http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/102/7/456.full Surgery for Primary Tumor in the Presence of Metastatic Disease MBC at diagnosis constitutes 3.5%\u20137% of all new breast cancers (46); this apparently marginal problem involves about 7000 new patients every year in the United States alone, up to 50% of whom                        have locally operable (T1\u2013T3) primary tumors (47). Traditionally, this group of patients was managed primarily with systemic modalities, limiting local treatments to palliative                        management of uncontrolled local and/or regional disease (in form of so-called \u201ctoilette mastectomy\u201d or low-dose radiotherapy).                     The biological rationale for removing the primary tumor in case of proven disease dissemination is debatable. Several potential                        advantages have been proposed. By removing the primary tumor, one of the sources of further metastatic spread is eradicated                        (48\u201352); this risk of reseeding is more relevant with the current improvements in systemic treatments (53). Data from animal studies suggest that removal of tumor bulk may restore immunocompetence (54) because the primary tumor seems to modulate the immune system through release of immunosuppressive factors (55). A reduction in the number of cancer cells may also lead to increased efficacy of systemic therapy by decreasing the risk                        of emergence of chemoresistant cells and by removal of necrotic tumor tissue poorly accessible to drugs (54). Debulking surgery has been proven clinically effective in other common solid tumors, such as ovarian, colorectal, gastric,                        renal cancers, and malignant melanoma (56\u201358).                     However, some potential disadvantages of removing the primary tumor have also been proposed. Because the primary tumor is                        a source of antiangiogenic factors and growth factor inhibitors, there may be an accelerated relapse in response to its removal                        (49,59); however, the rush of angiogenesis in distant disease sites may increase the chemosensitivity of malignant cells (60). The possible release of growth factors related to surgical wounding (51) and the immunosuppression caused by surgery and anesthesia (61) are also potential disadvantages.                     Several series evaluated the role of local treatment for the primary tumor in patients with MBC at diagnosis (Table 1) (50,55,62,63,64,66). Importantly, in patients with positive surgical margins, surgery did not add any substantial survival benefit as compared                        with patients who did not undergo surgery.                     Interestingly, the percentage of MBC patients undergoing surgery for the primary tumor in all these series is surprisingly                        high, ranging from 37% to 61.3% (49,50). These percentages reflect the ongoing change, despite the lack of randomized confirmatory data, in the perceived role of                        breast cancer surgery in the presence of metastatic disease. As already mentioned, the characteristics of MBC have changed                        and hence the comparison with historical controls and the applicability of old criteria for operability clearly needs reevaluation.                        Overall, patients undergoing surgery are more likely to be younger, with smaller endocrine responsive tumors and more often                        have only a single metastatic site without visceral involvement. Therefore, the benefit of surgery may, at least partially,                        be attributed to selection biases, such as surgical referral of patients with better general status, less advanced primary                        tumors, lower burden of metastatic disease, and better response to systemic treatment (49,53). The question is whether these patients lived longer because of tumor removal or had their tumors removed because of a predicted                        longer survival (67). A publication bias of reporting preferably the positive studies also cannot be excluded (49). Nevertheless, results of multivariable analyses, which control for these confounding factors, consistently suggest a survival                        benefit for optimal local treatment of the primary tumor. Many questions still remain unsolved, including which patients could                        benefit most from surgery and what is its optimal timing and the best systemic treatment for these selected patients (51,53,68).                     In conclusion, there is a bulk of retrospective data suggesting the importance of local treatment of primary tumor and strongly                        recommending that well-conducted randomized trials are performed in this setting. One such trial is being developed under                        the joint effort of Breast International Group and the North American Intergroup. While waiting for data from these studies,                        surgery for breast primary tumor can be considered as a relatively inexpensive and low morbidity treatment, which can offer                        a rapid local control and has a potential for survival benefit, provided it is performed optimally. Sorry for not reformatting the above. Since this  2010 article was published there has been newer research on how breast cancer cells talk to healthy cells. Here's an article about one study: http://life.nationalpost.com/2012/12/21/canadian-scientists-discover-how-cancer-cells-communicate-with-healthy-cells-in-major-breakthrough/ The research team is looking to develop drugs known as biologics that would block this signal pathway between cells. \u201cInstead of only targeting the primary tumour, we can now pinpoint the cells in the tumour\u2019s environment that are responding to the tumour and target those too,\u201d said Valbona Luga, a co-author of the study published Thursday in the journal Cell. \u201cWe hope to use our new knowledge of the tumour\u2019s immediate surroundings to intercept its signals to cancer cells, and by doing so, drastically impede tumour spreading,\u201d she said. I would say surgical removal of the tumour's immediate surroundings does the same thing. But biologic drugs may be the answer in the future.",

I haven't set down my meds just taking a low dose of 5 mg Tamoxifen. Now 11 years NED and on anti-estrogens I hope to go another 4 years on this dose.  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3878717/ \"The fact that dormant micrometastases stay in distant organs for many years suggests a long evolutionary process of these cells after their departure from the primary tumor. During this time, independent genetic and epigenetic traits may arise and drive the recurrences which will not be present the original primary tumors (59). Thus, it may be necessary to examine the metastases from patients with late relapses and compare them to the primary tumor and early metastases to decipher the genetic or epigenetic alterations that lead to late recurrences. Other factors may also confound the prediction of late recurrences. Some late recurrences may exceed the detection threshold, but are asymptomatic and undetected till the patients are deceased.\" They are talking about early stage here but NED is NED, some relapses are early, some late. They also give an example of an ER+ woman with kidney stones who was found to have bone mets upon CT 22 years after primary diagnosis. I do believe it is important to maintain strong bones, ie, maintain the balance of osteoclast differentiation (see Figure 2 in article), and do regular strength training for that.  My onc wants to know at each visit whether my weight is stable (still yes) and whether I am exercising (still yes). I don't really talk about the future with my onc. But if I were to stop my meds at the 15 year mark, I would first want to do a CTC test, a DEXA scan for bone density, maybe a full body CT (which I haven't had now for 4 years), and Zometa infusion (which I haven't had for 6 years), just for one last osteoclast inhibiting drip. I probably should start discussing these things with my onc. Maybe throw in a gene sequencing test as a baseline for genetic or epigenetic alterations. By then my insurance would probably prefer I just continue with my cheap drug. Thanks for letting me ramble.",

As for the statistics, this is from bco's Lower Your Risk section:  Compared to normal weight women, obese women had an 11% greater risk of dying from breast cancer during the 10 years after diagnosis. The risk of dying from breast cancer more than 10 years after diagnosis was also greater for obese and overweight women. Compared to normal weight women: Overweight and obese women didn't respond as well to treatment compared to normal weight women. Normal weight women had the best response to adjuvant chemotherapy and hormonal therapy (treatments given after surgery to reduce the risk of the cancer coming back). Normal weight women were 77% more likely to benefit from chemotherapy and 57% more likely to benefit from hormonal therapy compared to women who were obese, after 10 years of follow-up. http://www.breastcancer.org/risk/new_research/20091211b.jsp  \"Risk of dying from breast cancer\" translates more or less to risk of getting mets, unless you die from treatment-related complications at an earlier stage. So something smaller than 11% would be the risk within 10 years. Maybe for that your doctor didn't think it was worth mentioning, but for 38% higher risk more than 10 years after diagnosis even adjusted for treatment-related deaths, I would want my doctor to be mentioning it. Risk factors are not certainties but still good to know. I have made decisions based on lower risks than 38%. This is just one study but is a huge one with 19,000 Danish women. They seem to have left out the risks for underweight women.",

I think clinical trials will have to be redesigned to reflect our diverse genetic/ genomic profiles. Cancer is just too complex and doesn't lend itself to oversimplified theories. Take soy. Might the fact that I grew up eating a lot of it influence whether it is beneficial for me or not? Probably. Do I know which way the effect might go in this case? Not really. So I take it in moderation. Same with dairy. I never had that much of it, but ate a ton of cottage cheese (without ever having heard of the Gerson diet) while on chemo. (It had a nice neutral taste.) Did it help me get to NED? Who knows. It most likely didn't hurt although the lack of dairy apparently didn't hurt Jane Plant. Chemo likely helped both of us, but there are some people who won't respond to chemo or certain chemo agents.  Your past treatment serves to complicate matters (I was chemo-naive), your health history, your past lifestyle, maybe the lifestyle of your parents or grandparents. Our bodies absorb all these influences, even before we are born. With early stage breast cancer I think it is reasonable to rely on the probabilities. With Stage IV, too much has gone wrong and the probabilities provided by conventional approaches too unsatisfactory that doctors can't even agree among themselves. Again because it has to be a tailored approach and the tailors have their own biases as well. I trust my onc but in the end it's my quality of life and only I can decide how much of it I want vs. how many months Treatment X might be able to give me. If metsers feel great while on alt treatments, that counts for a lot in my book. Now if they're starving to death, that is nothing for me. I'm not sure how QOL issues are handled in clinical trials for Stage IV. Also do they take into account whether one exercises or eats healthy and the synergies these may have?",

At 7 years, DD was dealing with a bald mom who needed a lot of help and was often in the hospital. I told her teacher and after-school caregivers. Although I didn't like her teacher's immediate (somewhat selfish) response - \"why does this have to happen in my class?\" - she dealt with the resulting issues quite well. The caregivers, who had seen me deteriorating, frightened her the most with their concern for me. We tried to tell her that I was being treated and would eventually get stronger. I always thought it better to be optimistic until one was certain of a dire outcome. In 4th grade, I also told the teacher but she was a bit more skeptical, partly because I didn't mention my stage and looked healthy. She might have thought this was some kind of ploy to gain her sympathy for my daughter. Then she probably talked with some other people in the school or was just simply impressed by my daughter and was more understanding. As my daughter enters a new school, I will probably not tell the teachers or anyone else anything as long as I remain NED. Unless DD has some kind of crisis resulting from her growing understanding of this disease. Ebru, wishing you the best in dealing with your son's situation. (((Hugs)))",

I would not want to pursue active treatment if I really had just a few months to live, but I'd make sure that was the case by seeking second or third opinions.

      "Content": "Sep 7, 2016 10:02AM Heidihill wrote: Thanks for sharing your story, Stephanie! It is interesting to see where yours dovetails with mine a bit. I never took estrogen but took drug holidays which would have had the effect of increasing estrogen endogenously. My oncologist gave me the idea when he mentioned a clinical trial for early stage, the Study on Letrozole Extension (SOLE). The premise of the trial is that a 3 month annual break after 5 years of continuous treatment resensitizes the body to estrogen. The trial had a fundraiser last year so it is likely still in progress. I didn't go for three months but a month in the summer with abundant Vitamin D production seemed reasonable. This helped me get through my Femara stint. I could always look forward to my break. Then there's the testoterone. Again I didn't take any testosterone pills but started progressive weight training. Apart from doing something for my bones I read there might be some benefit from the resulting testosterone spike (side effect alleviation and recurrence prevention). http://www.breastcancer.org/research-news/20130928... Now that I think about it, since I am now on tamoxifen the testosterone spikes I get from exercise are probably increasing my estrogen levels as I have enough aromatase to do that. So it may be worth switching back to an AI at some point. ",

      "Content": "Jan 14, 2014 10:22PM - edited Jan 14, 2014 10:41PM by Heidihill Zero ctc is a prognostic marker more than anything. Tumor cells in the blood die off so it's possible they are all dead by the time the sample gets to the lab. A blood draw is just a sampling from our whole blood supply so live tumor cells may not be congregating near the needle stick at that point. At least this is how I think of my own 0 ctc result from last year, which may be a right or wrong way of viewing it. My doctor wants me to do another one soon. I might wait until insurance starts paying for it because it's a pain in the pocket.  Denise, congrats on your full remission and clear node. Zometa is more likely effective for postmenopausal women as an anti-recurrence drug, in which category you probably are if you are taking anastrazole. Hope you get more mileage from it as a bone strenghthener, too.",

So it's my own experiences that made me say what I did. OTOH I would say someone with pancreatic cancer really needs a machete while I definitely need just the scissors. I just wanted to emphasize the relative nature of our diseases and maybe even question whether breast cancer is really a chronic disease.

In your shoes, I would switch to Tamoxifen. In the past 3 years I've switched from Femara to Arimidex to Tamoxifen to Arimidex and back to Tamoxifen again, for eye issues and major nerve inflammation (with right side numbness) due to injury. With the last one my onc switched me to Tamoxifen and added cortisone. I also did acupuncture and massage concurrently. There is some evidence that the lack of estrogen promotes inflammation. So a selective estrogen receptor modulator, which can act as an estrogen agonist in some tissues, maybe including brain and nerve, might be helpful. My problems resolved after a few months and has not recurred. That was more than a year ago. Maybe this is something for you as well.",

A treatment could work on the majority of cells but some may remain that won't ever respond to that particular treatment. Those remaining cells can proliferate over time and show up as a recurrence or progression at some point and will have to be treated with something else, or they may just chill out. The latter case is maybe because the cells that were killed were those that had the ability to form colonies and the ones that remained were the dumber ones. There are many possible scenarios when you think that cancer cells are not homogeneous. So our own NEDs are most probably never going to be alike. Even within the same NED period, particularly if you change treatment. For example, I switched to Tamoxifen from Femara about 18 months ago and my already low tumor markers have gone down after every three month interval we checked. Something must be going on. It's possible it's just the joint issues getting resolved, if that has anything to do with it. I do believe we have some control theoretically over the epigenetic part of the cancer-driving equation. But it will be different for each one of us and there is no way to tell to what extent and manner in each individual case. My onc just asked me to start taking metformin a few days ago. I am trying to research this now but just saw an article about metformin affecting epigenetic switches related to inflammation signalling pathways via glucose. I've only skimmed it but just in case anyone's interested (and has a lot of time) here is the link. There is something about using metformin with Tamoxifen so I'll have to see what that's about.  http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/12/27/1221055110.full.pdf  ",

From the same lead author, here is another article (which can be rented for free as with the full study for those who want to register.) http://www.deepdyve.com/lp/springer-journals/from-improved-survival-to-potential-cure-in-patients-with-metastatic-rtwWldYMh0 He mentions that 4 out of 5 patients who survived long-term without relapsing (9-14 years) never received chemotherapy. Targeted therapies were no less  effective for this group. Also this is a Japanese study and I wonder how much the Japanese diet and lifestyle had to do with the amazing results, for example: Those who received local therapies (N = 35) also showed better prognosis: OSR (overall survival rate) of 82% at 10 years and 53% at 20 years. It's interesting though that in multivariate analyses there were no factors favoring better prognosis for overall survival rates, just for relapse-free rates. I take this to mean that OMBC is better used to predict length of NED but not necessarily length of survival. Sort of confusing.",

In this case, it included neoadjuvant chemo (before surgery). Apparently (as I've only learned recently) this is worth doing at the outset for certain rare presentations with limited metastasis at initial diagnosis. In your sister's case, hormonal treatments may be the best because of the number of lymph nodes involved. It's worth asking her docs and maybe getting a second opinion. After four months of chemo, i went into remission/had NED. That was three years ago. Wish you all the luck and strength in this journey with your sister.",

(Maybe that's key in defining immunotherapy?)  It is based on DNA-recombinant humanized monoclonal antibodies (95% human, 5% mouse) and was designed to avoid rejection by the human body. I would not be first in line to get immunotherapy (as in vaccines) because my immune system tends to overreact. A strong immune response can quickly get out of hand and lead to death. An example is a case described in the polio virus trials.   ",

Moving the joints regularly stimulates collagen building to help with flexibility. What really helped was taking breaks, which I took with my doctor's consent at least once a year. Sometimes my break was just switching to another drug for a month. I was on Femara and once switched to Arimidex for a month and another time my onc said to take a break with Tamoxifen I but preferred not to do a non-AI at the time. I've also taken a break by popping the pill every other day instead of every day. I couldn't have done Femara for 4.5 years without the breaks. Each time it took a while for SE's to set back in and were always less than the previous \"cycle.\" I eventually switched to low-dose Tamoxifen for 2 years, which was heaven. It's been nice not to have to worry about my bones for one. My onc put me back on Arimidex for a 6-month break from heaven (until January). I've now stopped it prematurely as a Christmas present to myself as my hand was all swollen and my knuckles and fingers hurt. The swelling has gone down already with just one finger affected now. I'll start Tamoxifen again in a few days.",

My prevention strategy was to move my arms everyday (dancing) and I now lift weights everyday. There was just a study out which concluded that in cases like ours (with so many nodes removed), weight lifting reduced the risk of lymphedema by 70%! It is a lot of work and no, one doesn't have to exercise everyday, according to the study. We need to be exercising anyway to reduce our risk of recurrence/progression, so we can reduce our lymphedema risk right along with that.",

Exactly as Joy said, without weights or bands. Dancing with music. My rads onc was very pleased. I kept this up for months until I joined a gym and a personal trainer taught me to exercise with therabands. I used these and other elastic bands everyday for several months at home while graduating to free weights and machines at the gym. So start easy and progress. And yes, progressing means pain for me. Fortunately I never got LE. I have gotten swollen from flying and from a 6 hour hike in the mountains carrying a heavy pack. Massage helped to bring it back down each time.",

My post says exactly that and what I am advocating is people ask their doctors how they can prevent lymphedema through one of these protocols, preferrably both. I provided the links so people can read for themselves what these protocols are about. The medical world does not seem to be paying attention to our needs. I did my research as I am at greater risk with 19 nodes removed and paid out of my own pocket for the preventive services I believed I needed, including manual lymph drainage, scar massage, physiotherapy, as in the Spanish study (which I did read), and 8 months after surgery a personal trainer, doing a progressive program like in the Schmitz study. I feel very lucky that I did these things and wanted to share this message with others. At the time of my surgery, these studies were not out, but there were other European studies I had read/read about, which brought me to my conclusion that massage as well as muscle conditioning/contraction was important in preventing lymphedema. And that now that these other studies are out, doctors should realize this has to be standard of care. Why do women have to wait until they get swollen if they are at risk and there are prevention strategies with studies to back them??? Please pester your doctors about this. Even if you only get the \"Spanish treatment\" (no weights), you are already far ahead of the game. I'm sorry if I didn't make this clear, Kira. I do understand your concerns more than you think. Jainey, you're welcome.  We need to educate our doctors about this. In my case, I have been lifting weights daily for 2 1/2 years now. That's a longer follow-up than the Schmitz study. I started VERY gradually because my bone mets had reached the stage where I could not carry my handbag, much less grocery bags and that was even before surgery. So I feel strongly that if I could do it, most others can, too.",

The last infusion was after a 2.5 year break, which was a few months before I switched from an AI to tamoxifen. With tamoxifen there's no need for Zometa if you're postmenopausal, as tamox strengthens the bones. After two years on tamox, my onc switched me to Arimidex. That was last August and now he plans to switch me back to tamoxifen in January. I prefer tamoxifen among all the meds I've had, so no problem with that as well as not having to have Zometa infusions anymore. I'm sure you will do fine with every other month. ETA: The last long interval was my decision as I felt Zometa was causing me more joint pain.  ",

Above are links to the summary and to the text of a Spanish study financed by the Spanish Health Ministry which reaches pretty much the same conclusion (72% risk reduction). There are other European studies, but I can't cite them, sorry. I do recall a German one. Unfortunately, it is up to us to undertake the necessary precautions/interventions because the protocols described in these studies are not standard of care. In an ideal world, every woman at risk should have access to interventions post-surgery before any sign of lymphedema, just as you would be entitled to complete rehabilitation if you had broken an arm. After all, 80% of lymphedema cases are diagnosed during the first year after surgery. Interventions like the Spanish one, following close to surgery, would help so many people. The recommended exercises are described in the article. The Schmitz study using weights looks at patients having therapy at least one year after surgery. So either way seems to work. Doing both probably would help most. Maybe the best approach is to for people to ask their doctors what their risk of LE is and ask if preventive measures could be taken that doesn't imply hiring a personal valet to carry groceries and such (the personal valet idea is from Dr. Schmitz, as quoted here ).",
