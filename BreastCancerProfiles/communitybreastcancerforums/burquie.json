I'm feeling a little better everyday; Went to the plastic surgeon yesterday, she said my reduction side looks great! My mastec/reconstr side she left one drain in, needs to get to <20cc's, right now it's at 50....... oh I can't wait! I think the drains sites are what most of the discomfort is from... mind you its not a lot of discomfort, but you know it's there. I was also having some blistering on my incision on the mastec side, just have to put some antibiotic ointment on it. My husband said it looks better already today. My only other discomfort comes from where she put the expander under my chest muscle..... by the end of the day it feels like I've been lifting weights!!! Next week I see the oncologist to see what's next; still haven't heard from my general surgeon in regards my path report, but I see him early next week also. Well,just wanted to check in..... Hope everyone has a great weekend; and Happy Mothers Day!!!

I know it's an old cliche, but everyone does react differently. Having said that; I was sick after my first AC, they changed my med to Kytril, and I never had a problem after that. The only other thing was that I found myself getting fatigued more easily. Of course the loss of hair after around the 14th day, and the tast thing. Some people get a metallic taste in their mouth, others like me just lose their taste for everything! Remember to take your anti-nausea meds even if you don't feel sick....... it's hard to play \"catch up\" with them. And remember to drink, drink drink, even if it doesn't taste very good; sometimes using a straw to drink helps. Good luck on your journey.......... You will make it!! Bonnie",

He said when he first looked at my reports he was on the fence about doing rads. Then the more he looked it over, he has recommended that I do 5 1/2 weeks of rads. He explained that I had some angiolymphatic plugs found in the pathology. If it was just my tumor and the mastectomy he would say no rads, if it was just the tumor and the 2 nodes he would have said no rads, but the combination of all 3 he feels I should do them. And seeing as its my body he left it totally up to me to decide.......... damn it! I KNOW what I should do and I Know that I will. But I just thought maybe this damn journey was going to be coming to an end. So today I'm a little depressed and discouraged. I know it will get better. I will be seeing him on Thursday when I go for my last chemo and will firm things up with him about when I start. Bonnie",

So we will try again in a few days. yes, he was a smoker.......and was told he should stop.....but those damn things just had a hold of him that he couldn't shake. He is only 45.......I am scared out of my mind......first me being sick, and now him. The boys are in a state shock. I will keep you updated.",

My youngest son has also been sick for the past couple days with a fever and sore throat.......ever feel like you have a big black cloud over your head??? Well, I sure do! I personally am doing okay I guess. I have a couple dr's appts next week, one with plastic surgeon and the other with my thyroid dr. I hope everyone is feeling well and living life!

The only thing I could feel was  a little pulling and tugging. She had to cut away a little scar tissue that developed. Put in a few dissolvable stitches, steri strips and I was good to go........ until the numbing stuff stopped working. Then it was xtra strength tylenol here I come! It's still a little uncomfortable today, but nothing too bad. Glad that it's out...... now they will ultra sound me again to see the status of that bloodclot, maybe I can get off the blood thinners.

I called the surgeons office this morning, and they are sending me for an ultrasound of my arm tomorrow morning. Why can't things just be easy in this whole ordeal???

Taking care of people is what I do best; I (along with my dh) hospiced at home his father with cancer, my mother with alzheimers and my 82 yr old dad still lives with us. (he has COPD and diabetes, but holding steady, thank god!) And my boys are both young men and don't need muching caring for anymore........ so I'm running out of people to take care of.

Just take a preventative aspirin dose everyday); thickening uterine lining(made an appt for next month with the gyn).

Of course everyone is different in how they feel, rely on your Dr's judgement, that's what he is getting the big bucks for!

I will probably only need the injections a few days, thank God. I also start on the coumadin tomorrow, and will be on that for a while I guess. Thanks for all the good thoughts and words of encouragement from everyone. I just can't wait until we are all done with this crap! Debbie M: that story of that woman NOT doing rads helps me with my decision to do rads! Well ladies, I have had an exhausting day, so I'm off to bed a little early tonight.

I have been having to go and get my coumadin levels checked a couple times a week; still trying to get me on an even level with that. I think the vein in my \"good arm\" is gonna wear out if they don't get it soon. For some reason they don't want the lab getting it through the port. I go next week for my 3 week checkup (sooo nice not having to go for treatment this week ); I also see the rad onc and have a CT scan. Hope everyone is feeling okay. Bonnie",

I was a little nervous, not so much that they would see something, but because of the \"changes in the boob geography\", . The tech was actually going to look to compare my leftside (reconstructed) to my last film. HA! I said don't bother honey..... it's completely different..... a lot less there!

I also have been noticing some extra tightness around my expander on my reconstructed side. So I mentioned this all to the Dr who was going to be giving me my iodine. She, by the way is a radiation onc at one of the hospitals. She gives me a pretty thorough going over, and when she looks at my neck and breast area she asks if I'm always this red?? I said \"no, didn't notice I was red......but I was! She says she thinks I have \"radiation recall\"; this can be caused from the chemo and rads I had, or I now just found out.... a side effect from the tamoxifen and the rads I had. Would have been nice if someone would have mentioned this possible effect earlier! I had never heard of such a thing!  She contacted my PS right away (I'm due for exchange surgery on April 11th) they decided to put me on some antibiotics....just to make sure I don't have an infection. I have to call on Monday to let them know how things look, if I am still red and irritated there is else something they will give me. So here I sit.......all radioactive inside and out!",

Kathleen, glad to hear it's \"just\" an infection; I know every little ache and pain and anything unusual really gets to us. Sorry for the delay in your tx, I know you must be getting anxious to get it over with! Linda, I'm wondering when they are going to take my port out; at first the surgeon told me he likes to keep it 3-6 months after treatment, but now that it has caused a blood clot, I'm wondering if he will take it sooner. It doesn't really bother me, except if I sleep too long on that side. And I' have been trying not to do that..... wondering if that is what helped the clot to form? Terry, good for you for attending the walk! I couldn't even think about attending the one here. That last dose of Taxol kicked my butt this past weekend! Saturday I got up, had a 1/2 cup of coffee and had to go back to bed, felt like I was going to pass out! I slept for another hour and then hubby made me breakfast. Finally managed to get dressed around 1 (thinking it would help me feel better) and then just stayed on the couch all day!  Sunday was a little better but still extremely tired. I'm soooo looking forward to feeling \"almost normal\". I had an appt with the PS this morning. She did my final fill of my expander. She said if any problems from radiation develop, she'll deal with it. The most important thing is to do everything possible to make sure we get all the cancer. So, I don't have to see her until after the first of the year. I hope everyone is feeling well! For those of you almost done with chemo, remember we are all standing at the finish line waiting for you! Bonnie",

That's what he gets paid the big bucks for. second: was the drain that was removed from the area that is now swollen?? If so, it might possibly be some fluid collecting. If that is the case and it gets very bothersome, the Dr can drain it off. No biggie. Sorry you have joined our club..... but everyone here is great! You will find WONDERFUL support here.",

I just got over a case of MRSA, and after being on heavy antibiotics for 2 months I developed thrush all down my esophagus(sp?). I would get hungry, start to eat, my stomache would hurt, felt very full and couldn't eat any more. I lost about 10 lbs before they finally put be on some meds for it. It tokk a couple weeks to clear up. Hope you're soon able to eat something!",
