My mother past 17 years ago with breast cancer and took care of her. Well at 44 years old now, I recently had a mastectomy with stage 1 found two cancers on same breast. I'm now faced with making a decision of doing chemo or not after receiving my oncotype of 20. (Estrogen 80% driven, HER2 negative). My oncologist says that it's a personal decision, but highly recommends that I do chemo followed by hormone treatment. I'm not looking forward to chemo as I have seen how my mother was when I would take her and specially the hair loss. I will be taking a genetic testing (sister found negative) just for my kids and family being informed. But it seems hereditary because my mother's sister also had breast cancer in her 40's. I appreciate feedback from your stage-oners.",

My oncologist says that it's a personal decision, but recommends that I do chemo since they found two cancers. I'm also have an appt. for genetic testing. The testing is for future decision down the road not to help me make a decision for my chemo. I really appreciate everyone comments and feedback. ",

The onco said that for the chemo treatment to be effective, the treatment must be done as soon as my surgery. Meanwhile, I have an appointment with my hairstylist (for over 20 yrs), so I'll have to break the news to her.I'm looking at getting a short blunt cut which will be about 8 inches shorter than now. Yes, I'm leaning more to doing a chemo b/c of my mother and aunt. I have my 9 year old son to watch grow. :) Both Diagnosis 6/2/2011:  Grade 2, Invasive duct Carcinoma, 1.1cm, Stage 1, nodes all negative.  ",
