She can choose to just say that she's fine or it could be the door for her to talk. I'm more concerned about the second part of your entry, about whether to keep your mouth shut about the chemo. If you do get into a conversation about the BC, just offer your experience and hopefully she will ask questions. Like, \"When I was first diagnosed, my first thought was 'I don't want to loose my hair.' but I learned that it wasn't so terrible being bald. Knowing that I was doing something to save my life, took the fear away.\" You aren't ever inappropriate when you give your own experience and that is'nt nosy or preachy. Take care.",
