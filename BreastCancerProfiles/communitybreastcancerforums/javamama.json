      "Content": "Oct 29, 2016 01:17PM - edited Oct 29, 2016 03:09PM by javamama Alright ladies. Just got back from NOLA. UMX and DIEP went great. In fact, I feel great. 11 days post-op and I have very few limitations other than what my docs tell me I can't do. lol I still have two drains in, but I think one will be ready to be out by tomorrow or Monday at the latest. The other is still giving me good output so, that will come out later. Now for the bad news. All my diagnostic tests showed a smallish tumor with no node involvement. Well, my final pathology came back earlier this week and it is no bueno. Still treatable and curable, but I will now need chemo and radiation and hormone therapy. Before they cut on me, I was only slated with possible radiation and hormone therapy. They took a LOT of axillary nodes while I was under and I am grateful they did. I'm glad I did immediate reconstruction anyway. I've seen the pictures of women with nothing and with TEs in after they get radiated and I think a little extra tissue is very helpful to mitigate the damage to the skin and tissue. My fabulous PS gave me a huge boob so if there is necrosis or skin tightening due to radiation, I have enough to cut some damaged fat out and still match my right boob. He even gave me a little side boob to insulate as well. I wanted nipple sparing, but the BS said they couldn't let me keep my nipple AND have clear margins. So off with her head. Besides, my boob tried to kill me. I'm glad I killed it first. My PS said chemo won't hurt the foob, but radiation can. And with the auxiliary dissection, lymphedema is on the table. But so far, my left arm is rocking this as well. I see my MO this coming Wednesday and will have a better idea of what my cancer killing protocol will be. But I know that the end will involve me going back to NOLA and getting my foob finished and any there revisions I need done... done. Yay for some finality. Well, other than the decade or so of hormone suppression therapy. Ha! I am so glad everyone's surgery went well. ",

I hope I avoid some of the complications that I've seen others going through with their DIEPs. My left arm is still limited din range of motion- mostly from pain, not because I can't. Doing some stretching exercise and the lymphedema exercises they gave me. I think it's helping. But who knows? My cancer brain is freaked right out. I still can't get over how far off my mammogram and ultrasound were from what they found inside my boob. And I'm also freaked out that I need chemo and radiation now. It might have made a difference in whether I did the immediate reconstruction. I talked with my PS before I left NOLA and he said the chemo shouldn't affect the flap at all, but radiation might. It's why he made my boob extra big. Because if I get some necrosis, he can cut it out at phase 2 and I will still have tons of boob left to match the right. However, if I had known I had node involvement, I might have made a different decision re: keeping my right boob. After the fact knowledge is shitty when it might've made a difference in how I decided to do stuff. Hopefully, chemo and rads and hormone suppression will make keeping the right boob okay in the long run. And kill any rogue cancer cells that broke free. But I'm worried that chemo is starting so close to my surgery date- it'll be 4 weeks out. I worry that the caustic stuff coursing through my veins trying to kill cancer and kill me at the same time doesn't interfere with healing. Because the very last thing I need is chemo to interrupt wha tI think is pretty rapid stitching together of my body. If it slows down, will I get infected, will the sutures open up, will holes start to open up in my boob because my cells are dying from the chemo? So many fears. Is it weird that I am more upset at losing my hair- my one real vanity- than I would be to lose a boob? Although both would be totally devastating. If I had to choose an either/or. To lose my hair AND not heal well would suck. I just want one thing to go well. And come Monday, they will do a full body CT scan, bone density, and echocardiogram. But I don't want to do any of that because I'm afraid that they will find something else. Or it'll be worse than we thought. Or something BAD will happen. The only good thing that's come back in my favor is the 21 gene panel showing zero gene involvement. I also feel like I'm on a frickin' freight train barreling down to a unknown crash. From the first diagnosis via mammogram it's been balls to the wall... kill the cancer/cut it out/scorch the Earth and do it fast, fast, fast. ",

Met with the doc yesterday. All my scans came back clean. No evidence of any cancer anywhere else in my body. And my heart looks good as well. Get my port installed next Tuesday. Drop off cold caps on the Friday before I start chemo on Monday the 21st. Got my chemo calendar from my nurse navigator as well. You know, for someone who doesn't like to go see doctors or spend time at hospitals and medical offices, I am at the docs an awful lot. My worst nightmare. I discussed several vitamins and supplements with the doc and he seemed okay with most everything. Which makes me feel better. One more thing I CAN control. As I've stated since getting the cancer diagnosis, I feel out-of-control. And not in a drank too much and danced on the table/bar kinda of way. But fell into a river with class 5 rapids and I can't catch my breath, keep my head above water, or making any decisions about anything. Ugh. I do better if I can make a decision, do something to mitigate SEs, something to feel like I have some control over a small part of what's happening. My dad flew to me when I found out my diagnosis. And my hubby has been the bomb. My college aged kids have been freaked. But slowly, all of us are getting our heads wrapped around cancer, the disease, the diagnoses and all that comes with it. Sadly, my dad had to get home today after staying for two months. I can't tell y'all what a comfort it's been having him around. With the holidays coming up, I should get my kids to come home to help fill that hole. Family makes me happy. And having the solid support of those I love and who love me has been so incredible. I can do this. I can face the chemo. I can face the side effects. I can. And you guys have helped as well. Reading your journey makes the path have more light so I don't feel like I'm walking into darkness. So thank you for that!",

Oh and eating ice cream as the chemo nurse shoots Adriamycin into my port. And driving home with the cold cap on. Chemo days are apparently going to be really COLD days for me. lol amw5- I think the bone pain is from neulasta shot. Which makes sense as it's forcing your bone marrow to produce white blood cells in a shorter period of time than it would normally. Questions- I had my pre-meds, but the chemo nurse seemed to think I might not need anti-nausea meds at all. Which flips me out because that seems to be the side effect hitting most of our group. I think I'm just going to take them anyway as a prophylactic measure anyway. I have them. I might as well use them. ",

Happy New Year, everyone. I hope this year is FAR better to you than the last. amyemm- girl, the way they told it to me is that cancer cells are sneaky and really small. And if they've gone on walkabout via the lymph system in any way, they might've gone walk about via other systems as well- like blood. And they've gone to a sunny destination to chill and stay for a bit. Not showing up on any diagnostics. Fooling us and lulling us into a false sense of security. While they root down and dig in. Chemo is the attack system that roots them out. It travels all the same pathways those sneaky cancer cell bastards have traveled and found those nooks and crannies and crevices. And then it kicks cancer's ass. Radiation is salting the Earth to make the location of the original tumor inhospitable. Like a barren wasteland desert. But chemo? Ninja warriors. Some tumors respond visibly to chemo by shrinking. Other cancer's don't. But chemo stops it from spreading even if the original tumor size isn't affected. And if you are young, they will err on the side of caution and throw the entire- very strong- kitchen sink at you to make sure you're long term results are good. Because that's the end game. Making sure we live LONG lives. Kick cancer's ass, all!",

Ugh. hopfull2- the docetaxel works on slow growth cells. I didn't realize that the hair on our head and those of our eyebrows/lashes are actually on different growth cycles. From everything I've read, head hair is more impacted by AC than CT and hair on the eyes is more impacted by CT than AC. Weird, I know. But there you have it. What one chemo treatment leaves, the other treatment kills. Go figure. lol Today I go see my MO and get more labs drawn so that tomorrow they may infuse poison into my veins. I can't top thinking about it. I am also cold capping and it makes for an incredibly long day. No big shed so far and no big scalp tingling. But my first AC treatment was just two weeks ago. So, I'm not expecting anything on that front until next week or a little later. I need to get to one of the those look good classes. I feel terrible. The cold capping is making me wash my hair far less than I normally would and I look like a meth head. Not heroin chic, but meth chic. lol Infusion Tuesday has me up at 2am. I'd just gotten my body to stay asleep until 4am. But the stress of the upcoming infusion has me all insomniacal. lol That's a new word I just invented. Not maniacal. Insomniacal. lol Crazy with no sleep. That's me. I am one down, seven more to go. After tomorrow, I will be two down, six more to go. I can do this. To live and see my sons have children and travel with my husband, I can do this. To play with my puppy, I can do this. Yes, I got a new puppy back in April, long before I knew my life was changing. I am so glad I have her. She's so awesome. I bought coloring books with bad, naughty words. To color while doing chemo and cold capping. It seemed appropriate. lol",

With young children, google is great or get a book to talk about it with them. My kids are older- both in college and majoring in sciences- so once I told them, they did their own research and ask me how I'm feeling most of the time. Because in this day and age, cancer ISN'T a death sentence. So while my kids are apprehensive, it's manageable for them. Crazy thing? People you expect to step up, don't. But that's not a problem for me. Everyone deals with bad crap in a different way. It's the people you didn't expect to step up that takes you by surprise. And it really makes my heart happy. Anyway, once you get over being hurt by those who fall back, you get inspired by those who walk forward. But don't be mad at people who don't know how to handle the C word. They might actually have their own shit they are going through and might not have the ability to support you, too. Not everyone lets it all hang out and you might not know they're having problems at their job, at home, with their kids, etc. Also, some people think that if bad things happen to you, it could happen to them. And they don't want to face that possibility on the daily. Or they could just be assholes. But you don't know. So, cut people some slack. They might be going to counseling before they divorce and haven't told anyone, not even you and they just can't help you because they can barely help themselves. So, take heart. Cancer sucks.

Mittleschmerz. Anyway, I had and still have a pulsing sensation coming from both ovaries. It started mid morning yesterday, got super painful last night, and had lessened somewhat this morning. It hurts like a mofo, y'all. I had labs done yesterday so I got to speak with my nurse nav as well. At first, the pain from my ovaries and my bones all crashed together to make me feel like my blood pressure was high. I had them check. Nope. Pretty good. My blood work came back great as well. So, I asked my nurse about it and she said the last bit of the neulasta could be still impacting my body. That I might be supersensitive to neulasta. Which sucks.

For some reason, I thought they put you under for the install. Instead, my interventional radiology dept put me into twilight. Fentanyl and versed. I was conscious through most of it. And talkative. My social retardation comes through as chattiness. I overcompensate with being a talker in stress situations. So, that what I did. And my poor nurse kept pushing more drugs because she thought I wasn't sedated enough. I was. Anyway, I was far more worried about the port install than I should've been. Although, I have a feeling that once all the numbing agents wear off later today, I'm going to wish I had way more fentanyl and versed just lying around. lol My first chemo is Monday. And it's another stressful unknown. Not as much as the port install or the mastectomy. But I worry. More for the Side Effects than anything else. And not the normal side effects, but the dangerous ones. I would be okay with some nausea. I would not be okay with heart damage. And when I brought this up to the chemo nurse at chemo class, she told me that every side effect from chemo can be managed. Cancer can't. Cancer kills. So, that pretty much puts things into perspective and yet I am still apprehensive. Welcome to all the new ladies joining the thread. I've been reading it all. I haven't been able to respond, though. It's hard enough just trying to sit with my own fears that sometimes trying to type isn't the thing my brain can let me do. Watch stupid movies seems to be about the most strenuous mental thing I can manage on some days.",

I've often thought about started a secret- not just private or closed- Facebook group for chatting when the no sleeps pop up because it helps to chat with others who are awake for the same reason you are... cancer. lol Anyway, if you can't sleep, pop in here and post. Many times, I think I come take a look to see what other people are up to. Rachel- see if your doc will let you have magnesium. I get the kind that's good for lots of stuff AND pooping. Just a little extra mag might help the yogurt and whatever else you might be using. I'm taking 500mg of a multiple magnesium pill and it's helped. Now, for the first 3 days or so, it doesn't help as much as I'd like. But the rest of the time, I am like clockwork when I first wake up. My MO also stated a glass of wine or two every once in a while isn't terrible. But I'm on AC which I think gets metabolized via the kidneys- it's why our pee turns pink with the C portion of the chemo. And so, tylenol and alcohol, I think are metabolized via the liver. So maybe there is a difference there. I know once I switch chemo drugs to the T portion, I'm suppose to switch from tylenol to advil. Because you are trying to use a different metabolism pathway than the chemo drugs. However, none of us unless we are really compromised should have an issue with using our kidneys or our liver even during chemo. But it helps to not tax those organs so much when they are working to rid the body of the poison we deliberately ingested. Those are my thoughts and .02 cents. But I'd really press your MO about this if it's important. I can live without a glass of wine. Now, I won't be happy that I can't for 4 or 5 months, but I can do it. But it was sure a good thing that I could toast with some prosecco on Turkey Day with my family. I plan on having a glass at Christams dinner and for brining in the NEw Year.",

Monday is a CT full body scan, bone density, and echocardiogram. I go to chemo class the day after. The docs talks to me about my tests the day after that. And then literally the next week, I start chemo. I feel like my brain is going to explode. I found out I had cancer in August. We thought it was a small tumor and no node involvement. But when they opened me up for my UMX last month, big tumor and positive nodes. I'm in a full on tailspin. My very doable surgery/recon/tamoxifen plan was completely blown to smithereens. I don't want chemo and to lose all my hair. I don't want radiation and to have skin/fat damage. Jesus. I feel like screaming and crying and just hiding. And I am PISSED that I didn't find this earlier. Like seriously. Ugh. AC/T are my poisons. AC for 8 weeks, given every 2 weeks. Then T for 4 weeks (I think). Maybe it's 8 weeks. I know it's not the one every week for 12 weeks. It's the shorter course with the higher dose. Double Ugh. Shit. Shit. Shit.",

I ordered the Polar Cold Caps. http://www.polarcoldcaps.com It's $395/mo to rent the whole kit with a $395 rental deposit that you get back when you return the kit. There are two or three huge threads about cold caps in the side effects forum. I spent the last few days reading through them. I think if you have short hair, it might be okay to lose it during chemo. But if you have one hair and it's going to take 2, maybe 3 years to grow it back that long, it might be worth cold caps vs. wigs and hair accessories.",

Cancer has sucked so bad, I feel like I whine all the time about the crap I'm going through. So I've vowed to try and not express such negative thoughts- but once you get cancer it's like you can't HELP but think the worst of everything- in my real life. My family is scared shitless. And not that I think more of them than of me, I really don't want to add to their apprehensions. Well, my hubby really since my kiddos are off at college. Bu they FaceTime to check in on me. Anyway, I've noticed that I'm whining way more on here than I would normally. But I don't think it's a bad thing if it helps relieve some of the real life lamentations. Not that y'all should be the only ones to hear my fears. But seriously, who else would understand them anyway? ;) I'm about to take another tylenol and try and get some sleep. Hopefully in a day or two the port will stop hurting and I, too, will forget it's there.",

Also, having some baking soda and peppermint to swirl seems to keep some of the fuzz at bay. But still... The mouth issue is GROSS. Two days post 1st chemo- Still feeling pretty good. Woke up with a headache. Started feeling more congested last night and it feels like a sin headache today. Only I'm pretty sure it's chemo sinus headache and not pollen related. Ugh. I'll take my claritan again this morning. Not that it's doing anything for this congestion. lol On a side note: My TOM came on Monday right before my first chemo. My ovaries were all... they I hear these drugs might turn Javamama into a menopausal bitch. We have to give her one last hooray, just in case. Cue the heaviest TOM I've had in YEARS. Now, this could be because I cut my estrogen/progesterone positive tumors OUT which impacted how much hormones was available for uptake by the rest of my body- my first TOM after surgery was brightly colored where it had been getting darker as I got older. I know, too much TMI. But I swear it all plays into my crazy chemo mind. So the only thing I was looking forward to during chemo was the loss of my period. Period. The only thing. And now it's here, all brightly colored and just MORE since I have had my tumor cut out. Chemo drugs be damned, because not even the infusion on Monday did anything to lessen anything. So there's that little bit by my body trying to make things so much more interesting for me.",

So this year, instead of me cooking ALL THE THINGS, I decided to let go of control and let my husband and two college-aged boys take care of Turkey dinner. It was a leap of faith. Because I love to cook. And I love food. Good food makes my little heart sing. And if I'm in the zone, cooking is very zen mediation for me. But, but, but... this year, I have cancer. And although, I've gotten the tumor cut out, I still have cancer and cancer treatments. I can't remember how far out you have to be to be declared cancer free, until then, I have cancer. Which makes my brain hurt and my heart as well. But I have an awesome family who wanted to take care of me this year. And even though there is a small kernel of me who WANTS to be a bad ass in the kitchen, there is HUGE realistic girl in me who know- KNOWS, yo -that cancer won't let me be me this year and I have to choose to do something else. And in that choice, I can be bitchy cancer Dawn- that's my name, Dawn- or gracious cancer Dawn. And make my family feel great in the process. We ordered a complete ham dinner from Wegman's plus two pies- pumpkin and apple crumb. And we ordered a heritage brined turkey from our butcher, which my husband cooked off. Dinner was fantastic. Very low stress. Very high emotional reward for everyone. And I think we are going to do the same thing for Christmas dinner. Easy, low key and where everyone feels great about what they did. Plus, my two boys were home and that makes everything fabulous. I hope YOUR thanksgiving was wonderful and an experience for which to give thanks as well as being good eats!",
