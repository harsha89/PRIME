My mom tried to get me to go to the one in PA because they had some complementary/alternative treatment in addition to conventional treatment.  I talked on the phone with someone there and it was like she was trying to sell me on the place.  She supposedly had bc and some other cancer (or recurrence, I don't remember) and two young boys (like me) and her husband left her (like mine did) and nothing worked until she went to CTCA, etc, etc.  I wasn't feeling real great about the conversation but was giving her my info anyway and just then my cell phone died.  I took that as a sign and didn't call her back! I'm sure they're legitimate and if you're close to one it might be nice to be able to get all your treatment in one place.  I just wasn't comfortable with it and decided a local naturopath could help me with the alternative stuff while my local Onc took care of the conventional stuff.  And it ended up that my naturopath followed a lot of the protocol that the docs at CTCA follow so I'm glad I didn't spend the extra money to travel there just for that. Hope that helps a little and good luck to you!",

For one, ask as many questions you need to until you feel comfortable and understand what they are talking about.  I asked questions in the beginning but the techs kind of blew me off.  I didn't get brave enough to ask again (different tech) until the end and she explained things much better and I realized only a teeny tiny sliver of my lung was in the beam, not the whole lung.  I spent all that time worrying for nothing. Some people are laying on their backs, some on their bellies, some get 3 weeks, some get 7 weeks, some have their armpit and/or clavicle, some just the breast.  It all depends on your stats. How long you lay there varies too but it's usually only about 5 minutes from start to finish.  It usually takes longer for them to get you layed down and moved to the position they want you in and set up the machine than the actual radiation takes.  I had about 6 zaps on an angle from the right side and then the machine would move over to the left and go about another 7 times.  Each time varied from a few seconds to about 15 seconds. Side effects vary too.  For me, I was just red and itchy.  They prescribed me radiaplex and that helped a lot.  It took about two weeks for the redness to go away once I was done and about the same time is when the fatigue set in and lasted a couple weeks.  That was it!  I'm four months out and have had no problems with skin or lungs.  I do feel fatigued a lot, but I'm also finishing up my Herceptin so it's hard to say what the fatigue is from. I'm a person that believes the mind has a huge effect on our bodies.  I believe if you truly keep thinking something horrible is going to happen, there's a good possibility that it will and vice versa.  Someone told me to go in thinking about the rays of radiation as a silver bullet that's going to kill any leftover cancer.  I'm not a big Jesus person, but for some reason I decided to see it as rays of light coming from Jesus' hands healing me.  Or I'd pretend I was sunbathing nude on the beach cause the techs always had good music on!   Another great thing to use is Belleruth Naparstek's Meditation for Radiation Treatment.  I would listen to that every night while going to sleep and it helped a lot too. Good luck ladies - it seems like a lot in the beginning but you'll get through it quicker than you think.  I'm sure others will chime in with points I missed.",

I think I actually ended up manifesting those side effects.  This time around, the Tam is my only option for tx so I every time I take a pill, I tell myself how good it is for me and how much I love taking it and how it's going to save my life.  It's corny, but hey, I'm 6 wks in and have had no problems.  And I stear clear of the Tam threads! As for me, I'm headed back to surgery tomorrow.  I developed an infection in the left side just yesterday and my PS wants to have a look around and see if he can save my TE's. I'm so discouraged and so sick of feeling sick. My dad and step mom had to come over and clean for me today and now they're going to be stuck taking care of my boys for the good part of the week...I'm just so tired of being a burdon to people and not being able to do things on my own.

I didn't get a chance to read all the posts so I'm not sure where everyone is at in their tx, but for those in the middle of everything - the road seems impossibly long but you'll get there. It goes faster than you think, although not fast enough when you're in the midst of it, lol. Especially a year of Herceptin. I remember being so darn sick of that drug by about the 13th tx, but it must have worked because I was HER2- this time. Life does return to normal and you eventually start to feel wonderful again.  Funny that a couple of you are coders...I was in the coding program at Stark State but had to quit for now.  I'm hoping I can find a med office job soon here and continue the program next Jan.  Anyway, nice to meet you all!",

At this point we have some lingering potty training issues, but they've been through 4 moves in 4 years and adjusting to their dad leaving so I couldn't really say that the issues stem from just mommy being sick...it's probably a little bit of everything!

My twins were 3 when I was diagnosed.  Since I was a stay-at-home-mom, I knew they would notice a lot of different things going on.  Mine are the type that pick up on subtle changes and act out if they're not kept in the loop, lol!  I kept it simple but I did tell them pretty much everything in a way they could understand.  Kids get really crazy ideas sometimes if you don't let them know what's going on...like \"Maybe mommy's hair is gone because I was bad\" or \"Did I do something to make mommy sick?\".  It seems absurd to us, but at that age they are still thinking the world revolves around them so it makes sense to them. I just told my kids that mommy had an ouchie and that I was going to be going to the doctor A LOT!  The doctor would give me medicine to make the ouchie go away, but that medicine would make me tired and make my hair fall out.  I held all my hair back and made a funny face at them to make them laugh.  I let them know that lots of family - grandmas, grandpas, and aunts - would be keeping them safe at their houses when mommy felt tired or sick.  They loved \"camping out\" at family's house so this worked out really well.  We tried to stick to a routine as much as possible and during my \"good weeks\" we'd try to do lots of fun stuff.  After I'd get home from chemo, they'd ask if my ouchie was gone, which was heartbreaking in one sense, but gave me the gumption to keep on keepin' on for them.  They had no issues with my hair.  They watched as mommy got a special \"hair cut\" and laughed at my bald head. It's a tough decision and it's going to vary from family to family and kid to kid.  Usually, the hospital has social workers available at no cost to patients so you might want to check in with one and discuss options for telling your little ones.  Ultimately though, you know your kids best and what will work best for your family so go with your gut.  Good luck to you, I know it's not easy with little ones.  Hugs!",

So does everyone.  Does that really make us more likely to recur, especially when a lot of us have taken steps to change our lifestyle and bolster our immune systems?  What do you guys think? ",

For me, being small breasted, it was just a little uncomfortable having someone smoosh my boob down and clamp (bad choice of words, I know) it between two paddles, but it was by no means painful.  And I had extremely tender breasts at the time.  Chances are, they'll do an ultrasound first and may do a mammogram to get a clearer picture of the situation just to be safe.  You'll be just fine!  ",

As far as getting time off of work:  there should be a social worker at your hospital that you can talk to about what your rights are.  I know I picked up a brochure once in my cancer center library that discussed cancer patient's rights in the workplace.  I would find out exactly what you're entitled to before you agree to use vacation time and before you talk to your boss.  Then you can present her with the facts.  Maybe get something from your doctors to that explains what you'll be going through and what time you may need off. If it seems like she is keeping this professional then maybe that's the best route for you to take with her - it doesn't sound like she's someone who knows how to offer emotional support.

But everyone's situation is different even if you do have the same stats. Nobody wants to do chemo, but I will say that I didn't need to be so devastated.  It wasn't that bad.  Yes, it's inconvenient and it gets you down at times and you're tired a lot, but it goes very quickly and you're back to yourself before you know it. For now, try to take things one step at a time.  All you have to focus on at this moment is surgery.  It's hard not to think about all the what-ifs, but you'll just drive yourself crazy if you do.  Hang in there, hugs to you!",

Everyone's situation is different so there's no real exact answer to your questions.  But from my experience, I started chemo about 6 weeks after diagnosis, 9 wks after I found the lump.  I had enlarged lymph nodes and had them biopsied and they were normal.  As far as staging, I was told anything over 2 cm is automatically stage II, but that the tx plan doesn't really change whether you're I or II.  I was never staged because I had chemo first to shrink the mass, so I'll never know what the actual dimensions of my mass were.  My breast surgeon did the biopsy and once that came back she recommende chemo first, so I got several opinions with oncs, picked one and started chemo. You're in the hardest part of this right now.  The uncertainty and decision making is the hardest part.  Once you know what you're dealing with and tx starts things start to calm down.  Try to enjoy the rest of the weekend - hugs to you!",

NIGHT. LONG.  The food was horrible.  It didn't taste horrible, it tasted really good.  But it was full of things nobody trying to heal from anything should be eating - white breads and pastas, no whole grains; canned fruits and vegetables, no fresh; things filled with added sugars and high fructose corn syrup; a \"salad\" with nutritionaly deficient iceberg lettuce, not nutrient-filled dark leafy greens.  And lastly, I was in quarantine which meant I couldn't see my family, friends, or my little guys who I missed like crazy.  Not good for morale. IMO, healing is much better done at home, not in all cases, but a lot of them!",

I pretty much have hair all over my body - it's just thin and slow growing.  I'm wondering whether to even out my hair or just let it go.  The hair that never fell out is about an inch long and there's quite a bit of it.  The hair that fell out is just tiny stubble right now, so I've got patches that are way longer in some places and I'm nearly bald in other places.  I love the \"long\" fuzz and hate to buzz it right now, but I might look a little better if I wasn't so patchy!  Gosh, just never thought I'd be thinking about these things!",
