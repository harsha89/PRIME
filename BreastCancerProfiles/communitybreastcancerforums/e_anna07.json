It took me about a week to recover because they had to go so deep. Two weeks after the core biopsy I had it excised under general anesthesia. It was a fibroadenoma that was changing and becoming very aggressive. The breast surgeon cleared all the margins. I now go in for check ups every 6 months. The doctors have all told me that stress is one of the worst things and to eliminate/avoid it as much as possible. I was told that fibroadenomas are considered to be pre-cancerous as they are estrogen receptive. I went on to loose any extra weight and lower my body fat % below 20%. Now 40 pounds lighter andÂ divorced the husband that was so mean to me and rejected me especially when i needed him most, I am getting healthier and am definitely happier.",
