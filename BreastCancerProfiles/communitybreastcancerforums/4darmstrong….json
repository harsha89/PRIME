Paula Young has an online outlet that has extremely good prices.  You may get lucky and find what you're looking for there.  My 6yr and 3 yr grandsons have had a ball wearing my wigs and hats.  At Christmas we decided we could have forgone the toys and bought them hats and wigs instead.  They love rubbing my head and they want me to pull my wig off and show everyone that I'm bald.  The 3 yr old wants me to pick him up at preschool without the wig.  Apparently some of his friends don't believe I'm bald.  My hair started coming out around day 14 and was gone in one week.  I had really thick hair too.  It started growing again within 3 wks after my last tx.  The nurse said it would take 8 or 9 wks.  It was like my body knew we were through with that though.  I have been red-headed for 48 yrs and now I am a brunette.  LOL.",

Our house burned after my first treatment.  Now is when you need to pull together as a family.  It's okay to be scared.  I can promise you that your sister is scared.  I am not afraid of dying but I am terrified of being sick and disabled by surgeries and treatments.  Talk to your sister.  Let her know you are worried but will be there for her.  Pray for your sister. ",

The mast. was much worse.  I go Monday to see about starting rads.  I'm hoping the surgery was the worst part of this circus ride.  I took Prilosec on about day 4 or 5 to help with the indigestion and it seemed to help with the nasty taste.  Ask them to infuse the Taxotere slowly always.  You'll be glad you made the trade off of time vs side effects.  The first treatment I had horrible migraines starting on day 3 but I always got them premenstrually anyway.  My pcp gave me meds that took care of that problem.",
