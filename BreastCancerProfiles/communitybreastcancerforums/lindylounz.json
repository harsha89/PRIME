Now that I can think more clearly, I am beginning to fear the possibility of the return of cancer somewhere else. During surgery, the biopsy of lymph nodes came back as 0 out of 4. But the pathology result showed a cluster of cells in 1 node which they call negative. With ER and PR +ve results with high grade DCIS and stage 11a tumour I'm beginning to think I should have been recommended for chemotherapy. I feel really confused. Am thinking of going for a second opinion. Am I worrying unnecessarily? Can anyone shed some light on things for me regarding their own treatments. Many thanks Dx 9/27/2010, IDC, 1cm, Stage IIA, Grade 1, 1/4 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I am from New Zealand and all our care goes through the public hospital system, which is free of charge (very different to the US!). My confusion lies in how I grade my diagnosis. I had 60mm high grade DCIS with a grade 1 invasive mucinous carcinoma. The lymph node at time of surgery showed clear, but later pathology had 1 lymph node with tumour cells, which the oncologist calls negative, but what he calls suspicious but, in his opinion, not worthy of worry. So, of course my worry is with the tumour cells found in that 1 lymph node. Worry that the cells have started to travel. I worry that in my haste to call myself clear and avoid any further treatment I have let something important pass me by. It's hard to be this far along in everything and to imagine I am considering chemotherapy! I was so afraid of everything to begin with - the biopsy, dye injections, reconstruction etc. that I couldn't face anything further. Now that I have healed somewhat the reality of the future has started to sink in. Hope I haven't confused you all. Thanks for giving me your attention.",

On this journey I have come to learn how each woman and her cancer are so different.Â  No decision is really by the book. I have always been a person who avoided drugs, doctors etc. if I could heal myself. Finding out where I stand in this situation has been a challenge. I know I didn't want chemotherapy after my surgery, I didn't want anything. That was mainly because my will to live was so low for a few weeks that the thought of cancer being an issue was the furthest from my mind, seeing as I was well before and whilst I had the cancer! Now that I appreciate my life again I am afraid of losing it, hence my drive to get to understand my diagnosis fully. I no longer feel afraid whichever way I go. I will stay in touch and let you know the outcome of my next oncologist visit. Go well all of you xxx Linda",

Because you had the oncotype test done it gave you further information about your tumours makeup, hence the need for chemotherapy. We don't have the oncotype test here, which leaves a big gap in the ability to make an informed decision. Good luck with your recovery, will be thinking of you.",

Some of my pathology result was missing when I saw the oncologist. Now that I have that result I know a lot more about what I'm dealing with. The SN did have micromets, of which there were many clusters, measuring approx 0.1mm. On researching this, there has been controversy surrounding the treatment for quite a long time. There is one clinic in the States who have decided to treat ALL their women who have any tumour cells in the SN. I printed off 8 studies on this subject (8 out of many, many that have been done). These studies concluded that the presence of metasteses of 2mm or less in diameter in SN was associated with poorer disease-free and overall survival compared to the absence of micrometasteses. So now, armed with this information, I am going to a private oncologist for a 2nd opinion. I feel more informed and less afraid of making the decision for myself, with the help of an experienced professional, of whether to have chemotherapy or not. Now that I have recovered from the reconstruction I feel I am in a much clearer headspace to make the right decision. Time is a wonderful thing. If the oncologist thinks I categorically would not benefit from chemotherapy I will take that away to help me make my decision. By the way, we do not have the oncotype test here. It is being trialled in parts of Australia, so not sure when we will see it. I am pleased for you that you have all the information and you know you don't need chemotherapy. I hope to see the oncologist next Friday and will definately let you know how I go.",
