I was diagnosed with Stage iv er/pr positive BC with mets to liver, spine and hips 10 months ago. I did 10 days of radiation on a tumor too close to my spinal cord and am currently on hormone therapy, which are the only conventional treatments I have done.. I started on Lupron and letrozol 7 months ago. My latest scan last week showed no visible cancer except for a very small amount in the breast tumor which has been steadily decreasing. My circulating tumor cells have been going down and are very close to normal. I am doing a ton of other alternative therapies so it is hard for me to know what is doing what. My onc does not know about my alternative therapies. (I tried to tell her once but she was not interested) She said that it is of course a very good result, that most often these hormone therapies halt growth rather than decrease, but that we shouldn't get too excited because 'we know it is there even if we can't see it and it will come back\". Does anyone know if either or both of these drugs can kill the cancer and reverse the diagnosis? I got scanned somewhere other than my normal hospital for my last scan and the doctor could not believe that I had ever had the diagnosis I had. Though she could see dead tumors in bones, liver and lymph, she was very confused given diagnosis, the short time since staring treatment as well as the kind of treatment so that led me to wonder whether this is an atypical response. Hoping it is because then I can put more faith in the curative nature of some of the alternative therapies I have been doing. Thanks in advance and love and healing to all of you!

I feel very strong and healthy (was not always the case - my spine fractured from the tumors, and I was hospitalized with extreme pain) and I am so grateful to BE here feeling good, running around with my baby. I will take what I can get! I would be curious to know how often mets clear on hormone therapy. My onc said most often it just stops them from growing. More research!",
