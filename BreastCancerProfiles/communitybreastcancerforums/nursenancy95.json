I Was diagnose with DCIS grade 2, comedo necrosis--had biopsy in November, lumpectomy in December, re-excision in January for unclear margins at superior end of excision and was told today I need another re-excision next week as margins still not clear this time at posterior end of previous excision. Has anyone else seen this many re-excisions? My mind is working overtime(as I am sure everyone here has experienced). There are so many variables--I feel so overwhelmed by all of this. Thanks for listening, being a nurse and foster parent I am usually on the other end of this-it has been rough being the one asking for help. I am so grateful these boards are here for us. God Bless you all. Log in to post a reply",
