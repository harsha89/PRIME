Even though my dx wait is over I am now in wait for tests and test result before chemo. I've already done radiation, but the pre chemo tests and result waits are horrendous, (I have 3 more this week) I have kept working through all this and there are days where going to work can be a god send because it does help and then there are those where we just float. But hang in there it will get better and we are all hoping for a B9 for you. Big positive hugs, Barbara BTW I didn't tell my 15 year old daughter what was going on either until I had a solid dx-it was less stressful for her and me.",

Anyway he was adamant about taking the whole area out, so I really had a lumpectomy and my path report came back staged, with size and receptors, then I went in for the SNB. Which had a micro-metastasis that was treated with radiation, and now I am prepping for chemo. I couldn't agree more with concernedsis, make sure you feel comfortable and confident. A second opinion never hurts, especially when we are talking about a mastectomy. If all else fails call you GYN because sometimes their offices have a good lead on good breast surgeons they recommend. Oh and no I am pretty sure you can stay in this thread and move around to others with information you want and need. You can also start new threads as needed too. Good luck and keep us posted.",

I was shocked when I saw my onc and he wanted to do chemo, radiation, Tamoxifen and surgically remove my ovaries. From all the opinions I was given 41, my age, is young so they tend to be really aggressive. But no matter what the age pandazankar is right stage, surgery type, and receptors all play a role. Wish you well. Barbara",

When I had a surgical biopsy ( in late May) my surgeon decide to remove the whole thing rather than have to go back, so essentially it was a surgical biopsy/lumpectomy for the price of one. Mine was just a hair over 2cm and I have a C cup and it looks just fine.  I think a lot can depend on where the tumor is located. I went back to work two days after, and although I was tired and sore, it was fine. I also had a weird cold/cough at that time and my husband was having a panic attack that it was something cancer related and it was just that a lingering cold, that my doc said probably lingered due to stress and all the poking and probing they were doing to my body. Then in early June I had a Sentinel Node Biopsy which showed a micro-metastasis (spelling?), which is a teeny tiny amount of cancer, and there was a long conversation between  my onc, surgeon and and radiation oncologist about going in for more. The decision was to do 35 treatments of radiation, including the underarm, which I just finished, and 20 cycles of chemo, which I start in late September.  Plus, down the road, having my ovaries removed, I had a partial hysterectomy at 28, but still have the ovaries And then 5 years of Tamoxifen. All the ER+ or - and PR + or- and HER2 + or - will help your oncologist decide the best course of action for you. Also, I understand age can have a bearing on treatment too, I am 41, at least that is what I have read.  I really understand how overwhelming this all is, but if you are like me and trust your gut instincts and take deep breaths you will be fine. I hope my story helps-I am sending you positive vibes.",

I just finished my radiation on August 28th and it is already starting to feel better, so there is light at the end of the tunnel.  I start the long road of chemo next month so at least that should make my underarm hurt! Anyway, my rad/onc doc said to stretch regularly and not to beat it up, but not to baby it either and I would feel better, and he was right. Good luck!",
