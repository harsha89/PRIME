I hate to say this but for me losing my hair was the most traumatic part of my whole journey so far. I thought I had prepared myself enough but I don't think it's possible to totally prepare yourself. I was told my hair would not fall out until after my 2nd treatment but it actually started to fall out on the 16th day after my first chemo. My whole head was so tender within 3 days after my first chemo but that feeling went away. About 3 days before my hair started to fall out certain spots became tender. I had already bought my wig, my wig lady was going to shave my head. At this point I started using baby shampoo because I read it in one of the pamphlets but  once my hair started to fall out I used the baby shampoo and it clumped on each side of my head like dog doodie on the back of a dog! My wig lady mentioned that I shouldn't have used the baby shampoo because it's full of perfume and this is why babies smell so good! It could have been just my hair but I don't suggest using the baby shampoo. Good luck and take care. Joanne",
