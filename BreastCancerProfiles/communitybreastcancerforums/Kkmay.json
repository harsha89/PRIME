As of the size of the tumor, I read somewhere in the community that a MO told her patient it doesn\u2019t matter how large your tumor is or how many nodes are involved. What truely matters is your response to treatment! You could have a huge tumor and many nodes involved, yet responsd very well to treatment.",

She actually had a meltdown at the hospital at her first chemo appointment although I spent many days telling her about the wonderful stories of the survivors in this amazing community, and other friends and co-workers. I think you should do the same. Explain to her that chemo is doable, actually some people have very few side-effects with the current medications. Tell her that if you knew chemo will \u201ckill\u201d her, you woun\u2019t let her have it. Also, always be with her, go to hospital appointments with her, have \u201ccalming\u201d conversations with her. She needs your support now more than ever. It\u2019s a long journey, take it day by day. Wish you and your mom all the best!",

I have read several research papers online of the importance of vitamin d supplemtation and how it increased the probability of pCR by approximately threefold. However, I'm worried that this will interfere with the effectiveness of chemo. Has anyone tried supplementing with vitamin D3 during chemo and what was it helpful?
