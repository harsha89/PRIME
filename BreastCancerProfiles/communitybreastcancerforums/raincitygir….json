If you are wondering how things \"look\" - my scars are now almost a year old and are nearly invisible.  The radiation discoloration is nearly gone.  You can tell no difference between one breast and the other in shape or size and he did take quite a large section.  Things just move into place. It is hard to believe we have to make these decisions as though we have been to med school :)  Hang in there!",

This was not so bad for me to even need advil, just more lubrication.  Within a day or two, it began to lightly peel and the discomfort dissipated.  I was hit with some pretty good fatigue around then as well.  When I started boosts, the red and tan of the whole breast began to dissipate pretty quickly and I have no further discomfort in those areas.  The boost area is a bit redder but that is because the electron treatments during boosts are more shallow, so more like an actuall sunburn for me.  I have large breasts, DD's.  The radiation has thankfully not prevented me from wearing a bra.  Now that I am done, yay, yay, yay, I have just a hint of peeling beginning in the boost area, and it's not really peeling as much as it is flaking. Now, if the fatigue will begin to improve, I will be thrilled.  It can go pretty smoothly and I sure hope it does for you - try not to freak out in advance and take the good stories into your mind, all the while, keeping those boobs as lubed as you can manage.  The finish line is a wondrous place to be and not very far - you will be surprised...best wishes!",

My nipple became sore early on but they just taped it down for all other treatments and there was no further issue.  The reason for taping it down rather than just covering it is because it is because it protrudes that it is more affected. The minor discomfort of each was over in less than 2 days.  You may be more affected by the fatigue at the end, but even that was tolerable, especially with you having so few treatments compared to my protocol. I started lubing as soon as I did the simulation.  I used Aquafor at that point.  I alternated Aquafor (greasy, so only at night) with 99% pure aloe gel (during the day) and as needed, I used a prescription cream that was very helpful.   Don't be afraid, I hope you will be pleasantly surprised.",

As for the cream - by keeping the condition of the skin very moisturized early on, it doesn't dry out as easily, causing cracking and/or blisters.  I have used it religiously.  At night, I am using the 98% pure aloe gel from Trader Joe's next to the hospital and Aquafor.  During the day, I used the Xclair prescription as it is far less messy.  Xclair works to prevent burning as I understand it, rather than just being a reactive treatment.  I also carry small tubes or bottles of Aquafor or Eucerin to put on immediately after treatment. I hope that you, like me, find this a fairly innocuous experience compared to chemo. I got sick on Friday and convinced myself it was a side effect of radiation and so I called.  Got a call back in under three minutes, and the usual warm and understanding demeanor of this practice.  He diagnosed me with a cold (silly me) and very kindly told me why I couldn't have what I self-diagnosed after googling. In defense of my crazy self, the cold was entirely located in my airway and throat that night.  The doc then came and found me today to see how I was feeling. Did you work on the puzzle?  I don't but my husband did 8 pieces today... I didn't realize Udder Cream is the same thing as Bag Balm. Were you able to find an earlier appt for DH?",

Aquafor is super greasy and hard on your clothing.  I used aloe after treatments because it didnt ruin anything - if you have trader joe's they have some great stuff there that is 99% pure. I was told I could put aloe or aquafor on immediately after treatment and I did. Oh, I also put cornstarch under my breast to keep it dry.  I have very large breasts and had no problems underneath thankfully and never was unable to wear a bra.  I often chose not to at home though. Omaz is right, you will likely be pleasantly surprised.",

It was a really fun \"graduation\", they make a big fuss and it feels like you have done something important.  In fact, we have, we have made a decision to fight for our lives.   I am now allowed to say \"I had cancer\" and \"I am NED\". I can't believe that that in 18 days I have my annual mammogram.  It has been a long year - there was suspicion in February at my annual but I was asked to hold off for six months......should I have done so?  Who knows and it doesn't really matter....

I understand the 50% reduction as a result of anti-hormone therapy but how did that get cut in half by chemo?  NCCN only gives us a 1-2% potential benefit.  I have IDC with ILC features - you have ILC, but other than age, that is our most significant difference... I am not encouraging or discouraging chemo for you, I am just playing devil's advocate..... I hope the answer comes for you easily :) In the meantime, big hugs!",

As for radiation  -  for me, that was a piece of cake.  We are all different but in general, most people don't have a hard time.  My fatigue level didn't change dramatically.  I was religious about skincare.  Toward the end,  I did get a small amount of peeling but they provide excellent meds causing quick healing.  You will be able to do your chores and much more if you are as fortunate as I was. Typically, the decision regarding anti-estrogen therapy is made by the medical oncologist, not the radiation oncologist, so be prepared for a possible change.  Are you in Canada?  Is that why you are doing the shorter radiation protocol?",

The doc who found my cancer on the mammogram gave me the best advice - he told me to get mad, really mad - that I would need that kind of thought to get me through.

Best wishes and may you not need it :",

One other thing, tumor size definitely plays a role. One centimeter or less generally gets a no-go on chemo, all other factors being the same, but a 1.1+ opens the door for discussions,",

I have to hold three planks for one minute each which doesn't sound like much but it really is, for me at least. It is the last part of the workout so when I complete that, I know there is only final stretching to do.  It's purpose to build your core and because mine is very weak and flabby, I have to do this.  I would rather be able to quilt or bake a pie like you do than plank.   I am going for rad #7 this morning.  When I come home, DD is having six girlfriends here for movies and popcorn.  I just hope they don't hear me snoring from the upstairs tv room.  ",

You will find the answer and don't be surprised if it takes you a bit of time.... Best wishes, Diane",

I guess what you do sort of know is that you won't be having chemo - I don't think they would have scheduled radiation already if you were - so this bodes well for your situation.  You also likely have clean margins or rads would not be scheduled. I am very surprised you are not having Canadian protocol radiation, more like 4 weeks I believe.  Do you not have oncology or breast surgeon appointment coming up?  The other night, some family members were telling me how much better the Canadian medical system is but I am struggling to believe that based on your post.",

I  started with lumpectomy and chemo. but then read more and met with docs and concluded that maybe I really didn't need chemo after all so I stopped halfway through.  It was shocking to have them say \"you really are ok to stop, you are not a high risk and with lumenal A cancer and a low ki-67, your benefit was not really significant enough\". BTW, I had an intermediate Oncotype.  Since then I have started rads.  Not bad at all so far, but then I just finished #6. 50 miles is a long haul when you are worn out - so glad you have a friend to stay with.

Health food stores will have natural repellents, usually with citronella as the active ingredient, and these can be less detrimental to your skin. However, you should avoid putting insect repellent on your skin and then wearing a compression garment over it. That may cause skin reactions and can also damage the fabric of your garment. No matter which repellent you use, some insect bites probably are inevitable. Be prepared to treat them immediately to lessen the histamine effect, which can cause increased swelling in that area. Benadryl or hydrocortisone creams are two treatment options for insect bites. An ointment with aluminum sulfate as the active ingredient can also help decrease the effects of bites and stings. And a tip from my friend Connie: treat bee stings by applying a paste of meat tenderizer and water to the site of the sting. Treat an insect bite like any break in the skin on your limb at risk. Wash and dry the area completely and apply antibiotic cream to the area.",

I also have IDC and was told that chemo would improve by 2-3% as well with at least 5% risk of damage from chemo.  One in six people end up in hospital or ER due to chemo, it is not to be taken lightly.  That said, many people handle it very well.  I did half of it and through reading and discussions with the docs came to understand there was too little statistical benefit with an ER+ cancer. I hope they can clarify this for you.  All these decisions are very difficult. Yes, the oncotype may well put you in the intermediate grey area but it is only a part of the decision making process.

But they did all mention that 56 is young. Here are the four opinions - well, because I am an oncologist and see people die, you probably should; I definitely would not have my wife, mother or daughter do it, the value is too small in your case; i am 60/40 for chemo; i am 50/50 on chemo.  So, it came down to two things - the first, and this is really subjective/personal, was whether I would want to be sitting there in a year with an issue that I might have avoided and the second, most important, was the family meeting where my adult children and husband's faces told me the answer.  What was holding me back from the decision was a total lack of desire to do chemo and of course, FEAR.  The reality of my CMF has been far less than the anxiety.   If you decide otherwise, I will completely understand as I almost did as well. I am always available for your questions - also have you been to crazy sexy cancer seattle?  There is a group dinner on Nov. 16 - go take a look as I know all are welcome. Diane",

Look forward to hearing from you tomorrow - my second round of chemo is at 9 a.m. and though I don't want to go, I am happy to be moving forward and FAR less anxious this round.  I have been very lucky this first round....

I am surprised they gave you a report without an explanation. One thing I noticed, the individual scores don't add up to 6, did you perhaps make a typo?  The 6, I believe, refers to  the  Nottingham score and would give you a 6 of 9, which is essentially considered intermediate.  I have been living in the intermediate world since last summer and I think it is the hardest place to be because the decisions become yours.  I hope you get some good rest tonight and lots of answers tomorrow!",

I pursued four opinions and ended up with only one saying I should do chemo but my understanding was potential benefit was 1-3% with potential damage closer to 5%. I began chemo and then had a recheck with my renowned surgeon and then both rad teams I was considering. They were all surprised that I was doing chemo at all. The rad onc sent out for my ki67 and mine was also very low. This info was part of my oncotype but had not been included in the report to my onc. I stopped chemo at halfway point, did my rads and finished those a few weeks ago. Started arimidex this week. I am also allergic to many many things but so far, so good with the arimidex.",

I have heard of very few who don't get the approval once their oncologist insists.  After all, if the oncotype shows no chemo necessary, think how much the insurance company saves.  However, if someone has mentioned herceptin to you, I suspect you are a TN as the PR/ER+'s don't get herceptin as far as I know. When will you crack?  I hung tough through active treatment and then faced with that damn bottle of pills for the next five years, I felt less in control than I had throughout.  It took me several weeks to take them and then a few weeks into them, I had a bit of an emotional crash as was predicted could happen by my MO.  All is fine now though.  I just am forever changed by this - some for the bad, but also some for the good. You are going to the rad onc first?  Maybe you don't need chemo at all! Wouldn't that be lovely :) ?",

He operated and removed seven chunks and sent them for biopsy.  They were all RADIESSE.  This was reported by me and by the oral surgeon to the FDA and to the manufacturer.  Ultimately, the plastic surgeon reported it as well and stopped offering it. Since then, my dentist has seen many of these cases and Radiesse no longer claims that it doesn't migrate.   Prior to Radiesse, I used other products without a problem.  I really recommend you give this careful consideration - the pain of the biopsies and the size of the scars inside my mouth are not to be ignored......   By the way, Botox can be used according to my doc and thank goodness for that :)",
