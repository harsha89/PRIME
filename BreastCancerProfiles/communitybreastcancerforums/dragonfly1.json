I just wanted to encourage everyone that may be reading that sometimes Rads goes very smoothly. I had #26 of 33 today (28+5 boosts). My RO believes in using Aloe only unless there is skin breakdown. I've been using Aloe 3x/day and I have no change in skin color other than my nipple being slightly darker than the untreated one. The fatigue is definitely increasing but is manageable and I'm continuing to work full-time with no problem. I know that everyone responds differently but I hope it is encouraging to know that for some people Rads is not too bad. I consider myself blessed because chemo was awful for me and I think I was due for a break:)",

I've already had my rads consulation and found out that I'll have my rads simulation/tattoos on June 16th and then start 33 rads on June 20th including 5 boosts. I'm dreading rads during the terrible heat of the summer on Long Island but I'll manage. I was able to work during chemo in spite of awful side effects so I know I can get through this too. My RO is telling me that I should go bra-less on my weekends and that it's ok to wear 100% cotton wireless bra on my work days. I had a hard time finding them but eventually found some reasonably priced ones from Jockey online but they only have sizes for A/B cups (so if you fit that description you are in luck-$20 each and the third one is free...) Just for fun: I noticed that the previous rad threads came up with the idea to buy the same number of lottery scratch off tickets for the number of treatments they have so that they can count off the days and have a little fun/win some money (hopefully) at the same time. I'm planning to do that as well and thought I'd share the idea for all of us who are beginning or rads journey...",

My eyelashes are almost completely gone now. I've been using eyeliner to create some definition around my eyes. Otherwise, I just look ghostly. I had one very insensitive colleague who decided that she needed to comment on my loss of eyebrows and eyelashes. She said, \"well it does make you look rather pale-you know, alien-like\". I think she could have kept that to herself. Well, I have a great sense of humor and so does DH, so he took this pic of me with the fish-eye lense on our camera-Ha!

I had my port removed on April 9th so of course I have a red incision/scar and it always seems to be right along the collar of my shirt where you can see it. I've been very self-conscious about it and annoyed that I have to avoid wearing certain things. So I stopped by Ulta today and found the solution to the problem. They gave me a product called Dermablend (also used to cover tattoos). I bought the \"cover cream\" in my skin tone along with a clear \"setting powder\". It says it will last for up to 12 hours and is waterproof. It's a bit pricy but there's enough that I won't have to buy it again for a year (it was approx $30 for each). Thought this may help someone else who wants to cover a scar...Here's a photo after applying it:  Rt Lumpectomy/SNB 1/7/2011 TCHx6 (2/15-5/31/11), Herceptin x 1 year (done 1/18/12), Rads 28+5 (finished 8/8/11) BRCA 1/2 Neg, Now on Tamoxifen, My \"jump for joy\" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jUmLkbhHZE Diagnosis: 11/29/2010, IDC, 1cm, Stage I, Grade 3, 0/4 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2+",

Maybe it's because your hair is so light and it's less obvious-let's go with that. My hair is so dark that it looks a lot like Lago's early pics. I'll try to post a pic soon. I have even coverage all over although the top/front started about 2 weeks after the back/sides so it's a little shorter. You can still see my scalp all over but I think with 6 more weeks it should fill in. I'm not using anything-just eating my fruits, veggies and protein during Rads. I'm too scatter-brained to keep up with any more meds at this point and I honestly think it's going to do whatever it wants anyway. What's happening with your eyelashes/eyebrows? Mine keep thinning but are mostly intact-not too noticeable.",

This is my hair at almost 7 weeks PFC. I buzzed my hair 2 weeks after the last chemo to get rid of the weird, clear, sparse hair-so this is all new growth in the past 5 weeks. The front didn't start growing until 2 weeks after the sides and back (you can actually see a clear difference). My DH is away a lot and every time he returns home he is shocked at the difference even though I never think anything is happening:)",

I actually went for a cut/trim today (after I posted the pics) to even things out-my husband's barber did it since I don't have much hair:) The back and sides were a lot longer because it had never been cut at all and it was getting a bit scruffy. I hated to lose some length but I think it looks more styled now and will grow more evenly. It was a quite funny experience-the barber was very sweet and kept fussing over every little detail which he had not been doing for the men before me.

I'm about 6 months PFC and my hair isn't very long but is getting waves in it so I suppose it's going to curl. Like many have described, the front is taking its time growing so I have no bangs at all (although its deceiving because it seems to be curled up in a fuzzy mess). I have to wash my hair at night and sleep on it to flatten it and calm the frizz-nothing else works. If I wash it and go out (without sleeping on it) I look like a static ball. My best friend described my hair as being a little bit like a brillo pad (she's the only one who can be that honest with me and get away with it). So, I try to not look in the mirror much and keep hoping it will magically work itself out with more length! ",

I think people like my wig better than my real hair (probably because I never took much time to do anything with my real hair and the wig is perfectly styled every day:) Won't they be shocked when they see my super short dark hair in a few more weeks...I'll post more pics when I have more hair growth to share. It's growing relatively fast-even in the past week.   P.S. I'm not usually that shiny-Ha!Ha! that was a pic on the way to a whitewater trip in boiling heat in Costa Rica 2 months before I was diagnosed-Hmmm. wish I had that energy right now! ",

I've had such interesting experiences during this process. Once I was wearing a hat while waiting for a PET scan in a crowded waiting room. A woman was blatantly staring at me for the longest time. When the waiting room cleared out she walked over to me and quietly said, \"I'm a survivor and I just wanted you to know that you'll be fine\". I decided at that point that I should re-think the looks I get and just give people the benefit of the doubt. On the other hand, on a recent trial run going topless on a weekend, I had a woman staring at me and then she walked over and said \"good for you, when my hair was growing back I couldn't even leave the house\".

I was visiting my best friend over the weekend and as best friends do, she told me the truth:) She saw all that light baby fuzz on my cheeks and said \"that has to go!\" I had not known what to do with it because I was afraid to shave my face. Well, she showed me this thing called a \"Clio\" which is a small personal trimming device (size of a pen, uses a AAA battery) that you can buy at Target, Walgreens, Ulta, etc. It's amazing. It's like a tiny version of clippers and just buzzes the fuzz right off without actually shaving right to the skin-perfect! Just had to share...",

I'm triple positive (ER+/PR+/Her2+) and will be meeting with the oncologist for the first time this Friday and I fully expect to get chemo and Herceptin because of the Her2. I work in a hospital (although it's adults only) but I'm a federal employee and we don't have access to short term disability as a result. I only have 4 weeks of sick leave so I would be forced to take leave without pay if I can't work. My hope is that I can work most of the time and just take days off as needed during each cycle because there is no way I can just take the next 4-5 months off completely. I know in a perfect world the oncologists would like us to take the time off but it's just not realistic sometimes. I'll post again to let you know how it works out because I'm guessing I'll start treatment fairly soon. Best wishes with your lumpectomy and a speedy recovery!

It really does get easier once you have a specific plan and regain a sense of control.  Breast cancer is a shock and really turns your life upside down for a while. Have you gotten any more info from pathology or scans? Your initial post was a bit confusing. You seemed to indicate that there may be lymph node involvement-are they guessing from the pathology or an MRI? Usually lymph nodes are confirmed at the time of surgery with a sentinel node biopsy. You also mentioned grade 1 but also Her2+. That doesn't seem quite right because Her2+ tumors are usually high grade/aggressive (as in grade 2 or 3) and Her2+ almost always requires chemo even if it's small. I'm not sure a Her2+ tumor would be grade 1. If the oncologist said \"slow growing and... might not need chemo\" it sounds like it's not Her2+. The final staging will come from the surgical pathology-right now any staging is tentative. Keep us posted-we're here if you need to vent or ask questions. Sending a big HUG!!!",

When my Gyn called me with the initial diagnosis he gave me the name of a general surgeon and told me to set up an appointment. Luckily I began asking everyone I know about this and was told NOT to go to a general surgeon but to instead find a breast surgeon who does these surgeries all the time. I was eventually able to find a breast surgeon and she is incredibly knowledgeable. She has a reputation for getting clean margins and for doing lots of SNBs. I agree with the other members that you should find a breast surgeon if you can. It's so hard to manage all of this when you are already overwhelmed with a new diagnosis but it really does start to get easier. In the first few weeks I felt like I was walking through a minefield. Being newly diagnosed during the holidays really sucks too! I found myself struggling with New Year's because all I could think was that 2011 is going to be a very hard year of surgery and treatment. I've also been told numerous times not to hesitate to get a second opinion. I think that's good advice considering what how much depends on what these doctors tell us. I'm going to be seeking out an oncologist now and I expect that I'll be seeking more than one opinion for sure since I'm ER+/PR+/HER+ and want to be sure I get the best possible treatment (and will likely be in treatment for a long time so I better like the oncologist I choose...) Anyway, every week it's getting a little bit easier so hang in there. We'll all get through it together.",

After well over a year of dealing with BC and treatment I've learned that this diagnosis creates significant fear and anxiety for you AND your family. I completely underestimated how much it was affecting my husband in the beginning because I was so angry and felt like \"I\" was the one going through it. Don't forget that he will be going through it too and he will be scared whether he says it or not-and often men don't express themselves well. I was pointed to a book called \"Breast Cancer Husband: How to Support Your Wife (and Yourself) During Diagnosis, Treatment and Beyond\" on Amazon. It's written by a husband who went through this. I bought it for my husband early on and I although he wouldn't say much, I would catch him reading sections now and then. Having said that, you will continue to get comments that are upsetting because unfortunately we've all been told for so long that if it's caught early we're ok to the point that people seem to think we're dealing with the common cold. As a result, our friends and family may be well-meaning but they say some stupid things that feel very minimizing and dismissive. I feel like I've spent the past year re-educating everyone that there is no cure and Stage I is wonderful but does not = safe. It simply gives me better odds at the outset. We still have cancer and it's dangerous at all stages. Meanwhile, keep communicating and get those feelings out. I had to come here to vent to the women who truly understood what I was going through-to ask my questions and express my fears during the tough times.  It really does get better. As soon as you have a treatment plan you will feel a sense of control and that helps. But I will never forget what my Breast Surgeon said: she told me that after a BC diagnosis, surgery and treatment (regardless of what combination you need) \"it's a year of your life\" meaning that you need that long to get through the process physically and emotionally. She was right.  Big HUG!",

My friends who have just listened have been the most helpful and it really irks me too when people say \"stay strong\" (I guess because it goes without saying and do I really have a choice?) I think sometimes we really just need to vent about how rough we feel and other days we will focus on being positive but either way it's really tough going through all this treatment while life just continues on around us. 1. Several of my friends have been sending me cards at various times throughout treatment which is really encouraging. I've had friends mail me boxes of homemade cookies, funny videos, a pillowpal (for my naps), PJs (button-up top for after surgery). My best friend made CDs like the \"kick chemo's ass mix\"...little things really make you smile when you are going through this:) As far as food, I snacked on animal crackers. \"Sunsweet Ones\" individually wrapped prunes and dried apricots were really helpful (chemo causes constipation sometimes). My sister the nurse sent me thermacare heatwraps to pamper myself when I was aching (bone pain from shots given during chemo) and some gentle Aveeno bubble bath. Something else that I have since discovered that would be a great gift is a \"Chillow\" because chemo can put you into menopause and cause hot flashes and a chillow is a cooled mat for your pillow. 2. Two books that have been so helpful: \"What To Eat During Cancer Treatment: 100 Great Tasting , Family-Friendly Recipes to Help You Cope\". The book is actually broken into chapters based upon side effects such as nausea, weight loss, taste alteration, etc. and helped me a lot during chemo. I highly recommend the Shepherds pie:)  If your friend is married, the other book that was wonderful is \"Breast Cancer Husband: How to Help Your Wife (and Yourself) During Diagnosis, Treatment and Beyond\" by Marc Silver . It was written by a man whose wife had breast cancer and is an easy read. My husband (who never reads) actually read it and found it very helpful in understanding what I am going through...Both books are on Amazon 3. A dear friend of mine recommended that I set up a \"Caringbridge\" webpage. It's free and you can make it private so that only your friends/family can view it. Caringbridge is for those with longterm health conditions. It has turned out to be an amazing support. Essentially, you write entries and it will alert the list of designated friends at which point they can write comments of support in your guestbook. I really like it because it's a private place to express anything and everything that I'm going through and I can even post pictures. You can keep your Caringbridge page going as long as you want. For me, it's a better alternative than a public blog or sharing things on facebook where I have a mixed group of friends and some don't know... Many of my friends have wanted to do something for me at times when I didn't actually need anything except their friendship. It's hard to watch someone suffering and not be able to do anything. At those times, I told them that just spending time with me was really all I needed. Taking a short walk with me, sitting on my deck with me, watching tv, etc. You are already a wonderful friend just for asking:) ",

It's a terrible shock in the beginning and there is no easy way to get your head around something like this. Trust those of us who are a little ways into the journey, it really does get better. Part of the problem is that you feel very overwhelmed and out of control in the beginning but once you have surgery and begin treatment you start to feel like you are regaining some control and thing settle down. Being ER+/PR+ is not a bad thing, (I'm 90%+ on both as well). It means that you have something to target if that makes sense. So, generally after surgery/chemo, etc. you take meds to block the hormones. As far as making a decision, take a deep breath and whatever you do, don't feel rushed. If there is anything I've learned in all of this it's that you have more time than you think. At the beginning I thought, \"Oh no, I've got cancer, I have to do something quickly.\" Looking back, I realize now that I could have taken more time. I was so afraid that every minute, day, week was allowing the cancer to grow but even aggressive BC doesn't grow that fast. So, if you need more than one opinion, get it. If you require something like an oncotype test (in some cases it helps to determine if you are a good candidate for chemo) then wait for the results. Get all the information you need to make the best decision for you personally. Making the decision for lumpectomy vs. mastectomy is not always easy but I relied on the expertise of my BS who assured me that there is very little difference in recurrence rates between the two options. Sometimes a lumpectomy is not possible if the tumor is too large to get a good cosmetic result or there are multiple areas involved. Again, take the time you need to really weigh the options and decide what is best for you.    Cry when you need to-I'm not one to cry a lot but I was a basket case in those first few weeks and found myself waking up in the middle of the night, crying, wandering through the house aimlessly-totally out of character. This turns your world upside down. Trust me, it will get a lot better. Best wishes to you as you move forward-extending a big cyber hug to you:)",

I'm so sorry that you are dealing with this. Let me see if I can clarify a little bit. I'm no expert but...it would help to know more about your estrogen, progesterone and Her2 status-are you + or - ? From the little bit of info you've provided, it's a good news/bad news situation (it's never all good news with BC is it?). Negative nodes is very good news because it means that the cancer did not spread to your lymph nodes. Grade 3 is not so good because it's \"high\" grade meaning the cells are highly disorganized and aggressive. However, grade 3/dividing cells will respond better to chemo. Finally, vascular invasion means that there is evidence of blood vessel involvement. The problem with BC is that it's sneaky and travels in more than one way (through the lymph nodes or the blood vessels). I have a feeling that chemo is being suggested for you based on the Grade 3 and vascular invasion because they will want to ensure that if any cells escaped, they kill them before they can establish themselves anywhere else. I remember looking at my oncologist in horror and saying \"why in the world do I need chemo if I have clear margins and it's not in my lymph nodes?\". She gently explained that for those of us with aggressive, high grade BC (even when it's early stage), they just don't have a way to determine if those cells got away and we can't take that chance. The other thing that can be really helpful is the Oncotype test-it's a genetic test that will give you a score that indicates your risk and can help you make a better decision about your need for chemo. If it comes back intermediate or high, you'll know for sure that chemo is necessary which is even more peace of mind. These decisions are never easy. I'm a year into treatment and please know that it really does get easier. You reach a point where it's less of a daily battle and you start to feel normal again. Do not feel rushed to make treatment decisions-you have time even though it may feel very urgent. Make sure that you feel comfortable with what you are doing. Edited to add: you asked about the timeframe for chemo-my understanding from what my MO told me is that it is recommended that you start chemo within 6-8 weeks of your surgery date for maximum effectiveness. Wishing you all the best!",
