I have had six rounds of taxotere, and have had fantastic results as far as shrinking and eradicating tumors are concerned. My onco told me that I was chronic, that I would have to have chemo forever. I went to this thread because bless your hearts, you are dealing with Taxotere and hives and horrible rashes. This all started for me too last night. I was taking an epsom salt bath, and broke out in hives in an armband shape around my right upper arm, no lymph system there to help wash out any poisons, so I think it came out there on my skin. So once you developed rashes and hives did your Onco continue giving you Taxotere or did they switch it up? Maybe my hives made up my mind for me, no more taxotere for this woman, in spite of the amazing results. Love to all...",

Not being able to breathe really is scary, and I am worried that the xeloda isn't working...although I have only done one 14 day round. Thank you for helping me to know the options...I wish my oncologist were as forthcoming.",
