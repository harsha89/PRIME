Glad you shared the wk-end with your family.That should of given you a little period to focus elsewhere. I went to a family 40th birthday home party.  My mind was not there but I had something else to focus on for short while. But hopefully you will be posting smileys on here on Tuesday. We can surprise ourselves sometimes with how much inner strength we really do have. Try and keep active today....I'm planning my tomorrow later so I don't drive myself do-lolly....You are in my thoughts......best wishes   From  Mai.",
