My BS cut the entire thing out, and sent it to pathology to make sure it was benign. I will say that the lump I recently found is only a few inches away from where my complex cyst was, only it's deep into the tissue, and it feels very different than the cyst did. I can't tell you what the lump is at this point because my follow up appt with the BS isn't until the 30th. However, it is possible to have a mass and a cyst in the same area. I do agree with BarredOwl, definitely check for signs of infection at the biopsy site (fever, hot to the touch, etc) and call the office with that info and your pain issue. Good luck!",

Both were clear, but my BS was still concerned because of the presentation that she ordered the MRI. I've got a pretty large dent under my left breast (7 o'clock), another small indent above that, and my nipple is not only pointing straight down now, but its indented on the areola under the nipple. I'm going crazy waiting for the results. She keeps telling me there's *something* in there, and we just have to wait for it to get big enough to deal with it. She suspects ILC, I wonder if that's something they'll be able to tell from the MRI.",

I've been begging for a year to do something with the back area. Its amazing now!! Anyways, I keep getting pulled into worry throughout the day thinking about my MRI results. I had it done on Friday, and they said my BS would have results by Monday. I've never had an MRI before. How are the results? Do they just tell you there's a spot here or here, or can they say that it looks like something specific? This has been 2 months of testing because I keep getting called back. We ended up having to wait a month to get the MRI done because of my cycle *eyeroll* Anyways, I was just curious what to expect when they call with the results, and if anyone would know, it would be you ladies <3 I hope everyone is having an amazing Easter!!

My BS wants me to come back in 3 months for more imaging but didn't want to do any biopsies at this point. I'm inclined to just let things lay at this point because we've spent so much money on all this that I just really don't want to go broke getting the same answer. My MIL is wanting me to go get a second opinion, but I can't imagine going through all these tests again and paying even more, because I\"m sure my insurance won't cover all these tests again for a second opinion. *shrug* I don't know whether to be happy or frustrated, so I'm going with neither right now. We're doing demo on our master closet which has me plenty busy, and my dad just moved in with us so there's that hahaha. I hope everyone is doing well, and thanks for keeping me company while I obsessed over results!",

They weren't sure about it and said I would have to come in and talk to the doc about it, which makes sense. Jelson - I brought up the MRI while on the phone with them. I basically told them what you said about advocating with the insurance company. They said they will call and see if there's anything they can do about it. *fingers crossed*! You are completely right about the insurance. I honestly didn't think about it that way with the deductible. We are only $1k away from meeting the deductible, and after that we'll pay 30% until we reach the OOP. That's not really that bad considering. I don't even want to think of the pain of starting back over at $0! The ladies at the office are super nice. They went through and calculated what it would be since we're still having to pay 100% at this point and you were right, it's a lot less than last time. Sooo off I go again, hopefully this time she can see whatever it is. She also said they would be doing the BRCA test and another u/s when I go in. Not sure how long the BRCA will take to come back in though. Wish me luck!",

      "Content": "Chanty wrote: Hey ladies! It's been awhile since I've posted, things have been so super busy around here during the past few months! In April/May-ish, I found an indent in my left breast at the 6 o'clock position and my left nipple deviated from the normal position (it now points down and towards the indent). My breast specialist sent me for an ultrasound, mammo, and MRI. All came back clear. My BIRAD score for my MRI was a 2 at that time. The breast specialist stated that she believes there's \"something in there\", but that we have to wait to see it. She wanted me to come in every 3 months for imaging until it was big enough for her to see. That's fine and dandy, except our insurance is awful. From that one visit and the testing she had done, we ended up paying almost 3k out of pocket (not counting the MRI bill!). The bills are so overwhelming that I canceled my appointment in July. As I was cleaning the garage yesterday, I found all of our old infertility paperwork. I was looking through it and saw that I have a MTHFR mutation. When I looked it up, it showed an increase risk of breast cancer with that mutation. Does anyone have any experience with their own diagnosis and this mutation? I had managed to ignore all of this breast stuff because I've been so busy with work, school, the kids, my husband, and taking care of my dad, and now I'm back in that panic mode with this gene mutation thing and the indent having gotten larger. I keep picking up the phone to set up an appointment, but all I can think about is all of the bills that will come pouring out again (I still haven't paid for the MRI bill that the insurance is refusing to pay for). I am terrified to go in there and spend a ton more money only to be told she still can't see it and to come back in another 3 months. How long would you wait? *If* she's right and there is actually something there, my understanding is breast cancer is slow growing. It's only been 5 months since I saw her. I'm rambling at this point haha. Thoughts? Log in to post a reply",
