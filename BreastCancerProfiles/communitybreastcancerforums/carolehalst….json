The pathology after BMX described my tumor as 1.2 centimeters.  Without a low oncotype number my BC dr. would have recommended chemo.  I do not have an oncologist.  I go to the same BC dr. every 6 mos. for an ultrasound of my chest wall and underarms.  Also blood work for tumor markers.   After 3 yrs. if nothing shows up, I will go once a year.

Our bodies can make estrogen from fat.  And as Susie stated, the adrenal gland (glands?) can produce estrogen.  I'm going along with my BC dr. who believes I'm better off taking Arimidex.  So far the SEs aren't that bad.  I believe mine are mainly from stopping HRT and from aging. It's important to stay active and not dwell on bc.  Accept the new normal and live a full life.",

I believe people are sincere when they say, You look so good!  They've all had friends or relatives who wasted away with cancer.  I get that reaction a lot and am not offended because I think I look pretty good, too, for my age!  Hope everyone is having a good Saturday.",
