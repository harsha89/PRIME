They've both eased my mind and let it wonder off becoming a bit more worried now, at the same time. I'm just too petrified to visit a doctor, and I know that it's what I should be doing! I remember when I was 16-17 I was going through the same thing and noticing the same changes. That idea puts me at ease to an extent, but the fact that I'm not 100% sure as to what to be looking out for exactly, where, and how, makes me more nervous. I drink coffee once a day, but it's certainly not a strong coffee. I avoid sweets as much as I can, but still get natural human cravings from time to time. Other than that, I'm doing everything else right, I would think. Thank you again for your answers. All the best to the both of you! And I'll try and work up the courage to visit my doctor!",

It's a bit hard for me to describe what I feel exactly when I squeeze them both, especially my left breast. I'm not sure if I should define it as a certain \"hardness\", or whether it's just normal breast tissue. I usually notice the changes right before my period, which I've read is normal for most women. What concerns me is knowing how to define a lump exactly and what to look out for. I notice no abnormalities under either armpits, and have slightly larger pores on both breasts around the areola. Then again, I also have larger pores on my nose and just under my eyes around the cheeks, so I don't know if that's normal or not (re: the breasts). I'm not sure what \"normal\" would be for me, and when to start worrying. I know it sounds silly, but I'm too afraid to see a doctor about this. There's no family history of it, and there's no pain associated with touching my breasts and squeezing them a bit. I'd be greatly appreciative of anyone who cares to shed some light regarding this, and, maybe risking to sound like a child, put my mind at ease. Thank you and all the best to everyone here!
