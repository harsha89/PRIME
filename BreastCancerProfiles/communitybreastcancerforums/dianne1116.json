Doc gave me antibiotics, then a steroid cream, then more antibiotics then more steroid cream. Sent me for mammogram and ultrasound, these were negative. continue to have red area isolated to L breast. still itches and still have a lot of pain. I use ice to sleep with just to numb the pain. no lumps, just a red/pink area that does not go away. doc says \"cancer just doesn't come to mind with these symptoms\" but he has no idea what it could be. the symptoms have not changed in 2 months. any ideas?

I have seen the pictures and the symptoms and they fit. Has anyone else gone through IBC that could help me understand. The doctor even mentioned a pinpoint spot that looked like a pencil lead and I remember reading somewhere as a symptom. Should I go back to my primary or all breast health clinic an see if I can get a consult. Tired of waiting his out, I want to know from someone experienced in this",
