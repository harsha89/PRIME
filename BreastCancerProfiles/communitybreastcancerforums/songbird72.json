They were supposed to start working on scheduling Friday and when I called at 2:30 today you could tell they had not done anything. Tomorrow they are getting a call every hour until I have a date and time for surgery. You would think they would understand how frustrating this is and the way I feel like ticking timebomb. Sorry to vent but I am very frustrated tonight!!!
