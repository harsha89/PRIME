I went with BMX initially, and seven months later did the exchange. I was a bundle of nerves, and worried so much more. I think that with the initial surgery, all I could think of was how to get this cancer out of me. The second time around, it was truly an elective surgery. Of course, despite all my worrying, all went well, and I'm certain it will for you too. Have a drink, revel in your good health, and acknowledge your worries. It won't make them go away, but it will make them better. Lizzie",

In January I will \"celebrate\" my one year diagnosis. I had BMX on Feb 24, immediate reconstruction with TEs. Had my exchange in September. I've been doing very well. Have my next PS appointment soon after Jan 1, and we'll be discussing nipples. I may be looking at some more reconstruction because one breast isn't quite perfect. Overall, though, I'm very pleased with my outcome, and would stop here if I needed to. However, now that I've come this far, I might as well finish! Work: I'm a manager at a Home Health agency, so fortunately I have been able to work without losing much time, as they can accommodate any restrictions I've had. They've been awesome. Hope all of you are well. Happy Holidays to each and every one! Lizzie",
