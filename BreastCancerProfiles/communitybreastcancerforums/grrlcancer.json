    "Content": "grrlcancer wrote: I had a mastectomy with an implant immediately put in 7 weeks ago.  The incision keeps opening up because of necrosis.  The PS has cut away the dead tissue 5 times.  Each time it has opened up. He said that if we take the implant out, I will still have the problem.  I want the implant out but I'm reluctant in forcing the PS to do an operation that he doesn't want to do. Is there anyone else that has had this issue? Dx 1/3/2008, IDC, 2cm, Stage IIB, Grade 3, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
