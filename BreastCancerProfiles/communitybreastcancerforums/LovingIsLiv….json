I thought it was permanent but it went away on its own (no massaging, just light stretching). I saw a LE therapist for a few weeks but I didn't feel like I got that much out of it, and it was expensive. After my 6 weeks were up she said that I would need another referral if I wanted to keep going, and it may not be covered. So I stopped going and did exercises at home. Now I notice that I get pain and tightness when the weather is cold or when I do some repetitive movements. The minute I get my arm warmed up, the pain goes away and I can move again. I keep my arm covered all the time. I also feel like I have some nerve damage, because the pain can go down to my hand and it tingles. And that also prevents me from extending my arm all the way. It's a weird feeling and no specialist doctor knew how to deal with it. But my primary doctor told me to take a B complex, and that has helped with the nerve pain. He didn't want to prescribe any nerve pain medicines because the side effects were worse than the benefit. So for anyone having nerve pain, I'd recommend at least trying a good quality B complex.",

However, he told me about the RxPonder trial that targets women who have 1-3 positive lymph nodes and scores of <25. Even though the trial is closed, he said it is perfectly \"reasonable and ethical\" to forego chemo. To me, it means someone with an oncotype of 25 and 3 lymph nodes could go without chemo according to the trial, and I just have one positive lymph node with an oncotype of 15! He said that regardless of my score, someone with my type of cancer gets about a 5% benefit from chemo over 10 years. So that is the point of the trial, to show that the \"5 percent\" recurrences are in women who have high recurrence scores. His plan for me with or without chemo would be to do Arimidex for 10 years with Zometa infusions every 6 months (because of my weak bones). He said that Arimidex is shown to have a 1% benefit over Tamoxifen, and that Zometa has a further 3% benefit in overall survival. I am all for those *proven* odds. I just don't want to inject a poison into my body if the question on whether it will hurt or help me is still up in the air. I am SO glad I got a second opinion. The doctor, his nurse, and the whole staff were so kind and caring, and went out of their way to make me feel comfortable. I hope my story can help others make their decision, because having to make the choice is not easy at first. My advice is to get as much information as you can before making any decision. Get the oncotype/mammaprint/etc. READ your pathology report. Get a second opinion, because you ARE worth it, and these decisions will impact the rest of your life. Best wishes to you all.

Yesterday, my total drainage was less than 10cc, and it's been decreasing by half pretty much daily. It wasn't painful in the beginning, probably because I was sore all over. But now I can feel the drain inside and it's starting to hurt. When I spoke to my surgeon on the phone, he said he will take them out on Friday. I'll be sure to take a pill before I go in to that appointment! Otherwise, my recovery has been better than what I expected. I'm still tired and not able to do everything that I used to, but I'm hoping by next week I will be closer to normal just in time for Thanksgiving (maybe some shopping?). I had an appointment with my MO yesterday, and she seems to think I should do 4 rounds of chemo just as an \"insurance policy\". Personally, I want to wait for my oncotype results to come back and then make a decision then. I had to ask her to run the oncotype because she felt it wouldn't change her opinion either way. Anyway, I'll be seeing her again in 3 weeks and by then we should have a final decision. In the meantime, I'm going to seek a second opinion at the major breast cancer center here in San Diego.

My oncologist said that she recommends chemo, but it was ultimately my decision and that I should see it as an extra layer of security. I know from my pathology report that they looked at everything, it's all detailed out. I'm wondering why your surgeon didn't remove the rest of the lymph nodes at the same time, maybe they weren't tested during the surgery. When I was diagnosed, I was told my tumor was 1cm on ultrasound. Then they did an MRI 2 weeks later, and they told me it was 2.9cm, and in final pathology, it came back at 3.0cm by 2cm. In the MRI, they had found a \"stable cyst.\" There is no mention of a cyst in pathology, which makes me think that what appeared as a cyst was actually DCIS...Does imaging even mean anything?

My biggest pain comes from not being able to lift my arm up. The surgeon seems to think it's normal, but it's been a month now. Sometimes I wish the surgeon didn't remove all of my lymph nodes and just stuck with the first 6 sentinel nodes.

Originally I was leaning towards a lumpectomy+radiation, but the side effects and hassle of it all turned me off from the idea. I also think I will drive myself crazy if any cysts, lumps, etc pop up, since I have a long history of cysts. I am BRCAplus and PALB2 negative, but my genetic counselor had me do full panel testing and I don't know when those results will come out. But what I know is that I need to take care of what is already there as soon as possible. Best wishes to all.",

Meanwhile, my full genetic panel came back and I have a \"variance of unknown significance\" in the BARD1 gene. There is only one study on this gene so there's not much they can do with the information at this point. Hopefully in the future it will become more clear, and benign! As always, my best wishes to everyone here. God bless.",

I'm very nervous about it. I wasn't offered the MammaPrint since I wanted to know a specific score, and I was told that Oncotype has more data to support it and it is more widely accepted. I know this is good news for you, but I think you might want to seek a second opinion. Many oncologists automatically recommend chemo when cancer is found in the lymph nodes, since they can serve as an \"incubator\" for cells to escape into the bloodstream. While I haven't talked about this very publicly on the boards, I have had experience with breast cancer in my brother (yes, brother). When we found out about him, which was March of this year, he was already Stage IV with bone mets. He is also ER positive, and of course chemo will probably be ongoing. Tamoxifen didn't work for him, and the time that he took a break from chemo and used Tamoxifen, the cancer regrew. It's a difficult situation that no one deserves to be in, but having said that, I want to do the most effective treatment possible to prevent me from getting to that point. I need some definitive answer that chemo will or will not help me. Cancer is scary, but hearing many positive stories gives me a lot of hope. I am so thankful to have access to so much support that I wouldn't have otherwise. Best wishes to all of you here.",

      "Content": "Apr 20, 2016 09:21AM - edited Apr 20, 2016 10:38AM by LovingIsLiving Hi ElleD. I'm sorry you have to make such a tough decision. I had to do the same a few months ago when I decided against chemotherapy. I didn't have the Mammaprint test. Insurance was unlikely to pay for it and I am surprised they paid for the Oncotype given I had a positive node (small, but still there). I had a score of 15, low risk. I know that sometimes the Mammaprint contradicts the Oncotype. In that case I wouldn't know which to believe. I wouldn't have felt comfortable doing only the Mammaprint, getting a \"low/high risk\" result and not knowing how low/high the risk actually was. I was also recommended TCx4, it was on the table but I was not urged to do it by either oncologist that I saw. The RxPonder study is still ongoing and we won't know for at least 4-5 years. The second oncologist I saw (Breast cancer specialist) mentioned that Oncotype studies have all supported its use. That gave me some confidence. Also, my mitotic index was 1 out of 3, which means the cells were dividing slowly. I didn't have LVI or extracapsular extension, also good. Even though I had a low PR+, neither oncologist thought it was significant, and said that if there was no cancer in the node it would be clearly no chemo. So now I am on Tamoxifen. I would have started on Arimidex or similar if I didn't have osteoporosis. But the plan is to switch a couple years down the road. When I first started I had horrible headaches, those went away after 3 weeks. Then came the hot flashes. I get some joint pain now and then but I had that before Tamoxifen. I am happy with my decision and I don't feel like chemo would have been the right thing for me. Having said that, each person and tumor is different. Your pathology results might be different (like mitotic index or LVI). I would see if it is not too late to get the Oncotype ordered. It only takes about 2 weeks and it could give you more clarity. Remember to take everything into consideration before you make a decision, including your quality of life and be aware of the risks that chemo poses. Wishing you the best of luck and let us know what you ultimately decide. Hugs.",

We just don't know, and we probably never will. As you and others said, your mom's cancer was caught early. And she is on treatment, so that's also good. It's normal for her to be scared sometimes.

I'm very thankful for oncotype because I think the old staging methods are not catch-alls. Someone who is stage 1 with no nodes might have skipped chemo when they actually needed it. It's a valuable tool and I think when the Rxponder trial comes out more oncologists will agree that a positive node doesn't mean automatic chemo.",

That will classify you as low or high risk. If you're low risk, then I would say chemo is still on the table, but less necessary. If you're high risk, then going through chemo would be more beneficial. BarredOwl, who I hope will see this thread, always has *excellent* advice and information for people trying to make sense of it all. Having said that, grade 3 means that the cells were dividing more quickly. Being HR positive is great, it means that hormonal therapy can keep recurrence rates low. Personally, my oncotype was 15, one positive lymph node. But cells were dividing slowly. For me, no chemo was the best choice. Hopefully the Mammaprint will shed some more light on your situation. Wishing you the best, and hoping that lymph node dissection comes back clear! Edited by Mods to reflect OP's username change.",

That day the technician couldn't get a good picture of that area of the breast so she took 8 (!) pictures of one breast. I was stupid enough to let her but when I got home I was furious and called corporate. They apologized and called me back personally to tell me they would be having a talk with that technician. Anyway, 5 years later, here I am. I'll never know if that caused damage to my breast tissue which turned into a tumor. A genetic test I did after my diagnosis showed I have a variance in the BARD1 gene and that couldn't help either. And the most recent mammograms I had didn't even show a tumor.

But I was told that up to 18 is low risk, and 18-30 is intermediate, and 31+ is high risk (for post menopause). And if you look at the RxPonder study, they grouped women with scores of 25 or lower to randomize chemo/no chemo. I missed the deadline of registering for RxPonder, so my oncologist and second opinion (UCSD) said that it would be up to me and the benefit of chemo is smaller than the benefit of hormonal therapy. My tumor was 30% DCIS, and I had a low mitotic index, which means the cells were dividing slowly. I had no LVI and the lymph node was contained. Everything put together made me lean towards no chemo. I am very happy with my decision and I believe that quality of life is more important than the percentages they give us. I've seen and read about women who do everything and still recur, and women who do nothing and live long healthy lives. I pray that you'll get all the information you need. Hugs!",
