Tumor was taken on biopsy.  DH asked if I needed to go through any other treatments and he said no.  Canceled the follow-up appointment with the ONC although my surgeon felt I should have seen her but I told him I did tell them I changed my surgery and there was nothing there for them to work with.  Both my surgeon and my GYN have told me I made a very good decision.  I could not see myself ever being put through what I went through last year.  Yes, I miss my breasts.  Yes, even though I wanted the BMX I still can be emotional about it but as my surgeon said, \"You lost two body parts.  It's a normal reaction.\"  Yes, I made a drastic choice, BUT I did not want to risk _any_ SEs that would affect my quality of health or life.  I live flat and have never worn \"foobs\" and have no desire to wear them nor does my DH see the purpose for me to do so.   There is so much to take into consideration when making our decisions that at times it is overwhelming.  Each choice is so individual to the person making it and is the right choice for them.",
