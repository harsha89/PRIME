Ask your MO whether you could do more frequent, low-dose chemo instead of three or four dose-dense infusions. I'm 3/4 of the way through a 12-week regimen of taxol, carboplatin and herceptin and have had hair loss, but no effects on my fingernails and very little neuropathy. (And honestly I think a good part of my hair loss is because of an injected medicine to keep my white blood cell counts up - my hair loss didn't start in earnest until I started this medicine.) Everyone is different of course, but this is an option that I don't think enough MO's mention to patients. Frankly I think it's because it's easier to schedule people for appointments every three weeks than every week. It's for the convenience of both the patient and the clinic,but seriously, what is convenience in the face of dose-dense side effects that can be so debilitating!",

I'm thinking of getting a chemodiva halo wig, but I don't want to rush to get my hair cut tomorrow when I start chemo the day after. Just too much abrupt change at once. So I'm kind of wondering how long I can wait before getting my hair cut off to make the halo wig ... after all it won't help much if I don't have any hair left when I get the wig made. My treatment is Carboplatin, Paclitaxol, Herceptin, fractionated doses weekly for 12 weeks, then Herceptin continuing for a year after. Any advice?",

They were our \"final stop\" -- our fourth opinion -- because each of the doctors we had seen before had offered very unsatisfactory ideas. They use a holistic, wellness-oriented approach that involves nutrition and complementary therapies as well as conventional treatment. Personally I think it's a shame that they don't have a hospital of their own in Seattle, but they did a great job of coordinating with the hospital we used for his surgery and conventional chemotherapy, which was Swedish. (Also fantastic doctors there.) The oncologist we saw at SCTWC now has his own practice, LifeSpring, which uses a similar approach. Anyway, if you want to know more about his treatment pathand why I think it worked so well, send me a PM, or post in the alternative treatments discussion forum.",
