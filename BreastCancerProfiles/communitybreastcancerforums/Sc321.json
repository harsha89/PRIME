I\u2019m going to see how the US goes and if I need to see about jumping through the hoops of Tricare to see someone off post! As scary as it is I keep telling myself that the odds are in my favor!",

I went to the doctor yesterday because my hair has been falling out and thinning pretty badly over the last two months or so. I casually mentioned to my doctor that I had a small spot on my right breast that popped up in early November and asked if she would look at it. It is super small and feels like a piece of rice just resting under the skin. My first thought was a pimple or ingrown hair because I do get those all over my body. Well, she decided to do a breast exam on me just in case. She wasn't overly concerned with the spot I had pointed out, and had no answers for it. However, during the exam she found a one inch, bumpy, hard lump at 6:00 on my right breast. I do monthly exams and she said that I probably did not notice it because it is \u201cdeeper\" in the breast. She had me feel it and it honestly feels like a little potato in my boob. She referred me to radiology and I have a breast ultrasound scheduled for Jan 4. I could tell she was concerned by her face while she was examining me and she told me to expect the worst but hope for the best. Am I right to worry and be scared? She only gave me two explanations for the lump which were an abscess or cancer. I have no pain, swelling, redness or anything unusual other than my \u201cboob tater tot\" (as my husband is calling it). I'm young so finding a lump in my breast and having my doctor say those things is very scary and has my anxiety through the roof, especially since I have to wait two weeks to even get a scan. I'm also a member of Tricare Prime and had an aunt pass away from breast cancer a few years ago. I also had two other aunts pass from colon cancer and my maternal grandparents both died from lung cancer. Any insights would be wonderful!!! Much love and good vibes! Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Dec 22, 2017 09:32AM - edited Dec 22, 2017 09:32AM by Sc321 thank you for the kind words! I think it has scared me so much because I had another health crisis back in September of this year. I went for a routine pap and ended up having a total of eight appointments ending with high grade cervical changes and displaxia(sp?) and now I go every year for More testing to make sure it doesn't progress into cervical cancer, which my mother and older sister both had. When she said she found a lump I immediately thought of all the small things it could be when your doctor says cancer your brain just stops, then goes into overdrive. Thank you for the encouragement! I'm definitely going to try and stay positive",

I will definitely be taking the time between now and then to gather all the questions I want to make sure to ask. I am probably going to write them down because I know I'm going to be nervous! I'm still a little put off by my PCM as I feel like she doesn't typically take me seriously or hear out my concerns, but I'm glad she referred me for the test. I'll have to check into getting the genetic testing done. I'm not sure if my military insurance covers it so I will definitely look into it!!!  Much love",
