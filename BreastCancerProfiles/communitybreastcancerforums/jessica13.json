My radiation center is bearing the brunt because after diagnosis, I had surgery, started chemo, had to transfer jobs, sublet my flat, move from London back to the US on Xmas Eve, navigate culture shock, insurance nightmares and the worst winter ever before starting rads. I have only recently gone off autopilot so am not that surprised the tears are catching up with me and while I'm trying to be less of a crazy person I am also trying to not feel guilty about it! @Bounce- I did start going to a therapist that specializes in cancer and she rightly advised me to treat my dr's appts as I would a business mtg, but easier said than done. I am emotional because I am always being rushed, don't feel that I have been given enough info to make a decision and am just supposed to blindly accept the doctors' wisdom, when often their opinions are contradictory. That doesn't sit well with me and despite everyone saying 'at least I have a choice' about radiation or mastectomy or nothing, they all really suck as options! ;) Acceptance is supposedly one of the stages I have to go through but mutely accepting and trusting what they say feels like being defeated. @Brookside & @Binney- I emailed my RO this am because with chemobrain I need to have things written down to digest them. The doctor called me from her vacation abroad and was super pissy with me for not understanding that they aren't radiating my nodes. She said that I didn't understand basic anatomy and that there was no way to avoid radiating the area of my SNB scar if she was to radiate the full breast, but that my axilla was getting no radiation beneath the skin. She is the chair of the department and said everyone in her team argued that my nodes needed to be radiated since I am 35, had aggressive disease, etc and that she did me a favor by avoiding the axilla. This is why I don't trust her - I had clear sentinel nodes and no vascular invasion, there is no evidence to support radiating my axillary nodes, confirmed by multiple doctors in the UK. She also said that having had only 2 sentinel nodes taken out could NEVER be responsible for breast lymphedema and that it was my surgeon's fault for doing oncoplastic remodeling. Reason #2 I don't trust her; my surgeon said I had a 5% chance of arm LE from the SNB, so I think it would be just as likely if not more so for breast LE. It is totally possible that I am just incapable of processing anything right now but I am so sick of doctors and their dismissiveness. I suppose since I had LE before I have to focus on getting through this without exacerbating it but it isn't easy. It hurts to wear the Jovipak now and I feel so swollen and tender and gross. Thanks for letting me vent!!",

My radiation is in the prone position and shouldn't involve the axilla since I had clear nodes. However to avoid the lung, they have done the planning to have the beam wrap around part of my armpit - right above my SNB scar. At the start of rads I freaked out about this and the doctor told me that it was just 'scatter' that would be hitting my scar area. However 17/25 sessions in, my armpit is extremely red and sore- more so than even my breast, and my techs confirmed that the area was within the field of radiation, not scatter. I don't fully understand the terminology but this made me just lose it and refuse to go through with the treatment yesterday (#18). I am sick of being told conflicting things and also not being told the full story because they think I won't understand anyway or that they know what's best for me. Whether it's rational or not, I really don't want to continue and I don't know how to broach my concerns with my doctors because 1) I don't trust them at this point and 2) they are sick of dealing with my meltdowns. \\I don't have time to get another consult but I don't know what to do.

I have a ton of scar tissue which is protuding from my chest like a muscle knot - it's nowhere near the scar itself but I guess the tissue that was moved around to fill in my tumor hole is contracting and getting really hard. Now I also have a ton of broken blood vessels from massaging it, and it's getting uglier by the day :( Jess",

I had always expected to do lumpectomy + rads but then I got LE and it turned out part of my tumor was Her2+ so I also did chemo and will have Herceptin and Tamoxifen... Radiation and its impact on cosmetics/LE was just the straw breaking the camel's back, so to speak. I will be in the prone position so can hopefully avoid the arm LE, and I guess I have to have faith that time will improve the situation. Feeling in control of it does help! Cheers Jessica ",

I have been having it treated with MLD for 6 weeks and it is manageable but I am petrified of how badly radiation will exacerbate both the scar tissue hardness and the lymphedema. I will not be having rads to the axilla (though I guess there could be 'scatter') but it will be to the full breast. I am 35 and more concerned about the quality of life, given that I may have to deal with cancer again in my lifetime anyway given statistical odds from my age, but don't know if it would be stupid to decline radiation. Have any of you had surgery related breast or truncal LE and went through radiation anyway? Thanks!

Now my breast has got a lot of scar tissue underneath the tumor area and I've been advised to massage it out before rads begin so the lumpiness and dimpling don't harden in place. Did anyone else experience this? It's super painful to massage it but I don't want these dimples to last!! Advice or positive experiences welcome! thanks!",
