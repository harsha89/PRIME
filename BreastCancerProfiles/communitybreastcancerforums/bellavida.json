My mom was recently diagnosed with liver mets (she also had pleural effusion around the heart and lung). Right before being diagnosed with the liver mets had many of the symptoms that you are experiencing. After two cycles of chemo (taxatore) she is doing so much better and her tumor markers are down. I am praying for the same for you. There is hope.  Christina",

Initially she had some reduction in her liver mets and her most recent scan showed all is stable. Her doctor would like to see further reduction so in a couple of weeks she will be upping the dose. It has been a fairly doable drug for my mom, she has had fatigue but no neuropathy or other side affects. Hope that it goes well for you. ",

However, today we received her latest scan results and the news is not good. She has new cells in her kidney as well as a couple 2-3cm growths in her liver. Her doctor is planning to start her on Taxol starting Tuesday, she will receive treatment once a week for three weeks and then her doctor plans to reevaluate. Her doctor seems optimistic, but I am devastated. Has anyone been on Taxol? What should she expect? I would appreciate any advice, thank you! Log in to post a reply",

Her doctor is very good and she also indicated that once she was stable again she would consider putting her on a AI again. Unfortunately, she is HER2-. I do hope the Taxol is affective.

Disability discharges have been made more complicated in the last several years. Before they would just discharge the loan but now loans are conditionally discharged and then after a couple of years once they determine that your disability is indeed permanent and you are still disabled they permanately discharge them. My father's loans were discharged a couple of years back due to disability  (he has Parkinsons's) but it took a couple of years. As far as forebearance and interest I believe it depends on what type of loan you have. If you have a unsubsidized loan interest continues to acrue however if you have a subsidized loan it does not. I hope this helps.  Christina",
