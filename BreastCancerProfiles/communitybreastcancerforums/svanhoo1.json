I don't know about other family members - my entire immediate family is deceased due to several various types of cancers. I have been getting diagnostic mammograms for several years now, due to cysts, lumps, calcifications, breast discharge, asymmetrical breast density with a lot of breast density...etc. I have these things in the left breast - no noted problems in the right breast. I had a ductogram done for the breast discharge. The radiologist said it only showed duct dilation. Two years ago, after complaining about a hard lump, my dr. sent me for a diagnostic CAD mammogram, which marked the area as suspicious. The mammogram also flagged a lymph node as enlarged, but the dr. said it was the same size as the previous year so she wasn't concerned about it. Had an ultrasound and the dr. said it looked like fibroglandular tissue. She said that I could take it to the next level if I wanted to, but it was up to me. I decided not to do further testing. Last year's screening mammogram was ok. When I had this year's screening mammogram, I received a note from my dr., saying it was negative. A week later, I received a letter from the radiologist that said my mammogram showed the need for further additional testing. I am scheduled for an MRI on Wed. My dr. said that because my left breast is so dense, this radiologist can't evaluate the left breast. Questions - Do they always use dye with an MRI? I've noticed some discomfort on a bone near my neck for the past few months. I can't feel anything there, but it is tender to the touch and bothers me when I turn my neck from time to time. Does the breast MRI show this area too? I know the statistics are in my favor, but I'm still worried. I have made a decision to be more proactive regarding my health. I'm raising my grandson who is now eight. I've had him since birth and he needs me. I've never had an MRI, so I don't know what to expect. Sorry this is so long! Log in to post a reply",
