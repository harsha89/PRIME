Then I got like heat waves through my R breast - so I go get a ultra sound and they found cyst but one was uncomfortable when she touched it - the woman that performed the ultra sound left the room saying I was ok but has a weird stare at the woman behind the counter and said I need to see surgeon today (that was Friday) they said I'd not today - come in Monday morning to talk to doctor and she will be aspirating that cyst - I don't like how they acted .... Could they have told me If I had something to worry or can only the doctor do that ? I'm freaked out and can't sleep ... Log in to post a reply",
