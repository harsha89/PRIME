A week after him discussing removing the lump or letting it be it flared up and he did an I&D on it! Not sure how that worked since it was more of a mass then anything! I have a history of pituitary issues so he's not sure if that has anything to do with the problems I am having! Thanks for everyone's support on here it was greatly appreciated!",

I immediately thought it was mastitis (I'm 44, and definitely not breast feeding) I was put on a 10 say course of keflex and the redness went away but I have a huge lump at 2 o'clock and a small one at 8 o'clock. US was suspicious findings not cystic, radiologist says it looks like \"gunky junk\" in a duct but has some lines like a solid mass. No biopsy Dr wants to wait 4weeks to see if inflammation (lump area) goes away! Wondering if I should have just asked for the biopsy and not waited! Any opinions? Log in to post a reply",

When I called today the receptionist told me the doctor said that my specimen was sent out for a second opinion and I shouldn't worry because that happens! I think I'm losing my patience with the comments coming from radiology office! So not happy with that I called the surgeons office that started all this and asked if they could find out why it was going out! I'm a big girl tell me if they saw something weird or he just wanted to verify his negative results, anything was better than don't know anything until Tues! So upon the investigation they were sending it out for additional stains! That's a little more helpful! I called back before the office closed and there was a little bit in the computer that she read me and the major things she hit were leukocyte antigen + and lymphocyte antigen -, and something about histeocytic marker! Sound like anything useful to anyone? The nurse just kept saying I shouldn't be giving you results over the phone I could get in trouble! Well I was thankful she tried to help me, they are my results anyway! I was straight forward with her when I first called and said I just wanted to know why it was being sent out for additional testing I even told her \"no need to blow smoke up my ass, I'm a big girl is rather know that then to worry for another 4 days! So I am back to waiting! Yippee",

I guess my concern was I finished the Keflex on Memorial Day and the lump is still there.  \"Kicks\" I'm not sure what the report said but when the radiologist called me for the suspicious findings that's how he explained it. The general surgeon was less than impressed with his report too! He said he wouldn't say anything clear for him to over! I guess I'll stop stressing and wait for the repeat US on Jul 3! Thank you everyone!",

They asked me to call back tomorrow at 10! I was really hoping to not have to get results on my 45th birthday! I guess if it's good news it won't be so bad!  While doing my biopsy he said he since I have more than one lump he did not think it was cancer! He also made the comment \" if it was cancer you would know\" hello I was really happy with everything he was saying up until that point! How in the world would I know? Well enough venting, hopefully I know something tomorrow!",
