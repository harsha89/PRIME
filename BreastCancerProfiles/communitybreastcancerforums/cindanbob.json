Hopefully, it's only arthritis. But the waiting sure is getting on my nerves! Wish me luck and I'll let you all know as soon as I get the results. You ladies on this board sure have saved my sanity! I read your posts all the time although I don't often add anything. Usually someone has already answered my questions! Good luck to you all. dx 10/05 stage1 grade2 ER/PR+ Log in to post a reply",
