    "Content": "MatthewR wrote: My mom recently found out she had a canerous growth in her left breast. The tumor was about 4cm when it was removed. She then had what they called a partial  mastectomy and had 8 Nodes removed to be tested. There was no cancer found in the breast after the second surgery but 5 of the 8 nodes tested positive for cancer. I am trying to better understand where she stands. The IHC report was attached to the Pathology report. ER+ 75% PR+ 82% HER2- 0 EGFR+ 51% Ki-67 1% so her innitial tumor was 4cm and 5 of 8 lymph nodes have cancer. She said the surgeon told her it is very non-aggressive cancer, but I still don't know what stage she is in. After some reading she could either be in II or III. She is going into a specialist in a few weeks but she said she will probably be getting radiation and chemo.  I am just wondering what stage she is in and was also hoping to get a better description on what these percenteges mean. My mom is the most positive and friendly person I have ever known and I feel like I have to find some way to help her. Log in to post a reply",
