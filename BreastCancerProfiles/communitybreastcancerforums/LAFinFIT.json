She decided to do a full exam (to include) breast as I was a new patient to her. To my surprise she felt a \"mass\" at 2 o'clock on my left breast and referred me for a mammogram-(which lead to an US) and a breast surgeon for follow up. The surgeon reviewed the diagnostics and said she didn't see anything on any report or feel anything and i was \"triple negative\" and not to worry. BUT come back in 6 weeks to follow up. Now i do believe she was a new doc because when i tried to make the f/u they didn't have her as part of the practice and they would have to call me when they got her sched. I do not know if she was new in medicine or the practice though. I do have a family hx of breast cancer and I am of complete european decent (supposedly it puts you at higher risk). Long story short- they never called to schedule and i think due to my uncertainly with this surgeon i had not followed up with them. I did follow up with my gyn again and she clearly feel's this \"mass\". I felt it after she pointed it out (both visits) as well. I don't want to speculate- but with a \"mass\" and hx but not seeing anything i am unable to feel \"safe\" so to speak. Do i request a biopsy or just go with the confirmation by the doc?

Since posting I got a new referral to a different practice and have an appt mid Feb. Thank you all for your input; it's much appreciated! ",

I was searching for \"triple negative results\" and I was shocked!! It appeared a bit odd to me as well. I even called my husband to confirm that was the term she used. I often think we need to listen to our instincts, however, sometimes we need that \"yeah, you should\".. thank you again! ",
