I know we will never be able to let go of the kids but I want to live for some more time, till they are more stable. THey have had to go through a lot of wierd stuff in thier young lives what with thier extremly healthy mother falling sick all of a sudden and thier father walking out of thier lives. Was in a lot of pain yesterday but feeling better today.Please pray for me, I believe its the prayers of so many people around me which has helped me fight for so long.",

Other than the normal side effects of fatigue and nausea I was ok and within a few months I was fine and back to my normal life.

My daughter got married in2005 and my son joined college the same year and everything seemed fine. Out of the blue in September 2006 I had pain in my neck which was diagnosed as metasis in the bone. I had corpectomy done to stabilize my cervical spine and went through the whole radiation and chemo again. while doing the treatment they found some spots in my lower back also which was also hit by radiation. I was fine for the past 2 months. Last week I got a headache and slight slurring of speech and when an MRI was done they told me that there were some changes in the brain and I need to do a Lumbar puncture for meningitis and if necessary some injections in the spine. It just seem never ending I am tired of treatment and the cost of it as in India we don\u2019t have medical insurance.

Can u believe i had booked tickets to go to singapore on november 3rd to spend some time with my daughter living there. my son has semester hols for one month and we were planning to go spend it with her. we have been chatting everyday , she was so excited  about it and had planned all the places she was going to take us. she just moved to singapore with her husband last dec and she wanted me to help her set up her house and learn some cooking tips. But when I told her about the test results she told me \"its ok ma, you finish your treatment first, you can always come afterwards.\" My son is also insisting that i fight it out and so is the rest of my family. So i think i will go ahead and do the treatment. thanks once again for your encouragement. fouzi ",

As I had written earlier I am on some herbal medication and have been extremely tired with lots of aches nd pains and fever on an off. The vaidyar (herbal doctor) had warned me about it but it was so bad I needed somebody to move my hand and legs for me. He says he is removing all toxins from my body and it seems to be working because i have lost most of my puffiness and  water retention and look almost normal. Insha Allah as long as it does not give me any side effects I am willing to try. I am almost off all alopathic medicines except dextrose (steroids)2mg a day and painkillers when i feel too much pain. I did meet my oncologist last week and tell him about the treatment and he told me that medically i look better and i can go ahead and try it if I believed in it. Let us hope and pray it will help me in some way.  ",

NOw i am not able to lift the lid. I have sight if I can lift it manually, but otherwise it remains closed. My oncologist did a ct scan and found that my earlier brain  changes have increased and he wants me to start xeloda. Meanwhile I got an infection in my left eye and could not open it also. I became very depressed and upset. THen my herbal doctor came to see me and he gave me some steam inhalations and herbs mixed with mothers milk to be applied in the eye. Now my left eye is fully ok and my right eyelid has started moving a bit. He is quite confident he can make me ok. So as of now I have decided not to start xeloda. I have been on chemo and radition continiulsy for the past one and half years and i think i need to take a break. I have confiedence in this man and after 6 months of living on pain killers 3 times a day,now for the past one month i have been living wihout any pain killers. And health wise i feel much better. I have lost all my edema i had with the steroids. Looking much better and except for my eye feeling better.Please pray for me and pray that i have made the right decision. My daughter is coming down on monday to take care of me. She still hopes to take me back with her when she goes to singapore. May be If God wills.  ",

He feels that either the cells are so minimal or the test didnt pick it up but definitely some signs in the MRI. So Insha Allah i will start chemo again from Monday for one month. I don't know wether to feel relieved that the test was negative or upset that i have to do chemo. Anyway I am taking it as it comes. Will keep keep in touch. Thanks for the support. I am amazed at the kindness of random people all over the world praying for me. I believe it is prayers that have worked more than my treatment so thanks once again for praying for me fouzi ",
