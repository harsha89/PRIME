I will begin chemotherapy in January and have a mastecomy in the summer. I had 17 out of 38 lymph nodes positive, which is very alarming to me. I am ER+ and HER2+. Now, here is my real dilemma. My oncologist initally recommended a treatment of Adriamycin and Cytoxan, followed by Taxol an Herceptin. My muga scan revealed that my Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction is 53%. Because of this, my doctor switched my chemotherapy to Taxotere, Carboplatin, and Hercptin. I read the ACTH vs. TCH posts and I am now even more confused. If the TCH is just as good, why would the doctor recommend ACTH in the first place. I am tending to lean towards the Adriamycin, but I don't know if it is worth the chance if my ejection fraction is only 53%.  I am not even sure where it is appropriate to post this, but I need help making my decision! What is the consensus between these treatments?  The good news is that all of my other scans were clear, so besides the lymph nodes there are no metastases. I worry because I had 17 positive lymph nodes, and two lumpectomies were not successful. Now this, and I can't tell if I should get the TCH or if the doctor is just being too cautious! The concern is that if the adriamycin knocks my LVEF even lower, I won't be able to tolerate the Herceptin, which is essential for my survival.  Please help, I appreciate any comments. Thanks in advance! Dx 11/26/2008, IDC, 2cm, Stage IIIC, Grade 3, 17/38 nodes, ER+/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
