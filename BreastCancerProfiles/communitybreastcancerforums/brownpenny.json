I declined the suggestion to take tamoxifen. I followed strict follow-up with mammograms/ mri etc for q 6 mo ; and was then cleared to go back to every yr \"screening\" mammograms; Dx of breast cancer came Nov 2016 - but only after my request for an ultrasound ; (My annual screening mammogram had shown nothing.) I just felt a little \"thickening\" - but no lump so NP ordered the ultrasound. I had 2 areas of CA identified in the core needle biopsy which followed the ultrasound. - ( neither of which had any relation to the ADH area of concern from 2013. ) I was told a MX would be necessary due to the location near the nipple. I opted for a bilateral MX since I have had so many years of biopsies / scares FYI - my surgery involved reconstruction using flaps from my thighs. It was 11 hours long due to the complications related to the scar tissue from all the biopsies I have had through the years. I had at least 6 + ( lost count )biopsies through the yrs - leaving scar tissue to be dealt with in the reconstruction process using my tissue transfer. I do not regret the bilateral mx - but wish I had pushed for it sooner rather than accept it as their suggestion later. Continued biopsies only lead to more anguish and scar tissue. Then - you end up doing what is likely to be the end result anyway. Trust your instincts ! -You will be better off being your own advocate and being in charge of your own decisions once you gather all the facts. Good Luck!",
