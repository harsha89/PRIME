Because like you all, I just found out in May that I had a 1.3 cm breast cancer tumor. I had a lumpectomy with the impression that I had a benign tumor. Then I get a call 2 days later that I had breast cancer. Oh man, I was not expecting that. I am only 27, this isn't suppose to be happening!?! Luckily, I am blessed also with an immense support group of family and friends. My husband had a really hard time with the news at first. But he has become my rock! Him and my two daughters ( ages 7 & 3) are the reason I am going to put up the best fight possible. I feel lucky to have caught it in Stage 1. I have learned to just deal with this day to day. And I have good days and bad days. I lost my sister last year to Ovarian cancer. It had mets already to her liver, breast and bones. We found out she had cancer in January and she past away in June.",

Thanks Marsha- My one and only panic attack that i know i had for sure was 3 days after i was diagnosed. It was really strange, i didn't know what was wrong with me so my husband took me to the hospital and they told me i had an \"upper respiratory infection\". When i called my breast surgeon to tell him what happened and ask if he thought i should take the antibiotics they prescribed me... He said No, and that it definitley was not an URI and i had a panic attack. Well sure enough the next day, i felt fine. No trouble breathing, no rapid heart beat, nothing. I would have never guessed because i had never experienced a panic attack. And i hope too that its something small and there is nothing wrong with my heart. And to any of the new \"firecrackers\" , welcome. None of us want to be here but i am sure glad we can all be of support to each other.",

And it sounds like you are being proactive on all things. (such as Claritin, etc.) My only advice would be have some mouth rinse (water,salt and baking soda or Biotene) on hand. I wasn't told by my doctors about the mouth sores/sore throat until today when i experienced them and called the nurse. 2bluestars- I am glad to hear your first chemo went good as well. Here's to minimal side effects for you! :) I know thats what i wished for!! Soriya123- I had my port done 8 days ago and mine is starting to feel much better. It is only sore when touched or bra strap rubs against it. (which i decided wearing a bra wasn't worth it, lol) I hope for quick healing for you. Gma04- I bought a probiotic today.

I had my first chemo infusion on the 10th and then some side effects but i am feeling better now. I have a few things i would like to ask though and see if any of the rest of you are experiencing. I got A/C and then a Neulasta shot the following day. And since Sunday, i have gotten a rash on my face /upper torso. At first i thought it was like an acne breakout but it also has some big red patches (kinda looks similiar to hives). Also for the past 3 mornings when i wake up, my heart rate is racing. It makes me feel out of breath. My husband calculated it for me this morning and it was 100 bpm. All i had done was wake up and walk to the couch. Thats it. I called my onc and he is referring me to a Cardiologist. I will see him next Thursday. I know there is so many things that could be causing my heart to speed up... Steriods, chemo, Neulasta shot, nausea meds. I just am at a lost as to where to start to try and figure it out. But besides those, i am actually doing rather well. I am trying to get into my normal routine as much as possible. I hope all of you ladies are doing great! I am going to try my best to start responding back everyday",

So i did, but i feel like he didn't give me a good enough reason of why i would need radiation on top of chemotherapy. Have any of you ever experienced this? I am only stage 1 with no lymph node involvement but it had attached itself to a small portion of my pectorals muscle. My breast surgeon removed everything that he could without killing my skin or the muscle. So i am not sure why my onc is so adamant about me getting the radiation on top of the double mastectomy and 8 rounds of chemo. His exact words were \"Is your husband in agreement with you on your decision to not get radiation? Cause if you were my wife i would force you to get it.\" o_O",

However, I do check in and read from time to time because y'all keep me remembering that i am not alone!! I got my first round of Taxotere last Wednesday. And today has been HELL. I am in so much pain. It's very strange, it doesn't stay in the same spot, it isn't consistent, and I can't explain it well. It's bone and muscle. I am getting spasms and all. My tongue also hurts. I took a Vicodin this morning but with no relief. I also tried a hot bath and that only helped for a very short time ( 15 minutes). Anyone else experiencing this pain?",

Not so much about loosing my hair (because i know it will grow back) but everything else. And i love what you said Gma04..... Texas sized hugs!! I live on the Gulf Coast of Texas :)",

Soriya123- I was told by my Oncologist that he had patients who started taking regular Claritin a day before the injection to a couple days after and it helped with the bone pain. I won't be getting my first injection until Thursday but i will be taking the Claritin, just as a precaution to see if it helps. Mellie289- I hope to be able to reply back on here tomorrow and give everyone an update. They suggested a port for me because i will be getting 8 rounds (24 weeks). Brook21679- I couldn't help but notice that you and I were diagnosed the VERY SAME day. A day i will never forget.",

My first 4 are A/C and last 4 are Taxotere. I am also getting a Neulasta shot the day after each infusion. If you are getting any of these my tips for you would be 1. Start taking Claritin the day before or morning of the Neulasta shots. 2. Get some Biotene mouth rinse or mix salt, baking soda and warm water for a rinse. 3. Prepare to be able to rest a lot. 4. Get some type of heartburn relief medicine ( I took tums first then started taking Zantac 75) 5. Possibly have something on hand in case for constipation. But make sure you get everything approved by your oncologist before taking anything. Nausea was only an issue for me for the first 4 days. Every since then I have been able to eat pretty much everything I usually do. Everyone is different though. I broke out in a rash on day 5 but it wasn't from chemo, shot or meds. ( it was either an allergy to food or Colace) I know I am probably forgetting something but there is some really great ladies in here that have helped me so I am sure they will give you some pointers also. I was dx on May 24th and I still have my ups and downs. It's perfectly normal. You will feel like you are on an emotional roller coaster that just won't stop.",

So I am getting worried about only being 4 days out from having chemo and now coming down with a cold of some sort. I don't have any fever but am still getting worried. Anyone else experienced or know what I should do?",

It seems to be the consensus that i should get it. These are my concerns with it. 1) Since i opted for immediate reconstruction (at the time they said i wouldn't need radiation, just chemo) they will have to deflate my right tissue expander, do radiation, wait 6 months, reinflate the tissue expander, and then during my surgery to replace the TE with the implant....the plastic surgeon will have to wrap the implant in my own back muscle to insure that the implant doesn't break through my skin or move around. 2) If i have the radiation now, if it ever comes back in that breast, i won't have radiation as a back up (cause you can't do it in the same area twice). 3) it only increases my percentage for non-reoccurance by 1 or 2% (from everything i have read anyhow) So thats why i said i am not sure if the benefits outweigh the risks. However, i want to know that i am doing everything i can to be here as long as i can for my kids. I am really struggling with this decision. I know that my onc thinks a lot of my husband (he said he is very smart) however, i was HIGHLY offended to what he said to me. And so was my husband, once i told him. My husband is not going to go against what i want to do because i am the one going through this nightmare. I just feel let down, like someone mis-lead me. I was under the impression i could just get chemo, replace TE expanders with implants and be done. (besides check ups) My pectoral muscle is now on top of the TE so if it came back, it is upfront by my skin, it should be fairly easy to detect if it came back. (i would think) TwoHobbies- I hate to hear that about your co-worker. I wish the best for her. Sorry for such the long post. And thanks for letting me vent!!",
