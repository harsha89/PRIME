She was Stage 2B/3A Triple Negative with 4.5cm tumor and 3 lymph nodes involved. She had neo-adjuvant chemo ACx4 and Taxol X4 dose dense. After her double mastectomy they found that some residual cancer was still left in the lymph nodes they removed. Since the neo-adjuvant chemo failed to give her a PCR (pathological complete response) she is now getting some additional chemo in the adjuvant setting. She is getting 4 cycles of gem/carb. Basically due to the fact that there was residual cancer left in her lymph nodes at the time of surgery that put her at a high risk for recurrence. So she is getting the adjuvant chemo now as precautionary measure in case there are any lingering cells in her body. Had the neo-adjuvant chemo killed everything off she wouldn't need additional chemo.  Was there any residual cancer left after you had neo-adjuvant chemo ? If so that is probably why your Onc is suggesting additional chemo. Hope this helps.  Diane ",

She did neo-adjuvent AC x4, T X 4 DD. It did not out a lot of the cancer, the tumor was all gone but some residual cancer remained in 3 of her lymph nodes as per her path report after her BMX. She is now going to get some additional chemo due to her high risk of recurrence since the lymph nodes had residual cancer. Her Onc recommended either gem/carbo or Ixempra with possible carbo. Due to heavy duty side effects of Ixempra we are leaning towards the gem/carbo and that will probably be what she does and she will prob start next wee. Her BMX was Dec. 10th.   If you didn't have node involvement you may not want to do more chemo as yes it is toxic and will reck some havoc on the body again. If my mom didn't have residual in the nodes we wouldn't have pushed for add'l chemo and she could have just gotten radiation. But given her stage and triple negative status, her risk is high for recurrence and the nodes still having some cancer is a chance that we rather not take. It seems as though there isn't much out there on studies of women getting adjuvent chemo after neo-adjuvent fails to produce a complete response. Some Onc's definitely do it but more of on a case by case basis rather than as a protocol. There should be more studies to see if it does make a difference especially in women who are triple negative and can't get any additional hormone therapy after chemo etc.  ",

So seeing as you said after chemo your tumor was still 2cm then you did have residual cancer left and that is why your Onc is recommending additional chemo. As much as it sucks to get more chemo when we talked about it with my Mom's Onc we felt like rather hit this thing with everything we got now and lower the chance of it coming back as we all know if it comes back it is a whole different ball game. So we figured do it now and hope that if there are any lingering cells that this 2nd blast will knock them out. Good luck and stay strong! Diane ",
