I've had \"day 2\" of radiation and it was a little better than day 1, but not much. I am a very emotional person so I cried as the machine went up and over me. I am going to be 50 yrs.old next week and my Mother passed away at the age of 50, she had liver cancer and two of her sisters died from breast cancer. So, needless to say I'm am doing my best to stay positive and strong. I have many supportive friends and a great church family, but I depend on \"faith\" and knowing that the Lord is carrying me through this. I truly wish you well, and hope that we can stay in touch via this \"wonderful\" site. God Bless! ",

I will be going by his office tomorrow to pick up (what the pathology office called) a \"ERPR\"...whatever that is. I told the girl at the doc's office that all these women on the bc discussion board knew so much about their cancer, yet I knew absolutely nothing. (she was new and I think she was as lost as I was)  LOL  but said she would have someone get together what I needed. So you were diagnosed in 2007, yet you've been a member since 2002?  Why is that? ....if I'm not being nosey. I just love all you ladies  :)",

(even though I know we all have to start somewhere)   Well, the main guy (radiologist) was gay, which was nice, he was sensative and made me feel comfortable. It was quite an emotional experience, but like you I'm glad it's underway, back again tomorrow, but I have to do a total of 33 treatments....the journey begins.",
