We are so alike! i have mets to the bone as well. mine was in the hip, femur, rib, sternum, I forget where else. I was diagnosed last Oct 4.  Just like you, I went to work (missed one day), came home and cooked for my family, cleaned house, did the shopping... My cancer didn't consume me. It surfaced when I lost my hair, and would be a massive inconvenience  for about nine days after my AC/zometa coctail hour. I didn't get on the phone, alert the media about my cancer. i was not shy about telling people either, because I felt that the more people sending good vibes & prayers my way the better.   As my friends learned about my cancer, they called me sobbing, and i would always have a funny story about something I did because of my chemo brain...I think when dealing with people like us, the public at large has no idea how to handle us...it is far easier to comfort someone who is falling apart. What I did, and DO is force people to follow my lead...I refused to entertain any notion of my being sick. It does take a persistent effort to get people to respond the way we need, but we have to be patient and didigent in what we expect and 'train' those we come into contact with to behave the way we need them to in order to save our sanity !  My most recent cat scan and bone scan are clear with the exception of a small leision on my scapula...could be a bone cyst. I think the outcome would have been as the original diagnosing doc predicted if I hadn't taken things as I did. 20% survival rate???!!!!! Bull &%**. Let them say you are in denial...What EVER!  I think we need to see more stage IV women who are successfully battling this disease. Early detection is best, I would love to have been a member of that club. But  I wasn't and I will win... You will too... ",

I fought off what I thought was a mild cold for about a week, went for my last treatment of my first round of Chemo, and two days later, I was sick as a dog. I did NOT take anything... not over the counter, advil...nothing. I wanted to see how my body would fight it on it's own. My husband got it and I recovered before he did. My point is that I am taking things to strengthen my immune system. I don't listen to the docs about what to feed my body. I don't think they have a clue!!! I am so glad that you are taking matters back into your own hands...Dairy? Animal protein??? They told you to eat that??? CHEESE????? Wow. I was feeling like crap until I got cancer...hehe. I started eating like you did before your cancer and I feel better than ever....go figure. ( Ok, so I don't feel better than ever ALL the time... I feel like I have morning sickness , all day for about a week after chemo. Bleh) I went out of town and had to put off my chemo for a week. I felt so good I tried to put if off for another DAY. They wouldn't let me...Now they call me the day before to make sure I don't go AWOL...it's tempting!) Really, I do hope you are feeling better. I'll say a little prayer for you tonight. EAT FOR YOUR LIFE!!!  We are warriors and this disease has invaded OUR world.This life is ours and they can't have it!",

Changing your mindset requires a great deal of thought on your part...you need to practice being positive every second of every day. Have you been doing anything else to heal other than chemo? It's amazing how taking some control over your health will help your attitude. I have read posts where everyone is sick of hearing others say \"stay positive\" . I think most people say that because they don't know what else to say, but our mind is an amazing thing, and our body will do what our mind tells it to do.

She didn't see any issue with the surgery other than the fact that, as I am sure you know, you will need to closley monitor her because of her inability to follow instructions. Her dementia may increase, temporarily, just due to the surgery, and being thrown out of her routine so just know that, as I have seen many times, she may try to remove her bandages, because she won't remember what they are for. You are right, she is in the most difficult stage. As she progresses, you will find it easier, because she will not be as aware of her memory loss. Through the Alzheimer's Association, there is a book called \"Coach Broyle's Playbook for Caregivers\". He was a coach for the Arkansas Razorbacks, whose wife was diagnosed. He was her caregiver. This book is wonderful. It is literally what it's called, a playbook. He even made up a pocket size \"what to do when this happens\" kind of thing. There is also a book called \"Learning to Speak Alzheimer's\" It is amazing. I highly recommend it.   Good luck to you, and I wish your mom well through her surgery and recovery.",

They wouldn't give me the CD until my doctor had the results, but my calls helped move the process along...The squeaky wheel...you know.  I also got my own copies of my mamograms and ultrasounds. If I were you, I would do the same.   To ease your mind, maybe you should get another opinion (the reason for getting the CDs). (And a second opinion is a good idea anyway). I also would not accept the appt date of 12/30. That is ridiculous. is that because the surgeon is booked until 12/30? Consider calling daily, or weekly to see if there is a cancellation, or seek out another doctor who can see you sooner. And get your mind around WHATEVER you find out. Decide NOW that you can handle whatever comes your way. I bet everything is going to be fine. Heck, i was diagnosed stage IV a year ago...i am clear today (But don't think i didn't get three opinions before saying THAT out loud!!!)   ",

You may be on the right track in your thought process. How aware is she? What is her orientation to time and place? Are you caring for her in her home or does she live in a community? Having done this for 6 years, I have met many people with Cancer and Alz. For the most part, they don't remember that they have Cancer. Many times, it is complications from the Alz that affects them before the cancer does.  If she has the surgery, you are right. The post surgery and the healing process will be more challenging on many levels, due to her inability to comprehend or retain what is going on. The trauma of this kind of surgery could accelerate the progression of her disease. Please give me more info. I can get you the information you need so you can make a good sound decision.  ",

He is a veteran, was born in sweden, etc...These things obviously before she knew him. She learned about the war he fought in, learned about Swedish tradition, which he is remembering vividly now and some other things. She said she has lost the relationship she knows, but is now focusing on building a new relationship, based on his long term memories. She is helping him by understanding where he is in the disease process, keeping him engaged, because she is able to have a conversation with him about what he is remembering at the time. It is helping her, because she learns something new about him, and she doesn't feel so helpless.  ",

He had all of my scans and reports...He said he would be happy to do chemo in his office, but that the drive may be too much, as he was recommending a very agressive treatment plan. I opted to do the chemo locally and Dr. Wiseman would act as a consultant of sorts, giving his opinions to my local oncologist and seeing me every 4 mionths or so to be sure we were staying on track. It is working out beautifully. What's going on with you? Let me know...I may have some thoughts to share, but I am curious about you first. Oh, by the way...I am being told I am like a miracle child...I would love to share more, but telling my story is exhausting. There is so much. I want to be sure you are up for it before I take the time. It's worth it, I promise, but many folks resist what I tell them and then I am frusterated. So let me know what's going on and if you are the open minded type! I do wish you well!!! Steph",

(That was all they had!!!!) I was medium length and blonde. I wore it to church that night, with my hair tucked under it. Every time I passed a window, I was startled! My husband & I  laughed that some friend would walk up to him and slap his face and accuse him of cheating on me. The next day, we had a shave mom's head party. Too funny. At the first swipe, I was committed. I bought tape. Needs to happen. Just imagine...a sudden burst of wind and the darn thing is in the trees!!! You need to be able to take your hair off. it does get hot, at times but it's not that bad...REALLY. There is a site...wilshire wigs.com that you might look at. If you go to a wig salon, you will pay twice, maybe three times what you will pay wilshire wigs. if you have a wig shop, go in NOW to get your mind wrapped around what you are going to do. A decent synthetic wig will run you around $170.00, but you could pay hundreds. You'll pay around 80 at wilshire, for the salon's 170.00 wig. just get the brand and style name. Set you mind to have fun with this. It is what it is, so just make the best of what you are dealt. i have red, blonde, brown, long, short...depends on my mood and what i am wearing. I know some just opt for the scarves and choose the natural. I took this as an opportunity to be anyone i wanted to be whenever i wanted to be...it. My hair started to grow back in patches. i kept my head shaved until it all started coming in. now my hair is thick as heck. it's only about an inch long, but it is coming in very well.   ",
