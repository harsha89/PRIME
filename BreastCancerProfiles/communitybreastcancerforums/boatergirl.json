The radiologist told me 80% were benign, and I was feeling pretty good about things until reading up on ultrasound findings. I am still trying to be optomistic, but I will feel better knowing what the answers are no matter what. I hope you are doing well. My freind is having her other breast removed in Dec. prophloactically because she is afraid of developing cancer in that breast. She is doing well, but I worry because she had some + nodes. Thanks again for responding. I hope you are doing well",
