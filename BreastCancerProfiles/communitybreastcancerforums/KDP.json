(That was pretty uncomfortable).  But the part I was worred about....needles....was really nothing.  The team who performed my biospies was compassionate, caring and comforting.  I got my results back in two days and both biopsies were benign.  I cannot explain what an incredible gift that feels like.....I am very grateful and I hope everyone that reads this who is going through the same thing, has the same experience I had....and most importantly...the same end result.  By the way.....no real after pain and only some bruising on one side.  I feel very lucky.",
