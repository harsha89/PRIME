I just turned 30 years old,  and I have this weird growth on my breast.  It looks like a big pimple or a boil,  so from my online research I think it is just a skin irriation.  I called by ob/gyn and the secretary told me to get an ultrasound and mamogram done.  I thought the doc would want to see me first.  It makes me wonder if the are just ordering expensive tests to make money.   Is this normal procedure?
