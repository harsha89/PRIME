Obviously I'm thrilled it isn't looking like lung mets as originally suspected but am now wondering what's next. I've got an appointment with a specialist in July but in the meantime would loveto hear about other's experiences. Have you had symptoms? Are you doing any form of treatment? Did your drs think it was related to your breast cancer in anyway or a fully independent dx? Thank you!
