For the last few months, I have had some strange symptoms, in that breast, that I didn't think had anything to do with anything until now.Severe itching and redness (occasionally), soreness, aching pain, zaps of pain, and it feels lumpy in that area; which I thought was scar tissue.I know the best thing to do is to have an exam; but since it was only 1 year since the excision, does this seem normal?

On Jan 3rd my 2 year old scooted up under me as we prepared for bed.  I moved my right breast for fear that she was going to squish it (happened  before!)  When i did, i felt a lump above my areola that resembled a bb. My husband felt it also.  The  following  week I was seen by my Nurse Practitioner .  She measured the lump at 8.5mm x 11mm at 11 oclock and scheduled me for a diagnostic  mammo for 3 days later.  My very first mammo (I'm   36)... ouch!  After,  the  radiologist requested an ultrasound.  The  tech had a hard time keeping the wand on the bb. Once she found  it she went to chat with the radiologist.  He came in and did the ultrasound  himself. He said, there was \"no tail\" (ahh.... ok)...and that he didnt know what it was but that it looked benign. He said \"maybe a fibroadenoma or fatty mass.\" He said a biopsy  was too aggressive  and recommended f/u in 6 months.  I was told the report would go to my doc and i could get a copy from  her.  A few  days later I received  a short letter saying the results were \"probably benign\" and to call to make the appt for f/u.  Ok.... I was still  worried but moved on with life. Today i get a call from  my doc who is sending me to a Breast Specialist!  She said the mammo was normal (because it didnt pick up the bb) but the ultrasound   was abnormal.   Any thoughts? Why a specialist  now?  I thought this was so behind me. Thanks! Log in to post a reply",
