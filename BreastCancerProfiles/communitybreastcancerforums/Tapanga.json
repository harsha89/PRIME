At the time I was just ready to go back to normal even if it meant a tissue expander etc. etc. We let the area heal, then I did radiation. My PS won't try reconstruction again until the new year at the earliest to give the skin the best chance to heal after radiation. I'm using this time to decide whether or not I can live with using a prosthetic. I'm now on the fence about reconstruction, but don't have to make a decision anytime soon and have expressed my reservations about another surgery and the recovery time to my PS. In reality, I wouldn't have the surgery until late next spring thanks to my work schedule. So I think it is OK to be undecided, reconstruction doesn't have to be done right away, but it is an important decision so take your time, ask lots of questions and go with what feels right for you not what other people or society or your doctor says you have to do right now.",
