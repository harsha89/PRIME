They have the pockets that open from the outside and come with forms and stuffing. I also have good friends who have knitted me boobs (very lightweight) for fill and the knitting pattern is available free online. To go out in public, I wear the tank top with the prosthesis, another very stretchy tank top or short sleeve shirt over the top of it that I can get on and off, and a long sleeve button up the front structured shirt that I leave open. Seriously, no one can tell that I only have one boob! Just so you know, the two tank tops were paid for by insurance and insurance is aware that I have Appointments with cosmetic surgeons as I do intend to do a reconstruction on my right side. My bra size was a 34 double D, this means that I am very uneven looking so I'm going to seek reconstruction. Best of luck with everything, this is really really scary for all of us. Feel free to ask any questions that you may have of me. Shawna",
