    "Content": "SouthernJourney wrote: Last week I had my mamo, because of my risks (3 direct female family members with BC one have triple negative invasive ) I pretty much figured I'd get a call back, which I did. I do have a spot I can feel on my inner left breast and I have implants so I have felt safe in assuming it's just some scar tissue. Then the phone calls started coming in. The first one wasn't alarming to me. Just letting me know I have a area of concern on my left breast and need to come in for a comprehensive and US. Inset the appointment and went on about my day. Later that day my letter came stating I was being called back. Once again I wasn't alarmed. Then later in the day a second call came which I chalked up to the first person not getting things right in the computer and the person thinking I wasn't called. But then the next day rolled around (today) and I got 2 calls from the breast center during the day then a automated reminder call. All these calls today have started my mind in a horrible direction. They've made me nervous. I keep trying to remind myself what I told myself last week, it''s some scar tissue or something to do with my implants and it's nothing but after all the calls it's hard to keep focused on thinking it's no big deal. Then.. I had told my husband yesterday I got the call back and would travel again to the breast center this week for more tests. I only told him because I do let him know when I need to go to appointments as I have other chronic health issues and putting together a trip a hour from home takes a plan to be put into place. So today he decided to remind me I have an appointment and he called it the cancer center. They only screen there but I guess he assumed they also did treatments there. His poor choice of words after those calls didn't help ease the anxiety that was building by no means. I just needed to get all this off my chest and have no one I can tell because at this point in time no one in my real world needs to know as to not create panic. My family has a huge history of BV and other cancers so I don't want to alarm any of them. Thanks for letting me vent. Log in to post a reply",
