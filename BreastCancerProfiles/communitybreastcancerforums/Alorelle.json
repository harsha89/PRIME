    "Content": "Alorelle wrote: When I was nineteen, I had a tumor the size of a tennis ball in my neck. I had it removed and they said it didn't look like the cancer spread. I was diagnosed with lymphoma back then and they thought I had beat it. I'm now twenty three and a couple weeks ago bloody discharge started coming from my right breast. My doctor felt two lumps and I am awaiting results back. I'm not scared for me, I'm scared for my Mom because it was so hard for her to go through it the first time. I don't know what to do. I don't want my Mom to cry about this, because she is going through so much with my younger sister. If it turns out to be cancer, I don't know how to break it to her. Log in to post a reply",
