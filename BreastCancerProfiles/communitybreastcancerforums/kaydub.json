How far do you have to travel to get your txs?  How many more do you have? I'm not even sure how many I will get.  I asked the technician and she said that \"33\" was the norm. I didn't see the doc at my simulation.  I start with my block check on Monday and I think I will get the first tx on Tuesday. You are so beautiful in your picture!  Hang in there sweetheart, I have a daughter your age and I'm frightened for her now and always will be.  Love and prayers, Karen ",

So without any unexpected snags, I should be finished on Oct. 28th.  3 days from my 56th birthday.",

I guess it's done differently with each doctor or center. I'm like you, they would not come near my nodes!  I did get marked on my non-cancer side just below my rib cage.  Did anyone else get marked like this? I don't know why, but I'm getting nervous to start my txs next week.  I was scared to death to start chemo but made it through.  I'm sure hoping the radiation is a lot better than going through chemo. I guess this is normal to feel this way.  I know I will be okay...thanks for letting me vent.  You ladies are all awesome and I'm glad to able to share our adventures together.  Hang in there, this too shall pass.  :-) Love and prayers to all, Karen",

MellBell , I have been usingTom's of Maine deoderant and haven't noticed it not working. Others use corn starch but I don't know how well that works.  Diamond Girl, I'm sorry that you had an unpleasant experience with your techs.  I love Dutch Girl's idea about taking in cupcakes.  That would make me less cranky. :)",

I still don't wear an underwire yet.  Maybe after I'm finished up with my radiation treatments I will.  Right after my surgery, I woke up with a heavy duty bra on that hooked up the front.  It covered the whole area very well.  It had velcro straps on the top of it.  They gave me an extra one to take home.  I was not wrapped up or anything.  You will enjoy your reduction and not feel so uncomfortable w/o a bra. Or at least, I didn't.  Always did before. There are no silly questions, you have never done this before.  :)  I will be thinking of you on Tuesday.  Best of luck to you honey....hang in there!",
