Surgery went good but like so many others I am left with pones under my arms and puckers in the middle where the incisions stop. This really bothers me and is sometime painful. The tightness others talk about is there too. My Dr. tells me to give it time. 6 mo. to a year. But afer reading what others wrote, I wonder. I am considering more surgery to get rid of these pones under my arms. Yes I am heavy, about 200lbs and losing. I wore a C cup. But I hope that doesn't mean I have to put up with this from now on. Has anybody had this type of surgery?",

I still have healing to do but so far I am satisfied. from the front I have a scar across my chest. there is some puckering in back but I can live with it. I can wear the prostesis most of the day without any trouble but I understand that I am not completely healed yet. God is good....all the time. Wish you all the best and a Merry Christmas.. by the way, my insurance paid... just so you know..",
