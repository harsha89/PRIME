I met with the RO and am scheduled to start January 8 for 25 days of treatment.  I met with my plastic surgeon the next day and he said to start right away using the cream on my breast.  He said it would reduce the damage to the breast rads cause.  I'm truly hoping it works.  After all the SE I'm going through with Taxol, I don't need any more to deal with!",

Just wondering if anyone else who had bilateral mastectomy and expanders inserted.  My PS said that he liked to wait six months after finishing radiation to do the reconstruction to allow for tissue healing around area radiated.  Anyone?  Would appreciate your input.",

Hole in One:  Bone pain...nasty stuff.  Mine just started about two weeks ago and it's in the hip and knee of my left leg and it just won't quit.  Last night was the first night the pain woke me up from sleep!  I hope mine goes away in another couple of weeks! Smrivr:  The side effects from Taxol have been crazy for me.  I started with a crusty, bloody dry nose.  Then progressed to pain when I urinated and thought it was a UTI but after two samples tested both came back clean and told it was a side effect of the Taxol.  On top of all that, around week 10 of Taxol, I started breaking out in a rash starting on my hands and forearms.  After going to the dermatologist, he took a skin sample and sent it off to see exactly what it was.  The path report came back positive for chemo related rash.  It has just started going away on my hands but it seems to be taking longer on my arms, back and legs.  About two weeks ago, I started have pain in my left leg (hip and knee) - another wonderful side effect from Taxol.  So...today...the nose issues have started to clear up, the pain when going to the bathroom is still around but not as intense, rash is still visible on my arms, back, chest, and legs but getting better, and the leg pain is quite debilitating.  Oh, and also have neuropathy on the bottom of both feet.  Nice. I hope you aren't experiencing any of these but if you do...soldier on, you will get through it!  My mantra has been this whole journey has been \"It is what it is.\"  And...I'm alive to testify!",

Team Kim - I bought the Nutri-Bullit a couple of weeks ago and downloaded a ton of recipes from Pinterest.  I gained 22 lbs. during chemo and need to get that off plus the other pounds I gained from Graves' disease.  My husband and I have been replacing breakfast with a smoothie and eating low carb the other two meals.  I lost 6 lbs. the first week and 2 the second week.  I know it won't be like this the rest of the upcoming weeks but I had to just start somewhere! I've started going from a really nice tan to red and itching but I'm using aloe based gel to cool that down.  One of the ladies who comes in before me brings in a leaf from her aloe plant and uses the gel from the leaf just after her rads.  She said that was all she uses.  Seems to work well for her but to each her own...whatever works is what works!   Welcome Saddlequeen and TB90...this board is packed with really good info and listening ears!  And, congratulations to all of you who have finished with your rads! ",
