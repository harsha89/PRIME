I found this lump under my right arm and called my primary care Dr. she had me come in the next day and befor I left her office I had a ultrasound scheduled the following morning. Ultrasound done and within the hour the radiologist was calling my Dr with what they found. (a questionable palpable nodule under my arm in the axillary gland area) Then she started me on Omnicef anti biotic, I havnt been sick or had any kind of infection. I had a mammogram about 2mths ago and it came back negative. So I see the breast specialist next week on 11/2 to see what he says. Its got me worried now and I have to wait and see what he says, my Mom died this past May and she had a non operable breast cancer. ",
