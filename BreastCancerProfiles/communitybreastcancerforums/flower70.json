      "Content": "flower70 wrote: Hello. I received a call back from my regular screening appointment (3d mammogram) that I needed to schedule ultrasound in both breasts, diagnostic mammogram in both with spot compression in right breast. This is the 3rd time I have been called back after regular screenings. I'm tired of this. I had my1st mammogram in my late thirties, which came back normal. My second and 3rd both came back abnormal. Had additional tests with end results both times being cyst in right breast. They never did the needle confirmation (even tho I wanted it). Now I am getting called back again (4th mammogram). It's been 3years instead of my normal annual because I didn't have insurance for a few years. I insisted on the 3D this time because I have dense breasts and thought it would avoid an unnecessary call back. Still got a call back. Right breast - Asymmetry 4millimeters with \u201cassociated punctate calcifications\" anterior outer region, 2 centimeters from nipple. Left breast - Focal asymmetry - posterior region 3 o'clock 6 centimeters from nipple. I have to wait 2weeks for my ultrasounds and diagnostics. This waiting is really nerve wrecking and I was wondering if anyone has had this type or similar findings on here. It worries me most because I have dense breasts and have always had conventional mammograms until now. Could something have been missed in previous ones? Sorry to ramble, just worried. Any feedback would be appreciated. Thanks Log in to post a reply",

I was extra scared because I hadn\u2019t had my last one in 3 years. I just had my ultrasounds and diagnostic this morning-after the agonizing 2week wait lol. They said it doesn\u2019t appear suspicious-no biopsy recommended (now). Appear to be cysts. Said to follow up with my Dr. So relieved! Although I am tired of getting these callbacks every time and want to have a 100% confirmation on this. I\u2019m bothered by not knowing for sure. My husband wants me to demand needle biopsy or some kind of test guaranteeing no cancer. I already called my Dr office and they said she will call me when results are sent over to discuss more. Hang in there. Most come back benign üôèüèª üòä  ",
