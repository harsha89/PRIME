They said that my breasts were very dense which is down to my age as I'm only 22 but could not tell me what the lump actually was and said that they were not concerned with it but to come back if it didn't go. The lump is still there and now my right armpit has become swollen no lumps just swollen. It's not painful but sort of feels like it aches sometimes if that makes sense. I know that your lymph nodes can become swollen if you have a cold or something but I haven't been ill recently and it's been swollen for about 4 months now. I don't know whether I should be worried or not, or if I'm just overthinking?? Please advise. ThanksÂ  Log in to post a reply",
