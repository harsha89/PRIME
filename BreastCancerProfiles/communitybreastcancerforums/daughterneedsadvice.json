She had a single mastectomy and chemo. 5 years later, cancer was found in her remaining breast. Again, she underwent a mastectomy, chemo and radiation. One year after radiation, it was discovered the cancer had spread to her lungs.Â She was put on a pill form of chemo for three months. She had another scan and got the results yesterday...it didn't work. Her tumors have grown and now there is a small spot on her liver. Her doctor told her she needs to have weekly chemo treatments (three weeks on, one week off) for three months, then reevaluate. If that doesn't work, there is another kind and then another kind that doctors have been seeing good results with. Her question to me last night was--do I go through all of that again OR do I follow an extremely healthly lifestyle with plenty of exercise? I don't know how to answer that. She is my mom...I want her to do EVERYTHING in her power to fight it, but I'm not the one who has to go through the pain. Has anyone had any success with alternative medicine?? She's worried about the chemo knocking down her immune system and preventing her body from fighting effectively. Log in to post a reply",
