      "Content": "luvmimom wrote: Hello ~ my mom was diagnosed stage IV one year ago last December. All they were able to find was small mets in her pleura and she presented with a plueral effusion. She has been on hormonals for one year and has been doing well. She started with 3 months of Xeloda but went on a break due to weight loss and fluid gain in the legs, tried the hormonal, and the hormonal ended up working better for her. The effusion resolved. She had a bone scan at diagnosis, some imaging of her lungs but that's about it. No PET scan. She was diagnosed Stage 1, I believe, 15 years prior to the Stage IV diagnosis. I think she is ER+/PR+ HER- She's had abdominal discomfort for about 3 weeks now and went to see her PCP. They ordered an MRI and called her in today to OBGYN to explain to her that she has a large cyst on one ovary, some fluid buildup around one ovary, something they can't tell what it is beside one of the ovaries, and that her ovaries \"did not look quite right\"--that's what I got from her translation of the appt today. They are doing some more blood tests and deciding where to send her to surgery so she can have her ovaries removed and I guess, biopsied. So, we don't know if this is a new cancer (ovarian?) or mets yet of course. I just don't know what questions I should be asking. The OBGYNs will handle the surgery, and her ONC will be informed of findings if needed. I guess I am just asking if anyone has had experience with this ~ ovarian mets, or fluid around the ovary, and are there other treatments they can try? I think it's a little weird that they do not do more imaging on her ~ check her liver, etc. Does anyone else here go to Kaiser Northern California? I think Kaiser does not believe in a lot of imaging. Are there questions we should be asking the surgeon? Drs? Anyway, aside from the concern that it's cancer, she's also in a lot of pain. Not too bloated but the Dr said the fluid is sloshing up against the bowel making things uncomfortable. Thanks so much and happy new year to you all! Log in to post a reply",

There are plenty of options if it is a brain met but don't go there yet.

She took at one cyst and saw it was a cyst, then she took a look at another section where she felt a tiny lump and said it's sending an echo back like a cyst but from one angle it looks triangular maybe. But she's not a radiologist. Is this wise to get these ultrasounds done in office. Does it cause more worry then good? Because now I am freaked out. One minute she was reassuring, the next not so much, then she said 95% of patients she sends to radiology come back with benign conditions. I've never had this done in office before, but she's new so I was curious. I go for a follow up MRI and ultrasound next week. Log in to post a reply",

If this ends up benign definately brings up an important point about too much info in the drs office. The nurse practitioner she replaced did breast care for years, was on the tumor board, and always just sent me to imaging when she felt something. My mom died of ILC so I'm extra anxious. She said it was small, 2mm, similar to a cyst, but somewhat of a triangle shape, in an area of increased density on mammo (which us why she was extra cautious in that area) and if it were cancer would be invasive and not in situ... but could be cyst or complex cyst. My head spun. Looked like a round cyst to me, but at one angle it did have a sharp edge. Anyway, I think its best to ask to go straight to the experts next time. That said, if she's found early cancer by being extra vigilant I will be singing her praises no doubt. I can't feel the lump she felt ... she said no one would have felt it in a regular breast exam. And my mammo 3 months ago came back ok. Even the dense part. We shall see.",

I want to thank you all. This is the only place I have gone to learn and your strength and courage is inspiring. I share some of your stories with my mom as she is not ready to jump online quite yet. Mom was diagnosed with a malignant pleural effusion a few weeks ago. Her cancer is HE+ There appear to be no tumors in her lungs, liver and her bone scan was clean. Her oncologist suspects there are little \"active spots\" on the plueral lining that are causing the irritation which leads to the effusion that he saw on the MRI. Her pulmonologist disagrees and does not think it is cancer. They did not do a PET scan. Of course since there are cancer cells in the lung the onc told her she was a stage 4. She started chemo Monday with the hopes that the effusion will clear up over time and in 4-6 months she can switch to hormone treatment and keep the cancer under control for awhile. He has not talked to her in great detail about a prognosis. My mom is 69. I love her so much. What can I do for her at this point? I feel like I don't know what to say or not to say. I just want to be there for her. Also, has anyone had any experience with plueral effusions? And, if anyone is in CA, has anyone had experience being treated at Kaiser Permanente? I've been a member for a decade, they are new to the HMO and any advice would be great. Thanks so much for being here. God Bless ~ Log in to post a reply",

I gained so much knowledge from all of your experiences that I was able to really help my mom make choices about her treatment, and understand what she was experiencing--especially with her ILC abdominal mets. We would have been lost without you all. I thank you from the bottom of my heart. I will share what I posted on Facebook yesterday. We are going to write her obituary this weekend. I do reference \"journey\" in the beginning, and I've just read through the thread of how offensive that word can be to some. I am having a hard time coming up with the right word. She was diagnosed Stage II fifteen years ago and Stage IV almost three years ago. I wanted people to understand that it was not a battle those 18 years, or even every day the last three years . . . but once diagnosed 18 years ago at an early stage, it never left her thoughts or life. And I wanted people to every understand that it comes back. It lays in wait for years. She did everything \"right\" Mammograms every year, follow up year since her original diagnosis, etc and she still died of this wretched horrid disease. In some ways it was a journey for her--a change in her perspective on life. She was so brave, but also disappointed and afraid. Who wouldn't be? She loved us all so much. I miss her so much. Here it goes: It's with a heavy heart that I write my dear mother Pat passed away Wednesday morning after an 18 year journey with breast cancer. She died peacefully in the arms of her husband of nearly 50 years. It seems strange to use \"cancer\" and \"peaceful\" in the same paragraph. There is nothing really peaceful about cancer. She loved her family and those close to her with all her heart. She gave and gave to us every day--whether it was a shopping trip, a home cooked meal, or one of her many hand crafted cards. The void left by her passing is immediately present. She was so stoic, and even in the end when she decided to no longer treat her progressing disease, she fought for life. She accepted her death, but was brave enough to express the disappointment of leaving her family behind. She loved her two grandchildren--my children--with all her heart and it broke her heart to leave them, as well as my father. My heart grieves for my children who are only 2 1/2 and 5. They lost a one-of-a-kind grandmother too early. It just does not feel fair. It's not fair. It never is. Many of you have met my mother through the years. I thank those who have already sent their condolences. I just ask if you read this, please take a moment today to do something really nice for someone you love. Buy them a special gift. Take them out for coffee. Tell them how much you love them and how important they are to you. Sent them a hand written letter explaining how lovely the view  is out your window. May be try making the card yourself! You may be the only person that does something really special for someone today. It matters. We are left heartbroken, but are comforted by all the memories. Love is eternal. I love you mom.   Log in to post a reply",

Looked at my mom's original mastectomy records from 1997 and she actually had ILC, so the metastisis in this area makes sense, although her MO told her on the phone this morning that getting it in these areas was rare (I thought she had IDC) She has a great MO. Called this morning himself just to check on how she is feeling and can he prescribe anything for her symptoms. He wants her to recover for 2x weeks then they will put her treatment plan together. Hopefully we can get some shrinkage of that cancer in the abdomen so it stops twisting her bowel.",
