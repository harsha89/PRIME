I did get some blistering under my breast during my last week of full-breast rads, but once the boosts started, that cleared up quickly. Aquaphor is my new bestie. I've had no real fatigue. I do need a 20 min. nap in the afternoons or I get grumpy, but nothing debilitating. Kelly, mine is on the left as well, but I didn't need to do the breathing thing. That must be so difficult.

I have to think we'll come out on the other end as stronger, wiser, and happier women. I had a follow-up with my RO and my MO this week. My RO is concerned with my \"positive\" attitude. He seems to think I'm repressing my true feelings because I'm always upbeat. He thinks it's a sign of depression. Seriously??? He didn't see my August breakdown, when this adventure began . Once I was able to absorb what was happening, and I knew where I stood, I decided I would not give BC any more attention or energy than it deserved. I refuse to let it change my outlook. I really believe the adage \"it's not what happens to you, it's how you choose to react to it\" is the secret. Enjoy your day, everyone. I'm off to work on a baby quilt that has to be done in a week.

For me, this has all been uneventful so far. The thought of recurrence is always just under the surface, and will probably be with me for life, but I have faith that the Tamoxifen will keep any repeat at bay. I remember my breast surgeon telling me that I will die from something someday but it certainly won't be from DCIS. I wish you the best as you go through your treatments, whatever they may be.

I was told by my BS and my RO that rads would be uneventful and would kill off any stray DCIS cells that may have escaped during biopsy and/or surgery. I was all for killing off the little bastards and went into treatment with a \"kill 'em attitude\". I hope we clobbered them good. Fortunately, my SEs were mild. Just a little \"sunburn\" , and no fatigue to speak of. Now-I have to decide about Tamoxifen. MO says I don't need it but I am 100% ER and PR + and that makes me nervous. I'm going to discuss Evista with her at my appt in a couple of weeks. It blocks hormones and has fewer SEs. I don't understand how some people can be so cruel and insensitive, but I do believe in Karma. The \"boss\" is ignorant, and may just believe cancer is catching. Probably just scared.....or a moron. She certainly does not have the qualities that make a good leader. Wench!!! The husband-well he's just a rat-bastard. I don't have kids, but I do have a rat-bastard of my very own. I played nice for 15 years, then left his hairy behind in the frozen tundra of northern MN and never looked back. It's awesome to be able to come here and meet with others in the same boat as we are. I live with my sister, and although we are close, she is not someone I can talk to about this adventure. Her husband died from cancer 20 years ago and she has built up such a wall that she struggles to be able to talk about this with me. Thanks for the ear. Keep warm. Bless you all. ",
