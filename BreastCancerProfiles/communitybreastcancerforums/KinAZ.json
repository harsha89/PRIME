A year later I had diep reconstruction, and had problems on the other foob,,,wound would not heal, had to have my dh and cousin pack it for me and ended up with a wound vac which helped a great deal, although it was cumbersome and downright annoying it helped me heal.....Our bodies go through so much, and sometimes it takes longer to heal than we think it should.....I thought it would never end but it did....just hang in there.  I know how difficult it can be, and I am sorry your having such a tough time.

Sounds like a long hot summer ahead.  Dont know if I want a wig or not.... maybe better to get it and not use it, than to want it and not have it.  Nothing is easy about any of this. I am glad to have all of you here, altho I wish none of use were here!  Have a good weekend Karen",
