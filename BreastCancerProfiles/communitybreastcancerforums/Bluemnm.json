They have both had their own cancers (dad still does) and they have already had to bury my sister who was killed by a drunk driver when she was 26. I worry about who will take care of them, I have siblings but they are both busy with their kids and such. 2. My husband, although we have been married since 2008 he was deployed for almost 3 years total of the time we have been married. It still feels like we are newlyweds and I want more time to spend with him and travel, etc. We just bought a house last year and it seems like our life was just starting. I love him so much. 3. My nieces and nephews. I have 11 nieces and nephews that I am very close to, they are such good kids. My oldest nephew lived with me some after my sister died, so he is like a son to me. 4. My younger sister. When we were younger we didn't get along, but over the past few years we have become closer. She just got engaged and I want to be around for her wedding. 5. There are still many places I want to see and things I want to do!",

It is very helpful for discussions with your onc. In regards to travel I have taken many trips since my diagnosis, I just got back from an anniversary trip to vegas/grand canyon.
