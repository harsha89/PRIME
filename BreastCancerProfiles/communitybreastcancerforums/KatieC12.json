It will mean using more of my sick time than I wanted, and more gas to get to work, then the Centre, then back to work, then home. My arm was definitely numb by the time we finished, but they have a light that has a very nice magnolia tree in bloom with a blue sky and fluffy clouds on the ceiling. CAS4, keep working on Miss Pissy - I'll bet by the end of it you get her to smile. And I love my chiro - if my spasms don't go away he'll be seeing me soon. Sorry about the delay Gongshow, I know how much I wanted to just get on with this. And I just realized they didn't use a sharpie on me at all, so I guess the tattoos were good and the techs had great eyesight!",

I suppose some people think that wall of bras is inspiring, it sounds a bit bizarre to me. I saw my RO today, he recommended cortisone cream for the rash I started to get last Friday, I don't want to go around scratching my chest! He said it might get worse over the next week or two before it gets better. Only one more treatment, tomorrow morning. I can't think what I'll do with myself when it's over.",

My favourite techs were there today, which made it especially nice. They did however shift me right left and centre - I told them the next generation of radiation machines should be able to shift like a goose neck lamp, to avoid the techs having to shift the patient. I'm very grateful my cancer was caught so early - in fact, last year the breast screening clinic told me I could drop back to once every two years, but I asked to stay at once a year given my family history. My great-grandmother, my grandmother, my great aunt, my aunt, several second cousins and now me. If I'd not asked to stay on the once a year schedule, who knows what could have happened by next summer. I know I was lucky to have fewer treatments than so many here. I just think we should forgive ourselves our meltdowns and allow ourselves the very occasional pity party. I found myself a bit snarly last week, this week is better, I'm starting to get out the Christmas decorations. Blessings to all.",

The first two days this week I get to go to work, leave at lunch time, drive to the clinic, and then go back to work. Not real thrilled about that, but if that's the only thing bothering me then I guess I'm lucky.

I did have shooting pains for the first few weeks after the lumpectomy, but can't say I've had them since. I do have a little tenderness in the muscle under the arm that's new, and I did have severe tenderness at the top inside of my arm after the surgery, but thankfully it's pretty much gone now. My sleep is a bit restless and I'm thinking of bringing up the vaporizer into the bedroom. I hope you can get some rest.",

Yesterday I considered leaving an hour early but talked myself out of it. I find the most irritating thing is being shifted around in the set up. When they try to shift my body a little to the left or right, I think their method shifts the bones but leaves the skin where it was because they use the sheet to roll me. My skin doesn't move on it although the rest of my body might. Does that make sense?",
