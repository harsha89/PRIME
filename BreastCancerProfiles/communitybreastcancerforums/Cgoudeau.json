    "Content": "Cgoudeau wrote: I just found out this week that I have the BRCA 2 gene. I am an optimistic person by nature, so I had convinced myself that I didn't have it - needless to say, I was in shock when the test proved me wrong. I have an extremely supportive family, but I feel quite alone in this decision making process. I thought I knew what I would do, but all of that has changed now that I'm faced with the reality of removing healthy tissue as a preventative measure. I'm also feeling rushed somewhat by my schedule. I'm a teacher, and I'm feeling like I need to do something about this during the summer. I don't think I can live with the worry the whole school year, so I feel like I need to act now. I am 42, healthy, already had my three children, and I have an extremely supportive husband. So, I'm thinking this should be easier to make this decision, since i don't need the parts anymore. I've never had one surgery in my life! I'd appreciate any advice that comes my way. I'm also hoping to hear from someone who's been in my situation and can relate so that I don't feel so alone. Log in to post a reply",
