My breasts are small, no extra fat, and the tumor & two attched lobes he removed were in my chest wall. (taking up a lot of room) He got good margins on sides but on the top it was right up to my skin. And evidentally he feels he needs to get back in there, clean up. He meets with *the team* on Tuesday & will call me with their suggestions. But he & I both feel ok about the second surgery. So I think it's a go. It will delay chemo by 2-4 weeks. Have many of you been back fro second surgeries within  couple weeks of the first? I was half prepared for a second surgery, just from my research.

I had my initial surgery, lumpectomy & node removal (14 out, 2 cancerous) end of August. Didn't get clear margins so started chemo in Sept. A&C for 2 months then 12 weekly does of Taxol (with Herceptin that goes til Dec) I had good days & bad days, some times I thought it was doable other times I thought the side effects were just never ending. I finished chemo in Feb & had a BMX March 13. (no recon) Plus an unexpected bleed the next day & pretty much grew a new boob on 20 minutes, totally filled with clots. So back to the OR.  I go Friday for my rad dry run & start radiation on Monday. I don't plan to have recon, not saying I never will but I know the failure rate is high & at this time I don't want anymore pain, discomfort, surgeries or hospital stays.",

Ya know, that old \"it is what it is\". I don't like what I see in the mirror naked. Specially now with my chest burned to a crisp & peeling & leathery from rads. I don't like how my sternum sticks out like a skinny old chicken & both my sides cave in. But with my little soft foobs in my stretch bra I looked just as I did before when I am dressed.  Maybe this is a good time to seek help from a therapist. Maybe it isn't the actual loss of nipples that is bothering you. Perhaps it is more but right now that is your focus?  All the best to you.",
