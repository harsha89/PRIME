      "Content": "cdeefox wrote: I had idc last October-1.2 cm. lumpectomy, rads, and have been taking Arimedex since January. Two weeks ago, noticed a small hard pea size lump at my incision site (slightly above.) Radiologist did ultrasound, and said it was not in breast cancer, but in the skin. Today I saw my surgeon, who is removing it within a few days. He disagrees with my radiologist and says it is in the breast tissue. I am scared to death. I don't know what to expect. I asked if it is malignant will I need to have a mastectomy and he said no. But I know that is your only option after radiation treatments. Surgeon says it could just be a reaction to the lumpectomy surgery. Has anyone been through this? I was just getting my life back together. I am feeling devistated and am praying it will be benign.

Just wanted to let you all know that the tiny lump was removed and it was benign. I was so panicked at the thought of the \"beast\" returning, and was reassured by many of you that it probably was scar tissue, or something resulting from the previous lumpectomy. It was, and I don't know how to thank you all. I just hope I can be of help to someone as well. Thanks for being there for me!!",

Went to the radiologist who did an ultrasound, and said it appeared to be in the skin, not the breast tissue. Today, I saw my surgeon, who said it is in the tissue, not skin, and is scheduling surgery immediately to remove it. I am so frightened, and depressed that the nightmare of being diagnosed with a new cancer is looming. Please give me any feedback you might have. I keep hoping this is just something from the surgery. When I asked, my doctor said it could just be a reaction to it. I didn't really try to have him clarify the statement, as I was still in shock that he felt it should come out. Has anyone out there had a similar experience, and what was the outcome. Thanks for any help you can give me. I am up worrying and scared tonight, because I was just beginning to believe I was going to be fine, and now, I'm not sure. Log in to post a reply",
