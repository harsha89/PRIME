That is extra skin they leave in case you change your mind. I went to MSK in NYC. I do not regret the decision. Ask to see their other patients\u2019 fotos. Emphasize you do not want to be concave. That depends on the first surgeon and the extent of the cancer spread within the tissues and chest cavities. You will have a pot belly which you can reduce with leg lifts while lying down on your back. Do that for two months then do crunches for two months. I use resistance bands and bend forward at the waist. Do this for a set of 10 3x then work up to 6x. When you build the strength do free weights. After 6 months you will feel better about your body with exercise. Trust me. Tell the surgeon that with exercise you want to build your chest muscles. Recovery is faster with PT and you will have full range of motion. If you have a problem reach out to flat closure a community of flattoppers or women who went flat. Most surgeons want to give women implants but at least 45% of women opt for no reconstruction. Also reconstruction is not like a breast augmentation. You will have scars. One breast may be bigger than the other. Due to the implant being placed under your pec muscle it will affect your neck, shoulders and back. If you work out hard your pec can distort the implant. I hope this helped. Q",
