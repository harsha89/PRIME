My first one was a piece of cake. The surgeon inserted a needle to numb the breast which burned a little but was not bad at all. I did not feel any pain. Trying to lie still and not squirm was the biggest challenge The second biopsy was a little trickier. The microcalcifications were very close to the chest wall so it was difficult for the tech to get the image of where the microcalcifications were. After several pictures and many uncomfortable position changes she finally got it I did feel the last needle punch this time.... Not pleasant but bearable. I think the last punch was closest to the chest wall so this area wasn't as numb as the rest of the breast. You will be a little sore and bruised after. Ice packs help. I took ibuprofen for pain. I didn't have any activity restrictions the next day.... Just no running for a week or 2. My first biopsy was benign. The second showed 'flat epithelial atypia' and I ended up having a surgical biopsy of the same area. The path report from the surgical biopsy was normal. Both of my diagnostic mammograms were classified as bi-rad 4 for clusters of microcalcifications. I also had larger calcifications which my radiologist said were normal. He was more concerned about the pattern of the microcalcifications. I will echo previous posters in saying that biopsies for calcifications often end up being benign. Good luck to you!",

I have had several breast biopsies for microcalcifications which are different... The radiologist explained to me that calcifications that look more like cotton balls on the mammogram picture are not a red flag and microcalcifications that look like dark specs are more of concern....especially if they cluster in a tight pattern. But even those are more often benign. Bi rad3 is a good thing. If the radiologist really had a concern she would have classified you as Bi rad 4 and recommended a biopsy. If you are really concerned get another mammo in 6 month and get a clinical breast exam.",
