      "Content": "May 15, 2019 02:23PM - edited May 16, 2019 07:10PM by Olma61 After my initial mammo, ultrasound and biopsy I was diagnosed Stage 2. The plan was neo-adjuvant chemo, lumpectomy and maybe radiation. An MRI revealed a suspicious looking spot on my lung so I had a PET-CTscan. Lung spot turned out to be nothing, but I was diagnosed with bone mets and Stage IV. So I started chemo as Stage IV and my MO told me \"no surgery\". I was insisting I wanted this lump out of me and could not understand why cutting it out would not be helpful, but she was completely against any surgery at that point. Fast forward, chemo & targeted therapy have made my breast lump & one lymph node lesion completely undetectable. Doctor doesn't use the term \"oligometastasis\" with me but I guess I am, with bone only mets and currently only one active spot on the bone, that will be radiated. I have not brought up surgery again and really, I am not sure I would even want a mastectomy because I might be creating more problems for myself...but I am not sure. I do see that in some recent studies, women who've had surgery seem to have a slight edge in overall survival. Although older studies claimed no benefit... If I could have say, an excisional biopsy, where they could really tell my breast was cancer free...I would like that, but who knows if any doctor would even do that. Can't call it a lumpectomy, there is no more lump! And I don't know, but I suspect, the only surgery that WOULD be considered for Stage IV is mastectomy. This is a great question, KelQ. Would love to see more replies.",

She said \"probably every 9 weeks\" but I think I'm going to ask to go back to every 6 weeks if not monthly for awhile. As for side effects, I haven't experienced any. I've had dental work but not invasive dental work. Just fillings and a crown replaced. My dentist said fillings would not be a problem. The shot doesn't really hurt me going in but I'm good at dissociating when I'm being stuck. : ) Never noticed a burn. Lately, I have felt twinges in my jaw though. Not sure what it's about, my mouth is kind of a mess as I had to have three back teeth yanked (bridge failed) before chemo started and can't do anything to replace them yet due to XGEVA.",

It is definitely something you can talk to your doctor about. In my case, I got it monthly for 6 months while I was on weekly Taxol. After that was finished, I was only coming to the infusion center every three weeks for Herceptin & Perjeta, so the doctor switched me to Xgeva every 6 weeks instead of monthly. Then, six months later (12 months of Xgeva total at that point) she put me on quarterly Xgeva shots. That was November 2018 - but in April I had a pet scan and a spine met is active again. We are going to be switching back to Xgeva every six weeks. I do think the reason many docs are lessening the frequency after a period of time is to avoid ONJ or other side effects.",

I had no idea anything was wrong or that I had bone mets the whole time, including in the lumbar spine. I was walking, doing treadmill, elliptical and weights at least three times per week the entire 7 months. No adverse events. After I was diagnosed, I continued walking and doing light weights for both upper and lower body. Still no adverse events. Was never told not to exercise, in fact, was encouraged to do so by the onc, just like you were. I had lost 50 pounds by the time I was diagnosed, lost 20 more while in treatment but have gained back 15 since going on hormone therapy. Now trying to get back on the exercise train that I fell off in December 18. Walking and other low impact should be fine. Swimming and water aerobics might be good too, if you have access to a pool. Since you like to work out at home, Leslie Sansone has \"Walk Away The Pounds\" videos, which are very low impact and tailored to beginners, elderly and people with limitations. My cancer center has a fitness center and offered a three month cancer exercise program at no cost that I took advantage of. There, I got an evaluation and a safe exercise program (which included the treadmill and some strength training with bands plus flexibility and balance exercises). There are also free yoga classes but I have not done those yet. Another resource is the Live Strong cancer program which is offered free at some YMCAs around the country. Here is the locator for the Livestrong programs https://www.livestrong.org/ymca-search The advantage with the instructor led programs is they can give you a safe program that works within your limitations and they will give you a print out so you can work the program at home. Good luck!",

I stuck to my diet and exercise (and ate less due to anxiety) while on chemo and took off another ten pounds. I had about 20 lbs to go to reach a 25 bmi. Went on Arimidex a year ago, slacked off on exercise, ate more and gained 15 pounds back. I am now making a serious effort to take it off. I went back to tracking with My Fitness Pal, ***trying*** to get back on track with exercise, cut back on calories & got rid of \"keto\" food that was really just over indulgence. I may have lost two pounds this week :D I say may because the scale fluctuates but I've had some lower days this week. I had started my big weight loss with Nutrisystem but I did plateau after about 25 lbs. Also afraid to go back to NS because it's all process food with a lot of soy protein. But the portion control helped immensely with getting started. After NS, I just counted calories using My Fitness Pal to track and stepped up my exercise to at least 30 minutes walking a day, with some weight training and machines at the gym when I could. Really hoping I can at least get these 15 off and after that, maybe eventually get back to a 25 bmi.",

This regimen had very good results in the recent CLEOPATRA study. I do have a thought on your question - when you had Taxotere, was it dose dense taxotere delivered every three weeks? If so, the CLEOPATRA regimen with weekly Taxol would be a lower dose, more frequently so perhaps would be less likely to trigger an allergic reaction. You might also be able to get an anti allergy med to use that would help? Obviously these are things you can discuss with your doctor. The CLEOPATRA regimen got me to NED, my breast tumor can no longer be detected on PET scans , so I am a big fan of that one. But a serious allergic reaction like you had might not make it the best choice for you. How risky does your doctor think it will be",
