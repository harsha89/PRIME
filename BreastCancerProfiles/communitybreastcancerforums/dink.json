LOL I also bought the coffee mugs for us to have hot chocalate - the grownups and then to the Hallmark store and bought decorative glasses for a punch that my sister-in-law used to make at Christmas time - I'll have to get the recipe from her.  For some reason, I'm so excited about Christmas and I don't even know why.  This year we decided to take each of the couple (my son and his fiancee then my daughter and her spouse) out for a full day and buy their Christmas with them and eat out and do just what they want to do - one couple at a time.  We would Christmas for the children themselves and of course each couple have their smalles babies: Molly for my son and peaches for my daughter and they get their first Christmas steaks and toys as well as their chew snacks.  Molly is a little Yorky - I think and Lacey is a little Lasa Opsa.  Cathi, my daughter has begged my husband to put up the outside lights and he has refused since his mother died of lung cancer two years ago.  I think is going to this year because I bought the deer, outside Christmas tree and K-Mart had two different sets of outside presents and my daughter and I mixed and matched them so we both have square packages and round ones.  I can't wait.  I think I'm getting into the Christmas and Thanksgiving excitement.  It's been a while.  I'm sorry about all the little animals that have been sick or lost.  I know how important they are to all of us.  I hope everyone is ok.

HA! is a colonoscopy the day before my 45th birthday.  Life is wonderful.  No I really feel fine about all of this and all will be well.  Today my smallest grandson turned 2 and he is totally an awesome little guy.  My dad will be 67 tomorrow.  We will be having everyone over tomorrow for a birthday party.  I'm not sure if I'm ready - I'll be even more tired but I love to watch him because he is so happy about eveything and never walks- he's either running, skipping or jumping wherever he goes.

Shirlann, i know how frustrating it is to repeat visits to the doctor and they look at you like they aren't sure of anything.  A lot of time, depending on the physician, they aren't sure why they called you back.  I have learned why they do things the way they do.  I was used to seeing patients in the ER/Trauma Center and we weren't worried so much about the money but in the clinic world, you have to be concerned about money.  In the ER we let everyone else worry about the money portion and we worried about the patient.  I am now working for two physicians and running their Surgery Center.  They are so different from any other doctor I know.  They see people with and without insurance.  They don't care, their whole lives are surrounded by their patients.  They see up to 115 to 120 patients a day.  It's amazing.  They come to the surgery center and they pay what they can and a lot of times that's it.  The good Lord has really blessed them with their clinics and surgery center.  I'm fortunate to have them as a boss.  Sue, I'm sorry you are feeling a little low about being here on the site.  It's great to hear from you.

Lisa - I am so proud of you and for you.  You go girl.  Have fun and live it up. Mel- you are so great and have great words of wisdom and comfort.  I love the pictures and they are so appropriate with what is going on at the time. Love to you all, Leesa ",

Hugs to all and please know you are all in my prayers. Leesa",

Lisa, I went back and read some posts to catch up on things today, I am sorry to hear about your girls and your X-MIL.  I am hoping and praying for things to go better and the girls are handling things better.  I know when my MIL died three years ago, my DD would stay at her SO's house so she would not see my MIL in so much pain or see her while she was so sick.  My daughter was extremely close to my MIL and couldn't handle it.  She was the most important person besides my husband in my MIL's life.  The sun rose and set in my DD according to my MIL.  I was angy at my DD for that but I had to understand that was her way of dealing with the situation.  What did make me angry was,  my MIL told my DD where all the important papers were, the clothes she would like to be buried in, and my DD knew her the best, her favorite this and that.  When it came time for the funeral, any suggestions she made or anything she would say my MIL wanted they would total ignore her and sent her out of the room.  My husband was in shock, he felt guilty for not being there more while his mother was dealing with cancer because they live 650 miles away from us.  I still have resentment towards my SIL about the way my daughter was treated but I guess she felt she was just in what went on because of my daughter's actions then at the time of her death my DD all of a sudden was right there.  Now my DD is so possessive of my FIL that she knows when is does or is going to do everything.  Sometimes you just have to only be supportive, give them their space to deal with the existing situation and be there with your arms held out and support them in any way you can..  They will always come back to momma no matter how mean or what they do.  That is our job as mothers, to love unconditionally, support no matter what, and to pick up the pieces when the SH_T hits the fan.  You are truly a great lady and I admire you for standing up and letting them make their decisions but reminding them that you are their mother and you are not to be disrepected.  You are awesome.

Thanksgiving was great here.  The kids and grandkids came and went as they pleased.  I went Christmas shopping all by myself on Friday which I haven't done in many years.  I went by my son's house and his fiance wanted to go shopping again so we did.  We went back to his house and her mom wanted to go shopping so we did.  I shopped 12 hours and the only time I sate down was in the car but it was truly great.  I am trying to loose weight and really feel down on myself (due to my size and looks).  Kim, my son's fiance's mom, took me to Victoria's Secret and made me buy something for me and no one else.  She said \\, \"sometimes you have to do things for yourself and accept yourself the way you are at this time whether anyone else does or not and once you do it is amazing but the weight starts dropping. I'm waiting because by the time I left the store I had spent $100.71 on myself which hasn't been done in years and it was great.  I even thought of taking it all back but I haven't yet. LOL.  I really need prayers and support in this area of loosing weight because it is affecting my outlook on life a little.  I need to loose about 60 pounds. Cathi, I am praying for you, Amanda and baby Ella.  Lisa, I'm glad you are having a wonderful time. Don and I are to go to Florida for the two oldest grandkids trip to Disney World.  I'm not sure if I am going because I have too much work to do and because I have goten so big it gets hard to walk and not swell bigger.  I am still having a hard time with my right arm and went to see another doctor for the pain.  The new doctor decided it wasn't tendonitis but something with the nerves and wants to have my PCP send me to a specialist.  THere are times that I wish I could just cut it off but that won't happen. I hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving weekend.  I'm a little tired from the shopping on Friday. LOL",

(i'm a nurse so when I saw something strange I asked and they couldn't hide it from because I already saw the screen or the x-ray.  Any way over the years, the cysts multiplied (from a c bra cup on the right to an E size cup and the left breast C cup to DD).  The new study out for women with known breast cancers in the family history and someone with cysts like mine, they do an MRI.  The only problem with an MRI is \"it throws up too many flags\"  it's hard to tell sometimes the difference between cyst and masses.  I have several biopsies all of which were negative.  I've had atypical hyperplasia cells during this whole time.There was an area on the MRI that really concerned the doctors so they did a surggical biopsy.  My doctor is very thorough and he got some extra tissue and that was where the DIC was found with atypical hyperplasia cells.  They originally told me everything looked negative because it was an aginoma sitting in a solid cyst.  I was told I would never get any kind of breast cancer because it is all on my dad's side. HHHMMMMM.  I had radiation and worked then I started developin the cysts again especially in the left breast and had to have another biopsy - atypical hyperplasia cells.  I didn't want the gene test because of insurance payments.  We did all the tests as if I carried the gene they were all elevated but have come back down to normal.  I had bilateral mastectomies with reconstruction and still going through that and now have develope anemia and problems with my stomach.  I'm doing the gene testing November 25 at my doctor's request.  The genetic consultant was wonderful.  I am more tired now than I've ever been.  What does all this mean to me?  Only God knows what we will or do have.  It's up to us to be pro-active and take care of ourselves and our families.  As one of the other ladies said \"Knowledge is Power.  I hope you are all ok and remeber the saying, God doesn't give us more than we can handle.  Just think if it was someone else going through this that couldn't handle it.",

Mel  you are so smart and your true feeling come out in your writings.  You are a great friend.  I wish you lived closer to here. (Texas). I need a few prayers if any of you have any prayers left.  I am starting my reconstruction over on May 21, my center will have a big accreditation survey between now and the time I have surgery. If we fail the accreditation, I may not have a job.  please help me out here, I'm panicking.  Also, I have been asked to be the second grade coordinator and a member of the Fall Festival for 2009/2010 year.  I have never done this before so this is stressing me a little also.  Oh by the way ladies I havemy wine at my side.  Oh an up-date on my right arm from just above the elbow doen to the middle of the forearm has been hurting so bad.  I have been seeing a rhuematologist and yesterday he decided to put a steroid shot in my elbow.  He used the sonogram machine to see where to stick the needle and he showed me my tendon and the whole area was solid red.  I asked hime what that was and he said it was where the tendon was completely inflammed.  I was so happy when he said that, that he was confused.  I explained to him that I was glad it wasn't in my head and there was something really wrong.  He just laughed.  He gave me the shot and said if it wasn't any better he would put another shot in the elbow 5-19-09 and if that didn't stop the inflammation i would be referred to a surgeon and  have surgery on the tendon.  Sheesh, I''m tired of all this.  Karen, did they discuss giving  you an injection of steroid in your hip.  If I remember your tendon was torn and I bet they have to do surgery to fix that.  Well, I have babbled on - it's the wine.  Grace many hugs and prayers out to you.

Yes I am almost finished but still worried.  I don't know  what's wrong with me.  I feel like I did when I had my infections.  I can't seem to get my energy up and I just want to lay around.  I went to the office again today because they wanted me to do the interview then I need to work with the research departement as our surgery center is expanding out into research which is really interesting.  I got to work and then they kept coming in and out with lots of things that needed assistance.  I no have three more days to take off before October 1, 2010.  LOL I can't win for loosing.

Ladies I believe we are ready.  Ms. Judy, and Ms. Cathi, I believe you two are rubbing off on me. Have a good one everyone.  Lisa are you OK? Leesa ",

Jude how is the  moving going?  Are you ok and taking time to rest so as not to over do. Karen, your hair is beautiful.  I need to color mine and I would like to have it styled but I;m going to wait until it grows long again and I loose weight.  I miss being smaller and I feel rotten about my weight but I let myself go this year due to the treatments and surgeries.  I just had that I don't care attitude in regards to this area. Well, I;m off to bed.  I have alot of work to do tomorrow. See you guys, XOXOXO  Leesa Karen",

Well, it's back to the grindstone.  Oh and by the way, I love  my husband being around to help with things. I have to admit at times I ask him to do things just so I can look at him or have him close by.  He never complains and he keeps house better than most women.  The children adore him and he singing is wonderful.  He sings alot without realizing it. xoxoxoxox- Leesa",

Sue, I hope you are feeling better and will go see the doctor. Mel, you are a little doll, so thoughtful. Nancy and Karen, hello to you.  Karen, we have a little pet grave area on our land in MS and each animal through the years were buried in a little pet coffin with their favorite blanket or toy and their graves marked with a homemade grave marker.  So call us weird or call us loving human beings. Cloudhowe - I hope you are feeling better so about the lymphnodes. Lisa congrats on the date, how are things now.  I'm glad someone is having some excitement. I was paying a bill on the phone and was speaking to the service rep and she is 42 years old and was diangosed two days ago with colon cancer.   She shared her story over the phone and started crying a little because her doctor hasn't told her what her treatment will be or anything, she said she is feeling a little lost, scared, and uncertain, and not real sure how to handle ethings let alone how to help her family handle things.  I asked her for permission to let everyone here know and asked if we could pray for her and she said \"Please do remember me in your prayers but most of all remember my family and help me to help them.  So I'm asking wash of to remember her and welcome her if she decides to join out site.  I know it's colon cancer but she has no where to turn right now.  I hope this is ok with everyone.

Cathi - sorry about Ed but he is probably trying to assure that his business is ok and he doesn't want to make you worry.  Talking does wonders.  Cathi your baby is so cute (Margo and Brand't). My daughter turned 23 today - man do I feel old. UB you have my prayers - NED, NED, NED, NED................................ Lisa - that man just doesn't know what he's missing - he doesn't deserve you. Ms. Judy you are so precious. Jane - I know that in your avitar that is a little Joey, is he yours?  I have slept very soundly for three nights.  Last night wasn't too well and tonight probably will not be either since we will start moving in tomorrow and things are being delivered and we are trying to have tests, compencies, in-service and complete all start up requirements.  The dreams are starting over.  Not much longer until the first surgery and laser treatment. Cloudhowe - I love to read your posts - I can just hear your accent in your words.  You are a joy. Well, I have to get Connor ready for daycare.  He is out of school this week for Spring Break.  We still cannot get him to go to Disney World with his mom.  He doesn't want to go without Donnie and/or myself.  This gets really hard at times.  I thought I was through with this part of my life but what can you do the little fella needs us.  He's doing great.  His grades this six weeks were all E's and he had five S's.  He's in kindergarten.  When we started school he wasn't doing well at all. Boy did I ramble.  Love you ladies. Leesa",

It looks as if I missed alot over the past week or so.  My Thanksgiving was great.  Donnie (my husband) and I sat in the kitchen on Wednesday night and cut up all the onion, celery and anything else that needed to be cut up in order to make Thanksgiving Dinner for Thursday.  This was the first time in a long time that it was only him and I and we laughed, talked about the old times and even where we are now in our lives.  I asked him if it bothered him about me not having nice breasts any more due to the bilateral mastectomies and then the reconstruction, then the MRSA and the removal of the left breast and for once he answered truthfully - yes it bothers me that you have scars and your boobs aren't \"perfect\" any more but not for myself but for you because you have and are so self conscious and he wasn't sure if I would be able to handle it and he wasn't sure how to help.  It was truly an eye opener and a great night.  The kids and grandkids came over and we laughed and for some reason I was more relaxed than ever.  We put up the Christmas decorations, I watched and supervised. HA! HA! As you guys know, I haven't been feeling real well and I was to have a colonoscopy and my labs were coming back with anemia and low B12 and floate and Positive ANA test.  We I began hurting in my right breast which has aggrevated me since the reconstruction and it had a fluid pocket, etc.  Well, when Saturday rolled around, I told my honey I was going to the doctor - 2 1/2 hours away and he looked at me a realized there was really something wrong.  I got to the doctor's and her partner wass there because once again she was gone on another trip.  The  doctor withdrew 30 cc's of this merky colored fluid which should have been clear as it was from the expander itself.  I had emergency surgery and tthe right expander has now been removed and once again I have a JP in the right breast.  I think I hate that worse than the surgery.  I got out of the hospital today and I received the cold of the year as my reward.  Now with the snotty nose, cough, and generally feeling bad I'm doing better than most.  I'm sorry to hear everyone else has been so ill.  I feel a little blessed that my illness isn't that bad.  I have decided to wait until later next year to have surgery and just get the surgery center off the ground and give my body time to heal.  I think the labs were off due to the infection etc.  Oh the problem was the expander had folded back on it self and the fluid was leaking through the expander and was collecting in the space, tissues and what little muscle I had left.  I am currently taking cipro, I was on vancomycin and had the \"red man syndrome\" reaction from it and let me tell you that was a funny sight.  I was this bright pink to dark red clor from head to toe.  It happened within a few minutes.  The guy from the kitchen came to pick up my tray and had this scarred look on his face and while stuttering and trying not to trip over his feet and trying not to stare, he politely asked if I needed a doctor or someone to help me.  I told him no and then all of the staff was coming in to look at me so they would know what the side effects of vancomycin can be if given to fast.  It was really funy but scarry at first.  I went straight to work after leaving the hospital and traveling home and my boss made me leave.  I'll be back tomorrow though.  Cathi, I hope you are doing better.  Ulla, I don't know you that well but you are a very beautiful lady.  My sking is so dry now that I hate it and I don't like anyone to touch me - it feels yucky.  Judi, I'm worried about you, you have been feeling ill for a while and I really would like for you to be checked. (Hmmm do I sound like a mom or a nurse?).  Sue,  I thought the head thing might have been an abscess by the way you were describing it but if you're having headaches with it and feeling ill.  I think it's time to put your guard done and go get checked.  I learned from this surgery and my last surgery that I am smarter than other people even if they are MD's when it comes to my body and knowing something is wrong.  IT's kind of strange - I fight for my patients more than I do for myself.  Well, goodnight all and I hope everyone is doing well.

Karen, I;m sorry about Tinker.  I don't beleive any animal or person should suffer.  I can't tell you which way to go with Tinker but just know that we are all here for you and we feel your pain. Cheryl,  I'm sorry about your diagnosis.  I have DCIS in the left breast only and atypical hyperplasia cells throughout both breasts.  I have multiple lumpectomies, needle aspirations, and very bad fibrocystic disease.  I decided to have the bilateral mastectomies with reconstruction due to several reason.  One of the reasons was because I got tired of going through the abnormal sonos./mamos/MRIs, family and friends continually worring and I was only 43 when we finally found this one by mistake.  I say by mistake because my surgeon was being thorough and removed the adenoma and cyst but took extra tissue and the cacner cells were found in the extra tissue.  He told me that in order for them to check for DCIS any where else in the breast or the other breast, they would have to have something they are specifically looking at to test because DCIS could show up any where at any time and in order to check for it, they would have to pick a spot and hope it was the correct spot.  I don't have time for this: the constant worries, the ups and downs, upsetting and worrying my family, etc.  I have my grandchildren to worry about as my daughter is single and has not child support of any kind and has five (5) children.  So I have had some trouble with the reconstructions and will have to have another reconstruction. I would rather have the reconstruction problems and not the cancer.  I had radiation treatments on the left breast (25 tx) and it shrank and got a little darker than the other, so I was lopesided anyway.  Besides my insurance has paid quiet well so I'm ok with it.  I don't have to do the chemo for sure because I chose to go with the mastectomies.  Cathi - Young lady, I'm not sure what we are going to do with you.  I'm so glad you went to the hospital to get a jump start on getting well.  You are still as beautiful as ever.  As the saying goes, \"This too shall pass.\"  I hope you feel better soon.  Besides, knowing you, you will be using that canula tube as a belt or something and be dancing through the house soon.  DH better look out.LOL AE and UB - You are in my thoughts and prayers.  I'm sorry you are going through this but just know we are here for you. Wren, Sue, and everyone else, have a good day and remember \"Just smile and wave.\"  My grandson believes that works on his teacher and I believe he is right.  All of the boys in his class are doing it to their teacher especially when they are in trouble.   Talking about my little Connor (5 y/o), he was so funny when I got home last night.  He is in kindergarden and he gets his discipine every afternoon so we will know how he did for the day.  Well,  he had a good mark (color) then it was xd out and his color was moved down to a worse color (from yellow to orange-he's doing something wrong at this point).  He looked at me and was so pleased with himself and without stuttering he said, I was playing in the line and I know we aren't supose to but I was and Devine pushed me into Austin on an accident and Ausin hit me so I hit Devine and then we started wreslting and playing on the floor.  Now we have three new rules: no yelling, no hitting, and no wrestling in the line.  \"Mamaw, we was only playin why do we have to have three more rules?\"  I could only laugh because he was so matter of fact, proud that he told the truth, and concerned about the rules.  THe expressions on his face were very serious and sincere.  THen he smiled real big with his arms crossed across his chest and said, \"well, I was good at daycare.\"  Need I say more.

Lisa, I;m sorry to hear about you and Dennis.  You are a special person and definitelyy do not deserve to be treated that way.  You are very special and Dennis just doesn't know what he had.  Hey Lisa,  I wouldl ike to know how you come up with your ideas for your scrapebook.  I have lots of pictures surrounding special events but I'm not very creative or artistic. Nanaoften - how are you? UB and Sue, are you guys ok.  Hey Sue have you thought of when you might come to Florida?  I have to have surgery the end of April or the first of May but I am excited about you coming. Hello Ms. Cathi, the furbaby's new picture are beauttiful. Good night everyone, Leesa Mel, I don't know where you come up with the little inserts that you put in your posts but they are really cute.  My little Peaches, (Lasa Opsa) is the greatest.  I never wanted another animal in the house and as I said before we inherited her from our daughter, I forgot how much joy and laughter a little furbaby can bring.  I laugh so much and so hard at her that I am almost pathetic.  My husband laughs at me because of me laughing at her.  She throws hew chew toy around the room and entertains herself just like a kitten does.  She really loves the grandchildren but she likes to jump on them and give them kisses.  I'm not much for the licking in the face. Deb, I hope you are feeling better. ",

I'll talk to you ladies later. Leesa",

Mel, You are right, my little peaches - puppy- and Henry - my beta fish- wach have their own personalities and both are very jealous.  I would have never guessed a fish would be jealous but I think he is because when she is in the kitchen, which is Henry's domain, he keeps his back to me but when she is outside and I talk to him or rub the side of the fish tank, he does his little fin thing ans stares at me. Peaches is ours from now on. Peaches and the grandkids are even jealous of each other.  They spent the night, all five of the children, and I had to take them one at a time and let them lay down in my bed with me and when that one would go to sleep, I would put them in their bed and then the next one would come until all five were asleep - took about three hours.  Each one wanted some personal time and reading time with grandmom.  Peaches waited until everything was done then she jumped in the bed and growled at Donnie when he tried to take her off the bed.  I told him to give her a few minutes then she would get down and she did.

Nancy - I'm glad to hear that the hair has grown out and the wig is gone.  I've been talking to my grandaughter  (7 y/o) and we've been talking about her cutting her hair to donote to Locks of Love for the children with cancer.  We are going to try to look into this program.  Her hair grown so fast.  We had an intense discussion on cancer and why I don't have boobs at this time.  My MIL died of lung cancer and she asked, \"Why couldn't they just cut hers out.\"  We had to have a brief anatomy class.  Boy, you can see the wheels moving as she is thinking about what we were discussing.  Just how in depth do you go with a child that age? Makraz - I think my son was a little easier at times to raise than my daughter.  He and I were very close as he was  going through the teenage years.  He could never lie to me but I had to ask the correct questions to get the information out of him but he wouldn't lie to me.  My daughter was sneaky.  I would tell her no and she would go to her dad and only tell him partially what her plans were or whose she was with or where she was going.  She is alot like me in that she gets demanding and wants everything done yesterday and she gets impatient quickly.  She is self motivated and very smart.  HA! HA!  We are much closer now than when she was a teenager.  She went through a lot growing up and it was hard because I was mad at her dad for not asking and supervising better and at myself for working nights. Sue - I;m so glad you are feeling better. AE, EWB, Ulla, Wren, and everyone else including the party lady herself - Cathi- I hope things are going weel for you all. XOXO Leesa",

I'm a little sore and still have the right drain in.  I'm suppose to have the drain and the stitches removed Monday at 2:45.  I was reading about where several here were nervous to see themselves for the first time after surgery and I have to admit I was in that boat with you.  When I was going into surgery.  My mom and my husband were at my side and my mom was trying to calm down and said \"Just think you're going in with two uglies and you''re coming out with two cuties.\"  I think that was the first time I smiled with regards to the surgery.  I must say, my PS did a good job but they still look funny without nipples.  I have two different sets of stitches to the left breast - the one that had the radiation- and one set of stitches to the right breast.  She put in the expanders then some extra tissue for a \"build up.\"  I think all of you ladies look younger than you ages or the ages you say you are.  I believe we are all beautiful in one way or another.  Missing all the others: Jane, Mel, AE, UB, Sue, Cloudhowe, Judy, and everyone else not mentioned. Praying for you all Leesa",

Things have really been busy.  Mel, I am sorry to hear about your roomate.  I hope and prayer things will go well.  Thank you all for your well wishes.  I did get the drain removed last Monday and had 190 cc's of fluid removed and some of the stitches.  I went yesterday and she pulled off another 150 cc's from the left breast and about 40cc's from the right drain.  The fluid from the left breast is a dark brown and nasty looking.  She is culturing it and I will have the results on Monday.  My PS hit a muscle or something when she was withdrawing the fluid and ever since then I have had muscle spasms or something because when I move my arm a certain way the pain shoots down my left arm and it feels like it catches.  It will bring you to your knees.  She gave me a muscle relaxer.  I took one last night at 6:00 and slept until 11:00 today.  Also, the area around the left drain insertion sight is very tender and that is the one that didn't drain anything until she started removing the fluid herself.  Does this sound weird? Today was a very busy day once I woke up.  My third little grandbaby turned 4.  We went to Wal-mart and she got to pick out her birthday cake, touys, jewelry, and her \"makeup\" (lip gloss).  We then bought her a dress from the Hawain shop at the mall.  Went to see her dad at work.  Went to Chuck-E-Cheese and had a party.  We went to the nail and spa shop and we had our nails done, the we went to El Chico and she had a chocolate milk and chips with queso.  I had a coke with chips and ques.  The employees there came and sang Happy Birthday to her.  She was great all day.  Her nails are a bight dark pink with clear glitter on them (toes and fingers).  She was all smiles. Meagan (my son's fiance) invited me to look at wedding dresses with her and to help plan some of her weeding with her.  I feel really honored that she wants to include me in on this.  She is really a pretty girl.  My sone calls their dog their \"kid\" and he got a minature maltese yesterday and I didn't know it.  When I spoke to him today he said, \"I will be at the party after I drop off the kids.\"  I was surprised and taken aback when he said \"drop off the kids\", he told me about the new puppy and then understood he was talking about both of the puppies. \"Whew\".  Cathi, You can tell Margo is a little irl because she sure does have her \"daddy\" wrapped like all good little girls. LOL Welcome to all the new people.  Nance your daughter is truly beautiful, the dress and tennis shoes were great.  I know you weren't proud in the slightest.LOL.  Lisa, I would like to have a smiggen of your energy or even Cathi's.  I'm gaining weight and can't loose it. Well, I got carried away again sorry.  Hello to all and to all you are in my prayers. Hugs, Leesa",

Not one above the other.  I came from Mississippi so you can imagine what I go through.  I finally had to tell my family \"you either accept all of my children or none\".  It was really strange that they accepted Madison (hispanic/white) and not the three little ones (black/white).  I finally told them that I would never spend my vacations nor my holidays with them unless they caould accept all five grandbabies the same.  It has been very hard for them but they are coming around.  They will not let the dad come around but it doesn't have to do with his race.  My family gets frustrated with my daughter as all the children are hers and she just turned 23.  Believe me it's not because she didn't know better.  I had a charge nurse that would always make snide remarks until I pinned her to the wall one day and told her she better be glad that I had myself under control.  Just like with my family, I put my foot down and now I don't have any problems.  Some people!!! Karen you are so cute. DFH needs a swift kick in the booty. Cheryl glad to see you. Markatz - You have lots of words of encouragement also.  Oh Karen, I got the steroid shot in the right elbow on Friday.  I thought I would die later that afternoon - after the numbing medicine wore off.  I took a flexaril (one mind you) at about 6:00 on Friday night, went to bed at 6:30 and woke up Saturday around 12:00.  I was like a wet noodle the rest of the day and did nothing - the are is so much better.  But I took one more flexaril to help keep it relaxed one more day at around 4:00 and I went to bed at 7:00 Saturday night and woke up Sunday at 1:00 pm and went bake to bed at 8:15 pm and slept until this morning - It was great (very low tolerance to pain meds.) LOL  I'm not wearing the arm brace because I feel like I'm being tied down and it really bothers me.  I can have one more shot if needed in 4 weeks - May 19, 2009 and if it doesn't stop the inflammation I will have to see a surgeon to fix it.  They put this ultrasound machine on my arm and the total area was red showing inflammation of the tendon.

Nettie, You are so funny and I like your \"arsehole\" saying.  Sheila you are so right it is definitely hard to sing and cry at the same time.  When this happens you better listen because God is talking to you.  Open your heart and turn it all over to Him and he will take care of you.  Now I'm finished preaching. I went to the PS today.  Not really happy with what she had to say.  I'll have to think about it for a while.  According to her I can start my nipple reconstruction on September 14 then wait two full months and have the tattooing done.  If I want to she will take me back to surgery and straighten the left breast and make it larger to match the other.  There's not that much difference in the sizes and where the scar is, the breast tissue is not smoothe and looks a little deformed but that's due to \"scar tissue\" from surgeries, infection and radiation.  She couldn't guarantee that she could really fix it but she was willing to try.  I don't know about all of this and I'm so self conscious that all I want to do is cry because I wonder what my husband is thinking and I wonder if that's why we aren't very close - or at least plays a part in it.  Oh, I just want to cry.

The left breast just looks bad but she said it was due to the rads.  She thought everything looked great.  A friend of mine who has worked with a plastic surgeon for years asked if she could see what was bothering me so and I hesitated for a while but after crying and worrying I let her look and she was amazed at how things looked and said I should be very happy.  She thought it was great.  I told her that they were going to put steroid shots in the areas that had the tubes coming out and she said that was good.  She also said that while I had the local the PS could either make a small cut so the scar tissue would loosen up or I could even have a steroid shot in that area and it would cause it to loosen up and smoothe out.  So I guess things are better than I thought.  I'm trying to loose weight and I took my shirt off and looked in the mirror and thought, \"Why am I loosing weight, it won't change how horrible I llok.\" (The scars.  The scars are really bad, my c=section scar from 1986, 1987, and 1989 looks worse than my breast and in my opinion it's pretty darn good. lol.  Sorry to bend your ear.",

No Ms. Cathi. Oh my my my,  lets see where to begin.  I know that is what you are asking yourself.  Sit down, make a list of everything going on in your life and around your life.  Once you have done that think about what you can and can't change, realistically.i.e: 1  You start off by telling Ed you have to many stressors going on and you need his help.  He can relieve alot of stress for you by his going to get check and getting cleared by the doctor.  He will do that by Wednesday at the latest and make the appointment for him and say here you go.  Stand tall and stnd firm. 2.  You have to tell  DD:  I love you because you are mine and God gave you to me.  Now what is going on in our lives is not about you, DD, so don't call me with your poor mouthing, when you can stand up ad be a mom and love you children, then call me.  This is very hard but Over the past two weeks I'm good at it now and the children, my DD and Son, are really sarting to change.  My son \"bowed up to me and his dad and we stood firm.  Believe me I have never been so detemined like now.The are now working together to get things done instead of coming to Donnie and I.  They know they can't call and fuss or poor mouth. That is truly wonderful.  Like I said dont ask for prayers unless your ready to listen to the Good Lord and do what He says. LOL  Oh and by the way, He never said it would be easy and believe me it's not. 3.  I had my melt down at work almost two weeks ago.  I went to one of the doctor's, the one who is very detailed oriented and extremely smart, and told I needed help.  I explained to him I had some concerns if we were surveyed because I had been so involved in the Billing that I had let some other things go.  I asked him to help me get back on track and how to handle it.  He asked me what all needed to be done and i told him because all of it to me was equally important but as we talked I realized that only one thing was more important because of the effects it could have on us were greater at the time.  I made tell him every aspectdetail/steps it would take to accomplish everything.  Then he asked what is the ne thing you can change and change quickly.  The next thing he said was make small goals, accomplish that then go to the next thing and accomplish that and stop thinking al of it had to be done now.  I can truly say, my outlook has been different and I am actually seeing a huge accomplishment with work and getting things done quicker because before I looked like a fish out of water flopping around, I was flopping around and going from one thing to another and accomplishing nothing With all of tha being said, the most important thing to do is pray, look at yourself, remember who you are know what you know, know your goals and ake tiny steps to get there.  Listen to God and let Him guide you. Sorry to be preaching. You know our lives are very similar and this is what I have done over the past few weeks and my shoulders are now upright and straight and my desk a twork is almost completely caught up. Love ya, Leesa",

LOL I know it's not funny and I'm really not making light of it.  Just think that is the only real good thing that came out of your having cancer - your daughter is able to be checked early where before she wouldn't even qualify.  My daughter went to the doctor's and they found two or three lumps in her left breast, she is 23 years old and thank goodness the nurse practitioner she saw worded her need for the mammogram in a way that the insurance company would cover it.  The mammogram showed cysts and I told her now is the time she learns to do her exams correctly and regularly.  She now takes the breast exams seriously and she has \"abnormal cells\" on her pelvic exam so they will \"watch them\".  At least the nurse practitioner is being a little more careful with her than normal girls her age.  I will keep your daughter in my prayers.

Sue,  I'm so glad to hear from you.  It's all because of you that this thread was started and so many wonderful peopel have come together to be one in our times of need.  I'm not a wise and knowledgeable person but I do know when someone is a gretat person such as yourself.  We have you to thank for this great sisterhood/brotherhood. I wanted to let you guys know also that I had my last reconstruction surgery August 19, 2009 and all went well.  The only problem is on the side with radiation there breast is not very smoothe due to the effects of readiation on the skin but it doesn't look too bad.  When I have my clothes on and my bra on you can't notice the problem.  I  will go in November or December for the tatooing and the nipple reconstruction to take place.  It does feel wierd.  I used the silicone implants and they do feel real to your hand but physically you do notice a difference maybe it's ust in my head because \"they aren't my real boobs.\"  I didn't go big but it was big enough for me.  (Large C cup)  I have joined Metabolic Research for weight loss but haven't suceeded very well due to everyone being sick and things going on.  I will achieve this goal also like everything else when I put my mind to it.  Sue all I can do is thank you and thank God for you.  I could not have made it this far without the members of this thread.  I thank you all.   Judie your wisdom and words are phenominal and so heart warming.  Mel your funny side and gentle side are very comforting.  Cathi, you are a real inspiration with your \"baby - Margo\" grandbabies, the things you go throught with sister in law and children.  Lets me know I'm not the only one facing these difficulties.  Karen - your relationship with your children and the building of your new home - brings things into perspective. Lisa - Your romance life is like reading a novel and I never have to open a book - LOL. I;m so jealous.  I have toldy my DH and it has put ideas in his mind that has  truly been great.  Judie - I have your flower, the picture you took looking outside your window- on my desk tops and have many people comment on the beauty of it.  They also talk about it's calming effects. Cathy - your check wing for a man is truly awesome.  I sent it to a friend who was having problems with her fellow being romantic and asked for suggestions and I sent that picture to her and her \"man\" got the beest idea and now any friend that is down and needs an idea to spark things up gets a copy of the picture and the sparks start flying. LOL Sorry about going on but I thought i would let some of you know the impact your have mad on my life.  ",

LOL.  My husband called to tell me he was called in to work for time and a hald - Lord knows we could use the money - LOL.  I'm in the middle of surgery, starting an IV for another nurse, three patients in pre-op, short one nurse, ordering meds on the phone from the hospital, someone in my office wanting to complete a proposal for insurance contracts and a doctor in surgery wanting me in the OR to talk while he performs surgeru and my sweet little receptionist trying to be sweet says, \"Ms. Leesa your needed on the phone,\" I tell her she needs to wait a minute, and she repeated herself and I repeat myself then all of the sudden she says, \"Ms. Leesa I;m sorry and I know your busy but the hospital on the phone and your husband has had a wreck andd he's broke.\"  It was as if the world come to a sudden hault and I asked her to repeat herself which she did.  I ran to the phone and sure enough it was the hospital and he broke both his Tib/Fib bones at both ends.  He is now the proud owner of 20 regular screws and 2 butterfly screws and two plates.  Talk about team work at the surgery center.  My gourp of employees came to together and I rattled off it seems like 50 orders and announced to the doctor I had to leave we would talk later and out the door in all of 5 minutes. LOL.  I have such a great staff of emplloyees.  The whole process was scary but looking back on some of the details it was aslso funny.  He had his wreck at the hospital as he went through the parking lot to park his motorcycle he hit a patch of ice and wrecked his motorcycle.  NEEDLESS TO SAY HE DID NOT GET TO WORK FOR TIME AND A HALF. lol.  He was found by one of the doctors he works with in the cath lab.  The docotr pulled up beside him, rolled his window down and said, \"Donnie, you ok.\"  Donnie said yes, then he sat up and said, \"I was fine unil I said up and my foot dropped to the side.  Dr. Bayouth called the cath lab and told them, \"Linda, send all the boys and a stretcher, don't worry about Donnie he's already here.\"  He never told them Donnie was the patient.  The funniest part is the ambulance service and police got to the hospital parking lot before the employees with the stretcher.  LOL.  I can laugh now but at the time he was so grey and pale and sweating but trying to be brave.  I was reading Sheila's post where she was possibly loosing her job.  I want you all to know that God watches over all of us especially in our time of needs.  My bills from the surgeries, medications, and radiation have finally caught up with us and we maxed out our credit cards but I never gave up and I never stopped believing in God.  Today, my boss, he's the best, brought me a check for $5,000.00 and said it was just because I did a good job for him and he appreciated all I did.  Even though he tells me thanks and he encourages me everyday he said he thought I could use part of my year-end bonus now.  All I could do was cry and I asked him to give it to someone else that needed it more than me.  He just hugged me and said, You are the one that needs it now.  I have never experienced anything like this before.  I can't bring myself to cash the check and I'm not sure what to do.  What do you guys think.

Love you guys and miss you all.  Nettie the pics are beautigul and Judy, your little Connor is very handsome.",

LOL  Cathi, you are doing a great job and you are truly a wonderful woman, mom, grandma and friend.  The other ladies are correct that you need the \"me time\" as well as tthe itme with the kids.  Yes you will feel guilty about sending the kids to daycare but in the long run this will be best for the little ones.  I know this for a fact.  We have had Connor since he was born August 2, 2003.  My daughter has four other children and yes we still have custody of them all at this time.  She wouldn't visit \"Because when they cry, I cry and I don't like people telling me what I can and can't do with my own children.\" (that's what she says.  I really am angry with CPS because we have only seen the case worker on April 23, 2010 and that is all.  We aren't to let KaLee spend the night, they can only see the kids when her S.O. isn't around and they can't come around when Madison is here.  I get angry with KaLee because it's been like a vacation to her without the children and she doesn't seem interested in their well being.  She has chosen her S.O. over the children as they are together but CPS doesn't know.  I recent her for her actions, I'm saddened by the questions the kids ask such as, \"why can't I see my mommy?\" or \"Why don't mommy want us any more.  The least she could do is spend more time with them, help get them ready for bed and help with other things but she doesn't.  Connor, the one we have had since he was born and is soon to be 7 y/o is so funny when he tries to comfort them and he takes the little ones by the hand and sits them down and starts this \"grown up\" conversation with them.  Now remeber these are his brothers and sisters and he has never lived with them on a normal basis.  He's always been ours.  I feel like I'm too old for this and tired but then I look at those little faces and I know what I have to do.  One thing I have realized is that Connor as well as the others, all started to the same daycare when they were a few months old and needless to say, their friends have helped them to understand and have given them somewhat of a normalcy with all that has gone on with them.  They talk with their friends and socialize with their friends and they don't feel unloved by their parents because they have the support of their daycare friends and teachers.  We have had no one come in and inspect out home, they have not attended any counseling because the CPS worker has never set up the classes. When we call him, he just says there are worse cases than ours and he knows the children are safe and he doesn't feel the need to worry or rush throught things.  The alone time is wonderful but lonely at times.  Sorry I was rambling Glad everyone's visits have gone well.  Sheila good luck to you and your job.  Lisa glad you and Tom are doing well.  Hello to all Leesa",

Cathi, We haven't heard anything from you today, where are you and is everyone ok?  Amanda is going to need alot of support but you did the right thing which is you made her make the decision and you allowed her to keep her decision now she needs your support.  By letting her do it herself she will make it.  May God be with you and your family.  Please know we are here for you and your family if you need us.  To everyone else.  Hello and Goodnight.

When the kids were taken away and the CPS worker called, I couldn't keep my mouth shut, I told them everything i know and then some.  They removed the kids, my daughter was extremely angry and she tried to make him leave again and he just keeps coming back.  The CPS office here let everything drop in this case and still has not followed up.  We keep the kids a  majority of the time but she is still with him.  He changed for a little while but then right back the way he was, drinking, drugs, out all hours of the night, seeing other women, etc.  I am so angry with her but I love her because she is my daughter but I refuse to give her any money and I make her more accountable for her actions.  I don't give in as much as I used to but I have to remember that she isn't thinking right.  She wants her kids, she doesn't want to be alone, and she has absolutely no self-confidence.  To top all of this off she still wants him to leave deep down but doesn't know how to do it because he does keep coming back.  He even went so far as to mess up her apartment, hide her dvd and games and he sat in the shadows and watched her and the police as they went through her apartment and even had the nerve to call her on the phone with the police there and tell her where her stuff was hidden, then he ran off when the police got on the phone and went outside to find him.  What I;m trying to say is, maybe she isn't mental but trying to protect herself, children or family.  You never know what is going on behind closed doors.  I don't mean to scare you but after talking with DD I believe there is a lot more going on than meets the eye.  Support or no support, support doesn't matter if there is something else going on, ie: maybe threats against the children or her family.  You do have to give her tough love.  Let her know you are there but she has to take this step on her own and no one can do it for her.  She has to do it by herself for it to mean anything or for her to stick with it.  That is the hardest thing you can do is watch your child go throught this but it is the best thing because if you do it for her she will never stick to it because she isn' t ready.  It's like smoking a cigarette, you can't make someone quit unless they are ready.  It really hurts seeing ehr this way but I know I can help her and give her piece of mind untili she decides one way or the other and that's by letting her know I love her and I will keep her children safe so she can try to take care of herself.  I don't think Amanda is sick, maybe scarred but at the same time relaxed because her babies are taken care of.  It took KaLee 2 months to get her head on straight and she is more determined now than every to do what it takes to take care of her children and to get them back.  She is even to the point of fighting back and not putting up with his mess. If you need someone to commit to taking care of your babies if need be, send them this way and we will take them.  Just remeber you always have a friend here if you need it and if you need piece of mind.  Thinking of you and keeping you in my prayers, Leesa",

You should sit down one day and ask Landen if he knows his grandmaw loves him and then ask him how does he know and the answers he will give you will make you see just what you mean to him.  It's great.  I've asked Connor how he knows I love him and he says, \"cause you love me, cause you take care of me, cause you buy my stuff and you always come get me from daycare, and because you gave me my own room.\"  I just cry and laugh because he is so serious.",

Cathi, I'm doing fine,  have told the kids they are old enough to stand on their own two feet and they needed to get it together. I told my son if I caught him with drugs, I would deliver him to the police an he knows not to push me.  I have basically cut my daughter off as far as giving her money and helping her.  I do help with the daycare because of Connor.  I guess she used the ids too much to get what she  wanted.  We wouldnt help her get a car so she got my father-in-law to help her and that ended up being a mess.  I let them handle it as long as I could but when he called Donnie, my husband so upset, he is 81 ears old, I got angry and took matters into my on hands and settled that problems.  I also told her what I thought about what had happened and told her she needed to get her _ _ _ _ together. Cathi, I know you have bone cancer now and you said it is common for that to occur when you have had breast cancer but what about luekemia  Are there any connections between the two of them, luekemia and breast cancer?  Just asking no problems really. I miss being on this site.  Love you all, Leesa (Dink)",
