I still kick myself for thinking my breast looked strange because of breastfeeding. I had chemo from July to my l last dose on Dec 12. During chemo, my tumor did shrink to the point that my oncologist could no longer measure as he couldn't find the edges. He guesses that it is now about 1-2 cm and broken up. My biopsy tested positive in the lymph nodes and it was palpable in the beginning but my doc said about 4 treatments in he could no longer feel it. I'm set for a left masectomy on Jan 13 with a diep flap reconstruction and after I heal I will get radiation. I'm terrified. I don't want to sound stupid, but I am so scared that the chemo before surgery has cancer cells grow elsewhere. That when I get my surgery, I'm scared it will be worse then I imagined.Has anyone else had a large tumor with lymph node involvement and not have recurrence? Surgery scares me. Radiation after the diep flap scares me that it may not work. I know that no one can give any guarantee. I just really need some similar situations with positive outcomes. I'm also her2 positive. I'm new on here. I have been so positive outwards to my friends and family but inside and to my husband , I am an absolute worried mess. Please help. Advice. Stories. Info. Any welcomed!
