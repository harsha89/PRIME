    "Content": "justbutch wrote: My mother was told today by 2 doctors and 1 pathologist that they are sure (99%) that she has breast cancer.  They did the biopsy and she is now having the MRI.  They have told us that she will likey only need radiation not chemo.  We have a meeting scheduled for next Tuesday to discuss the options for treatment and the future. As her son I am ofcourse upset and concerned.  But more importantly I am concerned about her mental state.  My mom has always been a negative person who refuses to recognize her negativity.  My sister and I do our best to promote a positive outlook and remind her often of the positive side when she goes negative on us.  I know from first hand experience that a positive outlook on life can change so many things as I have been living with AIDS for 21 years. Does anyone have suggestions on how I might help her at this early stage?  Where might I find guidance and support for her and my family that is localized (Chattanooga Tennessee)?
