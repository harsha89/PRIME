They ended up giving me only an ultrasound and did not call me back until 2 weeks later that they need additional imagining. I freaked out because why wait 2 weeks and I couldn't get an appointment until a month later. My appointment is this week. but 2 weeks ago I had chest pains, breast pain and overall body pain with problems breathing and my doctor thought I had a blood clot and requested a CAT scan. I had that done of my chest and all came back clear with lympthnodes clear and said my pain is due to asthma. I not longer have breathing issues and don't feel the pain anymore but my questions are the following... I just had a CAT scan of my chest that showed nothing suspicious. Should I bring that to my mamogram appt on Thursday? Should I even have a mamo so close to having a CAT scan? That's alot of radiation ? Would the CAT scan have shown something was wrong with my breast ? I am so worried as to why I need further imagining after an Ultrasound if everywhere i read that an ultrasound is a good way to rule out any malignancy. I have very little information of someone who has had an ultra sound first and then a mamogram so I don't know what to expect. I am so anxious. Log in to post a reply",

I only got a US done which came back clear but they wanted additional images bc of the pain. I no longer feel the pain although i did start to expierence shortness of breath and chest pains and had CT scan and a bunch of blood work done that came back clear. I went for my diagnostic mamo and US 9/6 at 9AM. They told me they called me back bc it's protocol to do a mamo if I have pain but that there were no findings in the US. I told them I experienced some chest pains and arm pit pains that have now subsided. They did the mamo and the radiologist cleared the right breast (which is the one with the most pain) but wanted more images of the left then said to go meet with the US tech. The US tech went to talk to the Radiologst then came back and asked me to point where i feel pain. I did and she did a US of that area plus spent alooooot of time on my left breast. After she was done she went to talk to the radiologist and came back and said ok you can go home your results will be ready to your doctor in 2-3 days. So I asked, well is everything ok? this is a diagnostic mamo after all? she said i dont have any info the radiologist just siad the results will go to your doctor not you. AHHHHHH! WHY?!!?! So i been checking the portal everyday like a mad woman. It said my report would be ready Sept 11th, today it changed to Sept 15th why?! the images still said will be ready Sept 11th but the report is the only thing that got pushed. I thought Diagnostic Mamos were to DIAGNOSE, not to be in this agonizing waiting game. Whats more annoying is that my US report was ready the very next day and they didn't upload it until 5 days later and my Gyno didnt call me until 7 DAYS later to tell me that i needed additional images. someone please help, why is this taking so long? is this a bad sign help please Log in to post a reply",

So looking at the images isnt helpful because I don't know what I am looking at! I talked to the imaging center and asked why there was a delay but got no response. I called my doctor and she was busy so they said they would leave her a note and still have no heard back. I am sick to my stomach looking at my images trying to figure out if anything is wrong :( thank you all again",
