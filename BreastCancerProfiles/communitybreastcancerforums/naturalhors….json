      "Content": "Jan 31, 2012 03:46PM - edited Feb 4, 2012 01:46PM by naturalhorse I found BCO in 2009 when I was diagnosed and treated for stage IIb TN IDC (BRCA 1+) at age 43.  I had FAC chemo, bilateral MX, TC chemo, radiation, reconstruction and oopherectomy. Finished all of that in July 2010.   I then lived in the world of DNile and went back to my life before bc.  I never believed that I would have a recurrance let alone mets.  My doctor delcared me \"cancer free\".  I went to my followup appointments every three months as directed but was never really nervous about them.  It took me a long time to regain my stamina (I have a physically demanding lifestyle).  I remember asking the onc in July why I was still so tired.  His response...\"Just give it more time, your bloodwork looks great\". (he didn't mention that my CA27.29 was well above normal)  Next appointment in Nov. 2011 guess what....tumor markers had doubled it was time to look for the cancer. After PET and biopsy I have mets to lungs, adrenal gland, periaortic and cervical nodes.  I have been treated with Navelbine since December.  I have scans at the end of this week to see if it's been effective.  I think not but will wait for the scans to know. I also read this forum with my morning coffee and gain strength and knowledge from those of you who post. My career is as a Natural Horsemanship Instructor.  I have decided to continue teaching on a limited, hand picked basis.  The horses and humans I continue to work with feed my soul as I see the understanding come through.  I live on my parents property with 2 aging parents (my father also has serious health issues) 12 horses, 2 dogs and 2 cats. My son is now 26 and married with a 9 month old daughter.  They live about 35 miles away and I get to see them about once a week.   My sister and parents have been an incredible support system.  Sis goes to all treatments and support group with me, Dad takes care of the animals when I can't and Mom makes sure I eat :-) ",
