Two had cervical cancer at ages 34 and 42.  One other sister had breast cancer at 43.  All are doing well some 15 years later!  The fourth younger sister is cancer free, thank God. I was recently diagnosed with IDC at age 65.  So out of the seven sisters, four have had cancer.  We would like to know what the factors are--is there a link or just cruel coincidence....",
