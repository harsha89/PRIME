      "Content": "Oct 31, 2010 09:42PM - edited Aug 20, 2013 03:04AM by LG300 Brazos, it's an emotional rollercoaster for a lot of us.  For me, in addition to all the pain and scariness of this BC journey - my treatment ended up being much more complicated than originally expected - I also have the stress of needing to find a new job. I resigned from my last job (for reasons unrelated to my health) the month before I was diagnosed. The one good thing is that I took advantage of having the time off to catch up on doctor's appointments, overdue mammogram, etc. Otherwise, I would have never caught my BC at such an early stage. As it was, even though I had DCIS, it was widespread, and I ended up having three lumpectomies before finally getting a BMX (couldn't get clean margins). Because of all the pain and complications from my four surgeries (I got staph infections after two of the surgeries and spent 5 days in the hospital on IV antibiotics for the second infection), as well as all the pain from the TEs, I haven't been able to start looking for a new job until recently (I was diagnosed 6 months ago). Even now, I don't even have enough energy to make it through a whole day of work. I have been consulting part-time (mostly pro bono) to feel somewhat productive and keep my mind working. Before I was in too much pain to even think about working (I don't know how so many of you returned to work so quickly), but now that I'm feeling better physically, I have to deal with the stress of finding a job. I feel that after all I've been through this year, I deserve some good luck, so hopefully I'll find something soon. Best of luck to all of you having exchanges surgeries coming up!  My exchange is Nov. 10, and I'm looking forward to really being able to move forward with my life after recovering from that surgery. BTW, Jeanne, can you add my BMX date to the top of the page.  I had BMX and TEs on June 30.  Thanks!",

Getty - That is weird not to see your PS after your surgery.  Unfortunately, I just saw mine again today.  I had my regular post-op appointment on Tuesday (we both had our surgeries last Wednesday), and I was fine, except for an allergic reaction to the adhesive on the bandages.  Then last night I noticed that my left breast was larger than my right (they were pretty even right after the exchange surgery) and that it was red and swollen on the bottom.  Went to see my PS today and she said there was some fluid and an infection, but she thought we could \"nip it in the bud.\"  She gave me two different antibiotics.  I go back to see her again on Tuesday. Reneemac - I can't believe your PS thought your TE was already out and was ready to do nipple construction.  Good luck with your exchange surgery in a couple weeks!  I've had some complications following mine, but on a positive note, it feels great to have the TEs out.",
