Â We don't always know whats going on inside our bodies but you have to be alert and proactive, and it sounds like you are, keep with the routine of checking that you are on and all will be well.

Had it Friday- called back Monday, back in Tuesday, met with the radiologist and she wanted me back in 6 months as well for what she said was a dilated duct.. she told me the chances were less than 1% that it was anything but I asked for the biopsy.. had that Wednesday. (This is my second- I had a fibrodenoma removed in 2009) it\u2019s not bad at all and will be worth the peace of mind. I actually got my results today and it was not a dilated duct, it was another fibro- (benign) but back again in 6 months anyway. I\u2019m very lumpy so I asked to listed as high risk so no more waiting in the future. You\u2019ll do great! It\u2019s quick and like I said the peace of mind will be awesome! Goooooood luck ðŸ˜˜",

So far it has been super easy. I have a fibroadenoma that was core biopsied twice because it grew. Both times results were benign but I asked to have it removed for my own peace of mind. I would recommend this to anyone. Though the lump I had was not cancer, I did not want to risk missing something due to thinking it was the same ole lump. I went in this morning, they asked me questions about my health, got my IV going, gave me some sedatives and I woke up feeling great! I of course am a little sore but not bad at all and Im back to work Thursday morning. Even if they say you dont need it out. Just take it out, better all around. Feel free to email me if you have any questions and Good luck!!",

Leave and come back in 6 months and check again, mammogram (which she said may also show nothing) or biopsy (a lastÂ option as she felt things were normal) Me being the nervous person I am, asked for the biopsy which was done that day. Results, benign!!!! Just had another one as the lump this time showed up on the ultrasound and again, thank God, the results were normal, but I truely appreciate my surgeon who gave ME the option to decide what I wanted to do. I sleep much easier now. I reccomend that if you feel uneasy, find someone to check, chances are it's fine but you'll sleep better and stop worrying. All my best to youÂ ",
