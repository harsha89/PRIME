Fatigue definitely setting in (\"a little early\" says my RO) and some queasiness (\"not us\" says my RO). Skin not bad at all yet though. Anyway - just wanted to say hi and good thoughts to you all. And I'm so impressed with you guys who are keeping up with workouts!",

I'm about 2/3 through rads and it's gone well. I love the techs. Surgery was also fine. Really liked my surgeon. My emotional issue - started shortly after I started rads - has been Rage - not at techs or radiation or even cancer, but just super quick to anger and slow to subside. Don't much like my oncologist - no communication - and am also seriously doubting whether to move on to AIs. His \"here, take this drug and I'll see you in a year\" approach doesn't do much for my confidence. But don't want to make a decision based on anger. There is nothing wrong with you. You are navigating a situation that's hard on your body and mind and you arefaced with difficult decisions at the same time. I wish you lots of luck in this sucky process.",
