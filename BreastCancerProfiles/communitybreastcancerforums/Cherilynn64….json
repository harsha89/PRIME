The farther back you go the worse they are. Even some I have seen in the 50s say \"died of kindey problems.\" Well WTF does that mean? Renal cancer? Hypertension? Infection? That can mean anything.  Your post resonated with me b/c I have one living grandmother who is 99 who I know all her med history but my other grandmother I barely knew and she had a slew of medical issues. And I look a lot like she did when she was young and I take after that side of the family. So far as I know there is zero cancer on either side of the family, yet maybe she also had cancer when she died (she officially died of COPD but had many other issues)? So I understand why you want to know, too, but it probably woukdn't benefit you at all. Beacon, wow, that is fabulous that you were given those medical records! I hate that all of us have to deal with this horrid disease, but if there is a \"bright side\" I'm thankful that I have it in the year 2012 if you know what I mean. Let's just hope a cure is SOON. ",

(since they are putting in a port). Also, what was the PR result, positive or negative (this would be right by the ER result), and did they run the HER2 test? That would also indicate positive or negative. Feel free to throw out anything else here, we can all go over it with you a step at a time :-) ",

I had general anesthesia so that was a first for me, too.

I cried a little for like an hour off and on which is normal. Worst thing for me was the stomach upset and acid reflux. OMG. That lasted for almost a MONTH. I couldln't eat some days almost anything. Stuff tasted weird, stuff I normally liked made me vomit.....I did end up taking about 7 days worth of over the counter omeprazole (Prilosec) and that helped. I stopped after that time and it was gone. So the acid reflux can wreak havoc on your singing voice as you know.....that might be something to think about, but it's easily treatable and was not permanent. And not everyone has it for as long as I did. Maybe try googling singers and anesthesia effects? See what comes up? If I run across something I will post it!",

I had a tough time deciding after my diagosis of DCIS and IDC in Jan for lumpectomy or mastectomy....I finally went with lumpectomy and radiation and tamoxifen due to my age, genetic history, and lifestyle. Had I had a family history I would have had a mastectomy. If this occurs locally in the breast again, I will say take them both this time.  Mets scare the crap out of me and no doubt everyone else. I agree with your decision for chemo due to your age for sure....I was 47 and considered young for breast cancer, so at only 39, yeah, sounds like it was the right decision. And if I had had a mid range oncotype score that was on the fence, I was going to do chemo due to the grade 3 and the KI of 22%. Sometimes I get up in the morning and wonder, should I have done chemo anyways? I reckon that decision is always going to be with us. Thanks Annice - I hope it's negative. They drew blood and ran tumor markers back in March when they put me on tamoxifen, and those came out normal levels so I'm praying it stays that way. I'm in the process of moving out of state and it all hinges on waiting till Sept for this PET scan. I just dont' want to move and the first thing I get is a PET scan showing something and I have all new docs etc....so I'm waiting on that then will have the all clear to go. Cheri ",

I can't imagine someone coming on here and telling you you're crazy for doing chemo (they'd be crazy telling you that!). It's your decision however you can around to it. I literally almost flipped a freakin' coin to decide on lumpectomy vs mastectomy. It's what the results show you combined with what your gut tells you to do. I'm in a horrible personal mess that occurred 7 months before the cancer diagnosis that as me seeing a psychologist for the first time in my life. My gut was yelling at me like crazy for years, and I didn't listen. And I'm paying for it. When I got the cancer dx in Jan, I was like, God, really, you're kiddin right? But I prayed and listened to my gut this time....and I have been able to sleep. And that's how I gauge my decisions. If I can sleep at night, I made the right decision. So far with everything related to cancer, I'm sleeping fine. It's the other mess keeping me up, heh. Doc Annice - you're an endocrinologist? I just got diagosed with hypothyroidism.

My oncologist is also our same age and I said the proverbial if this were you what would you do? He said absolutely no chemo, not with that score and my estrogen and progesterone at almost 100% positive. He said tamoxifen is the best weapon I have and not using any estrogen replacement in the future. I'm still very premenopausal even though my periods now have seemed to stop. Still have no tamoxifen side effects other that that. So who knows? I sure hope for a good outcome for you!! Keep us posted once you find out your score. Good luck {{{{{{}}}}}",

He said chemo would do more harm than good in my case. I was put on tamoxifen after radiation.  Oncotype test is an excellent tool but it's still just one of many tools used together to figure out treatment. But it's a great indicator for guidance.

However, here's how I look at it. What are the odds that we were the ones that got breast cancer? I've never been sick a day in my life save for occasional cold and flu. No family history, poof, surprise, guess what you have? Percent chance that any of us should have gotten this is very low. So for me, a 2% chance is something I'm willing to risk for side effects, b/c I don't think I even had a 2% chance of getting cancer. So odds weren't in my favor there. So I fgure 2%, well, I'll take it. That being said, I'm lucky and I know it - I have still had no side effects knock on wood. I'm 3 1/2 months out and nothing. But I also always exercised and still do (jazzercise dance aerobics) and I changed my diet to no white sugar no white bread no processed food of any kind, no caffeine, so maybe everything together is helping me with no side effects. Side effects are genetic - you may not metabolize the drug well, you may experience the side effect worse than the next person or not at all. If one person gets a side effect, it's reported.....and hence why you see 5 million things that can happen to you on your prescription label (I'm a pharmacist so this comes with the territory). Most people don't get side effects - you hear from the people who do. Again percentages - most are 1 to 2 % chance of getting which means 98-99% of patients don't have them or don't get them to a horrible degree to where they have to stop the med. That is the exception not the norm. That's why I adamantly post on several threads \"still side effect free\"  - I'm not gloating (trust me I'm happy about it!!!), but I want people to see yes, you don't always get side effects. Also with these meds side effects that do occur often abate within the first few months to a year, so it becomes a tolerability level question. My 2 cents :-) Cheri ",

My oncologist back in Phoenix also thought about using Lupron on me (that's the injectable for 2 years) to supress estrogen production - it's a chemical hysterectomy so to speak. However he normally uses it only on women UNDER 40. But he did consider it for me because like you I'm still pre-menopausal. WAY pre-men. My estrogen levels are still that of a 30 year old it's ridiculous. He looked at my numbers and was like wow, you're nowhere near menopause possibly for another decade. So he said Lupron was something to consider. But he said tamoxifen would still be my best bet. He offered chemo only if I wanted it - mine was 11 and my one tumor was 1.5cm which he considered large. But he said 11 was very low and he won't give chemo normally to any woman whose score is under 20. He said the data shows tamoxifen being the most beneficial if your tumor was very highly positive which mine was (98%, and 99% on progesterone). What was your percentage of ER and PR? That might help make the decision for you. Cheri",

I totally agree, it's very helpful to hear what others went through and what meds you ended up on.  I'm now one year and one month on tamoxifen, no side effects except my period has all but stopped. It went to every 3 months and just last week I had my first one in 5 months. The new medical onc I am seeing here since I moved ran all my hormone levels to compare to pre-lumpectomy levels where I was extremely pre-menopausal. My FSH and LH have finally started going down to peri-menopausal levels but my estrogen is still high. My former oncologist talked about putting me on Lupron or Zoladex injections to shut down my ovaries, so in 2 months at my next checkup with the new onc, she's going to measure again and then decide since my estrogen is still so high. I'm grateful for no side effects from the tamoxifen. Cheri",

I had a lump that felt like a pea or bb bullet in my outer left breast for over a year and a half before I even got it looked in to. Ultrasound was what finally confirmed that it was something that needed to be biopsied....and it did turn out to be cancer. However, it was removed, I had 5 days internal radiation, I didn't need chemo, I just had tumor markers drawn and they were clear....all of this in the last 3 months total. I stayed working full time except for 3 days off for lumpectomy and 5 half days for radiation, I live alone and managed fine....my sentinel lymph nodes ended up being completely clear. I'm not saying all this to scare you, just to prepare you for the worst case scenario. You have a MUCH higher chance that it's benign and a cyst and nothing more!!! Don't forget that! The waiting is horrendous. It took them 9 days over christmas and new years to get my biopsy results. OMG! The waiting was worse than the surgery! I'm not kidding! We all know what that wait is like whatever procedure you're getting done.  Lymph nodes are tricky b/c you can have swollen lymph nodes from many things, even allergies or being exposed to a virus. And others are right who say if you had cancer in your lymph nodes this long....let's just say you woudn't be here typing to us about just now getting checked out. Good luck and keep everyone posted! ",
