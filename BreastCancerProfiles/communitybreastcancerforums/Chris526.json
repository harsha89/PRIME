I just wish there was a book we could go to and it would tell us what to do next. ",

Thank you for all your support.  I started my Xeloda on Tues. and Wed. I had my first Zometa (?) infusion.  I was a little depressed going back to the chemo chairs...I really thought I was ok.

'07 then a mast in Nov., (followed by rads), after a PET/CT scan showed additional tumors in the breast but all else was clean.   The PET/CT I had in May showed the mets.     My onc did base the dx on the PET/CT scan.  What would be the purpose of a liver or lung biopsy?    I am trying to learn but it is so much.  Every new step requires learning new terminology, new tests and results and then the most important part..knowing what questions to ask!!! My onc is starting me on Xeloda alone.  She would rather try one drug at a time - she feels there are more options.  If she gives me two drugs together and they didn't work...she wouldn't know which one didn't work which lessen my choices. Is Xeloda hard to tollerate?  I will also have an infusion once a month for the bone cancer. This is certainly an ongoing process",
