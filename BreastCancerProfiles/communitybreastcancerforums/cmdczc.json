Progesterone is, like estrogen, a steroid hormone (all produced from cholesterol) in a pathway that includes the production of other steroid hormones, including cortisol.  Progesterone is produced in the pathway before (as a precursor) to estrogen, therefore, if you are estrogen +, you should be also progesterone +.  This also explains the correlation with stress and cortisol production with breast cancer.  Progesterone is also stored in adipose tissue, so obesity promotes both estrogen and progesterone production and release, thereby feeding our ER+/PR+ receptor tumors. A vicious cycle... Hope that helps! Cindy (stage IIIa)",

Just had to put my 2 cents in.  I know I am in the minority here, however, and I know there is exploitation by \"pink washing\" throughout retail sales, however, if this leads to increase funding for research, I am for it.   If you look at the funding for the research presented at the San Antonio meeting, you will see Komen funding.  If you look at the research funding on the Komen website, it goes to solid basic molecular research.  This is where I believe a cure will be found in my lifetime, at least to the majority of bc (with the advent of knowledge about the subtypes, it is now known that this is a myriad of diseases).  300 million was given to basic research by Komen in 2012.  Should it be more? Maybe, but it goes to quality research at name institutions that can get their work published.  Look at clinicaltrials.gov, and look at the number of breast cancer active trials, almost 4500, way more than other devastating cancers, such as pancreatic or glioblastoma.  This is where the targeted therapies will come from that will have the most effect against this disease.  I work in the field and the changes in diagnosis and staging of breast cancer has evolved at such a more rapid pace than in other cancers, and it is due to the public awareness that has been brought forward by the Making Strides Against Cancer, Komen, etc.   Personally, I also appreciate the support my friends and family show when they walk and clap and cheer.   So, anyway, just had to give the opposing viewpoint.  Thanks to everyone who has donated to the cause, and yes, I own pink socks and a pink spatula!
