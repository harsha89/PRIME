I'm going to read your post several times as I learn more about what I'm going to be taking.  I did find the August 08 thread last night and we've already started getting to know eachother.  I appreciate all your suggestions.  I've learned a lot the last few days but I have a long way to go.  I will pop in occasionally to get some advise from the experts.  I'll be praying for all of you.  Good night",
