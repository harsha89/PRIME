My girlfriend had a bilateral mastectomy and she told me the sentinel lymph node was more painful than the bmx.  She is doing better, but its taken her six months to get there. The painkillers get me through the night, but I feel so restricted because it was done on the side I write with. I guess if all we had was a lumpectomy, we should be grateful. If I knew though that it was going to be this bad, I might have passed on the procedure. Sorry no solutions on this end, just ranting alongside you. ",
