We want to feel good again and we don't want to wait. I know everyone kept telling me give it time. I know at 4 weeks I still was having leg pain and not feeling energy wise up to par. Every day you will get stronger and less pain. Just don't overdo and try not to get discouraged.",

Me too.  When I kept telling you I wasnt eating because nothing tasted good or wasn't able to sleep you all just seemed like it was no big deal.  Thank Goodness I didn't do something drastic while I wasnt myself and yeah you are right I wasnt my nails fell apart and I couldnt paint them and yeah I had no hair and the reason I wasnt wearing my cute clothes was they didnt fit anymore thanks to chemo and plus I needed my sweats and sweatshirts because I was freezing and still am.  I plan on saying something when I go back next as it was then I was just ready to get the last treatment on the road but would have been nice to have know back then she was worried and heard some good advice from her.   ",
