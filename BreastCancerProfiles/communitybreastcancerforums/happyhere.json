I've been sewing children's clothing for 11 years and I cannot come up with a good solution that could be custom made. So that is my hesitation on going down this road of having a garment made.  It's a tough area to get compression and movement without a binding seam.  It's the area at the 10 o'clock position (on left arm) from the armpit that swells and gets painful from the sleeve and cami.",

      "Content": "happyhere wrote: Has anyone found that compression garmets help them with truncal lymphedema?  And is there anything recommendation for something that is not custom made? The main area affected is the upper half of my left arm, arm pit area, left chest area through to my back and shoulder.  I have almost no swelling issues from my mid-upper arm down to my fingers. I wear my sleeve, but where the sleeve ends on my upper arm is the area with the swelling occurs.  So the end of the sleeve gets tight by late afternoon.  I tried one of the slimming camis but my arm pit/area between breast and arm has swelling.  The arm hole of the cami irritates this area. The only suggestion from my compression garmet fitter is to try the cami or the next option is something custom made.  Before I go the custom route, wanted to see if anyone had tried anything else.

After all the worry, I had no problems.  I only wore a sleeve and gauntlet on the plane (it's all I have, truncal part is new).  Made sure I drank a ton of water, no coffee or soda.   While on vacation, we did a ton more hiking, fishing and walking than I normally do and by the end of our trip most of the swelling was gone.  So either the lull of symptoms occurred because of timing from the massage or because I was more active than normal.  Now that I have been back at work for a week, the swelling has started again.  I am wondering if my sedentary work life at a computer is affecting the LE.  Going to try and get more active and see if that helps.",
