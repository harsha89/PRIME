    "Content": "Charles_Pelkey wrote: Okay, small, small observation regarding the name of this particular forum: \"High risk women.\" I know that men constitute a small, small segment of the breast cancer community, but there are a significant number of us that fall into that \"high risk\" category, due to - at least in my case - being BRCA2 positive. No, I am not complaining. Nearly 99% of breast cancer patients are women and I have, on more than one occasion, jokingly referred to myself as \"one of the girls,\" because of the unusual frequency of my cancer in my gender. But, humor aside, I cringe at times when the default label for all breast cancer patients is \"woman.\" It's not recognition that we need, but the very basicÂ awareness that the risk exists in all of us. Absent some level of knowledge of the risks faced by all humans, men (and medical professionals) will continue to ignore signs that, in a woman, would set off all of the appropriate alarm bells. I think that the past 30 years have shown that awareness saves lives. The absence of that awareness can prove to be fatal. In my case, I was sadly pre-armed with that awareness, solely because my favorite uncle had died of Stage IV breast cancer. Twenty years later, I found an inexplicable lump and got the bad news ... albeit at Stage II. I hope it doesn't take direct involvement with a loved one's death to raise the warning that all of us \u2015 men and women \u2015 have to heed signs, weigh risks and seek sound medical advice when we discover something unusual. Breast cancer is not just a women's disease. It's something about which all of us need to be aware. Okay, speech over. I will return my soapbox to the corner. Charles F.
