I just wanted my life back so I traveled all over Europe. It was on a trip in April that I suddenly could no longer walk. I was sent home with a nurse escort business class by my travel insurance company. A Orthopedic doctor found the cancer in my hip and said it had to come from somewhere. I told him about my breast. My oncologist contacted a surgeon and she did a biopsy. I a'm walking and driving now. I was in a wheelchair. Then a walker. I use a cane ,but I can walk without it.I am now undergoing radiation for my breast after a mastectomy. I do not feel sick. Nothing hurts and the only pain medication I take is Tylenol. My oncologist went on to say that I will live to be an old lady. I have not had any chemo but I will be taking a hormone therapy pill the rest of my life.
