I have my apt with the surgeon tomorrow but I am still very confused. I have had my biopsy but no MRI or CT so I don't know if I should believe the stage she has told me. Can they tell this from just a biopsy, mamo & us? Please help",

I am only a small step ahead of you in my journey but please believe me that this group is exactly where you need to be. I have never been one to join online groups before this, but this has helped get my feelings and fears out of my head and give me the strength to move on to the next step. Jackbirdie thank you for your words of encouragement, they do mean a great deal coming from someone who has been down this road. I now have a little more information, and as many of you have stated, a peace and acceptance settles in as you prepare for the next leg of the journey. I am little frustrated, as I had my biopsy done at a small hospital and the ER/PR HER were not included on the pathology sent to my surgeon. My BS contacted the hospital 3 times during my appointment to get these results, but to no avail we still did not have them at the end of my appointment, before I left I was told not to worry, they would get them and get back with me in the next day or she would retest immediately. I now understand that the reason for stage 2 without surgery or mri, my BS explained that this was because of the tumor size alone, and may change as we learn more. The lack of complete information of course has now left me with many new questions, as far as a treatment plan. Glad that there is an up side, I finally slept 7 hours last night (the first full night since that awful phone call) and feeling refreshed and ready to fight this.",

It feels like every emotion I have is active at the same time. My NP did not have any additional pathology information yet but wanted me to know asap so I could absorb the shock. Well here I am 3 days later, and still in shock, still mad as hell and even more confused then ever. All I've been told is the details will trickle in over 7-10 days, and that she is going to set me up an appt with the surgeon at our area cancer hospital. I am a firm believer that information is power and feel so helpless that I do not have much information yet. I've been reading through many of the inspirational stories on the site and already know how fortunate I am to have found you all.

Just keeping myself busy, went back to work Saturday (I've been on a week of vacation to mentally sort things through) Getting back into my everyday routine has helped a lot. It is still hard at night, I'm sure I am not alone. I have always been the first one up in the house usually 2-3 hours before anyone. This has always been my alone time. That time seems to be my worst enemy right now. Angtee15 Sorry to hear about your dx, this just sucks at our age. My husband and I just moved a year ago into a new house, dream location but the house need a bit of updating. Our plan was to buy it now and get the updates done before we retire. Talked it over for a year and finally decide to take the leap. Funny how you can line up all your little ducks in a row then life can just throw a bowling ball at them and scatter them all over. Feel free to pm me if you just want to talk, you are NOT alone in this. Zaborowski So sorry to hear about your dx and about your mother, I lost my father to cancer, although it was not bc. It is still something that always was able to creep in and haunt my dreams. I have always been a matter of fact type of person and if it was my sister I would probably tell her that when she has cancer the choice would be hers to make. Right now this is all about me and what I can live with. It sounds like you did exactly what I would have done, never feel bad about it. Don't let her pressure you into making the decision she wants, do your research and make the decision based on what YOU want. I do not plan on having a second opinion. I am very comfortable with my bs. She is at our area cancer center (MD Anderson affiliated) and a bc survivor herself. I instantly felt comfortable around her and for me that is very important. I am also undecided on surgery, so many things to weigh. Recovery time, future surgeries, chance of it returning, survival rates. Oh the options. Take care and stay in touch I did have my first \"ignorant\" comment yesterday. My dear sister-in-law called last night to ask how my first day back at work went. I then replied that I was tired but it was nice to have normalcy. Her response was \"See you are going to be fine, just keep on working\" I was speechless for a sec and then told her Sweetie, this isn't like a cold that you can just work through. I am still sick and need treatment to get better. So glad I nipped that one when I did. She apologized and we went back to normal conversations. Later she called me and apologized again and said she is just scared for me and never meant that I could magically get better through working. Our relationship has survived and probably has improved some now.",

I have absolutely no family history. I do not even know a person who has been through it. I suppose I should feel blessed to be able to say both of those things, which I do but it also makes me feel quite alone in it. I am so glad I found this group/community of people to share with. Thank you again for your support now and in the rest of my detour",
