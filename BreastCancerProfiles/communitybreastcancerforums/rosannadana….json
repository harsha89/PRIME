I was very anxious about the prospect of having to have chemo, but my doctor did not recommend it. I also went for a second opinion at a well-known cancer center and the medical oncologist there said I definitely was not a candidate for chemotherapy. That was a huge relief, as I felt that 17 was awfully close to 18, the bottom end of the \"intermediate\" range, and everything I had read said if yr score falls in the intermediate range, it is up to you and your doctor to decide. Having the 2nd opinion agree with my doc, and being so definite about no benefit to chemo for me was such a relief. I hope you can find some peace with whatever decision you make. My Dx is IDC, lumpectomy, getting ready for radiation and then an aromatase inhibitor for 5 to 10 yrs. the 2nd opinion doc said the endocrine therapy for 5 to 10 yrs is the most important part of my treatment. i wish you well!",
