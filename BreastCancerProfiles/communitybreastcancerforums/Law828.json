I am in treatment right now and I don't wear perfume or smelly scents, so if there is a bad smell......oh oh. I read that a lady undergoing chemo treatment for breast cancer stage 4 puts out a bad odor and was \"banned\" from attending activities with her 3 girls at school. The teachers claim her smell is nauseating and the principle said his mother had the same bad smell when she was going though chemo. I don't mind staying away from people to spare them, but the holidays are coming up and I will be close to family and friends. I think what that school in Albq. NM is doing is cruel or there must be more than what the media is reporting, but that little part is questioning if I smell bad.

It makes me happy to see that the treatment has shown positive results for both of you.  You are giving me lots of hope and strength to be strong...Thank You",

I can never find bras that fit right, my left side sags now due to wearing bras with no support. It took me two years to find a bathing suit. I'm 5' 5\" and weigh 190 with most of it in my tummy area. Reconstruction and radiation doctors both said the only option would be for me to have the diep going thru my mid section. My tests and scans have all been good since April of last year and when I spoke to my oncologist, he said I am good to go and to live like I am cancer free. My liver counts went up right before I was diagnosed and went higher when I was in chemo the first time. My pet read that I have a fatty liver, but after the mets and 2nd round of chemo my liver counts are very normal. After reading RonnieKay's experience, it scares me. My option would of been to have both removed and I could not get anyone to sign off on it for my surgeon to schedule me. And my 2nd oncologist told me that all mid section fat produces estrogen. That is what caused me to schedule my surgery. I am currently scheduled in October and I will be going back and fourth with my decision.",

So happy for you and thank you for sharing because I too came searching long ago to see how many survivors there are hoping that I could be one of them one day. Today I am here and a survivor since 2011 and again 2013. I will find out next month if I am cancer free. I feel I AM cancer free and that is what I am sticking too. I live with a positive attitude, focus on what works and forget what didn't, stay stress free (and when I can't I exercise hard till the stress is out or craft), I really try hard to drink lots of water because I believe water flushes the bad cells and keeps them from planting in my organs or anywhere else.

Chickadee, did you start to feel awful right away?  Did it get worst as time went on?  No appetite or nausea?  I guess I'm trying to set up a plan in my head so that I won't want to quit the treatment or have the dosage lowered.  My doctor feels 40 mg of ixempra may be too much and will reduced it if I start to feel bad.  I don't want to reduce it, instead I want to prepare myself to just deal with it (it wont be forever, though I'm sure it feels like it is).  ",
