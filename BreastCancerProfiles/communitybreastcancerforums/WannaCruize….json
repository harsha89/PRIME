Today the breast surgeon gave my daughter a referral to a plastic surgeon that she works closely with to discuss the options for reconstruction. I'm trying hard not to direct her decision, but want to make sure we are talking through all pros & cons so she (hopefully) can come to a decision that she is confident in. I found a thread that Beesie made laying out what to consider between lumpectomy, uni-MX and bi-MX that i'll print out for her. Despite being bald, with no eyelashes or eyebrows, she's very upbeat and feeling very strong right now, so she wants to get this surgery scheduled and behind her so she can recover, enjoy some summer, and get back to work. I'm just trying to make sure we consider everything, and don't make too hasty of a decision.",

      "Content": "Apr 2, 2013 09:27PM - edited Apr 2, 2013 09:38PM by WannaCruize Ok, I'm back with a few more questions. I thought of asking on the regular surgical threads, but because my 32 yr old DD was IBC Stage IV at diagnosis, that colors some of our questions. We met with the plastic surgeon today, and she talked Tami through her choices, but the overriding message is that the best decision in her case would be to NOT do immediate reconstruction, or even have tissue expanders in yet. Just do the total mastectomy, wait to heal, and then as long as she is still 'stable', look to the reconstruction. She talked about being able to use the same scar, put in a small tissue expander in a minimal surgery, no drains, etc. Then expand for a month or two. Then go in again though the scar and place the implant. DD wants to end up with small 'b's, as she has lived her whole life with huge, unwieldy boobs on a very small frame. The big concern is leaving too much skin behind, as some of it on the left is still showing some IBC symptoms, i.e. pitted skin, inflammation. After a lot of discussion, DD is comfortable with that decision but is still adamant (with my agreement) that she wants a BMX even with no evidence of cancer on the right side. She has treated her cancer very aggressively since diagnosis in August, and it has worked very well for her so far. Here is my question. Because of being stage IV already, we don't see the value of having any lymph nodes removed. Why heighten the risk of lymphedema if we already know it has escaped from the breast, and it will not change her treatment plan either way? The one inflamed node in her armpit has resolved with chemo. It is overly risky to leave it in, or any of them? We would appreciate the pros & cons. If there is a better place to post this, please let me know. Just looking to gain the wisdom of the wonderful ladies here. Looking at surgery in about two weeks, DD just wants it done so she doesn't have to stress about what might be lurking in there.",

I guess I'm just looking for reassurance since we're treated her IBC aggressively so far, with great results, that we aren't choosing to be conservative at the risk of causing more problems down the line. I'm finding a few more references to other Stage IV patients NOT have any auxillary nodes removed during mastectomy, so that's a relief that we're aren't the only one questioning the benefit of removing them at this stage.  It's not something that can just be asked in the general surgery threads, because anyone NOT Stage IV already should have either SND and/or ALND done.  I just know since she is so active, (softball player her whole life), I know she hated being relegated to the bench during chemo and just got back on the field (albeit in a 'protected' position and having a runner when she gets on base). It seems to us that greatly increasing risk of developing lymphedema at her age (32) withoug some significant benefit is hard to justify.  We've mentioned it to the surgeon and she agreed, but it was just kind of in passing, so I want to be sure we keep expressing it in these pre-op meetings to make sure we are all on the same page.  If the surgeon disagrees, that's fine, but she needs to specifically articulate the reasons why making that decision is risky.",

I've been lurking here since August, obsessively learning all I can about this damn disease, ever since my 32 year old DD was diagnosed. IBC with bone mets, Stage 4 fresh out of the gate, ER+, HER2-. She's done some reading here at BCO, and other places, but a lot of it was overwhelming at first, so she's delegated me to do most of the research and relay the info to her. She's got a great oncologist, very straightforward, which my DD appreciates, and she has moved forward very aggressively with her treatment. She's had 4 rounds of AC, and 12 weekly Taxol, ending on 2/15. Just repeated all her scans and got great results. Dramatic improvement in all areas, resolution of many of the bone mets, and much less skin thickening, etc. We are SO grateful that she responded so well to chemo, but now we are at a crossroads. She started Tamoxifen 2 days ago, and got a referral to the surgeon, which my DD was very happy for, because before now the ONC was hesitant to even discuss the topic. Just met the breast surgeon today, and the recommended step was MX for the left breast, with BMX if DD prefers, and just continue hormonals for now. She's recommending holding off radiation so it is fully available in case of progression. She's also agreed with our questioning the need for ALND, since we know for a fact that the BC is 'out of the gate already', and since the one swollen aux node has resolved with chemo, just to watch it for now. That greatly eased my DD's qualms regarding the risk for LE from BMX. Surgeon referred DD to a plastic surgeon to discuss immediate reconstruction w/small implant. She has very large breasts, and wants to end up with much smaller ones, for sure. I guess the questions we still are kicking around are because of the IBC along with Stage IV. From what I've read, usually that means delayed reconstruction, because it seems most get radiation right after surgery. Is it crazy to even consider having immediate reconstruction with a small implant?",
