It was diagnosed at the age of 42 as a fibroadenoma measuring a little over 1.3cm more/less. Now 2 years later, it has grown to 2.8cm and, because of my age and clinical findings (painful, sore, etc) they are recommending removal. Due to finances and the doubt that removal is actually needed (as 2 previous biopsies have confirmed it be benign - One biopsy was discordant causing inflammation/infection and the second one was benign), I'm really not wanting to undergo the procedure which is scheduled Jan 11. I'm perimenopausal and I've read these things can regress (not resolve) on their own over time. My breast surgeon has diagnosed: diffuse cystic mastophy of right breast, family history of malignant neoplasm of breast, and neoplasm of uncertain behavior of right breast. My concern is the report. The histapathology depicts 3 different findings and being that this is all so new, meaning, I've never paid attention to this in the past - I'm wondering if this sounds normal. The first was A) Fibroadenoma, B) Fibrosclerosis, and C) Negative for atypical hyerplasia, in situ carcinoma, and invasive carcinoma. I've researched a little about fibrosclerosis and it seems to be what's called sclerosing lobular adenosis which is believed to be linked to a higher cancer diagnosis. However, being that nothing had been done with that information for the past 2 years, I'm curious who can provide additional information and thoughts if doing anything at this point is a necessary option. And to confirm that sclerosing lobular adenosis is indeed linked to a higher cancer diagnosis. Like most people on this forum, cancers run in my family - Grandma - breast cancer, Aunt - breast cancer, cousin - breast cancer, sister - uterine cancer, Aunt - ovarian cancer, uncle - prostate/testicular cancer. Logically, everyone repeatedly has said to remove for peace of mind. While I understand that statement and appreciate that information, my concern are the finances and the \"down time\" - I'm trying to avoid both if I could. I'm well aware that just because cancers run in the family doesn't mean you are too. Thank you to all that have responded to previous posts. I just need a lot of direction at this point.

My appointment consultation was ok but left some nagging doubts. The surgeon is recommending wire excision removal. She says the tumor is surrounded/embedded by cysts, which is probably why the first biopsy became \"infected\" because the surgeon believes the doctor ruptured the cyst when doing the first biopsy. The second biopsy was benign but the surgeon explained they are just taking a \"core\" sample of the tumor and that the tumor itself is composed of many cells, which may exhibit cancer/precancer cells within different areas. She wants to remove the entire tumor and surrounding cysts and send it as a whole for biopsy so they can \"dissect\" then entire area. The cysts depict a mix of fluid/solid components. The surgeon believes the tumor itself has not grown that the last imaging facility may have taken cyst measurements into consideration with the tumor, which is why it appears bigger this time around. She is still recommending removal. I'm confused at this point. They are suppose to get pre-authorization from my insurance and call by next week to proceed. My nagging doubt is that, at the end of the day, she is a surgeon and she is \"paid\" to perform/cut into you. I don't know if this procedure is in my best nature, or unfortunately, in this day in age, she is protecting herself should anything ever arise of this one day. I worry that the imaging facility I went to may be more aggressive in overdiagnosing. I don't know what to do. Feeling very uneasy about the situation. Deb ",

I didn't want to wait and watch initially but I've had this for the past 2 years and recently have gone to a new imaging facility so I'm wondering if they're overly aggressively diagnosing - they rated me a BIRAD 4.

The surgeon said it's my choice so I don't feel the urge/need to even do the procedure at this point. I feel at this time, it's a waste of time, money and worry - people say to listen to your \"gut feeling\" and I don't feel like it's absolutely needed. I keep reading that fibroadenomas can resolve on their own; and again, I don't feel this is a phyllodes - simply because: 1 - the surgeon stated she didn't think it looked like one and 2 - the measurements and the fact it doesn't have a lot of the characteristics most woman talk about (growing very quickly in a short time - mine \"grew\" these past 2 years and surgeon is thinking the facility included cysts in the final measurements and it certainly doesn't feel disfiguring or warm to the touch).

I had the chance to talk to the radiologist at the new imaging facility from my last visit and asked if he'd realized I'd already had 2 previous biopsies - he did not. I'm a little unsettled that this facility doesn't seem very thorough because I repeatedly told my tech, included this in my new patient paperwork AND they obtained all copies/studies from previous facility. But ok, whatever, he didn't get that memo I guess. He said if I can mail the pathology reports, he will include an addendum with that new finding and will agree that another biopsy is not needed (Yay!). The second part of my question - did he include cysts in measurements or was it just the fibroadenoma itself - as it is bigger this time around. He said fibroadenomas can grow and that this one indeed had grown - he said it displays solid/cystic masses within it but still feels it's B9. I'm happy to hear that of course. The breast surgeon office was going to consult with my previous imaging facility and have them compare with their previous images with these images taken and see if they can come to the same agreement (that it has grown or stayed the same size). If it is the same size and the new facility is wrong (because so far, I'm not too impressed with their protocol) - I will cancel my Jan 11 surgery - if it's bigger - I'll be back to the drawing board to decide if I'm doing the right thing (watch and wait or \"cut it out\").

I had been on the forum previously because I was diagnosed at the age of 42 with a fibroadenoma - which always seemed odd to me as I have been actively been screened for the past 10 years for other issues and have been advised this is normally a \"young womens disease\". I had a discordant biopsy the first time, which caused inflammation and fever and had to redo after a round of antibiotics. The second one cleared. Now I'm wondering if it was possible that maybe the second biopsy wasn't taken from the same area of concern? Now fast forward 2 years later, and the lump is still there but has grown. My ultrasound/mammo now reads Birad 4 - suspicion of phyllodes tumor. This makes a little better sense to me because of my age? I'm so confused. I really do not want to undergo a biopsy of the same area that was done 2 years ago in which I had a horrible experience. I'm contemplating meeting with a breast surgeon to have it removed once and for all.

I am so very worried that my hormones are out of whack. From breast issues to menstrual issues. Beesie, I know you are very actively involved in reading these posts. I value your input and feedback. Have you ever come across anyone in the past with these very same symptoms or even close to. I know you always say not to borrow trouble. In my case, it's a matter of not being caught offguard and covering all possiblities. I am very worried. I appreciate everyone's feedback.",

It's just nice to be able to reach to others and share/hear your stories and, most importanly, not feel so alone. I did get more information regarding pelvic ultrasound, they actually want to evaluate me for possible endometrial polyp versus endometrial neoplasm with scant amount of free fluid in the cul de sac with retroflexed and retroverted, moderately enlarged uterus. My next breast follow up is July 9th. I will tell them of my continued pain and lump and my endo issues too. I have also recently noticed on my left aerola area that I have a small round purplish, bruise looking area that was not there before. Suggestions/recommendations appreciated again. THANK YOU ALL AGAIN!!!!!",

My lumpectomy was done around the 9 o'clock area (didn't know if that's relevant info). A million \"Thank you's\"!!!!! Worried/concerned. Log in to post a reply",

I'm so grateful for everyone here on these boards and I want to thank all for your support. I hope everyone is doing well too. God Bless you all. Deb",
