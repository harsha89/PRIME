Didn't mean to provide inaccurate info, but since I was an NCI comprehensive cancer center administrator for many years, I [perhaps incorrectly] assumed that the likely \"stop\" after learning of node-positive status would be a medical oncologist, who is usually the coordinator of tx. I suggest you ask him/her to draw you a decision tree as s/he explains, which outlines decision points/tx options at each step along the way. I remember that my med onc did this on my first visit after I got off the exam table, dressed and was seated ... by raising the exam table--which is covered in disposable white paper--o the seated position, and drawing on the paper that covered the upright surface as if it were an easel. (It's a take-home.) All the best, Donna",
