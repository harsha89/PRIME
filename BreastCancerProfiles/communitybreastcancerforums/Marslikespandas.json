    "Content": "Marslikespandas wrote: Hello! So over been having pain/discomfort in my left breast and underarm. It hasn't been very bad, but uncomfortable. I thought it was from gaining weight and not being used to having cushion there. It's been getting worse enough for me to stay worrying, and yesterday I made an appt. I went today, and the dr noticed something there, but isn't quite sure what. He is sending me to get an ultrasound tomorrow. I'm trying not to worry, but it's hard not to when the pain reminds me, haha. I have never been to this doctor before, so I'm not sure if he just has really good bedside manner, or if he really thinks it's nothing to worry about. I just don't know what to think, or how to feel. I feel silly for being worried and emotional when the doctor didn't seem worried, but at the same time I know something is wrong, even if it's not cancer. Dr said so too, he said we still need to figure out what is wrong so this pain and the thing he found can go away.... Log in to post a reply",
