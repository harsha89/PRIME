I just found out Friday that my PET scan showed many liver tumors, after being nearly NED six months ago. My oncologist is having a liver biopsy done, to see if I've changed from ER+, to ER- or Hr2+. This might be something to have checked to see if you are still being treated properly. You don't mention that you have had IV chemo. Abraxane worked really well to kick my liver tumors back. Have you had any DNA testing done, to see what treatments will work the best on your tumor type? I'm waiting right now, to hear what my next treatment will be. I'm feeling scared too, you're not alone. I wish you great success with the new med. Prayers to you and your family. Best, Melani    ",

I could only take the Faslodex. My tumor markers jumped 56 points during that month! It appears that the Ibrance makes the Faslodex work somehow. I will be interested in what my TM's are next month.
