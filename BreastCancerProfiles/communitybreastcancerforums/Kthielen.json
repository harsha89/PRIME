I will start on an AI at some point as well, was on Anastrazole so will switch to something else.  Kathy ",

It is painless, you just lay on a table and the camera moves around you making clicking noises. It is state of the art and a precise radiation therapy. I live in AZ also! Who is you Rad Onc? I went to Dr Youseff at Barrow's Insitute at St Joe's. I also have a liver spot that I might do Cyberknife to. God bless, Kathy",
