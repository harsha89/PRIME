I'm very scared about the surgery (never had to be put under) and also the wire localization before the surgery. I've heard everything from \"barely felt it\" to \"worst pain ever\". Can I hear some reassuring stories about the surgery and wire localization please? I'm really scared. Also my mom had surgery and she had woken up during the surgery and I don't want that to happen to me. Thanks so much.
