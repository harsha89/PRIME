My surgery went well.  It is day 9 and I got my drains out today.   Pain was okay until day 4, then it hit me hard.  By day 6 the MX pain was fine, the lymph node dissection is really painful, and nerves cut in dissection causing pretty intense arm pain.  By day 6 full extension of both arms without pain.  Still on pain pills day 9 for arm and dissection pain.  So in a nutshell that was my experience so far. Great news... I had chemo before surgery.  Started January 2010, carboplatin, taxotere, herceptin every 3 weeks, 6 treatments total.  Prior to starting chemo, I had 4 cancerous tumors - 2 of which were lymph nodes - and a total of more than 110mm of cancerous tumors.  At surgery they found only one tumor at 1.3mm!!!!!  Chemo kicked butt!  All 12 nodes rmoved from axillary levels I & II were negative!!!! level II had scar tissue where cancer was!   Good healing and good luck to those of you still pending surgery.  Hang tough!",

I hope you can use the info to find your \"almost cure.\" Very promising clinical trials show that over time almost all patients can become 100% pain free. The nerves sometimes grow back, but ya just get them burned off again.  This IS our hope and answer to millions of prayers. I encourage anyone with PMPS to become so well versed on the procedure that you can whip out the yellow pages and start going down the list of pain doctors near you. I live out where Jesus lost his sandals and have been to 5 cities and 3 states to get some help... I think time also helped. The fact that clinical trials are starting based on anecdotal information from patients like me is so promising that I don't think there is any reason for any of us to suffer... and I had over 14 infections in my mastectomy site, 21 surgeries and even 5 transplants of stem cells to help relieve the pain. None of those brought the relief the rhizotomy did.  We must take charge of our own health care and advocate for ourselves. My prayers and best wishes to everyone suffering PMPS. I'm on vacation in a hot humid city and oh my hell, the pain is crazy. I'll be glad to get back to the mountains and have my pain cut in half. Hugs and so much love to y all. I feel you, I've been there and am living proof there is help. Bexter",

      "Content": "Jul 18, 2014 02:30AM - edited Jul 18, 2014 02:39AM by Bexter3 hello sisters. I posted a while back about finally finding a pain specialist willing to take on my post mastectomy pain syndrome. Four years of excruciating pain, four years of never sleeping longer than 2 hours straight, 42 total doctors, and 12 pain specialists later my post mastectomy pain has gone from an unbearable, considered suicide daily as a solution to 5 days out of 7 very tolerable pain - still hurts, especially when weather changes or an active day BUT I am sleeping, and even dreaming again. Anyway, I had so many private messages wanting more specifics, I thought I'd share some reading articles, research and the lingo, or terminology, used for the procedure I had. First, it was not a nerve block and the diagnostic test (and actual procedure) to see if the nerves were responsible for the pain involves laying on a table, getting doped up while the doctor uses so high profile X-ray type machine (chemo ate the name of the machine) to see where the responsible nerves come out of the spine, s/he then manipulates the area with a thin pointy instrument. If touching the nerve replicates your pain, then you can have the procedure.... So here we go... Please don't think I am talking down to any of you, but to be truly educated about this miracle option, it's important to know the terminology and definitions. My 12th pain specialist said there was nothing that could be done, I started crying, thanked him for his time and started to leave. He said... Of course we could try a \"RADIO FREQUENCY ABLATION OF THE INTERCOSTAL BRACHIAL NERVES.\"  The nerves that often get damaged in a mastectomy and/or lymphendectomy are called the intercostal and/or intercostal brachial nerves. These come out of the spinal column at the vertebrae, specifically (in my case the rib cage and armpit area) the THORACIC VERTEBRAE. They wrap around, up and/or over to the front --- and yes, one travels the shoulder blade. They cannot simply be seen at the spine because they travel out of the FACET JOINT AT THE SPINE. Radio frequency ablation means they use high UHF, or VHF, (darn chemo brain) radio frequency waves to cauterize (burn) the nerves where they come out of the spinal facet joint. (Don't worry you won't need antennae or rabbit ears, LOL). For me Thoracic nerve joints at T-1 through T-8. A total of 8 different vertebrae and nerves, were the ones that were damaged and caused the feelings of a butcher knife being stabbed in my arm pit, or 20 ice picks being slammed in my chest, phantom pains, ice cold bb's streaming, etc. Once the diagnostic test was done and he replicated the exact pains I had been experiencing, he knew the ablation would work. From then on, he used the term RHIZOTOMY to describe the procedure. Here is some stuff from the web that can help explain anything I missed. As I've told the numerous private messaging ladies, I'm not a doctor, I tried every possible treatment and drug out there. I still take pain medications - OxyContin low base dose and Percocet for breakthrough pain for the soft tissue damage. If you have PMPS, you already know you can take as much narcotics or opioids allowed and it doesn't even touch the nerve pain! I also take an antidepressants known to help nerve pain (Lyrica, Gabapentin, Noratryptaline are all examples - I am currently on a drug holiday from mine noratryptaline because it makes me fat and sleepy and helped speed up bladder cancer caused by Carboplatin).  I only had my right side T2-T8 cauterized, but need T-1 and at least 4 on the left side done because I still have a lot of pain in my right armpit and also pain on the left side. Here's the reading. Google \"post mastectomy pain intercostal radio frequency ablation\" or \"mastectomy pain ablation\" or \"post mastectomy pain rhizotomy\" or any combination, for more info. Good luck and don't stop talking to docs until you get some relief! http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC299044... http://nci.cu.edu.eg/lectures/Book%20Breast%20Canc... Start reading at page 232 http://medind.nic.in/iad/t06/i5/iadt06i5p375.pdf Read radio frequency ablation on page 387 If some of the links don't work, again just google the terms, you'll find lots to read. Good luck and please message me if you need more info. Bexter",

I never slept longer than 2 hours before I had my first one April 2014. Now I am finally mostly pain free in between treatments. It literally saved my life. I had my entire funeral planned and after seeing the 11th pain specialist, he agreed to \"try something outside of the box.\" They've done it for years for back pain sufferers. I simply have the nerves that were damaged by the bilateral mastectomy and lymphendectomy burned off where they come out of the spine. Thoracic Vertabrae facet joints T 2-5 on right side and T 2-4 on the left. It hurt like hell, but the prize is minimal pain for 6 months or so, however long it takes for the nerves to regenerate.
