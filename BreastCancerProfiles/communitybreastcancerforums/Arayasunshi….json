And unfortunately, I know that there are many of you who can relate to how I feel.  Thank You so much for all your support, I really apprecaite it. =) ",

I live in Edmonton...my family are in Newfoundland, and my boyfriend's family are in British Columbia.  My boyfriend works away up North, 2 weeks on, 2 weeks off.  Believe me when I say there are days I feel like a single mom.  My mom spent all summer here, all of October, and 3 weeks in December.  When she came in December, it was because I was going through radiation, and we thought that would be the best time for her to come.  We didn't anticipate me being in all this pain now. *Sigh.*  I told my boyfriend that If I ever had to go through chemo, or radiation again, I was moving back to NL, or BC where I would have alot of family support.  My friends here have been good to me though...but I feel like I call the same people over and over, and I'm just so tired of asking for help.  I feel like there is always something going on, and I'm tired and feel like I'm constantly complaining. Today, my ribs started to hurt...on the left side, (I had radiation on my right side) It hurts when I take a breath, and I don't know what I did.   I think it's time to start looking for a sitter though...someone who I can call up with little notice, to watch my daughter, even for a couple of hours during the week, while my bf is working away.  Most of the time, I'm ok.  I'm so distracted with taking care of her, that I don't have time to feel anything, but some other days, I feel like everything is happening all at once, and it breaks me.  I love my boyfriend dearly, but there are days I'm so angry with him, because he's away.  It's been a really rough 7 months.   I'm so happy to have found this board.  Thanks for letting me rant....",

I hate throwing up.  Boyfriend will be home in less then a week, I can't wait.  Is nauscia a side effect from Tamoxifen, or maybe it's from Tylenol 3? Although, if it were a Tamoxifen side effect, wouldn't it have happened sooner, I've been taking them since November?  I have to wait one more week to get the results from my CT and bone scan.  I'm trying to be optimistic about it, but I'm scared.  Hopefully I will have awesome news to share with everybody then. =) xo!

I've been doing some of the stretches/poses at home, and find they help.  Next week, the instructor is bringing me dvds so I can follow at home between classes. I have felt so much better the past few days.  It helps that our weather is getting nicer and the snow and ice are melting.  I saw my dr. today, and told him I stopped taking the percocet because they weren't helping, and he suggested I continue to use the tylenol 4s if they work better.  (They don't work, really.) I'm just going to take it one week at a time, and see how this \"pain\" plays out.  Ugh. I hate the pain days.  Cheers!",

I'm not even done my shopping.  Thank God for Good friends...my BFF offered to finish my shopping for me.  \"You stay home until this infection is cleared up, or you'll be too sick to enjoy your Christmas.\" I'm also fortunate enough that my mom and dad came up from NL, and they keep my 14 month old daughter entertained and busy so I can rest.  EVERYTIME I go for anything where I need an IV, it never works on the first try.  It takes a few attempts, sometimes from 2 or 3 nurses.  I want to yell at them sometimes because I think they should know how to do it. But then I think they'll be mean to me, and 8 more months is a long time to go for Herceptin with nurses who don't like you.  I was under the impression, that I could not have a port, seeing that chemo is done, and the herceptin iv is so much smaller.  When I go see my Onc again, I'll have to mention it to him...is it my onc that I would have to mention it to?  Beth...Yes, I live in Edmonton.  Aren't the roads just terrible right now??? my onc. is Dr. Feton...at the Cross.  I like him.  Dr. Hamilton at University done my surgery.  He was awesome.   I'm going to try to rest lots this weekend, and drink lots of fluids.  Hopefully I can get rid of this in a day or so.  I really need to strenghten my immune system.  I have tickets for Sunday night for \"The Singing Christmas Tree\" and I want to go!  Hope you all have a nice weekend.
