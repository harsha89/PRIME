Holly - how is your arm?  My fingers have been swelling every night for about 3 weeks now (even when elevated), but I haven't seen anyone about LE yet.  I will, it's just been too much right now.",

Saw a different RO today before treatment and my skin dryness and flakyness is definately unusual.  He recommended switching to Aquaphor, which I am not thrilled with as it is so greasy.  I will see my RO today before treatment as they want to keep a close eye on it.  At least it doesn't itch, yet anyways. I'm glad my Radiation Center has a light display to look at on the ceiling, I would not like to look at a mirror!",

I never had hair on the face before and now feel like its longer than my hair on top.  I'm thinking I'm going to actually have to shave it.  I'm 44 so also could be in \"chemopause\", do you think they are related?  Does menopause make you grow hair on your face?  Sorry your simulation did not go well, hope you can start soon, I felt the same way, the sooner you start, the sooner it is over.  Anyway, 4 down for me and so far okay.  I did notice an upset stomach for a few days last week, but it's been fine today and yesterday, so maybe not related. ",

NannaBaby, just to clarify, my tumor size \"grew\" during the testing phase before chemo started i.e., my biopsy report said 2cm, my MRI said 5cm. But they said once the biopsy is done, blood can leak out and make the tumor bigger. Thank goodness, once I started chemo is all shrunk away. I had neo chemo b/c the tumor was large relative to my breast (b cup) and was very aggressive - chemo was the best option to start to kill it right away and to preserve my breast for a lump. Cindy - I soooo agree about being able to tell the chemo is working.  It was so much easier to take the side effects when I could literally feel the lump growing smaller and smaller! I guess I was NED at surgery also, never thought of it that way, nothing at the lump site and nothing in the nodes! Kay - my surgery was also 4 weeks after my last Taxol.  I had the same worry, but they also said my body needed some time to heal from chemo before the surgery.  I had AC then Taxol and Herceptin.  I am on a 3 week Herceptin cycle, so I had 1 Herceptin only treatment the week before surgery.",

I am definately feeling more tired this week, and my skin is pink to a light shade of red.  No pain, other than the every so often twinge at the node dissection scar site. Almost 4 more weeks still seems like a long way to go, but it does feel good to get 1/2 through.  Will get #18 later today. I've been wearing the no underwire bra, haven't gone braless or tried the front hook athletic bras yet, so far the bra/clothes have not been a problem. Gina - Hope your DD is feeling better and the seroma is not hurting too bad.",

Also, about cosmetic results, I realized after I posted yesterday, that obviously tumor site has something to do with it.  My tumor was such that the scar was right on the edge of the aerola so after a few weeks, it just blended in and can't be seen anymore. Would think even if your tumor shrunk away to nothing like mine, you might have a more visible scar if the tumor was farther away from the nipple.",

Did someone say that have researched doctors that are doing research on TN?  It would be good to have that information. I have to figure out a way to come to this site more often, do people access this site from their phones?  Adnerb, from our signature, it looks like you were on Carbo and Gemzar twice?  How long were you on it the first time?  I am just finishing my second cycle and all my pain is gone, thank goodness.  I am tired and take a nap every day and recently started having terrible constipation, but otherwise am not finding it too bad.  I am doing 3 cycles then having a PET scan, so I am curious on how long you were on and if you stopped bc of SE or because of good results. wrsmith - I have not heard that, I was told Stage IV now.  Interesting, but I also wonder the implications. Better stats, perhaps?",

My MO initially said she would like to limit to 6 or 8 cycles, at the time I did not ask why. With the good results, she wants to stop after 6 cycles and continue on Gemzer only, though I think she will do another PET scan at the end of the 6 cycles first.
