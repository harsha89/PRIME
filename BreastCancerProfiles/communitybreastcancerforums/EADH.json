    "Content": "EADH wrote: Last Friday at my routine OB appt, I showed her 2 lumps that I recently found. She thought one felt like it was just dense tissue due to normal hormonal pregnancy changes, but she seemed concerned about the second lump. I was able to schedule an ultrasound for Monday morning. The radiologist confirmed the first lump was nothing more than my body preparing for lactating. However, the second lump at the 1:00 position in my left breast was a 3 cm mass that he was concerned about. Thankfully, they were able to squeeze me in yesterday for a biopsy and now the wait for the results continues. The longest week of my life. Hopefully will hear from the radiologist on Friday. At 38 weeks pregnant today and with a 2 year old son, too, I'm freaking out about if I receive bad news. Does anyone have any positive experiences to share? Has anyone else had a mass this size biopsied to find out it was benign!? Log in to post a reply",
