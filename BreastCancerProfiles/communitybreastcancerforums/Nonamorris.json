I have another question now though. Since the biopsy, I have developed what feels like a cord running from where she took the biopsy to the underside of my breast. Has anyone experienced this, is it normal?",

      "Content": "Nonamorris wrote: My diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound showed a fluid filled mass on top of a solid mass. Birad 5. The radiologist came in and sat with me and explained that in his experience that it looked like a primary breast cancer and that I needed a biopsy and MRI right away. I had the biopsy the following week. My surgeon's office called to reschedule my appointment until after my MRI, which is the 17th, and I flipped out. I told her that I couldn't wait another week to find out what the biopsy showed. The nurse then tells me that the biopsy came back benign but that my Dr isn't convinced that that is accurate and want s to see the MRI and possibly schedule an open biopsy. I am relieved with the biopsy results but at the same time I am seriously anxious over the Dr's reaction. Has anyone else been through this? Can needle biopsies be wrong? Log in to post a reply",
