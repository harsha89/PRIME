I know that I have seen this lump on the mammos and u/s in the past, but never had it been felt no matter how the dr's tried to feel it.  Now that it has actually been felt during a CBE, I feel that it is time to take it out.  I wasn't born with it, I don't want it growing inside me anymore-- no matter if it turns out benign or not. Maybe the doctor will decide to take it. ",

A little background info would probably help ~~~ 1995 during a routine physical, my dr felt a possible lump and did an ultrasound. Didn't see anything so she sent me for a mammo because of family history (grandmother, aunt, 2 cousins all with BC) and it showed some areas to \"watch\". Kept going back yearly and things were rather boring. I tried to watch my dietary habits and be healthy. In 2002, my yearly mammo showed a small mass and microcalcifications. I went back 6 months later for another ultrasound and diagnostic mammo.... the ultrasound showed a possible small, non-fluid filled, mass and the mammo showed the mass had possibly grown slightly and another tight cluster. I was sent to a breast surgeon and we talked for a good hour. I was a very busy mom, and worked 2 fulltime jobs. Didn't have time for BC. The surgeon said it was a good possibility that it was just benign stuff and I asked what was the worst-case scenario. He said that *IF* it was a malignancy, that it was a very slow growing type and I probably had a good 10-12 years before any problems would come up. I decided to take those good 10-12 years and not biopsy or do anything. I continued with yearly mammos...... all very boring. Last Oct I went in for just a regular screening and it came back showing nothing. No mass, no microcalcifications, nothing. For the past 13 years, there has absolutely been no lumps or mass felt during a physical exam by myself or a doctor. Thursday I went in for a regular checkup with my doctor. New dr because I just moved to this area. She immediately felt \"a nodule\" at the 7 o'clock position (very near where I think the old films show the mass) and was concerned. I told her the past history and she said that this was serious and time to take care of it. She has set me up for a bilateral diagnostic mammo with ultrasound for this week and then gave me the information for the breast surgeon she is referring me to in the next town over from her. She told me about the procedure he does during surgery where he implants the medicine right into the breast. By that time, I was in tears and my head was spinning. My first reaction was that I really didn't want to hear anything about surgery or even a biopsy and I sure don't want to deal with treatments and such. I don't have the excuse of being too busy because of children at home, or a job anymore so I am going to go ahead and explore my options *IF* anything shows up this time. Anyway-- from all of your past experiences, do any of you think that I really may have anything to be concerned about? Log in to post a reply",

This morning my PCP called and said they just got the results and that the report states that everything *appears* benign however, the radiologist wants me to follow up with the breast surgeon anyway. So, now I am waiting for that appointment to be set up.  I'm really not that worried at all-- I'm sure they just want me to meet this surgeon to have a sort of like \"baseline\" appointment to meet him. ",
