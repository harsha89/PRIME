My dad is 88 and I was with my dad in the emergency room for 6 hours last night for chest pain. Turned out to most likely be pleurisy but he's already in rehab for breaking his hip in April. How and when do I tell him? I guess that is really my biggest issue right now. I'm going to find out all my Mets and numbers and stuff and add that to my signature. I don't know those numbers right now. My initial diagnosis was 12/22/10. I had a mastectomy and 3 lymph nodes removed on 2/1/11 but at that time that was all I needed. My chemo starts on 6/1/12. I'll have 3 weeks on of Taxotere and 1 week off. What do I need to be asking? Has anyone done anything with diet? Do I need to work on becoming a vegan? Do I need to give up wine? (Please say no to that! but I'll do it if I have to.) I already exercise religiously at least 4 times a week and plan to continue. I actually teach 3 classes a week at a local gym and will continue to do so for as long as I'm able. I eat a very balanced diet right now and I could go vegetarian if it really helps. I'd prefer to keep eating meat though. I work in an elementary school so I only have to work full time for 2 more weeks and then I'll have 11 weeks off.  Once again feedback and suggestians are welcome. This time it's so much harder.",
