    "Content": "FrenchPorsche wrote: I\u2019m new to this site and feeling apprehensive. I attended the breast clinic on Saturday (my appointment was due two weeks earlier but was postponed twice as the consultant was stuck in Pakistan). My referral was due to some nipple discharge on my left breast. Anyway, it seems from the mammogram and ultrasound that the left side is fine, but the radiologist found a susp area in my right breast and performed a core needle biopsy. I\u2019ve been told that I have an appointment at 3pm today provided they have had a chance to review the results. I think I would have heard by now if they were going to postpone it. I am currently feeling a bit stressed and worried. It\u2019s hard not to dwell on it.
