Definitely get it done!  I underwent genetic testing (thankfully negative) and learned that there are so many factors involved that can or cannot involve your genes.  It is important to know your risk (I am at a 35% lifetime) so you can better take care of yourself.  It sounds like you are doing all the right things.  I will warn you though, because you are young you may encounter a lot of \"false positives\" when you undergo mammograms, MRI's, etc.  Like you, I do not want to go through what my mom went through, and I also don't want my daughter to have to go through what I am going through now.  Since I got my first mammogram my life has been a whirlwind of mammo's, U/S's, MRI's, biopsies and worry.  But, the positive thing is everything so far has been benign.  And now that we have a pretty good idea of what my \"normal\" is, my testing has become much less invasive and less stressful. I found a lump this past September, and like you, turns out it was Fibroadenoma.  I am seeing my breast surgeon on Monday for my yearly exam and mammo and am going to ask him to remove it as it is close to my ribs and gets stuck inbetween them when I dance or teach my Zumba classes.    Sorry for the rambling, guess I just wanted to let you know that you are not alone, I understand your situation and wish you the best.   When you go for your genetic testing, the more detail you have about your family the better.  I brought my dad with me as I was younger when my mom was diagnosed and it was so long ago.  Plus he had better information regarding my aunt, grandmother and great-grandmother's diagnosises.  Whoever you can bring with you for support and/or help with information would be helpful.  I find it is always helpful to have either my husband, my dad or a friend with me at most of my appointments to help ease my anxiety and also help me retain information.  I also find it helpful to request copies of all testing that I have undergone as well as the pathology reports.  Also, given your age you may run into some Dr.'s who will still send you away until you are 40, regardless of your family history.  Keep going, find someone who will see you and take you seriously.   Best of luck to you, both you and your sister will be in my thoughts. Please let me know if I can help you with anything else <3 -Melissa ",
