The MRI reports that there is an indeterminate reticular ductal enhancing process 34 X 11 X 9 mmwhich co-localizes with the cluster of microcalcifications found on the diagnostic mammogram of 07/22/09, there is a second 25mm in diameter region of non-specific reticular enhancement which appears to co-localize with the dominant cluster of indeterminate microcalcifications seen on the aforementioned mammogram.  In addition, there is a third suspicious reticular/ductal enhancing legion measuring 11 X 6 X 3mm.This third finding is the most prominent focus of enhancement in either breast.  Bi-Rads 4B I have a sterotactic scheduled for Aug 31ST ...so now there is a third.

Now my left breast, being jealous is providing totally differentexperiences.  Yesterday, I had a stereotactic in two locations, 3:00 and 12:00. Additionally, there is another leasion at 2:30, but that one they want to biopsy via a MRI-guided biopsy.  They said that they won't look at that one until we get the results back from the other two. It started this way...follow up mammo for R lumpectomy.  I mentioned that I thought I felt something on the left as well.  As you can see I was right.  They first tried to do a US-guided biopsy, but they couldn't find the lesions on US.  One week later I had a MRI to see if it could be done with MRI-guided, but the radiologist felt it was better to do the 9&12:00 via stereotactic.  But the MRI was where they found the third lesion.   My onc is suggesting a bilat Mast.  I think at this point I am getting pretty scared.

I forgot to mention that I am having skin and nipple sparing utilizing the alloderm to have a really nice internal bra.  BS and PS both say no more bras!!!  I am really lucky.  My Onc, BS, and PS are all women.  The BS told me that she said that the odds of having BC herself was really high so she felt specializing in breast surgery would keep her in the forefront. She is young and vibrant and reminds me of gina davis...I met the PS for the first time last week and our appointment ended with a hug.  OMG, Irishtess, that is fantastic news.  You are the day after me and Hellome. It really breaks my heart when I realize what difficult and heroic choices we all have to make.  Recently, I was remembering seeing the cover of People Magazine a couple of years ago and thinking how scary and how brave the decision Christina Applegate made regarding her BMX...I felt so badly for her, I mean internally felt such empathy.  It is unbelievable that here I sit with all of you brave women facing the same thing. lorieg...you are in my prayers, swift recovery!

I think I am experiencing seromas under both arms.  I had the drains removed on Friday, so maybe it is normal.  It just seems like they are getting spongier and puffier and warmer than the rest of the area.  My BMX was 12 days ago, I just don't know if this is normal.  I read on a website that this is caused by doing too much while you should be resting.  I hope I didn't screw up anything. Thanks for letting me rant.  And no grammar check, please...LOL! NIKKI",

I had to spend an extra day in the hospital.  Couldn't get rid of my headache...Zofram (sp) kept giving me headaches..Finally Compazine yesterday and only minimal headache..Only two drains.  My surgery was BMX and they were able to do the skin sparing and the nipple preservation.  Final path unchanged from preop, but nodes negative too!!!  No dressing changes until see PS Monday afternoon.  No bras or binder.  PS was able to fill 200cc's per side, so now I look like a 12 yr old.  Pain tolerable, but tired.  PS do nothing...sleep, heal, eat & pee until I see her. Just when I thought I was going to freak before surgery...they gave me the nite-nite drugs.  Surgery 7 hours... Good luck to all the girls still waiting... Love, NIKKI",

Had to be at hospital at 11AM for a 1PM surgery.  Both of my pastors joined my DH and I at about 15 minutes till surgery.  The OR was running late so I didn't get taken till 1:45PM, that's when I started to panic.  I sort of awakened in PACU, but I couldn't open my eyes.  Moved to my room on the oncology floor.  The transfer from gurney to bed painful.But then not too bad.  Glad to have a Foley catheter.  But at 6AM about 9 hours post surgery they took out the Foley...my nurse reported that I was like a statue and needed to get up.  MY DH spent the night in a cot at my bedside.  I think that helped that nurse to be nice to me.  She didn't seem very compassionate.  The rest of the staff was great.  The first day post op I walked the halls and sat in a chair for 4 hours strait.  But the next day I was so nauseated, and such a headache.  I couldn't imagine going home.  Fortunately, by the next day all was well.  I haven't had any pain meds in 9 hours, so I think I am on the mend.  I am very weak.  Still have a mild headache.  But now I understand how so many women say this is doable.  On this side it seems so much easier than the anticipation. My only problem is no bm post op! 4 days... Fast healing for all who have gone before.  Easy for those waiting for this coming week or the next. We are all powerful women.  Strength and courage! Love, NIKKI",

I have been trying to catch up on everyone's news.  It is so hard to believe that it has already been 3 1/2 weeks since my BMX. Regarding the drain pulls,  I was so scared to have them pulled, I tried to ignore how scared I was until it was time to come out.  But at the moment my PS's assistant went to pull them out I realized that if I thought about the removal, I would loose it.  So I asked her to tell me about her upcoming weekend.  I got so sidetracked listening to her wonderful story, she was done before I knew she had started.  So my advice is to get distracted! We have shared so much over the past weeks, did anyone notice how amazing the support we can give to and receive from each other while taking a path so impossible to survive that it takes my breath away.  To see that we are now on the other side, it is a testament to each of us how strong we really are.  You know that they test the purity of metal by putting it to the fire. You see?  We all proved to be made of more than we ever thought possible. Amazing!  I am taking this as the new direction of my life. I can't wait to be healed and ready to take on the world, or at least my world! As far as fatigue, it continues to be a problem for me too.  I am sleeping better, but still prefer the recliner for the best sleep.  I am so looking forward to being Mom and Wife again, it is time.  Since I contracted an infection on the left suture line, I am sort of at square one as far as the healing goes.  I see the surgeon this afternoon and hopefully the cultures come back with nothing too serious.  I am allergic to a few antibiotics so perhaps they might be able to find a more effective treatment.  At least the wound has closed back up and the redness has subsided, it didn't seem possible last weekend. Happy Mother's Day to all the Moms! Nikki",

Today, I went to the surgeon that my Primary had referred me to for a second opinion.  First off, it is rather disconcerting to visit a MD that seems young enough to be my son, I know off the subject but I thought that he was nice, but he didn't actually understand thaf I had a pretty good handle on what was going on.  He said that he was going to personally go to the hospital to review the digital films with the CAD and to spend a few days thinking about what to do before he proceeds.  He says that he doen't normally do an excisional bx at this point and then he educated me that ADH is not cancer, and that DCIS isn't really cancer...blah, blah, blah.  He asked if I had a hx of bc in the family and I said only my maternal gm who was 86 yrs old when she had a mastectomy.  However, my mother, never had a mammo so we really can't determine an adequate hx. He then does the physical exam and leaves the room.  When he returns, now he is saying that perhaps I should consider Tamoxifen and that he was possible going to refer me to an ongologist to determine the need for Tamox.  I just feel that he was consulting a \"book\" while he was out of the room and this makes me concerned about his experience.   First he is making \"light\" of it and then he seems more concerned.  Maybe I am reading too much into it, but it certainly makes me wonder. I am going to contact Dr Synder @ Hoag and get a more experienced second opinion.  I feel like I appear to be chasing ghosts or something like I am looking for cancer, but I am just scared that it is only a couple of mm away and we just don't know it.  The doctor I saw today summarized it like this...if you took a solid loaf of raisin bread and took a core sample, you might miss the raisins, but you would still have raisin bread regardless.  Hmm...I wonder who told him that?

Thank you to all that have provided pointers and insight...we are lucky to have such a wonderful bunch of gals that are willing to share all the wisdom. I have three separate areas of the left that are BI-Rad 5.  We decided not to do a lumpectomy since it would turn into a partial mastectomy anyway.  And since I never began the 37 treatments of radiation...my oncologist says this is the best way to go...now I have learned that the path report in surgery will determine if I will require chemo afterwards.  Hopefully it is just DCIS in a larger area.

My prayers are with all of you lovely ladies.  To Annacortessgirl, Choirlove, dcrm, and  Jessamine...remember the quote from earlier in the month, \"You don't have to be brave, you just have to show up\".  Seriously, this is what got me through the last couple of days before surgery. I know that I was not brave!  I just had to show up!  When I became the most \"paranoid\" was just as they gave me the preop drugs...and then it was all over.  So hang in there!
