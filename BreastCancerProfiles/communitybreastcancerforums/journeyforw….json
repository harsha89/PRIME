I am waiting for my DVD to protect my right arm against lymphedema. I just signed up to find out everything I can about HER2 + BC. I really don't want to be overwhelmed only informed. I know the next step is chemotherapy...I'm just trying to bite the bullet. It is good to find support in this community....I'm ready to reach out! ",

She found no current edema problems and she was very helpful and now, 3 weeks post-op I have full range of motion and I am starting strength training with a very gradual progression on weight increase. BTW the DVD Strength and Courage - Exercises for Breast Cancer Survivors was very helpful to me. ...I get no endorsement benefit I just think its great! Today I had my port placed - on the opposite side of BC - at the hospital and I am preparing for chemotherapy in less than 2 weeks. I just want to encourage all who have been or are preparing for surgery, it is so important to have a good support system and LOTS and LOTS of prayers!...I know this has been challenging but God really does see us through the touch times. ReadyAbout - you are right that it is so important to keep the pain under control and preferably under 5/10 on the 0-10 pain scale. Drinking fluids and staying active, enjoy nature, get out side ( shield your skin against insects and sun and protect your involved arm - SO crucial during recover). I want to thank you for facilitating this great support group too! The sweet nurse who prepared me for the port implant this morning reminded me that recover during the beautiful spring/summer/fall seasons is preferable to cold,dark and miserable weather in winter months. Things to be thankful for!... Every kind word and supportive statement means so much to all of us during this trying time. Best results to all of you!",

April 13th..blah...) I had a discussion with the MO and I had the option for neoadjuvant which is chemotherapy to shrink the tumor then do surgery to take residual tissue. I decided to have the surgery to see what we were up against. Well I had the radioactive dye injection and the surgical nurse did a great job distracting me while the radiologist went to town on the injection. Puff..done!..waiting about 1 1/2 hours then off to general anesthesia and I was awakened with news that 3 sentinal nodes were removed because they \"lit-up\" on the x-ray guiding the surgeon. Great news for me - they were negative. I'll get more info at my surgical post-op appointment later this week. I am now 5 days post-op and my upper right arm is a bit numb feeling, underneath but I can move it well. I am very careful not to lift or push,pull. I support it with a soft pillow at night time and I'm resting comfortably in very little discomfort. I had a 12 o'clock position, lumpectomy and only needed ice, Tylenol and a bit of Motrin. I had prescription for add'al pain meds ready just in case. I would strongly encourage all post-op lumpectomy procedures to support the breast with absent wire - soft bra -while the tissue heals. I hope you and others can find some smattering of comfort from my experience. ... This whole thing feels so surreal at times! Ready-About, thank you for the warm welcome and I will hit the articles later - tomorrows another day. I am trying to stay very positive, and I'm absolutely very thankful for this community.",

What evidence shows that Vitamin C supplements interfere with radiation absorption? Are there studies that show it is contra-indicated? If so, somebody please share. Thanks.",

Spoonie77 - I am sorry you are going through a rough time right now. I hope the Physical Therapy sessions continue to be very helpful to you. I agree that all of us should ensure we get the care we need after radiation. If there is swelling, cording, loss of shoulder range of motion, nerve pain notify the RO so they can get you started with PT. Thank you for sharing your experience with us and take good care of yourself. CarolAnnieLumpLump and MLghten - We have similar schedules with me starting boosts next week - 5 total and then I should be done with rads on Nov 30th. My skin is red now with 2 small areas of concern. I have directions for saline soak mix to help with moist peeling skin. I may need to start this if the skin starts to peel and becomes itchy. Every one is different as far as side effects and reactions to rads so you should discuss skin treatment with your RO. PebblesV - I posted the pic of Domino on my frig to give me a smile while I'm in the kitchen cooking tomorrow. Wishing wellness to all and Happy Thanksgiving! Happy Fall Y'All (yes, I'm down south...and I love it!)",

If I was to develop swelling near the radiation site or R arm I will avoid fast, repetitive motions like the upper body Elliptical just for now - until I complete Rads. I walk fast on the treadmill and swing my arms when I walk and that is fine. It is so important to keep moving and work on range of motion of my shoulder joint. When you are resting on your back on the table, the set up for the treatments have your arms over your head holding to bars during the quick treatments. I think the Calendula Cream has been working well for me, so far. I know this is cumulative radiation so near the end of the planned treatments may cause some issues - hopefully none or minimal. It's really great to hear from so many going through this. From what I gather, everybody reacts differently, It's hard to predict.",

My skin looks good after 9 radiation treatments - I have 21 total. I put Calendula cream on 2 to 3 times daily. My radiation treatments are at 8 am so I shower and apply cream at night and do nothing but eat and go to my appointments in the morning. I'm starting to get slight fatigue but I keep working part-time and working out in the evenings at the gym. I avoid the eliptical machine because of the repetitive arm motions and my fear of setting off lymphedema event in my right arm during radiation. Instead, I fast walk on the Treadmill and ride stationary bicycle. I hope everyone going through this is staying strong and doing well.",

Hi everyone, My radiation appointments are at 8:15 am M-F so I slept in this Saturday morning and it felt great! I have 13/21 radiations completed and next week 3 rads and 4 days off with Thanksgiving holiday. So far, all is well with my skin. Yes, it appears slightly pinkish hours after radiation but that seems to fade somewhat the next morning. I have been applying Calendula Cream 2 to 3 times per day. I have been very thankful I have no soreness/pain on my right breast, so far. I did notice a \"zinger\" (nerve pain) in my lower upper R arm late yesterday afternoon - it goes away within seconds. Overall, I feel thankful for having radiations for this BrCa considering the fact that so many in this world do not have access to radiation treatments. I'm trying to keep everything in perspective and look at the positives. I do believe it will help me in my recovery. Plus, my sweet daughter from out-of-city college is spending the weekend with me and I feel really loved right now I'm sending my Love and support to all going through this right now.",
