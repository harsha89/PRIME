    "Content": "stupidcancer wrote: My best friend is 34 years old, diagnosed when she was 31. We just celebrated her being cancer free for 3 years in September, when she had a bad PET scan at the beginning of November. The cancer has metastasized and is in her lungs. Her cancer is HER2+. She has three small children, ages 7, 5 and 4. I am so mad, upset, scared and horrified for her. This is different than when she was originally diagnosed.. I want to support her, help her and love her through this.. which is why I am posting this message. Can you all tell of things your friends have done that have helped you continue fighting this blasted disease? I appreciate all of your thoughts and advice.. Log in to post a reply",
