I'm tired still, but I think that is still more from months and months of treatments, surgery and then tough chemo. I'm still taking hot showers and baths, the booklet they gave me said not to, but the nurse said it's fine. I just put lots of aquaphor on after. My area of radiation seems huge. Below my ribcage and up to my neck, from the center of my chest to under my arm. Big area. But I had 17 lymph nodes involved, so they want to radiate the whole chest area and some other lymph node areas.",

I'm still exhausted from finishing chemo 5 weeks ago, so I'm not looking forward to adding another treatment that will make me even more tired, but other than that, I am not very worried about rads in general. I bought a different button up shirt for each weekday to wear to treatments so I don't have to change into a gown when I go. I asked and they said as long as I don't wear a bra underneath, that would work for them. It will shave a few minutes off each appt I figure.",

Your dr should tell you everything you need to know. I asked if I could wear button down shirts so I didn't have to change into gowns. They said yes. Your RO will tell you what lotions and creams to use and not use. They will tell you how long before each treatment they want you to have nothing on your skin at all. No deodorant! They'll also tell you how many treatments you'll recieve. 2 and 3. The Sim is a simulation of what you actual radiation session will be like minus the radiation. I had a first consultation appt, then the appt where they did the tattoos, made a plastic mild of my chest, made a special pillow that I use every treatment, and did a CT scan. Then I had the sim appt. It lasted about 20 minutes and they ran through my radiation treatment minus the radiation and took xrays during it to make sure everything was where they wanted it. From consultation to forst rads was 1 week. I've heard it's longer for others. 4. Not very scared at all. The ladies are super nice at my treatment center, they let you choose the music and make you feel comfortable. You feel nothing at all during the treatment. They reassure you they will be looking for skin changes and help you out along the way.",

Is it normal that I just can't shake the feeling that I'm going to die and fairly quickly? It's probably because they cannot do the full diagnostic tests on me because I am pregnant. My lungs looked fine 2 weeks ago, my liver has 2 suspicious spots that they said look like hemangiomas, but they can't be sure, and they can't look at my brain and bones yet. So, I feel just sure the cancer is there. The original plan my surgeon laid out is to start chemo 4 weeks after my surgery, which would be less than 3 weeks now. I meet with the oncologist on Monday. They will probably split up A and C and I would get treatment every 2 weeks until 3 weeks before they want to induce me at 37 weeks. Then more chemo 2 weeks after delivery. Then, radiation amd at some point herceptin. I am being treated at University of Michigan. They do have a lot of experience treating pregnant women.",

They were going to do a lumpectomy. Right before surgery, my lymph nodes started to swell and since I was pregnant at that time, we decided to do a mastectomy and entire axillary node dissection. Neoadjuvant was not an option for me because of the pregnancy. My pathology said that the breast tumor was 3cm and there was a total of 4cm of cancer in my nodes. 17 of 35 positive, making me also IIIC. However, they could not do any other scans except a chest xray (clear), and a liver ultrasound (inconclusive ), so I may very well be stage 4. If I was stage 4 and chemo and targeted therapies work completely, I would never know that I was stage 4 and we would assume IIIC still. It's not a good feeling either way. I also had dose dense AC and now am doing 12 weekly taxol plus herceptin every 3rd week and perjeta every 3rd week for 4 treatments.",

Was diagnosed last August when I was 7 weeks pregnant. I ended up losing the baby at 13 weeks unrelated to the cancer. At that time I had already had a mastectomy which showed I was at least stage IIIc. When I lost the baby I was 2 days away from my first chemo. The only scans I had were a chest xray (clear) and a liver ultrasound which showed 2 spots that they thought were consistent with hemangiomas, but weren't sure. I was a devasted mess after losing the baby and with my mo decided not do any further scans until after chemo. I fished chemo in March, went on a 3 week trip and came.back to a herceptin only infusion and a bone and CT scan. The next day, My MO'S NP called and said my scans looked good. She said that my liver spot did not change in size so that is good and meant it was a most likely a hemangioma . At the time, I figured she meant both spots and didn't question it. But when the CT scan results came on the patient portal, I saw that it only mentions one spot. My MO and her NP were out for this past week. Another NP messaged me just saying she forwarded my message on to my NP and she would get back to me this coming Monday. I would be really surprised if they missed this, but I cannot find or think of any other reason the second spot would not have shown on my CT. Any thoughts? I also had a small spot show up on my hip, but it did not show in the bone scan so they aren't worried about it.",
