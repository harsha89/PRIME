I was diagnosed July 3, 2017 VIA US biopsy with IDC clinical stage 2, pr/er+, her2- Radiologist recommended MRI which I did and also had visit with BS, then had to wait to undergo second MRI biopsy. Finally got in with geneticist and the PS. PS said he will talk with my BS and then they will schedule. Have no follow up visits with anyone. It is frustrating to go through all the testing and waiting with no follow up visits. Have no idea when I will be scheduled. And with no visits scheduled, there is no opportunity to ask additional questions that come up. The geneticist appt was a joke. I spent 5 minutes tops with the doctor, watched a 30-minute video I could have watched online, then had blood drawn and was told it will take 3 weeks for results. The entire process is frustrating. I've also been told it has probably been there for a while so waiting isn't an issue.",
