Because the report also shows that 17 out of 22 of my lymp nodes are affected they want to see whether (or maybe which) other part my body is spread. i assume this will be my second 'home' and i will update my situation very soon... PS, so touching ... many of you not only post your own exprences but also share, help, encourage, bless ... so far, i havent told my parents the bad news. i cant even finish a sentence without a tissue!",

During my chemo, the 5th round, I was in hospital because of cough, fever and out of breath. The ct scan showed I had a chest infection. 3 months later after I finished the treatment, the ct scan still showed a spot in my lung. But the doc said it was probably from the last chest infection, not concerned. Last week, I had a ct scan again. This time the radiologist is concerned. The spot is still there and its surrounding is changed a bit as well. My oncologist mentioned it was probably because of the radiotherapy. He also refers my case to a chest specialist, who is not concerned AT THIS STAGE. But my oncologist does mention he will keep a close look on me, and give that spot a few more months and then seeits develop. He also mentioned that spreading to the lung is common in bc' case. And I m waiting now... In less than half a year after the treatment, I am back to the starting point, this time worse. The anxiety can eat me alive! I ve been back to work for 2 months. Just 3 weeks ago I restarted my jogging, same time I stopped the hot flash and night sweat. I try very hard to get my life back to normal but it seems this c word will never ever leave me alone, even for a little while! Today is my 36th birthday. I feel nothing but trapped to a body I hate so much!",

How kind of you！ to HVV: i used to like my body. i can walk fast, run fast, swim fast...except the flying part. This is actually the first time in my mind that I separate me from my body. Thank you very much. It is good to know i am not alone! to Racy: thanks! to Chrissyb: thank you for your sweet words! I understand what you say. I am just lack of motivations to do anything, to plan anything, even for my son. He is 4 now. but when he wants me to feed him, i will do it; when he wants more sweet and chocolate, i will give him...a lot! i know i should not catastrophize my situation, but it is so hard not to. is that your kid with you in the pic? he looks gorgeous.",

Last Thursday, i had the CT scan which was the last check before i started my chemo. Luckily no sign showing metastatic. of couse it doesnt mean that the cancer cell is not spread. doctors are very careful with their words. at the same time, my fish test comes out 'negative', which means i am also in the 'tn' group. this wednesday, i started my chemo. as far as i know, FEC-T, which is what i am using is quite a 'standard' treatment. Hopefully it works for me as well.",
