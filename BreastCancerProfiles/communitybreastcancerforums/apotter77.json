Breast cancer runs a bit in my family, well from what i know my mums side. For the last month or two the breast on my right has been aching. (Like when you've been walking all day and you feet ache) And I've noticed a lump 2-3cm above my nipple. I'm only a B cup and my breast have changed a fair bit after having my daughter haha of course. I'm just trying I explain everything as much as I can. The lump is lumpy and not so round to be exact. Its about 2-4cm big It doesn't hurt to touch just more uncomfortable. It has gotten bigger the last 2 weeks. I havent had any discharge from my nipple and i cant really tell if my breast is changing as my breasts are stretched from the breast milk when i pregnant i only breast fed for 2 weeks but they filled up with milk heaps. I feel so embarrassed saying all of this. But should i be concerned? It just doesnt feel right. And im stressing out. Log in to post a reply",

I'm hoping its just breast tissue or just some kind of infection.  Really appreciate your advice and kind words. Much love",
