Good luck with the rest of your recovery!  It's wonderful that you're happy with your decision!",

Komen foundation and they specifically asked about my insurance because they do have a financial helpline for those who aren't covered.  Since I did have ins, I dodn't talk to them, but maybe they would be helpful to you.  Their # is 800.462.9273.  Best of luck with everything, and keep us posted on your surgery!
