Trust me when I say I know what your feeling and cry Omg i was feeling so guilty for feeling sorry for myself all the whys what have i done so bad in life to deserve this i could go on forever. The boards help believe me I now know that we all do and it is normal I thought normal when you find out but I can cry for no reason the boards have helped me more than i can say. I have to do chemo and radation if not for the chat room i would have said to hell with it all no no and no and did. The ladies in chat made me feel it is not a death sentence and there is still life and I can do at least try crying is ok so many are in the same shape and lots are worse than me they keep telling me one day at a time you can ask any thing feel anything they understand. I found the chat room about 6 days  ago they are very hard for me and I get frustrated but they understand..",
