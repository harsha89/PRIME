How does this happen in such a short amount of time. Its not like my legs hurt or anything, just really hard to pick them up to climb the stairs. When i came up my porch today to climb those 3 lil stairs i fell face first. Not from dizziness or anything just legs not moving. I also had this problem when i went upstairs today to wake up my boys. Is this just part of the deal, do you think i should mention it to dr, would a cane help me.

My bones werent yet responding and a second opinion(which by the way was Cancer Treatment Centers of America) told me to switch treatments, i followed his advice, then two days later my original onc called and told me he believed i should not stop my original plan. I got a third opinion at a big hospital by a well known breast onc. He totally agreed with my onc and said to go back on the tykerb and xeloda. He also said he would never ever send anyone to CTCA he said numerous places to go but never there. So that is what i am on and having good response in the lungs. Sorry for the story but wanted to let you know how i came to my decision. Good Luck and GREAT BIG HUGGSSSSS!!!!!!!!!! Rusty ",

      "Content": "rooni wrote:  February 3, 2005 i recieved those unbelievable words no one wants to here. I was 27 years old and it was my youngest sons 5th birthday. We were all set to have him a lil party, never did i imagine what my family would soon be faced with. Everything had happened so quickly and i never imagined id get the results the same day i seen the surgeon. He was very thourough and i knew he knew just from the ultrasound what the verdict was. I was scheduled for lumpectomy the next monday. I had my big girl britches on and though i was scared shitless, i couldnt let anyone see me falter. I took care of things . i handled them head on. This beast was not taking me without a fight. After surgery things were a lil worse that fisrt thought. I ended up being stage 3c 12+ lymph nodes. So i went gung ho, had everything removed even my ovaries and started on the most aggressive chemo. I was pulling all the stops, nothing was gonna stop me. After radiation i went ahead and did all the reconstruction, my plastic surgeon is a miricle worker, i am impressed, especially since i put on so much weight. I completed my year of herceptin in Aug 06 and went on femera. The femara worked for me up until this summer, when in june i had some bad scans showing extensive bone mets and lung mets. With me im still looking for the brighter days, the better news, the miracles that i know are out there. I kept my positive attitude, started on tykerb,xeloda, and zometa. Then three months out i decided to get a second opinion, we redid scans. The lungs had showed great improvement, but the bones had not. The new onc switched me to tamoxifen for the er+ status. I think maybe i jumped the gun in listening to this guy. My regular onc called me personally to have an indepth discussion about what was going on. He was very unhappy with my decisions.I truely believe he has my best interests in mind. He also sent me to get a third opinion from a very well known breast onc, who agreed with him on this case. so i stopped the tamoxifen and restarted my tykerb, xeloda, and zometa. I hate to bring the words to light but maybe if i didnt go off on my own to seek out new opinions i would still be responding well to the tx. AM I TOO BLAME? Could that time of tamoxifen caused so much damage. So it brings me here, to this date where i feel like im not getting better, i need to get better. That little baby of mine just turned nine yesterday and i didnt even get to spend it with him. I was to sick. My lung mets are worse, of course debilitating bone pain, new liver lesions, and brain mets. Can  i do this. I have 5 more rads to the brain, after that i am really hoping to get some energy back and relief from these headaches. Then i am hoping to get the best chemo to knock out these lung mets so i can breath and get out and about with my family. I love them so much. If those big drug companies have the means for a cure, why cant they let people benefit, who cares about money. Im too young to die escpecially when my family needs me so much. It all just seems so unfair in the big picture. I dont know if i gave to much info or not enough, but im devestated right now and just trying to crawl up to my knees and be able to stand tall and scream that i want this. That i need this more than anything. My family needs this more than anything. I pray that my husband has the courage to keep battling this out with me. We have been through so much together, i was sixteen when we got together and here we are later 15 years later. Noone ever said we would make it, but i always knew better, he is my rock, my best friend, my soul mate, without him id have nothing, i need to let him know everyday how i love him. I never want him to feel taken advantage of, im not sure how to give him that. He does so much for me. I just feel like im creeping slowly down the hill that i surely dont want to go, and i need to turn my head around and reach for the sky!!! I am so sorry i have been invading the boards so much anymore but i need the wisdom of you beautiful selfless strong couragous women!!! Any suggestions??

I ended up in the hospital  on tuesday because i couldnt even move or feel my legs. It was so scary.They said the reason was because my potasium was really low. Plus my onc wanted to do scans on everything to see what was happening, he was worried about cord compression. While i was in here it was discovered that my wbc was so low and everything else was so out of wack. So then the neupogen was ordered. But the thing i dont get is before i was sent home with neupogen just to be cautious, this time its like nothing. Then i ended up getting shingles. Nice! I am in so much pain. I cant walk to the bathroom without crying. Has anyone had such a hard time on Abraxane? I thought it was supposed to be easy on you.

I took some immodium and was ok until the next night. It hit me again so hard i ended up in the ER, they bombarded me with liquids and wanted a stool sample which of course i couldnt produce til they sent me home(go figure). Anyway yesterday i was still feeling sick and it was time for my second abraxane tx, but when the nurse went to get my bp they couldnt get nothing. So the dr put me in the little room and pumped me with more fluids. He also took me completely by surprise and told me to get my things in order, like this was it or something. Im not blind to my situation, but i just didnt know why he was coming at me like that with no tests or anything. It had only been 2 weeks since scans.And he didnt treat me like that then, he acted like we had lots of fight left and i do too. Anyway he then decided to admitt me to hospital for ct and other tests. Ive really been having a hard time swallowing, it burns so bad, im trying to keep liquids down but it hurts so. Well after the ct my family dr came to tell me there was an infection in my colon, which in such a strange way made me so happy. There was a reason. So they started me on antibiotics. Well today the dr comes back in to tell me no there was no infection in my colon WHAT??? There may be a little infection in my lungs and pnemonia WHATT??? I was hoping that was the reason for the indegestion stomach pain ya know. How can two diagnoses be so different. They dont even coincide right. Im so lost. Anyway i am at home now and they got me on magic mouthwash, i cant swallow so that doesnt help my throat or the pian in my stomach. Im still on antibiotic and a pill  for thrush since the dexamethasone has got me all tore up. I am hoping i wake up tomorrow in better health and spirits. Thanks girls for listening, sorry so long.

The one good thing i got out of all of this is all my scans came back before i left the hospital.  The brain scan showed the improvement. I was told the lung nodules are a bit smaller, and everything else was stable. I wanted to wait a little while on the brain scan just to see how much improvement there was and if it did the job because im still getting some kind of some headaches and space out a bit but that could be just from everthing ive been through.
