I actually just asked my care coordinator about this yesterday because I have a heavy flow, like you. She said to tell your medical team when you check in for surgery - apparently they can give you a special pad-type thing to wear that can accommodate heavy periods if you're going into a longer surgery. I'm hoping the breast tenderness isn't an issue, and I have to say it will be nice to be knocked out and medicated when my cramps are the heaviest",
