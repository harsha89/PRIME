My side effects was bad joint pain in the knees and feet, that I walked like an old lady. So they switched me to Aromasin for 1 yr and that stopped working. Now I am on a oral chemo (Xeloda) and thats worst than any aromataste inhibitors. My Dr. says they start you out will the least SE that will keep your cancer stable for as long as that may be. We need to be thankful that we have some of the choices that wasn't available years ago and be thankful for them. Knowledge is also very important God Bless Us All",
