      "Content": "Dec 12, 2013 02:04PM - edited Dec 12, 2013 02:05PM by Siniberry I had my surgery Nov 19th, a lumpectomy with core needle ultrasound to pinpoint the tumor. I am so discourged today, I went back to the surgeon(this is the thrid time) for drainage. He told me to take my antibiotic and in about a week it should be fine, if not he will wetpack it or put in drains. Went to change the dressing and the fluid ran clear down my leg. I can't see this healing in a week. I feel like giving up but that is not an option. I wonder how he would feel if he was in my position. Love you all",

Feel like crap, was sick all day yesterday. All I know so far is that he took a softball size out and the tumor was about dime size. He said I would be on hormon (sp) therapy for 5yrs. Won't know anything till Dec 5 when I go back to him. I have had a headache every day since the surgery. Just wanted to update everyone.",

It is 1cm, I am having a lumpectomy Tuesday. I don't seem to have any feelings about it yet. I can feel it coming and like you just don't know when. When the DR told me I was just releaved to know . I will do what I need to. Then after the surgery when I know everything and what comes next then I will probably fall apart and have my cry. I will say a prayer for all of us facing the uncertainty at this time.",

I am going shopping hope no major drainage while I am gone, going to take some extra bandages with me. This is my baby Rocky,4yrs old and 110#He is mommy's lap dog.
