Two FNA biopsies were done the end of last week that I am awaiting results on, with us, mammo and a tentative plan to do an insicional biopsy in a few weeks regardless of these results. Sigh. Yes, the waiting is the worst. Of particular concern to me are the following things: there is a history of reproductive cancer in my mother, although not breast cancer. She is also currently in remission with Melanoma (not A melanoma, but actual melanoma cancer). This particular mass is not moveable, although there is some tissue that moves around it.  It is hard, and from what the surgeon said during biopsy there doesn't appear to be any fluid. He said it is absolutely not a cyst.  Most concerning to me was the fact that I brought up the fact that I am on bcp's to regulate my cycle.  I have some uterine issues that cause heavy bleeding and frequent clots, and the bcp's were an attempt to stave off the eventual hysterectomy I will need.  I'm okay with that...not really all that atttached to my body parts, and am blessed with four healthy children. Knowing that est can often feed a tumor, I asked if I should d/c bcp's until we had a conclusive diagnosis on this mass, and his response was he feel that it is MOST important that I don't get pregnant right now. That left me feeling quite unsettled. This lump just feels different to me, both phsyically and emotionally.  I am usuall a pretty positive person, but I keep sitting here thinking, just call me and tell me it's cancer so we can get on with the treatment.  I don't know if I have become numb to the ongoing breast concerns I have had over the past  5 years, or if something in my gut is trying to tell me something. Anyways, that's my story.  Even if my results are negative, I am happy to have found such a supportiuve and informative community! Log in to post a reply",
