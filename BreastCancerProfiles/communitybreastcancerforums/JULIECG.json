      "Content": "Feb 21, 2008 04:04PM - edited Feb 21, 2008 04:07PM by JULIECG I was diagnosed with Stage I breast cancer in June 2002 and mets/Stage IV in June 2007.  Since June 2007 I have been on Abraxane/Avastin combination.  Avastin is not yet approved for breast cancer, only colorectal and lung cancers.  Recently, the FDA advisory panel voted 5 - 4 to not recommend the approval of Avastin for breast cancer.  The FDA will supposedly announce their final decision later this month.  Usually, the FDA follows the panel's recommendations.   The panel's decision was based in part upon their conclusion that Avastin doesn't extend survival rates.  There is a lot of dispute about this.  My oncologist disagrees with the studies relied upon by the panel - their methods and conclusions.  All I know is that Avastin is working for me as I am NED (no evidence of disease) as of December 2007.  The only side effects I have had are a little blood in my nose (not full on nose bleeds)  and bloody gums.  Sorry to hear about your mom.  Do your research, get all of the facts and good luck with the treatment.  Julie CG.",
