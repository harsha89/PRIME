I randomly started losing weight without trying and have lost about 9 lbs in 2 months, and with that came me noticing a large (3.5cm), hard, and movable lump in my right breast. I went to get an ultrasound, as a mammo was not recommended since i'm only 20 and have never had one, and they gave it a BIRADS-4 rating. I wasn't expecting it to be anything, so for it to be labeled suspicious is pretty scary. I had a biopsy today, which came with complications in that the doctor had trouble \"getting into\" the lump so he ended up making 3 incisions and going in with the needle about 15 times. Needless to say I'm very bruised up, with multiple hematomas forming. I find out in about 5 days (have to wait weekend + 2 business days) whether or not it's cancer. My family do not live in the country, and so I feel pretty alone going through this because my friends don't understand. Any support and advice on dealing with the anxiety would be appreciated. You're all so strong! -SJ",
