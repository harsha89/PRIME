Not one any of us would choose to join but such an elite group of phenomenal women once your here you know you are in great company.  First of all I'm 40, have 3 children and a single mom.  I was dx with dcis in October 2013.  Everyone said \"oh dcis, that is the good kind if you have to have bc.\"  That made me feel like I did not deserve to be scared or seek support from breast cancers groups because I did not \"really\" have bc.  I share that only to let you know that dcis is real and you are allowed to feel everything you may feel as you walk this journey and also to encourage you to seek support from your local breast cancer support groups long before I did..... 4 weeks after surgery...ugh!  If only I had known all the benefit.  Anyway, my dx was dcis of my r breast, there were diffuse lesions through out 10cms of breast tissue.  I had to have a mastectomy and was given the option for a bmx, prophylactic on the left.  I choose a bmx with immediate trams flap reconstruction and could not be happier.  I'm six weeks out from surgery and resuming my regularly scheduled life....3 kids, work, costume design for my daughters high school musical.  On final path there was a 1.4 cm idc grade 3 along with the dcis.  A surprise to all of us....that changed everything.  I went from having the good kind of bc to well you might need chemo etc..... Thankfully I had a bmx, so no need for radiation even with the surprise and I learned Friday that I will be treated with tamoxifen only.  My oncotype testing showed an 8% chance of recurrence and it only dropped to 7.5% chance if I underwent chemo.  I am so very thankful that I went ahead with a bmx and the reconstruction looks great.  If there are questions I can answer or if I can be of any support to you, I would be happy to do so.  Attitude is everything.  Be positive, you will get through this and there is much to be learned on this journey.  Wishing you peace, blessings and all the best.
