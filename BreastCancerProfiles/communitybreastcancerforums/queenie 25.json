I mentioned that it hurt during the exam and still continues to hurt when the area is touched. It's not a painful hurt but more of tender like I'm about to start my cycle hurt. Then she said for sure I needed to see the surgeon. I'm like everyone else, how could they all feel it but not see it in the films. I'm 30 so I understand its harder to see. It's frustrating!",

I haven't seen my images from the ultrasound or mammogram they just gave me a piece of paper that said benign....but what was benign? I dont know if its a lump or nothing...they just mentioned something about dense tissue. Im going to call my dr tomorrow cause I want to know more before I meet with my surgeon on the 21st. Sorry again for dumb questions. Log in to post a reply",
