I am feeling a bit better today.  Met with my Onc today.  He told me that the bone and joint aches are from the Leukine Injections.  Only 2 more to go for this cycle of treatment. I am hanging in there and fighting everyday.  Thanks for the support.  J",

I started chemo ( Taxotere and Cytoxan) on May 6th. A little nausea here and there, but not too bad. Then yesterday I began the first of 5 Leukine injections.  I feel like I have been hit by a freight train. My muscles, joints, bones..everything hurts.  How long does this last?  The thought of having to go in again today for the 2nd Leukine shot makes me ill.  I am not sure if its the chemo kicking in, the Leukine shots or both, but I am miserable.  Just venting Log in to post a reply",
