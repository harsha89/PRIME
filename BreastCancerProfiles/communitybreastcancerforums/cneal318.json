He told her not to be surprised if she has a sudden burst of energy. He also told us to get an antacid over the counter for her to take each day as the steroid will cause some upset of the stomach. He told us many of things you all have said. Stephanie, this will be the 4th time mom has lost her hair and now she says its the least of her worries for now, and she has never once shaved it off. Mom also has anti nausea medication already. He also told that she will be very tired after starting the radiation. I will keep you posted on how things are going. Stephanie I will probably have many questions for you along the way. I thank all of you for you prayers, support and suggestions. Hugs Crystal",

For those of you who dont know me, I post for my mother who was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer in December 2005 with mets to liver and bone. She is er-,pr- and her 2+++. She has been recieving carboplatin, avastin, and she also takes tykerb and she gets zometa for bones. Last week at her chemo appointment she started to feel very sick and starting vomiting and she said it felt like her throat was closing up, she had received everything but the carbo before getting sick, so they didnt give it to her. Instead her onc wanted us to come back on Monday of this week for them to try a small dose of the carbo to see if they same think happened again. Well we went back and she recieved the chemo and after receiving almost all of it, she started to feel sick again and stated her throat felt like it was closing up again. Well needless to say onc said no more of that chemo for her. I am so upset because she has been doing very well on this chemo till now. Has anyone else ever experienced this. I feel like we are going through chemo options to fast and soon there will be nothing else to try. She is only 55 and I want her here for many more years. I had to call the onc today because said that she wants a break from the chemo. So I talked with onc and she said she would let her skip her next treatment which is second week of October and come in for the next treat after that which is at the end of October. That will give her about a month off. I am really scared that alot can happen in that month, but my mother wants this. I feel like I am loosing hope because it seems to be one thing after another. Thanks in advance for letting me ramble. Hugs Crystal Hugs Crystal Log in to post a reply",

However she may switched to this after we see lab work on March 19. I will keep you posted. This is a section from an article on the drug that mentions some of the side effects. I hope it helps. The downside of Ixempra is that chemo that goes after dividing cells, also attacks healthy cells along with cancerous ones. Ixempra's side effects include fatigue, hair loss and anorexia. Patients may experience a decrease in red blood cells, muscle pain, joint pain, the feeling of pins and needles in their fingers and toes, and in severe cases, inability to use their hands and feet fully. Does Taxol sound familiar? Crystal",

She is currently on carboplatin and avastin along with zometa for the bones.

I am very worried about her but I dont want pressure her to the point that she gets frustrated with me. I only live 5 minutes from her and I am constantly checking on her. Please say a prayer for her because I am worried something more is going on. She goes for blood work tommorrow.

We have no family history and before this mom was the picture of health no major health problems. She is also er-,pr- and her2+++. Well I wanted to update everyone on my mom. We went to onc on Wednesday and blood work shows that the xeloda is not working. So she will have to be put on yet another chemo. The onc is putting her on carboplatin every three weeks in addition to her zometa infusions and she will continue to take the tykerb also. She will start the new chemo Monday March 24. Mom didnt take the news to well, she feels like we are going through the different chemos to quickly and that we will run out of options soon. Her liver enzymes are up also. Is there anyone here who has been on this chemo. I welcome any information you can give on it. I have done some research on it and it says she will loose her hair (this will be the 3rd time). I truley hate this disease! I know it is going to take my mom away from me much sooner that she needs to be taken. She is 55 and still has so much more to offer to the world. It seems like we keep getting nothing but bad news. Oh also she had scans yesterday so we will find out the results next week on those. Im sorry to ramble on but I am so down right now. I just want to cry. Hugs Crystal[Edit] [Delete] Hugs Crystal Log in to post a reply",

Mom has been really out of lately, so the doctor ordered some additional blood work to be done. I received a call from the oncologist today stating that her liver is failing and told us she hopes mom makes it to christmas for us but doesnt expect her to make beyond a few weeks. We meet with hospice tomorrow. I am so upset right now although I new her time was coming sooner than later I did not expect to here less than a few weeks. Please keep me and my family in your prayers.  Crystal Hugs Crystal Log in to post a reply",

The hospice nurses are wonderful. They have given me so much comfort and peace with the way they are taking care of her. My grandmother who is here from Alabama is taking this very hard. She has to watch her oldest child at the age of 55 slowly pass away. She told me this is so very hard because as a mother you don't expect to loose your child before you go. I am trying to be strong for everyone but it is becoming more difficult each day. Thanks again to all of you for your continued prayers and thoughts. Crystal",
