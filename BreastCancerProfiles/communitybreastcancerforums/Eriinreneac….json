I was told once I was 5 years out I was \"safe\". So after 8 years I was good, right? Well it came back with a vengeance stage 4 mets to lung. If I had known it was a disease that was chronic that I would need to manage  I would have handled things differently.....that's at least how I think now. At 44 I got the death sentence and went on their protocol......zoladex and femara. After 5 years I said no thank  you, I had been doing high dose vitamin c infusions so continued and switched diet to all organic etc..... It's been over 6 years and now my tumor markers are elevated, family and friends are pissed. I don't care,  I feel great. Isn't that what matters? I'm done with appeasing the doctors, my husband, mom, friends, society, etc. When I die it will not read \"she fought a courageous battle with cancer\".......there is nothing courageous about this...I'm screaming all the way!!!!! I'm not brave, just determined to do things my way not tow the party line. General medicine does not care about my life just statistics . My Naturepath CARES about my whole body, thank you! My oncologist is very concerned .......just not sure about what or who and I have had many. Please don't read this as bitter, I'm just tired of the bs that comes with general medicine.  And yes October sucks, no one gets it except those going through the storm (bless their hearts) ",
