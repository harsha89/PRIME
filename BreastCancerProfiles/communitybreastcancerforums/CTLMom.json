I have tried numerous things to try and help with the various issues involved including radiation damage, scar tissue, adhesions, etc. Recently, I have gone to a neurologist to try and get the nerve pain diagnosed. He was very nice and asked a lot of questions in addition to the 7 page pain questionnaire I filled out. Yet, I barely had any physical exam except for a couple of spots. I had to ask for a johnny because I was in a shirt and bra that made it difficult for him to see the areas I was referring to. I ended up being given a prescription for Gabapentin which did nothing but give me horrible heartburn. I just went again for a follow up. This time there was no physical exam at all except for testing my arm strength. I asked a great deal of questions and was met with mostly \"I don't know.\" for an answer. This visit resulted in prescriptions for Voltaren gel and a low dose of Nortriptyline to try. I was told to call in 3 weeks. Before I left I asked if anyone was actually going to physically look at the mechanics of my back! I was told next time.... I don't want to be taking pills without knowing what is causing the problem in the first place. I do understand that this is not a simple quick process, but I can't image just handing out medications without even looking at the problem areas!!! I am SO frustrated with this whole nightmare!! In addition to a physical/visual exam there are other simple tests that can be done to rule things out before even undergoing an MRI or CT scan of the area. Has anyone been dealing with trying to get answers and just getting medicated instead? I already have pain meds from my GP which I don't take a lot of so at least that wasn't and issue for me to deal with during these visits. I want to not need ANY meds at all!

It seems like there is very little information apart from this site that really touches on the women that have these long term problems after this surgery. The research is very meager from what I can see. Most things talk about how well it works and how few problems there are. I feel the problems are seriously under reported! I really hope the Botox helps your back pain so that you can focus on the bigger issues. I find that pain has become incredibly distracting in my day to day life so I can only image how you must be feeling. However, looking at your history you are clearly a fighter. I'll wait to hear how the shots work.",

My husband felt like a creep but it obviously is not his fault. I agree, I did not read about this side effect. Just another thing to add to the mix. I guess trying more often makes sense for the stretching factor. I hope it works. Thanks again, Lorene",

My oncologist said that there is vaginal thinning and dryness from the chemo and she gave me some suggestions for things to lubricate. I have not gone to get them yet, and I hope that they work. Not that I have any sort of libido right now, but I feel bad for my poor husband. Now that I just finished my chemo, we are going away for five days in a couple of weeks. I hope I am able to function by then using the doctors suggestions. Any thoughts would be appreciated. I start Tamoxifin on 11/15 and I know that it will not be helping the problem.

I had a tissue expander (done at the same time as the mastectomy) and after several months had the permanent saline implant put in. Fast forward to 2013 and I was diagnosed with a local recurrence in the mastectomy scar. After having head to toe multiple type scans showing no metastatic disease I had the lump excised. Final pathology came back again showing no lymph node involvement. After healing I began rads which consisted 6,000cGY. Several months after finishing rads I began to notice increased tightness and changing shape in the left \"breast\". Over the next couple of years it got increasingly worse till June 2015 I developed cellulitis and was hospitalized for 5 days until it cleared up. From that point forward my \"breast\" was so incredibly tight and painful that I ended up having a lat flap surgery in 2016 in order to cut out the radiated tissue and replace it with the muscle and tissue from my back. What I didn't realize when I agreed to this surgery is that the radiation damage was in my back/shoulder/rib areas in addition to the chest wall. I have been in PT for 3 years and also had HBOT to try and help. In December I had the implant removed and went flat in the hope of relieving the pressure and tightness that wraps around my left side. It helped a little but I am still in pain every day and deal with spasms in both the chest and the mid back. My oncologist suggested a bone scan to rule out any possible metastatic bone involvement causing my pain. She didn't feel that was the case but it was more a situation of ruling it out. The scan came back clean. I have recently seen the cancer rehab specialist my oncologist referred me to who said that have radiation fibrosis syndrome. She prescribed Trental and vitamin E. I have not been on it long enough to know if it will help. I'm sorry to sound like Debbie Downer but I wanted to share another side of what can happen with radiation when you already have an implant. Thanks, CTLmom ",

I have not read all the posts regarding the treatment but I wondered if anyone has had a problem holding their arm up during the treatment. I had shoulder surgery many years ago for a partially torn rotater cuff and ever since then that should is really tight! I had my trial run yesterday and lost feeling in my fingers, and the shoulder was burning so bad I could hardly stand it. As soon as I put my arm down the feeling came back but my neck/shoulder muscles were so sore. I may need to ask for something to relax my muscles during the next six weeks. What an unexpected aggrevation. The techs told me other people that have had this type of surgery tell them the same thing!!!",
