THIS WEEK MY DAUGHTER WAS TESTED  FOR THE GENE DUE TO OUR EXTREME FAMILY HISTORY. SHE AND I ARE POSITIVE AS WELL. SO MUCH ON THIS SITE IS OLD INFORMATION, BUT THIS MUTATION INFORMATION IS FAIRLY NEW AND INFORMATION IS STILL BEING GATHERED. THIS IS A DISGUSTING GENE MUTATION AND CAUSES SO MANY MORE PROBLEMS THAN ARE EVEN MENTIONED HERE. BE PERSISTANT. SINCE IT IS SOMEWHAT RARE, THEY TEND TO WRITE IT OFF WITHOUT EVEN EXPLORING THE POSSIBILITIES. SMH. THERE IS A NEW DRUG THAT CAN HELP WITH BREAST CANCER RELATED TO THIS HORRIFIC GENE, BUT IS NOT YET ABLE TO BE USED IN USA. UNLESS YOU ARE ALREADY ON THE WAY OUT. VERY SCARY GENE MUTATION, BUT WHAT IS EVEN WORSE IS THAT THE DOCTORS DONT KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT EITHER.  THEY ARE SORT OF TRYING OUT TREATMENTS ON THE FLY AND HOPING THEY WORK.",
