I'm just thinking into the future here. If it's cancer, obviously they will take those steps. But if it's not, are they just gonna leave a somewhat large lump in my breast? I'm just wondering what this could mean. It sounds like many women have excisional. It was offered as an option but my BS recommended core needle. - Is it true that core needles can spread cancer cells if the lump is malignant? I can't find exact studies.  -What does it feel like? What is recovery like? How bad does the needle hurt going into an already painful lump? Can my husband be with me? -How common is it to have inconclusive results that require more testing or biopsies? I want answers this time! I just got my second ultrasound bill and my heart stopped. I'll be insured soon but still. Is there anything I should know about this procedure? I appreciate it! I plan on asking questions in the office but I want to make sure that this is the right choice for me. I don't want to have to come back for another test if excisional is more accurate. I'll need to change this soon if I decide excisional is best. Log in to post a reply",

My breasts were really swollen right before my period (which I'm having right now) so I was really worried about what that local needle would feel like. The pain is much better than before so hopefully it won't be as bad. My BS wouldn't have been my biggest fan if the biopsy was done a few days ago. I'd squirm right off the table. I might do that anyway from nervousness, but at least it won't be from pain. I'm sure it will hurt a little since my lump does hurt but hopefully nothing major. Will I be laying facing up or down? I've heard different things but maybe it depends on what type of biopsy.",

For me, I'd rather go from an ultrasound straight to a biopsy than  ultrasound, mammo and biopsy. Mammo seems unncessary as it only holds up the process more... but I guess they have to locate the lump to biopsy it. I don't know your age but I hear that mammos are better for women over 35.

Which stinks because biopsies really scare people and should only be used when necessary. It's starting to seem like every lump needs to go through the whole diagnostic process. Waiting through every imaginable test sucks the life out of many of us.

Most of the sites I read explain Fibrocystic Breasts as cysts or \"fibrous tissue\". What does that mean exactly? Some sites say rope-like or ridge-like tissue. What is that? Can a fibrocystic lump be irregular and complete unlike any other part of the breast? Is there such a thing as having a fibrocystic breast issue in only one breast? Can the pain be constant? One more question for my increasingly worried mind. Since normal tissue can have texture to it, is it possible for a cyst to grow underneath that texture? Making it seem irregular and rough because it's under the tissue? Or am I grasping at straws? My lump feels almost exactly like a breast cancer lump is described...only it's painful to touch and seems moveable. I don't know if it's fixed to anything but it moves between my fingers. On my other breast, there is a similar texture in the tissue but no lump. So I was wondering if it was possible for a cyst to grow under that lumpy tissue? I don't know. I'm desperate, especially at 27, to believe that this could be nothing but it sounds like cancer. I even saw a picture of a removed piece of cancer and it \"looked\" how my lump \"felt\". I'm being horribly pessimistic and I'm so sorry for that but I have nobody to talk to that understands. I'm drowning in my own fears. XOXO Log in to post a reply",

I'm not a very strong person and I'm not too young for cancer apparently but I'm too young to feel like my life is over. I know it's reasonable to keep a good attitude but I think most women experiencing a breast lump go into panic mode. Some more severe than others. I wonder how many people on this board with a worrisome lump (i.e., irregular or suspicious) were able to keep calm through the process. My family keeps telling me to calm down and that I can't do this to myself. I agree for the most part but I also know that it's always different when it's happening to you. For me, reacting to the possibility is as bad as the reality. Unfortunately, I do have a pretty nasty family history and a lump that makes my heart stop when I touch it.

Ultrasound is the best \"practical\" screening test for dense breasts  My BS thought an MRI would raise more questions than answer them.

It angers me actually cause my radiologist made it sound like the best news in the world that they couldn't sonographically locate it. Once I spoke to my BS, she basically said, \"yeah that happens.\" I thought ultrasounds were pretty good at finding something there even if they can't immediately identify it. My lump is not golf ball size or anything but it's not tiny either. In fact, my \"cyst\" showed up on US and it was deeper in the tissue than this current one. Kinda smaller, but definitely more solid. Still, can't get over how this new one never showed on imaging. I should have gone to the breast surgeon before doing the ultrasound. Might have saved me some time. I know what you are saying about aches and pains! I know it might be emotional despair causing it but you never know. I really do see now that my emotional response has been extreme. I think it's understandable, but I'm definitely in way too deep now so that could be causing pain.

Everyone with a lump has to consider the possibility of something being wrong. I had a very abbreviated first visit with my surgeon and was overwhelmed with questions after. I have no insurance so making another appointment seems risky. I have no choice but to bother the nurse... which I've only done 3 times so far since the 15th.. but might have to bother at least one more time before my biopsy.  She told me to call anytime with questions but I'm sure I have a reputation by now of being an overly worried patient. I would hope that they understand that and have compassion for women in that circumstance. I have major trust issues with doctors and I'm sure the breast center staff has picked up on that by now. Only because I'm absolutely frazzled by how long it's taking to diagnosed this lump. I was floored that an ultrasound wouldn;t pick something up of this size. It's just been frustrating and it was all compounded by some of the worrying things that my surgeon said. I respect my surgeon but I'm very young... not too young for cancer... but young enough even with my personal experiences to be scared completely out of my wits. I hope the medical staff understands that.  I also agree that waiting is a living nightmare. I've been waiting 2 months now and my summer has been destroyed. My future plans are all on hold. My doctor has given me no reason to assume it will be okay so I'm stuck in this limbo phase. It's horrible. I also agree that no medical professional should treat a patient, especially a potential cancer patient, any differently because they are more anxious or difficult than others.",

I've always had general pain in the areas where my lumps are. Since I considered it a bilateral occurence, I assumed it was cyclical and never checked for lumps until last month. I'm not one to touch my boobs often or even do breast exams but my breasts NEVER hurt like this all the time. Could this soreness really be caused by my constant touching?? If so, how does it go from not really hurting to being excruciaitng? It REALLY hurts to touch but it kinda hurts on its own too. Even my lump in my other breast, the \"so-called cyst\" is still causing me a great deal of pain and I rarely touch that one now. In an effort to compare the upper part of my left breast to my right, I am now feeling pain in the top part of my left breast, where there is no lump that I can feel. What is with all this pain? I've been touching my right breast constantly but not my left. There's pain everywhere. I'm getting so frustrated from all these issues happening at one time.",

I had been noticing pain in my right breast and found a mass. It's more long than wide. The doctor described it as \"oblong\". It's moveable but hard. It's irregular to me because of its oblong shape. Most of it feels smooth but there's a part on the end that feels textured. It's more square  shaped than round although it does move easily. It hurts so much to touch. My appointment was a bummer as the doctor didn't really examine me as much as I would have wanted. I'm not insured so all of this is costing a fortune. $115 to have her briefly examine the lump. It was not a complete exam by any means. It was all very disappointing. She then told me I  could either go to a breast specialist or get another ultrasound. The last ultrasound cost me almost $200 and it wasn't even a full breast ultrasound. This is all so overwhelming to me. The doctor seems to think this is benign but I don't know where she's getting that from. She really didn't inspect it very much. Also, since it doesn't really feel like a cyst, what's the point of the ultrasound? Here's the kicker... my ultrasound is two weeks away!!! Is that a normal waiting time for a palpable, painful mass? I can't see myself waiting that long after what I went through before. At least my other lump was round and smooth. This new lump is pretty irregular which means that a cyst is not likely. I could potentially spend all month investigating this horrible lump. I'm hoping someone has some insight. I appreciate your input so much! Thanks! Log in to post a reply",

There's something unsettling about an ultrasound tech telling you there's nothing to worry about when everyone else says that biopsy is the only true diagnostic tool. I want to obey the doctors but I don't want to be brushed off either. I have a crippling anxiety about doctors to begin with so I'm always tempted to take the easier way out of medical things. If I live to tell the tale of this experience, it will change my whole outlook on healthcare. I'll be constantly looking over my shoulder and worried about what the doctor might have missed. Or wondering if the \"benign\" thing turns malignant over time. It's definitely good that your doctor seems to really care about you AND you are not alone in your feelings. I think this type of \"scare\" really wakes people up to the potential dangers out there. I wish it didn't have to be that way though.  There's a certain charm to blissful ignorance and I miss it terribly! XOXO and best of luck.",

It actually doesn't appear to be that rare to have get BC in this age group. I'm just surprised I would get such a big lump. My mom had IBC @ 44 and died @ 46. That's young by most standards but probably increases my chances of getting it even younger. I'm a mess and I'm sorry for being such a downer all the time. But I'm scared to go to an ultrasound with no real reason to expect good news. At least my other lump had features that could be benign. Yikes ... thanks for whatever info you guys have!",

I hope your treatment goes well! This is precisely what terrifies me most about breast cancer. How could your lump not show up on mammo OR ultrasound? That's so scary. It makes me feel like a biopsy is required for every lump. I was told my lump in my left breast was a cluster of cysts. Can I really trust that? I'm really afraid that this new lump will either be dismissed or not properly examined. Do you mind my asking --- how big is your lump? I'm so sorry to hear your news.

It's just amazing to see. Courage to you all!  I'm 27 years old. My mother had breast cancer in her early 40's and my grandmother had ovarian in her 50's. I haven't been to the doctor in several years and found a lump last week in my breast. It's roughly the size of a skitte, perhaps bigger. It moves but does feel attached to something. I would say it's quite hard and can be quite painful... especially when I'm touching it.  I made an appointment to see a doctor last week and she 'believes' it to be a cyst. She also said that cancer would be unlikely even with my family history. I also mentioned that there was a blue vein very close to the lump and she didn't seem concerned. I left  feeling pretty good but then started to realize that my history is so strong and my lump characteristics are still suspicious to me. I have an ultrasound scheduled for next wednesday but I'm so scared that this is cancer. My quality of life since finding the lump has beem abismal. I can't function and I'm crying all the time. Mostly because I have no insurance. I'm so young but I know my risk is very high. I just don't know what to think or do. I feel pretty hopeless.  In summary,  the lump is skittle-sized, hard, moveable but feels anchored to something. It's painful.... was more painful during and before my period. I have blue veins in both my breasts but there's a specific blue vein over my lump. Could this still be a cyst? I know my doctor saying that should have given me some hope but it didn't.

She suggested genetic counseling and dicussed with me that screening should start earlier than 40 for me.  I think she meant that *THIS* particular lump is unlikely to be cancer given my age... despite the family history. I want to believe her so badly but I don't. I will try to keep myself calm but this is a horrible feeling. My mother died from her cancer and it really took her down.

Even though pain isn't a typical sign of cancer, it definitely  can be and certainly if a lump is large. I'm worried about when this thing started growing for it to become this size already. It's not fast growing as far as I can tell. It's been stable for the last month (I think) so it's not some overly rapid growth. I know women can get this at any age but it seems particularly rare in the 20-25 age range. It scares me that this thing could have been growing since those young ages. I've glanced at the threat with those brave young cancer sufferers and most of them discovered their lumps when they were small. Not everyone, but most of them. I'm so concerned but I hope you are right. I can't stand the idea of going for an ultrasound with absolutely no hope for a benign outcome.

It's round/oval in shape and smooth. However, I  can't get behind the lump with my finger because it seems stuck to something. It moves between my fingers and the doctor said it was 'moveable' but I don't understand why it feels stuck to something. Can a cyst be that way or are they supposed to move freely? I've had a cysts on my eye and behind my ear drained. You;d think that a cyst could be stuck to your breast.... so is it possible that a benign breast cyst could move on the top but still feel anchored to my breast? My lump is also pretty hard. Does this still seem like it could be a cyst? Thanks again!",

She felt that my lump was benign. I plan on calling tomorrow to see if I can change this but I probably won't be successful. I'm worried about my physical and mental state between now and then. Anybody know what I should do? I never realized that my insurance status could put my at the bottom of the list. I'm 27... could age be a factor? Obviously my doctor doesn't think this is urgent.. but anyone at any age wants an answer ASAP. Especially since the ultrasound is not necessarily going to answer anything. There could be an even longer wait to investigate this further. I'm feeeling so beaten down right now. Thank you kindly for your input.... and I hope you are now doing well!",

Not having a round lump makes me more worried.",

Also, since it doesn't really feel like a cyst, what's the point of the ultrasound? Here's the kicker... my ultrasound is two weeks away!!! Is that a normal waiting time for a palpable, painful mass? I can't see myself waiting that long after what I went through before. At least my other lump was round and smooth. This new lump is pretty irregular which means that a cyst is not likely. I could potentially spend all month investigating this horrible lump. I'm hoping someone has some insight. I appreciate your input so much! Thanks! Log in to post a reply",

I don't understand and I was too emotional to ask all my questions. She was not a good surgeon and I felt very empty inside when I left. Like I had all the time in the world to figure this out.

It's hard to believe that mammos and u/s scans wouldn't at least locate a mass whether they can completely identify it or not. It's gonna be a source of confusion for me. I do have an appointment with a breast surgeon and I will definitely ask many questions. I'm also taking anxiety meds which, as you can see, are not working but I'm really seeking some input about what we do as patients in these situations. Would the average person on this board believe a radiologist that says a palpable lump is not showing on a scan? I have nothing against seeing a breast surgeon but I waited two painfully long weeks for this ultrasound that found nothing. One plus about this breast surgeon is that she is seeing me immediately. I should have gone straight to her in the first place, As a selfpay patient, I don't think there would have been any hoops to jump through. Thank you all for your tough love and constant support. I completely understand what a basketcase I have been. I do think this is an appropriate place for questions, concerns, grief, and anxiety.

I was doing okay yesterday because my family wants me to think that the ultrasound meant I was okay. I'm too informed to believe that. Not only does my lump feel horrible but so many women on this board have been led astray with their breast problems. Like you, I'm not normally this anxious. I did have mild anxiety disorder or at least anxiety I could function with. This is severe anxiety like I've never experienced in my whole life. With some depression and weepiness thrown in.  I just want to be around long enough to have a family and marry my boyfriend. If I could get the all clear about this, I'd live my life so differently. I wouldn't ask God to spare me cancer... rather I would just take better care of myself so I'd have a fighting chance if I did get the disease.

During my first breast exam, she didn't even notice this lump I'm dealing with now. If there was no pain involved, I never would have noticed it and would have trusted her assessment.

This agony is nowhere near over and I'm so afraid of dying before I've had a chance to live. I also just found out that my mother had inflammatory breast cancer. I knew she had breast cancer but never knew what kind. IBC is the deadliest and most aggressive type. I'm sure that only increases my chances of getting the same disease or something similar. People say it's \"rare\" to get cancer before 35 but it doesn't seem that rare. Plus \"rare\" has a different meaning to people with a family history. IBC is very rare yet my mom still got it. I've completely lost hope and getting through the day is impossible. I just needed to vent. Is there really any hope with a lump like mine? It seems destined to be bad just by how it feels.",

I know that an urgent biopsy would have scared me more but I can't help feeling like her assessment was money driven. I didn;t get the sense that she really knew what was going on with me. I tried explaining to her that I hadn't been doing monthly exams and never saw the doctor. She didn't seem to get it. Yes it's true that some cancers are slow growing and can wait a week to a couple months for evaluation. But what if I've had my lump since age 23? 24? 25? There's no way of knowing because I didn't see a doctor then. Also, I forgot to have her check my lump with my arm down (it's way more noticeable with my arm down) and now I'm reeling about that. I pictured something so different in my head. I pictured a calming room with a patient doctor that would sweetly answer my questions. I got a lady who was generally dismissing me for my age (even though there were two women under 35 in the waiting room, one clearly had cancer). I don't want to be brushed off for my age. I'd rather be brushed off because her \"expert hands\" didn't think it seemed cancerous. I want a better attitude and I want to calm down but it's not happening. The waiting has beeen the worst and I worry that my lack of insurance is going to get me subpar care everywhere I go. I have this strange feeling that even if this was a highly suspicious lump (which it still could be), that I still wouldn't have gotten an urgent biopsy. Peace with you all and I'm going to TRY to enjoy my wedding but I'm in such a sad place. I didn't get enough reassurance from my doctor to justify such a long wait for a biopsy.",

It's just amazing to see. Courage to you all!  I'm 27 years old. My mother had breast cancer in her early 40's and my grandmother had ovarian in her 50's. I haven't been to the doctor in several years and found a lump last week in my breast. It's roughly the size of a skitte, perhaps bigger. It moves but does feel attached to something. I would say it's quite hard and can be quite painful... especially when I'm touching it.  I made an appointment to see a doctor last week and she 'believes' it to be a cyst. She also said that cancer would be unlikely even with my family history. I also mentioned that there was a blue vein very close to the lump and she didn't seem concerned. I left  feeling pretty good but then started to realize that my history is so strong and my lump characteristics are still suspicious to me. I have an ultrasound scheduled for next wednesday but I'm so scared that this is cancer. My quality of life since finding the lump has beem abismal. I can't function and I'm crying all the time. Mostly because I have no insurance. I'm so young but I know my risk is very high. I just don't know what to think or do. I feel pretty hopeless.  In summary,  the lump is skittle-sized, hard, moveable but feels anchored to something. It's painful.... was more painful during and before my period. I have blue veins in both my breasts but there's a specific blue vein over my lump. Could this still be a cyst? I know my doctor saying that should have given me some hope but it didn't.

We're supposed to trust the radiology findings but I can't help but second guess. She only did the ultrasound in one spot and I keep having this fear that she missed the spot entirely. It seems like a cyst that is hard and the size of a skittle would warrant more testing. I guess I just need to read the report myself and call my doctor. It doesn't seem like they are going to follow up with me on their own.",

I also found another spot on my other breast the other day. It's also painful to touch. It's been painful for several weeks but I never knew there was a mass there until now. It's hard, not round, more like a long, bony, twig. It moves and it's near the very edge of my breast... almost towards the armpit. I'm so scared becasue I hadn't gone to the doctor and haven't been doing self exams. I'm so scared about this vein. I've been convinced that this is bad since I found it.

Two weeks of crippling anxiety to get to this diagnosis... \"we don't see anything there\". I guess you can add me to the club of disillusioned patients. The exam itself was agony.  While the tech seemed more thorough than the other one, she asked me many questions about my genetic family history. This made me automatically think something was wrong. Like she was correlating my young age at diagnosis with my history. Then she leaves for what feels like forever and brings the radiologist with her. I almost had a heart attack right there. He proceeded to tell me that nothing was found on the ultrasound. He said for peace of mind I could go to a breast surgeon. Not sure how long that will take and I'm pretty sure if not more sure than ever that I have cancer. Apparently just not the kind that radiologist can detect. He kept telling me it was good news and I was just depressed. I tried asking him how they couldn';t find a lump that is large. What does an ultrasound do again? I think I have ILC or IBC. That explains what feels like a thick, painful, flat, bumpy chunk mass in my breast that an ultrasound can't find. I'm so distraught because I was secretly hoping for answers. Now the biopsy is not even scheduled to happen unless I refer myself to a breast surgeon. Only then will I get the diagnosis I've been waiting for for almost two months. Glad I have the ativan now...

If there's someone in your life that needs a bit of protection (i.e.,mother, sister) then I think you could wait to tell them if it would be too hard to tell them. It's a difficult situation when you don't actually know what's happening but most close relatives will benefit from knowing so they can pray for you or think positive thoughts for you. I really really really hope you get good news!",

My breast surgeon just told me that she thought mine was benign because of the length of it.... but I've seen a few people say they had a long lump. It's just maddening. I wish cancer had more noticeable characteristics. Biopsies are painful and stressful. It would be nice to have a few other ways to detect cancer.  As far as pain... I haven't been diagnosed yet.... but my pain is pretty bad on both lumps. My right side being the worst although I don't yet know if it's from touching it so much. I'm trying to stop touching so I can tell for sure. The pain is VERY sore when touched and mildly sore when not touched. It doesn't generally hurt on it's own and I'm more comfortable when I'm not touching it. I'm able to sleep on my stomach with no problems but it might be because my lump is closer to my armpit.",

I had been noticing pain in my right breast and found a mass. It's more long than wide. The doctor described it as \"oblong\". It's moveable but hard. It's irregular to me because of its oblong shape. Most of it feels smooth but there's a part on the end that feels textured. It's more square  shaped than round although it does move easily. It hurts so much to touch. My appointment was a bummer as the doctor didn't really examine me as much as I would have wanted. I'm not insured so all of this is costing a fortune. $115 to have her briefly examine the lump. It was not a complete exam by any means. It was all very disappointing. She then told me I  could either go to a breast specialist or get another ultrasound. The last ultrasound cost me almost $200 and it wasn't even a full breast ultrasound. This is all so overwhelming to me. The doctor seems to think this is benign but I don't know where she's getting that from. She really didn't inspect it very much. Also, since it doesn't really feel like a cyst, what's the point of the ultrasound? Here's the kicker... my ultrasound is two weeks away!!! Is that a normal waiting time for a palpable, painful mass? I can't see myself waiting that long after what I went through before. At least my other lump was round and smooth. This new lump is pretty irregular which means that a cyst is not likely. I could potentially spend all month investigating this horrible lump. I'm hoping someone has some insight. I appreciate your input so much! Thanks! Log in to post a reply",

Something very similar is happening to me only the doctors are making me wait two weeks for an ultrasound. My lumps is very long and painful. It's very good that they are taking you so seriously and booking your tests so quickly. That's definitely something I would like to have. I had an ultrasound on my other breast a week or so ago which was \"non-concerning\" but I had to wait 1.5 weeks for that. This waiting game is torturing me so I know exactly what you are going through. I'll keeo you in my thoughts and hope for a benign diagnosis! I know you are scared and trust me... you are definitely not alone. It feels like it in our real lives but this group is great.",

How long did you blow off the armpit lump before seeing the doc? I wish I could tell you how to ease the anxiety but I'm trying to figure that out myself. My heart goes out to you and we will all be hoping for good news!",

It looked unlike any other blue vein on my breast or body. I asked my PCP and she said it was not a concern but I have also read that it could be caused by cancer. Mine on my left side is not your garden variety vein that you would see anywhere else on the body. It's darker blue, has a more narrow shape and runs right over my \"cyst\". I'm not sure what to make of it. Apparently my \"cyst\" had \"no solid component\" or \"internal flow\" which is what a vein would cause. Right? I'm hoping someone will know the answer. It's not a \"typical\" breast cancer symptom. Their explanation is that a malignancy needs blood flow so a vein will appear. If there's no blood flow in your lump, does that mean you are fine? It's confusing. On the other hand, having light blue surface veins on both breasts is very normal. Many women have that especially if they have visible veins on other body parts (i.e., legs). Pale women tend to have visible veins or may develop varicose veins later in life. I'm still worried about my vein but I try to comfort myself with the fact that my ultrasound did not find a worrisome mass in that area. Veins are weird anyway. They can show up in the weirdest places. My cousin has them on her face. Not gross veins but light visible ones.",

You are always within your rights to demand a biopsy in the future.  Good idea about having a checkup in a few months. I would do bi-annual checkups and be checking your girls on a regular basis :-)",
