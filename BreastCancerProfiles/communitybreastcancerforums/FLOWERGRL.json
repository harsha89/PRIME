I found out last summer that I had the BRCA2 mutation, and it took me a little while to come to terms with my choice, but ultimately I decided I could NOT be on the roller coaster that you are on right now, and had a preventative double mastectomy a few months ago.  My sister's cancer did NOT show up on a mammogram and grew fast, so I wasn't comfortable with the standard MRI once a year (not to mention how expensive each years testing would be).  So glad you are being proactive and I think the more info you can have, the easier it will be to decide what YOU need to do.  Good luck!!",
