I'm scheduled to begin my sessions on Wednesdays Nov. 9th, doing the 2-week thing but I'm thinking of asking to reschedule my appointments to start on Nov 16th. With my current schedule, that second treatment is going to fall right before a holiday (Thanksgiving or Christmas) and I don't want to be feeling meh around the holidays. Is that weird? Also, how do they decide who gets a port? They didn't mention that I need to get one so I'm curious..",

No one has mentioned anything about me getting one, but they always have problems finding my veins and I don't want to be a pin cushion. Also, have you all told all of your friends and family? I find myself telling a few people, and its always awkward. I still haven't told everyone, including some really close friends.... And I'm still in denial about losing my hair....I wear wigs frequently, by its different when u know everything underneath will be gone...",

I've been muddling through, I have 3 more treatments left, I'm up to the Taxol stage which is way better than the Red devil. I wish I had gotten a port, every treatment leaves me feeling like a pin cushion and I think I'm out of veins. I've lost about 20 lbs since being diagnosed, I think it's mainly due to having no appetite and being sick with bronchitis. My biggest worry is low blood count, I don't want to get a blood transfusion",
