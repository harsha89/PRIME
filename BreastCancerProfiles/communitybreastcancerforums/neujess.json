I had quite a traumatic stereotactic (on the table for 2 hours, panic attack and hematoma). If this going to be easier? How does it work? Sounds like I have to stand up and be awake which scares me after what happened last time. Thank you! 4/5/17 mammo showing microcalcs, 4-10-17 stereotactic biopsy finding ALH, 5-11-17 wire guided excisional biopsy 4-3-19, Mammo with a new area of calcs found, 4-8-19 stereotactic which found more ALH, 5-21-19 wire guided excisional Log in to post a reply",

Just worried I guess about another panic attack, but as long as I am partially sedated it will be fine. Thanks LisaAlissa- definitely. I don't have large breast to begin with and since there are 2 areas I am sure the scarring will be significant. Glad they did the stereo first",
