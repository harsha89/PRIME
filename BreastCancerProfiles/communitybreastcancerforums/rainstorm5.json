A good choice, there, wish I'd done it. At 43, I was recentIy presented with the same options as you are now, but in my case I didn't particularly care about having a breast or not (I was small chest-wise to start with, so it doesn't show as much on me when I pull a t-shirt on, etc). The reason for my decision was that I didn't want to deal with the radiation/chemo just to save a very small breast. Now, after a month has gone by, I'm thinking of getting the other one removed so that I can have a reconstruction that looks the same on both sides. Plus, I;m going to wait a few more months to let everything heal up a little before I begin again with more surgeries. Just remember, you don't have to do anything you don't want to do, and if you just want the greater peace of mind that comes with the mastectomy, then by all means do so. Doctors may know best when it comes to treating the cancer, but each woman's body image issues are different/unique. One person might be willing to get the lumpectomy to save their breast, while that might not be a concern for someone else. You have to choose the path that works best for YOU. best wishes, Jill",
