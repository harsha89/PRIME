After my first round of chemo that was very successful I was back into running and loving my 10km races. Now about 18 months of steady progression while we race through hormone treatment options have severely dented any form of exercise programme! To be fair, the treatments themselves have been easier to bear (I could hardly walk on tamoxifen) but I feel physically and mentally exhausted all the time now, so much so that I pat myself on the back for just getting through a day of work and parenting my 8 yr old dd. A group of my friends have started a social running club, challenging each other to sign up for 5km and 10km races - of course I'm included because they're eternally positive and know how much I loved running before, but for now I'll be cheerleader rather than runner. A quick scan through your posts is inspiring me to keep on planning for getting those running shoes back on! With reference to the skiing & biking discussion, I stopped horse riding after diagnosis of extensive bone mets - figured that with running I'm moving slowly and am closer to the ground, so less chance of injury. As a single mom working full time, I can't add being incapacitated with a full body cast to my list of treatments :-) Horse is now a much loved and cuddled lawn mower and I can't say she's complaining about it. But I miss it a lot so can understand the need to keep on as long as you can. Enjoy!",

Two good reasons - the feel good factor of feeding & playing with the visiting kids & getting to spend some time in class with my daughter. My work hours can be made up another time. Being only 5 & not understanding cancer, me losing my hair was a very big deal for my princess, so I've been very careful about always wearing my wig to school, especially since I was diagnosed just before she started at a new school & had to go through getting used to a new place & make new friends. Today, one of her little friends said she liked my hair (my wig does get so many compliments!) & Katy happily told her it was a wig because my hair fell out & she told me to show her friends how I can lift it up. They were amazed & she was happily laughing. Sad that this is something that is part of her life, but very happy to be her show-&-tell for the day :-)",

I've had liver mets since late 2017 and have felt no pain. Does yours hurt when you press on it or palpitate it? If you have bone mets it could well be a bone met in a lower right rib (same area as liver). When I started chemo when I was first diagnosed I had tumour flare in my bone mets and the sharp pain, hurts to breathe sounds very familiar. I was convinced I had cracked a rib and later scans showed fracture healing. I was put on bisphosphonates from the start too so they did heal relatively quickly.",
