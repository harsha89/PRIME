I understand this is common, but I am starting to get concerned, because I feel a large amount of fluid in the center of my chest (in addition to the two \"pockets\" of fluid I have on each side), and I can feel it slosh back and forth, side to side. Gross and extremely uncomfortable. I've been aspirated twice, and now my surgeon has left the catheters he used to aspirate the last time in so fluid can leak out. But it's accumulating faster than it's draining. I'm especially concerned about the fluid in the center of my chest, which feels like it's moving downward toward my upper abdomen. I am also now having a lot of puffiness and fluid accumulation in my shoulders, above the Ace wrap I'm using for compression. I'm very discouraged by this. Anyone else have similar experiences or able to offer some encouragement? Dx 8/8/2011, DCIS, 3cm, Stage 0, Grade 2 Log in to post a reply",

My compression wrap is causing me to puff up with fluid in my upperÂ  chest and shoulders too. Oh, and the gurgling and sloshing every move I make! Ay, ay, ay! I have an appt. with my surgeon tomorrow, and I am seriously considering asking him to put the JP drains back in if he aspirates more than 100 ccs on each side again. Good luck!!",
