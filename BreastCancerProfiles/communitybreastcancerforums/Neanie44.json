My treatments are every 3 weeks, so by the end of the 2nd week of the 1st treatment, I felt better and could eat more, so I have gained 4lbs back, but seem to be holding steady. Unfortunately, most foods except desserts have no taste, so that is another factor. My next treatment is 10/13, so I will see what happens this go round. Important to do--Drink plenty of gatorade and eat peanut butter crackers. It's something about the combo that helped me.  Praying for all of our healing.",

Plenty of nausea meds kept my stomach in tact, but morning after Neulasta, I started to feel yuck and now mouth is sore. I will try the Benadryl and Maalox - thanks for the tip.",

My 1st infusion was horrible as well. Felt like all my organs were coming out of my body, then my boss who is a retiring Oncologist told me to drink Gatorade.. Lots of it. After about a day my body felt much better. A lady my husband met in the grocery told him to buy me peanut butter crackers to eat for the bone aches and that along with claritin were life savers for me. The injection is definitely causing the bone pain. Also, to help with the mouth sores, please ask your MO to prescribe Magic Mouthwash. https://goo.gl/images/NVn7X7 This is amazing stuff. I have braces and didn't know about it for the first treatment and when my mouth starting getting sore it felt like I had razors in my mouth. After taking this for 3 days, my mouth felt so much better. Also, brush with kids toothpaste. Also, for constipation, MO recommended Metamucil daily. Sending love and prayers for strength to all of you!! You can do this!!",

Daniz- my husband also tried so hard to keep me upbeat when I experienced my hair loss, but I was like you..so whatever. Then, I purchased some big earrings and started to feel better.
