I was originally diagnosed with DCIS  4 years ago and had bilateral mastectomies thinking I had taken care of It.  This year told I had IDC in same breast on chest wall. Path report 2005 didn't show anything. < 1% chance. So I'm not sure how to stage. However my onc thought I should do chemo 6 cycles as well as radiation followed by tamoxifen. Right now, just feeling anxious about the road ahead.I'm off from work for 3 months. Hope your port went well,June bug40.",
