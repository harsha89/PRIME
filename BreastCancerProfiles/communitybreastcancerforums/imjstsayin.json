Diagnosis 2/22/2010, IDC, Stage I, Grade 2, .9cm 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2-, BRAC1/2-  3 surgeries before i got clear margins. Next step was going to be mastectomy which i'm grateful i didn't have to have. 34 radiation treatments..no chemo..now on femara for the next 5 years. I had a total hysterectomy/ovaries in 1999. I took premarin for about 4 or 5 years, but was advised to stop the hormones so I did. I was wondering since i've been off the hormones for quite some time and had clean mamos for so long how could I get a hormone driven cancer? I guess I was under the false pretense that because of the hysterectomy and not taking the hormones i was relatively safe. Man was I wrong. I still have days that I still can't believe it happened.  Doc says I have 95% cure rate which gives me a lot of confidence but on the other hand in the back of my mind I keep thinking what if I'm in that 5%. I know it's a crazy thought to have and I should be grateful my chances are so good. But my mind says to me \"well you thought you would never get breast cancer in the first place\". Anyone a few years into this that can put my mind at rest? I think some of it is that i'm so still so fatigued from the radiation and still healing from my radiation burn that i over think things. I guess i'm still very scared even though we caught it early. P.S. Anyone else on Femara? Had any side effects? ",
