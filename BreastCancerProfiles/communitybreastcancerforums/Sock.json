I just had a local for the surgery.  I can see where some people would prefer to have sedation or general for anxiety, but I was fine with just the local (the sensation of pulling didn't bother me, if it bothers you, you may want sedation).  I walked to the OR in my gown, bonnet, and slippers, hopped on the table, got draped and covered in blankets and had the surgery.  They wheeled me in a chair to recovery, I had a Dr. Pepper and went home.  All told, we were there from check in to driving away in less than two hours.",

I had a few calls today about dropping off films, procedures at the surgical center, where to go to get the wire inserted, etc.  One person said something about recovery, the other said something about picking my films back up after I felt better and my response was that I pretty much expected to just be up and about, what's the big deal?  Maybe I'm too positive about it, but considering they're just going to numb my boob, take the lesion out, and put a steristrip on it, I'm not worried about being incapacitated or being in too much pain (I have a high pain tolerance). I think they both thought I was nuts. Thanks for the info.  I was wondering if it was something like that b/c the terms seemed to be interchangable online and one site said their surgeons considered excisional biopsies to be lumpectomies.",

I'm just curious, b/c I want to know what I'm supposed to call this when I fill out future medical histories.  I have my preop appointment on the 15th and I'll ask then but in the meantime, was curious what you all thought. Just a quick history 12/4 mammo, 12/24 diagnostic mammo and ultrasound Surgical consults in January, needle biopsy last week that came back benign.  Surgeon that I'm using recommends removal of lesion b/c he's not comfortable with false negative rates and it doesn't appear removal will change the shape of my breast.  No local for the fine needle biopsy and it was completely bearable - less painful than a flu shot.  Planning to just have a local for the removal.
