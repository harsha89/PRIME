Having some light bleeding coming from left stitches, slight skin sloughing. Anyone else have this problem? I will call PS as soon as they open, kind of early now! I guess I'm too impatient, but I truly love to get advice from the discussion boards! I feel like we can tell each other better than the drs can! Angie",
