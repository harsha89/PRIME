My doctor is considering Neulasta for my last two cycles.I am wondering if anyone else has had a fever when neutropenic and what precautions were taken? I know they were super careful; with me as I was already in the hospital and exposed to everything under the sun.All my cultures were negative.I really want to avoid the Neulasta if I can,I hate even taking Tylenol,but will of course do it if needed.Would like to hear from everyone.
