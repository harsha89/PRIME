There is no redness or swelling or anything to see. It is in the same place and not related to my cycles.  Since that time, I continue to have focal pain in my right breast  - sometimes its just pain without touching it but the pain is definitely worse if touched, bumped, layed on when sleeping, etc. It is at about the 9 o'clock position on my breast.  I went to the MD who did a thorough breast exam and couldn't feel any lumps (but did find the area of pain quite easily -- OUCH!).  I am scheduled for my first mammogram (I am 37 years old with no family history of bc) and US this coming Thursday and have an appointment with a breast specialist on Friday. Waiting for this appointment is killing me with suspense and anxiety. I recently read a lot of the posts in the \"...yes my breast cancer did hurt section\".  Although I got the \"reassurance\" from the MD that \"these things are rarely cancer, and cancer rarely hurts, you breast fed your babies...\", somehow by saying them, they werern't reassuring and it almost sounded like the MD was trying to convince convince herself to not be concerned.  *sigh*. Also - TMI alert --- Recently, my husband has noticed that my nipple is not as responsive when stimulated. What I am wondering is, what is the typical time line from imaging to potentially needing a biopsy? Do they do biops in the BS office? Please send positive thoughts and prayer my way that this will be nothing. Log in to post a reply",
