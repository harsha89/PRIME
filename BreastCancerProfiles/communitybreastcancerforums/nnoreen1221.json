My question is what can I do to stay positive and hold up for myself, family and grandmother.   This is the first discussion board that I have joined and I'm hoping that i will be able to gain strength and knowledge/awareness with Breast Cancer.  And I haven't mention but my mother is also watching a tumor in one of her breast, So i also believe that I have a change at developing cancer.... Sincerely, Nicole Log in to post a reply",
