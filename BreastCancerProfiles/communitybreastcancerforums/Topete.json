The day before my appointment my Drs office called me and said my dr wouldn't be in the office the next day so we need to reschedule my appt. And her next available appointment was oct. 17th!! I cried and said you know how horrible the last week has been and now I have to wait 3 more weeks! I told them it's not fair and asked if I could just get my results now so I don't have to worry. Nope they said no... But I'm assuming if they have me waiting this long everything will be okay. Iv read many of your ladies stories and things seem to happen super fast.. So in my mind long wait means all is okay.",

But I do hope you get the gist as I would really like to know what you all think... Okay here goes Went to my primary dr sept. 1st to show her the lump I found in my right breast.... She examined it and orders a breast u/s and x-Ray. For the next day. Breast u/s sept. 2nd Ultrasound technician did first u/s... Went to show the dr the results of what she found. Dr said to do a mammogram. We did the mammogram and tech when to see what the dr though of the results she decided to come in and do a u/s herself from there they decided she wanted to have the tech move me to the newer u/s Machine and do the u/s there to get a better view. Tech left to go over her findings dr wanted to come in a do the u/s again. There she found many swollen Axillary lymph nodes. I also have a swollen a mammary lymph node. All leave the room saying they might want to do a mri.. Come back say no need to do a mri. Best to do a biopsy to confirm suspicions or possibly rule it out. I then also had a chest x-Ray before leaving. I had my biopsy on mon. 9/19/2016 I had a biopsy of my auxiliary lymph nodes. I was told by the nurse I would get the results the next day since I was having it done before noon but the dr told me I would get them in 1 or 2 days. And 7 days later still waiting... My biopsy experience was like this at the biopsy the dr said we will only take one sample this will be easy in and out... As he's did the first sample he said well we sometimes take 2 or 3 samples depending on how they first one comes out so I'm going to take another sample... 1 hr later and 5 samples I was finally done. My Drs office called me yesterday 9/23/16 to schedule an appointment to go over the results. I had a appointment on Monday already but they pushed it back to Thursday. The reasoning is that the hospital where I had the biopsy done wanted to send the pathology report down to Santa Barbara cottage hospital to confirm the diagnosis... So you can imagine my freaking mind is going like crazy. Thanks for any advice or information in advan Log in to post a reply",
