She just finished her 4th cycle and she has 12 left. Is there any standard way that the tumors (she has one in her left breast and another in her armpit, but we don't know how many nodes are involved) respond to the treatment? I mean, they're supposed to shrink, and they have shrunk a little, from 5cm to aprox 3cm, but is this good enough? Or it's a very slow rate? I'm starting to get anxious about it. First they were hard and know they're soft to the touch. But you can still feel them. How was it for you? Did they got smaller very fast or it was after certain number of cyles? Thank you in advance for taking your time and reading this, it means a lot, you people are so tough, positive, great and I wish from the bottom of my heart that each one of you can win this battle! I'm here on behalf of my mom. Learning about this disease and helping her fight it.
