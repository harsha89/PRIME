The hardest part to decide is whether to preempt the loss or wait. its christmas time n with all the scheduled family gatherings, its even more difficult to show up w that kind of look. So i decided to do it n tranches so i can see how i look in diff. hairstyle. i was sporting mid bobcat look last week n friends says they love it. Yesterday, i had it cut short \"Rihanna\" style. am actually enjoying the weekly change in my look. i might actually buzz it out totally next week since i was told effect of med will come on 2nd week. good luck to all of us, this too shall pass",
