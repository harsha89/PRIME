I have been lurking trying to figure out where to start and when I saw your post I felt this is the right time for me to post as a true member. I was diagnosed  February 2009  with stage 3 breast cancer and went for a routine check up with my oncologist and she suggested I get a ct scan, boy was I caught off guard at my follow up when she told me that something showed up. Well one PET scan later March 17 2014 I was told my cancer has spread to hip and rib, almost 5 years to the date. I have already had 10 radiation treatments which has help with the pain and now have palliative care and get faslodex shots every other week. I am trying to figure out my new normal I just never feel good I am so uncomfortable in my body and I am always tired, with massive hot flashes, I don't know if they are panic attacks.  Will I ever feel good again?",

I had been feeling pretty good except for some what I felt was break thought pain to my right hip.  I had a pet scan on Sept 9 and results on Sept 11 to which I was told my cancer has spread to both ribs both hips and a small spot on my liver!! The falsadex did not work at all. Of coarse I am devastated. I am going to go to Mass General to hopefully look into a clinical trial.  If you could please share win me what you a on or going to be on or even handling your diagnosis. I do not get any leg cramps and right now I feel pretty healthy. But my dr did not speak of having a liver biopsy. I would love to hear back from you. Take care and thinking of you, Lyn",
