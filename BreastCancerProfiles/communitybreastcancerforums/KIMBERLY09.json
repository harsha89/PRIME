I had horrible MATS like someone stuck gum in my hair in random areas. I could not brush through them, if I tried to the whole flippin chunk would come out!!  Oh yeah not fun to wash or to brush or comb through. I finally got the nerve up to shave it off because it was too painful to style and emotionally I had enough. I actually had my brother buzz it off and he thoroughly enjoyed it I must say and we laughed and cried together. It brought us closer and gave some much needed humor to the situation for us all. I was completely bald at the coldest time of the year in Wisconsin.  You really do lose alot of body heat from your head!  lol  I know I struggled some days looking at myself bald, but I was also aware that it was a reminder to me that it was only temporary and it would grow back. I now have a full head of  curls  and (I used to have thin straight hair before) don't know really how to style them yet.  I have had one haircut since the regrowing phase last September just to even out the few hairs I had.  I was extremely sensitive about my hair issues more so than losing both breasts! crazy I know.  It is temporary and worth losing to ensure your beating this CRAPPY disease.  hang in there sis!!!",
