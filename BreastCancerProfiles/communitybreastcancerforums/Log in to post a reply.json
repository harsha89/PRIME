The doctor has ordered a PET scan.  He also told her to go ahead and do her reconstructive surgery which is scheduled for a week and a half from now.  My Mom lives about five hours from me.  She read some of the CAT scan report to me and said they had numerous remarks about various lymph nodes being enlarged as well.  It was too much for her to continue reading the report, and I don't want to scare her any more than she already is by asking her to read any more details.  I need some honest advice about what we should do.  I don't want to waste any time if there is treatment or things we should get done.  Please let me know how to make sense of all of this.

I had my first routine mammogram Monday.  They came back in for one more angle of my left breast. I had a hysterectomy 3 yrs ago and am not on HRT. My breast has been hurting continuously since the test. I have taken ibuprofen and applied heat. I had done self exams but not regularly.  I do feel lumpy but notice some lumps that are different than the others and some of them feel firm.  There is no dimpling, I have had occasional itching (thought it was from a bra), there are no reddened areas, and I don't notice any drainage. I'm just concerned and hate the wait. The Drs office told me it takes 3 days to get the results. I am a little scared but shouldn't be I guess. I hate hearing i'm probably worried about nothing, I don't have cancer, etc.... etc..... Just needing to vent STILL. carrie Log in to post a reply",

Got two different opinions - one says remove breast since its multi-focal (more than one tumor).  Other decision says \"no need to remove breast, since clean margins, chemo being done, not multi-focal or multi-centric even with those two add.' tumors, ect.\"  I have dense breasts and am hearing that maybe higher re-occurance with dense??  Am scheduled to stop chemo this July 12. Have to make a decision soon as I will start Rad.s - anyone out there keep their dense breasts and have a happy ending w/no re-occurance after lumpectomy only?? Would love to be able to keep my breast as its traumatic to me- would love to hear your story. Would also like to hear story of opposite if situation is similar.

      "Content": "Deleted Member wrote: My friend was recently diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer.  I am helping her with a bit of research and hoping someone out there might have more insight into getting an MRI scan prior to chemo/radiation. My friend has been told by one of her drs. to get an MRI done.  Thing is if she opts for the MRI and it shows cancerous cells then the treatment is to have a mastectomy.  If she decides not to do the MRI then she will be treated with chemo/radiation before having to consider a mastectomy.  What is confusing is if she decides to have the MRI done and there is something that shows up why she can't have the radiation/chemo before having the mastectomy.  Supposedly the dr. said as a dr. he has to perform a mastectomy once a MRI scan shows there are cancerous cells.   Has anyone every heard or gone through a similiar sitiation or can share with us this way of thinking?

(was on other board- \"waiting\") now I have a dilemma!!  I went for a 2nd opinion today at Beth Israel in Boston and they gave me the same treatment (drug plan) as my other hospital - that was the good news, however, they think I should save the breast unlike the first opinion. I was diagnosed with Multi-focal IDC and got clean margins (lumpectomy) 1.5cm with 2 satelite 2mm & 4mm tumors - was also in two lymphnodes.  Had a MRI a couple of weeks ago and both saw a \"spot\" on film outside clean margins. First hospital thinks it could be another tumor (tiny tiny) and should now get mastectomy and 2nd hospital today said that it looks to them like it could be scar tissue from lumpectomy or a blood vessel. I was devasted that I heard the first hospital (after my lumpectomy) tell me that it would be best to take breast - devastated.  Went to this 2nd opinion for this reason alone, and now this new opinion thinks that I could save it. I dont know what to do and am now upset all over again. I personally would want to save my breast but I dont want to be stupid either. Today I was told that removing my breast would reduce reoccurance at 1-3% whilst keeping it would reduce reoccurance at 7-8% - however, they also said that my \"overall survival rate (due to 2 lymphnodes) would be the same! so now I just dont know what is the right thing. I feel like I just got strapped in on that roller coaster ride again! Anyone else out there that dealt with this similar dilemma? my sister says to go for a 3rd opinion (best two out of 3), my husband says to not think about it for a while since I start chemo in 2 days! I needed this like a hole in the head. Best, Heidi Ain't No Such Thing as a Free Lunch :) Dx 2/14/2008, IDC, 1cm, Stage II, Grade 2, 2/12 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
