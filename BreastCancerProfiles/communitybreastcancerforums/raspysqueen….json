My RBC, hemoglobin, & platelets were too low. I went back today for treatment and they informed me that my doctor is removing the carboplatin for at least this treatment and #4 as well. They also told me I would not need the neulasta shot tomorrow. Has anyone ever heard of doctors removing drugs from a chemo regimen? Or not giving a neulasta shot? If so what was the outcome? Thanks :)",

One more round without it and for #5-6 I will see the actual oncologist instead of NP/PA so I can see how he thinks we should proceed. VioletKali, you are most definitely not alone.",
