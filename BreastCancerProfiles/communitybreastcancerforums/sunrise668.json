Here we normally do not have good knowledge about stages, diagnosis, and treatment of breast cancer, including the pre-cancer type, stage 0.   My situation: The doctor said I had various scattered points of calsification there after doing ultra sound and mammogram. Report says the calsification show no signs of being maglinant. Doctor said, \"No problem there\"..\"there's is minimal chance of turning to cancer.\" \"For monitoring, keep doing Ultra sound half a year, and mammogram once a year.\" Before I come here, I had little knowledge of breast cancer.  Thanks for this website, really!!  But now I found Stage 0 of cancer type could be my case. I have no idea on :  (a) whether it is cancer or not (b) what to do next (do i have to get it away as soon as possible to avoid any danger).   Please advise.Thanks .",
