She said that if the biopsy came back benign based on what she saw on the image she wouldn't believe it and would want me to have a more thorough excisional biopsy. I also talked with my ob gyn before the biopsy results came back. She told me that radiologists are so experienced with imaging that they are usually right about what they see. It was hard to have my radiologist be so frank but in the end I was grateful for her candor. I would do as your radiologist suggests and have further testing right away. There is no down side to it. It will rule out cancer or get you on to treatment if that's what's needed. Early treatment makes such a difference. I hope you don't need it but if you do it can give you a much better outcome. Don't let your fear stand in the way of obtaining the knowledge you need to ensure your health.",

I read that any sort of soda is one of the worst things for your liver. Sugar in general is hard on the liver. Unfortunately friends and family have been trying to comfort me with sweets. That's got to stop. I'm not overweight and in general I have a healthy diet. Nonahope I was so happy to hear about your wonderful liver test results. What foods did you eat to enhance liver function? Tina, thank you for your thoughts re hair loss. It's a tough issue and I really admire the way you are handling it. The santa hat sounds fun! Magari, I cold capped this session again and it was easier this time. I'm sticking with it even though I've lost quite a bit of hair. Using a couple of timers made the process better. Hair loss created severe matting in my hair the other day. I sprayed it while dry with a hair shine/glosser and was able to detangle it. Just hoping for less shedding this cycle but we shall see.

I'm self conscious about the way I look and find I avoid people. I also think the loneliness comes from having to put up a strong front. When I was first diagnosed well meaning friends told me I had to be strong, a fighter, and have a good, positive attitude. Although those things are important, for me they aren't achievable 24/7. Luckily I have a few people with which I can just be myself. To me, the mark of a good friend is someone with which I can be strong or vulnerable. My sister has been so wonderful and I spend a lot of time with her. The other emotional challenge I have is the difficulty of dealing with uncertainty. It's what I hate most about cancer. After finishing chemo there's really no way to know if it's been successful. I'm going to have to learn to deal with the uncertainties in a positive way. After cancer the urge to purge all the b.s. from one's life is great. No more worrying about the small stuff or putting off what's important to you. It's a wake up call to go after what you really want in life. Maybe that will be my silver lining. I also hate the fear. Some days I fear I won't get to the other side of this. I fear the possible permanent side effects of treatment and the outcomes of various tests: bone scans, liver scans, blood work, etc. All of them produce anxiety. I fear the entire experience may change me for the worse instead of the better. Maybe that's where the silver ling stuff will help. :-) My newest issue is red, dry eyes. I'm drinking lots of water but they still persist. Has anyone else experienced this? Over the counter drops haven't helped much. Well, that's it for me. I'm going to bundle up and go for a walk. I hope everyone does well today. ",

My first shot gave me bone pain, even in my jaw, whereas the second one just gave me fatigue. The bone pain didn't bother me too much as it felt like I'd been on a long hike. The tiredness puts me on the couch for a day or two. The first time my blood count was still low at my 7 day check up. The second time I was within normal limits by then. The first time I used feeling bad as an excuse to eat a lot of junk food. The second time I cleaned up my diet and my overall side effects from chemo were less. My Dr. said by day 9 or 10 most people's blood counts are within the normal range. I think all of us here have our ups and downs. It's a challenging time that's for sure. I think many of us are mid way or 1/3 through our treatments with side effects intensifying, etc. For me, I just hope that somehow I can come through this a wiser, more compassionate person instead of a diminished one.

My sister lives fairly close so we get together and comfort one another. I try to honor my mother's memory by counting my blessings--it's what she would want. Aymerz congratulations!!! You made it through and look so happy! I can't wait to be on the other side of chemo! Enjoy!!! Yesterday was the day after my nuelasta shot and that is always the hardest one for me. I think today will be better. I hope all of us feel better today.",

On days 2 & 3 it is more tiredness and upset stomach than anything else. Overall for me it was doable. I haven't had swelling. I have had some muscle soreness but it goes away pretty quickly. This round I haven't had to take any medicine to cope with side effects. I drink lots of water and get my rest. It's different for everybody, but for me taxotere/chemo treatments settled into a predictable pattern that I could cope with. The best thing about taxotere is that it's an effective anti cancer drug. I tried to think of it as something that was helping me more than hurting me. Take care. You will get through this.",

I don't think it's as clear cut as other areas of treatment. I have 20 sessions and I'll be glad to get them done. I'm so tired of people looking at my boobs, drawing stuff on me, shoving needles in my veins, etc. Don't get me wrong people have been nice, but I just want my body to be my own for a change. I don't want it messed with anymore. So that's my rant for today! Tina congratulations on completing your chemo! I hope you recover from it quickly. When the time is right you will do your radiation.

You aren't a wimp at all, rather you are smart to be cautious about exposing yourself to a risky environment. I work from home and sometimes I think work is a blessing in that it's a normal slice of life but at other times it can be stressful. It's important to find the right balance when you're going through chemo. I also find meditating helpful. Calling a close friend when I'm down helps too. However hard the chemo is I try and remember it's a door to being cancer free. Just remember you aren't alone. We are all rooting for you. Lizabeth, my 3rd round is January 11th. One of my liver values came back too high for the second time and the Dr. is concerned. I'm stage 1A and had a small but aggressive tumor with no lymph node involvement. The Dr. thinks it might be a reaction to Taxotere. Hopefully she will clear me for my 3rd round. Ironically I had a pretty easy time with round 2. I'm nervous before every infusion though because I know they're all different. Right now my hardest symptom is dry, red eyes. I have been using over the counter drops and drinking more water but they remain irritated and well just make me look kinda weird. Blair, you and Lizabeth and I are on the same regime. I agree that often the hardest part is the psychological. I just want to get through the chemo relatively unscathed. I keep wondering how long the chemo drugs stay in our bodies after our final treatment.",

I really enjoy being active and working out. I'm going to join a new gym soon. And yes what a difference in your hair! I know it probably doesn't seem like it but you are on your way girl! You can tell that you will eventually have a full head of hair. I even see some nice eyelashes. I think eyelashes and eyebrows fall out because they become synchronized during chemo. Normally they would be on a staggered growth cycle so they wouldn't fall out at the same time. Interestingly when we shave our legs we synchronize our leg hair. It all grows at the same time and rate and that's why we think shaving makes our hair get thicker. It doesn't really, it just synchronizes. I recently got some Latisse (lumigan) to enhance my lash and brow growth. I used it before and it worked well on both my lashes and brows. I'm applying it carefully so as not to get it on all my lashes/brows as I want to stagger my growth if I can. My brows and lashes are there, but thin. We shall see what happens. I'm keeping my expectations low. I know they could all fall out tomorrow. I cold capped but it didn't work very well at all. I lost 95% of my hair and am mostly bald. I think my body absorbed those chemo drugs like a sponge. I see what I think is growth in a few places but on most of my noggin there is nada. Where I am most bald and where I would really like it to see it come in I have nothing. I'm ok with it most of the time as I just put on a hat and do what I need to do but when I get myself ready for the day I look in the mirror and cry. Part of it is vanity and the other part is grief over not looking like myself. I need to remember to count my blessings. I've also been working on my skin. Chemo drugs took a toll on it but it's improving now. My eyes were so red for awhile but that's also gotten better. Blair I've heard that when hair comes in at first it's very soft and fuzzy. It sounds like that's what happening for you. I'm crossing my fingers that both of us see an improvement soon. Here's to a good recovery for all of us.",

Surprisingly I have enjoyed the drive. I arrive at the hospital early and go to the floor where there is a Starbucks and other shops. I sit in SB for awhile and indulge in my somewhat dubious hobby of hair envy. Interestingly, quite a few of the hospital employees have wildly colored hair: green, pink, purple, orange, you name it. I find it very amusing. Of course some just have normal hair or even pretty hair. It doesn't matter I envy it all, lol. It seems so long ago that I had hair. It's strange. As for the rad thing, while I found chemo more difficult physically, so far rads has been more emotionally challenging. I'm doing 20 total, 16 whole breast and 4 boost. I'm at day 14.

Like Tina, I wash my hands frequently and as soon as I can. I often feel isolated but I remind myself it's temporary. I go for walks, pet my cat, call friends and family, and enjoy a good book.

It could be that healthy people are more likely to exercise vigorously in the first place making those with high health to begin with less likely to recur. That said I enjoy exercise and being active. I'll continue to do it and yeah I think it does put the odds for future health more in one's favor.

Tina, nice picture! It sounds like you have a very caring son. It looks like it was a fun time. Yes, get some rest now! It was such a pretty day here yesterday. I went for a long walk with a friend and then had lunch. It was so great to get out. Normal feels good. One week from today is my 4th treatment. Doing my best to be ready for it; eating carefully, regular walks, etc. I've had trouble with liver values and I'm always afraid they'll delay my treatment. It's that feeling of anticipation and dread that we're all so familiar with. Kat I'm sorry you are having a hard time right now. I understand your grief. Grief for the loss of normal, grief over the physical changes. I grieved for my old body but have come to accept and like my new one. Hard to explain but I've made friends with my new breasts. I hope you find the solace you need. rljes Good for you for finding relief! I'm for whatever gets you through (as long as it doesn't hurt others of course). Blair hope you continue to feel better.

I had an abdominal ultra sound as standard procedure before starting chemo. After the elevated liver enzymes presented the Dr. ordered another scan. I was extremely nervous, my brain went in a lot of different directions, but the results were normal. My biggest fear is that I'll have weird blood test results and they'll want to delay my treatment. I so want to stay on schedule and be done. I've been very careful with my diet and I think that has helped my blood work. I find the anti nausea pills really made me constipated so I just take a tums if I need something. Like Hope I hate that constipated feeling. Fruit has been my best friend. I've been pretty lucky with side effects. I feel fine until the neulasta shot, then within 24 hrs of that I'm miserable for several days. By day 5 or 6 I've perked up again. By day 7 when I go to my appointment I feel pretty normal. I sure hate the lousy feeling the first 5 days though. I've also been walking everyday and that's helped as well. Blair, the steroids should help with your back and tiredness. Everyone reacts differently but steroids just wire the heck out of me. They almost give me too much energy. I hope they work for you. I think they'll help. I agree that your muscle pain is the result of chemo. You could also have twisted a muscle in your fall. I doubt that it will be permanent. I agree with Hope; get it checked out more if it doesn't go away.",

I do find that I tire more easily though. I guess each round will be different which for me is anxiety provoking. My hair continues to shed relentlessly. What bothers me most about hair loss is the loss of privacy and questions from strangers, acquaintances, neighbors, etc., it generates. I live in a small town so it will be unavoidable.

When you go to the Dr.'s it's a really good idea to take someone with you. A second set of ears to listen and get information can really help. Even at routine appointments it helps to have someone with you. You need to make sure you know how to contact your Dr.'s office after regular hours. This is something Dr.s want their patients to know and most go over how to do this with their patients. They don't want you to have to worry so much. Does your Dr. have your blood work? If he does he knows that your platelet count isn't quite in the normal range. Perhaps that's ok. Blood work can vary a lot from one day to the next. Your platelets might be fine now, but if you are still worried call your Dr.'s office. I hope your mind is soon at ease. The emotional aspects of chemotherapy are hard.",

To me what makes a good MO is someone who stays on top of side effects and who watches carefully for signs of recurrence. It's reflects well on your MO's competence that he or she ordered an ultrasound. I've known others who didn't get clear margins first time around. I think many surgeons try to conserve as much of the breast as possible so they take the smallest margin possible. If you've got them now that's what counts. I know what you mean about the optimism. I thought I'd just have surgery and radiation. I so didn't want to do chemo. Having the liver scan was the low emotional point of chemo for me. It just scared me. I've done well with the physical part of chemo but emotionally the whole having cancer thing is hard. I looked in the mirror the other day and saw bad skin, hardly any hair, tired eyes; just a really ugly version of myself, and I cried. It wasn't all about vanity. It was more about self identity and looking like a cancer patient. Thankfully my optimism re emerged. None of us knows how many days/months/years we have left--we could get hit by a bus tomorrow--so I want to enjoy life as much as possible. In the end I washed my face, said f*** it, slammed a hat on my head and went over to a friend's house. I think when optimism leads to resilience it can help us.",

I'm not looking forward to it at all. But the good news is that this was my last infusion! I will be going on to the next phase, radiation. A friend said there are three phases to cancer treatment: cut, poison and burn. Kinda of a blunt and somewhat funny way to put it.

I have 5 pounds to lose. I need to get serious about it! Meow I also had eye issues during chemo; blurriness and twitching. Both are completely gone now that I've finished chemo. Blair sounds like you are doing better with the whole back issue, i.e. not worrying quite so much. No wonder it hurt so much with a fracture. Sincerely hope you get answers and relief soon. Magari you sound busy and have a lot on your plate. I hope all of your appointments go well and that your port issue is mended soon. Nonahope I pray you are feeling well these days. Iris I hope you are doing well too. Like you I'm a regular these days at the gym. It feels good to be working on my fitness. I want to do some wonderful hikes this summer. It helps me to have a goal. I thought my hair was looking better but got a reality check when a grocery clerk I hadn't seen since prechemo stared at me in alarm and asked me if I was ok. The look on her face was a combination of concern and fear. Then a guy friend told me my hair looked really bad and I should just cut it all off. I know these are small issues compared to what others are going through, but nevertheless, still not fun. Well it's back to the hats I go. My eyebrows are coming along nicely. Eyelashes are a bit slower. Lost one toenail but it didn't hurt and there's a very thin one underneath it. Hang in there everyone.",

For those who have finished treatment, how often are you getting mammograms? My MO says once a year is sufficient but I'm wondering if that is sufficient. She also told me my greatest risk of recurrence is the next two years so I'm wondering why not do every 6 months. Magari I hope all is well with you. Sounds like life has been busy. You mentioned fat grafting which is something I'm curious about. I don't have implants but one of my breasts is smaller than the other one. It's not terrible but I wondered if fat grafting might fix it. My main concern with grating is that it may interfere with mammograms. Perhaps that doesn't matter when patients have had a full mastectomy and don't need mammograms or perhaps imaging has gotten so sophisticated that they can decipher the changes that can occur through grafting. Just curious about what you've heard about it. Star who've been through a lot. Pregnancy and breast cancer would be hard on anyone. I hope you continue to recover. I hope everyone is having a nice weekend.",

I hope you enjoy a nice visit with your friend. Rljes my twitchy, bloodshot eyes drive me nutty. It's such a weird side effect. I can't wait for it to go away. I'm sure you want your eyes to get better too. I went in for my radiation modeling/simulation. It was an easy experience. I'm having 20 treatments (16 +4 boosts). I opted to not have permanent markings so will have to be very careful with my marker/taped ones. I asked the nurse about potential permanent side effects and was told it can make my skin look suntanned and leathery. I thought the term \"leathery\" was most unfortunate. I don't want one breast that is tanned and leathery. It gets me that these medical people are so casual about side effects. The temporary side effect is a certain amount of fatigue which doesn't appear until the second half of the treatment schedule. I also asked about how close they would come to my lung and was happy to hear it probably wouldn't be necessary to radiate any part of my lung. I was also happy to hear that the radiation plan has to be reviewed by three different people before it's approved. Anyway I start next Thursday. This Sunday I will be 3 weeks post final chemo.",

Sometimes I think the hair gods have a warped sense of humor; give them the opposite of what they want and make them live with it, lol. I have short hair in some areas and some long in others. Basically I have a strange looking mullet. I'm trimming the long hair and figure one day the long hair and short will meet, until then I've decided to ignore the whole hair issue as best I can. Meowmmy I can see in your picture that your hair is starting to come in. I admire your great attitude about it. And your girls are very pretty. They have your expressive eyes. Orangedaisy benign is the most beautiful word any of us can hear. I'm sorry you are having more surgery but so glad it's not for direct cancer reasons. Hang in there and let us know how it goes. Magari I'm sorry you are also having more surgery, but it sounds very necessary. I hope it goes well and that you continue onto the next phase without problems. My \"saved\" hair is also thin and scraggly but the new hair growth seems fine and is the same color and texture as my pre chemo hair. Nonahope are you feeling any better? Sure hope you are. Take care everyone.",

Sorry to hear about the anti hormonal side effects. Yes, give it more time. It must take the body awhile to adjust. Good thing there are several options. I'm doing well. I've had some soreness and stiffness from radiation so I'm massaging my breast to break up scar tissue. Wish my hair would grow faster but don't have any bald spots so I'm grateful for that. Proud it's great to go to the gym and exercise. I enjoy it too.",

For me it elevates my mood and just makes me feel better so I happily do it. I'm glad you are tolerating Letrozole well. I know some women have a hard time with it. I have head gear to donate as well. Recurrence or no I just don't want the reminders around. My hair isn't attractive but I'm grateful to be able to go our without something on my head and pass for normal, especially in summer. I agree, so much more research is needed. Research has come far but so much farther to go. Cut, poison, burn of today's treatment is tough as we all know too well.",
