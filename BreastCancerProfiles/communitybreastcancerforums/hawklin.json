It's been about 5 months since I stopped breastfeeding and the lump has not gone away so I finally scheduled an appt. to have it looked at. My GP felt the lump that is kind of in the under arm area and I also have swollen lymph nodes in both arm pits. Course of action for now is blood work, ultrasound of said lump as well as a CT scan of my chest and neck and then I have a referral to a breast specialist aka surgeon for what course of action we will take after I have the scans done. I was told to wait to schedule my scans until he gets my blood work back. I just want answers. The only thing I can think of is that my youngest daughter is only 3 and if it's cancer and I die now she'll never remember me and it breaks my heart. And also that I should have gone to the dr. a long time ago. :( Log in to post a reply",

He said most of the masses like mine are benign but the only way to know for sure is to biopsy. The CT scan came back normal. So I guess it's promising news although my doctor called sounding concerned about the solid mass and we need to follow up with the breast specialist and do the biopsy. I'm going to try and keep the radiologists upbeat opinion in my head rather than the grave tone of my gp.",

I really have no idea what will happen at this appointment. I'm assuming it will just be a consult and we will go from there and schedule a biopsy. I don't know about a mammogram. My gp said we'd wait on that and see where the ultrasound and ct will take us. I don't know what the specialist will want. I will update after my ",

I had my follow up today and the Dr said that the results were undefinitive and although the tests were benign he still can't say what it is so now I have to have surgery next month so he can tell me without a doubt that it is not cancerous. I'm confident that it's not but I still have to be stressed about surgery. I just want to put this all behind me already and every appt. just seems to lead to another appt. :(",
