(Basically, to grab some of the nodule he would have blown a dime-size hole in my skin. It was close.) So now I have an appt with the surgeon tomorrow to plan a surgical biopsy.",

My nipple is especially sore- like how I remember from nursing. (my results came back benign-yay! ) With a strong family history, I worry that this won't be the last biopsy and I kind of want to get a handle on the healing. I am using an essential oil that my sister gave me. She said it could be referred pain but I wonder if it is just from wearing a sports bra all the time. Has anyone else experienced this?",
