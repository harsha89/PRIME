RonnieKay, I'm hoping your pity party pushes you back into a better place. scans again came out indeterminate. liver lit-up in exactly the same place on repeated PET and MRI showed 'something' in the corresponding area - but not conclusive for mets. MO sent scans on to liver doc and they agreed it best to closely follow until more can be ascertained. while I know I should be thrilled the area didn't seem to grow after 3 months, I'm still kinda bummed it wasn't just a false-positive. it's hard to think this is anything other than early signs of progression - but, I guess that's my glass half empty perspective. my family's been saying no definite bad news is good news; while I know I agree, I'm not really in the mood to put up balloons and celebrate. and I'm frustrated with myself for that. so, scans again in September. in the meantime, dh & I are doing our best to live as we want and not sweat it until there's something to do about it. that's something I learned was possible from so many of you ladies.

TLDR: dx stage IV from the start 18 months ago - had a phenomenal response to treatment - NED on H/P for 12 months. Just dx'd with brain mets. About me: I was diagnosed stage IV from the start 1/2014 -- her2+, a few small mets to liver. Taxotere, herceptin & perjeta did it's trick and got me to no evidence of disease - some called it PCR, complete radiographic response, and more - PET, MRI (liver & brain) showed up absolutely clean, and it was fabulous. I've been on just h/p since August 2014. Last month, \"new\" vision issues appeared. I'd had bouts of blurry vision for awhile but after clean brain MRIs, they attributed it to drug SEs. Recently, very sporadically, wherever I was trying to focus my sight would become completely blurry. For example, when looking at the face of my watch - I could see everything but the details on the face. This would last 5-15 minutes and then pass. Very bizarre, no rhyme or reason. MO said she'd never heard of anything like that but wanted brain MRI to be sure nothing was missed. We were all confident it would be negative & I had an appointment set to see the ophthalmologist. No such luck - MRI last Wednesday found 2 small brain metastases. It's unbelievably disappointing and frustrating, but seems the best thing we can do is listen to, and be aware of, ourselves. \"Funny\" part: while it is possible, neuro-docs really don't 'feel' the mets are causing the bizarre vision issue. We'll see. I had gamma knife this morning, will repeat PET to check for additional progression, and see MO to find out about next steps. We are not considering this a failure of herceptin/perjeta - just lousy luck - so I'm not anticipating any change in drug therapy. Still kinda foot-dragging on researching this new world of crap but am curious about any possible 'preventative' measures. Meanwhile, I'm still following an 'anti-cancer' lifestyle and incorporate integrative/complementary therapies - strict diet, mindbody and stress reduction daily practices, positivity exercises, lots of physical exercise, tons of supplements (I also see an integrative MO), acupuncture, etc. etc. - basically, the kitchen sink. Just shows how much of a crapshoot this is. Ug. Got the brain mets news on our 3rd wedding anniversary - managed to still enjoy a fabulous celebration; so proud of dh & myself for putting the right things first. Haven't had a chance for the pity party yet - trying to keep up appearances for dh & rest of the family. I'm so incredibly heartbroken and don't see how sharing that with them would help anything.",

I remain on maintenance herceptin & perjeta. had PET April 2015 that came out indeterminate. they'd expected surgical & radiation sites to show up \"wonky,\" but a part of liver very unexpectedly lit-up, too. report said it could be interference from intestine activity or possibly suspicious for metastasis. basically 50/50 odds. due to expanders I couldn't get MRI to rule out progression as would usually be the case - tried US w/o success & tumor markers aren't disease indicators for me. so, they moved up implant/expander swap date and I'll get the abdomen MRI a couple of days later - should be around the third week of June. really would have preferred it happen earlier but scheduling didn't work out. it's not been the most fun waiting period but decided I was on-board with this plan and have been trying to have fun and stay healthy. been doing pretty well at it, too. :) irritating point future folks may benefit from: before surgery I asked plastics about MRI-compatible expanders (they do exist) - I didn't get them (although fwiw, they had planned to go direct to implant, so perhaps not as prepared as they should have been). I realize a tiny tiny population gets these kinds of procedures at stage IV, but am disappointed it was not fully considered. liver surgeon had advised liver MRIs every 3 months to keep a close watch on liver (so much for collaboration). can't bitch too much though - all procedures did go smoothly and things may yet prove to be fine. note to others: try to insist on MRI-compatible expanders - you know, just-in-case. I caught-up on 25+ pages of posts in this thread (and promptly forgot most of it - chemobrain -sorry) and while I realize there was mixed news, I am so happy to read so many positive posts and so so many with such inspiring good reports! it's truly incredible how much support can be found here - congrats to you all for creating such a warm, positive environment. I consider myself still new to this and am grateful to you for sharing your experiences. I'm sorry if it had to be so, but it helps to know that many who are now doing well have had some ups and downs along the way. hoping to report back in a couple of weeks with all good news. tgif and best wishes for a lovely weekend!",

Liver surgeon coordinated with interventional radiology & mo & recommended a fiducial be placed to mark the last remaining liver met & 3-month MRIs to monitor -Mayo Clinic. Heard good things about liver docs at UCSF & other facilities, too. It wasn't as difficult as I thought it'd be & felt good to get a liver specialist's perspective.  Freebird - sounds like you are really having a rough time. Last thing I usually want is another doc appointment, but have you tried a palliative care/symptom management doc? They can have some creative, cool tricks up their sleeves and are great resources, especially when the other docs are outta ideas..... Your trip to the ocean sounds incredible - I love how it came about & who you're going with. Thanks for sharing - it's wonderful to hear about.

I was dx'd at 34, responded well to treatment, hit NED & and had bi-mx w/ expanders, & rads. I've recently had the expanders swapped out for implants and am pleased I went the way I did. in my case, flap surgery was taken off of the table by the plastic surgeon. at the time I was not happy about that, but in retrospect, I'm glad he refused. the idea was that going direct-to-implant or expanders-to-implants is a much shorter operation, less invasive, lower risks of complications, and a shorter recovery. with stage iv & all the trauma(read: treatment) body had been through since dx, they felt implants would get me to where I wanted to be faster and more easily (I'm told by no longer placing implants under the pec muscle, procedure/recovery are a lot easier). I know flap would look and feel so much better, but it was good I had only a minor procedure & quick recovery to anticipate; I would have struggled to go through with a flap surgery at this point, too. I really wanted recon and to be out & about enjoying things, not dealing with post-op issues - a cake & eat it too, kinda thing. I can't express how happy I am to not be worrying about inserts, symmetry, etc., etc., etc. - I found all of that pretty stressful and it made me feel somewhat uncomfortable with my body. I guess implants were a compromise, but I'm happy I went that way. PS did fat-grafting at the time of the swap to help with look & feel. it wasn't an option - just part of his process & it really wasn't that bad. I totally get why this can be such a tough choice. there is no wrong option - and the right one is likely what sounds/feels best to you. also, not sure if this is helpful, but... technology is constantly changing and you may have more/different options in the future regardless of what you choose today. best of luck to you & congrats on being stable!!!! :D  side-note for stage iv folks reading this pre-mx: if planning to use expanders check w/ your team to make sure they're MRI-compatible!! better safe than sorry. it's still fairly rare to have an mx post stage iv dx so they're often not aware of the MRI issue.

I understand both viewpoints, and am keeping an open mind, but am thrilled to get the surgery consults to get a better idea of what's possible and what timelines could look like. I'll get those surgical consults around the second week of July with next restaging the third week of July.  one concern both MOs have shared regards going to surgery too quickly after stopping Taxotere. both have stressed the importance of allowing enough time to confirm the herceptin and perjeta are holding things steady before moving forward. should there be progression, they caution they would not be able to start systemic treatment with chemo until I'd sufficiently recovered from surgery. so, of course, every hope that stable is around the corner and can be maintained without Tax, but I'm happy to have the good council to not be too hasty with surgery.

I got surgical consults and am a candidate for an mx and liver ablation. the consensus is the following: three months stable and I'll get the official green light for surgery.  I know each case is unique and that my particulars are rare, but fwiw, here's what I was told at Mayo Clinic: the liver surgeon had my teeny remaining liver spot marked with a fiducial and recommended ablation. I asked if I had seen him earlier, when I had the three lesions, would he have marked them all? his response: most likely, yes. at initial liver biopsy (2/2014) I requested markers and was told it is not done. at each onc appointment since February I've asked for a referral to a liver specialist and was told it wasn't time. I should not have listened and should have sought out the consult to at least explore options. while I know my case is unique, I hope someone can benefit from my experience. the reason for ablation and not resection? to his eye, it's possible there was something on the right lobe at time of dx (three lesions were all on the left). while he's not certain of it, for him that's enough to make the chance of benefit from ablation and resection the same. therefore, his opinion is to reserve the option of resection for the future and pursue the less invasive ablation at this time. while I'm not crying over spilled milk, it was tough to hear. however, learning that I'm still a candidate for local interventions definitely made my day. now, just focusing on staying stable.  ",

Congrats & best wishes for good reports from everyone! :D ************************************************* For the ladies switching to herceptin & perjeta: here's a thread I found helpful Perjeta/Herceptin/Taxotere - I know you're not on taxotere, but there's some decent discussion from people who are now on just herceptin & perjeta as well. I know everything is different for everyone, but I appreciate being informed. As for the runny nose: the good news is that there are days when it doesn't drip like a faucet. The bad news, I start the day with little folded tissue squares in every pocket, sleeve, and under my bra strap (just can't do the in-the-bra thing yet). Thank goodness for costco - I'm buying TWO cases of kleenex at a time! Maybe it's time to consider handkerchiefs.... It's a great regimen - it has its SEs, but they're really pretty manageable. I hope it's a phenomenal cocktail for you!!!",

I used a 1.5 liter bottle & made myself refill it a minimum of 2x/day. could really tell the difference between the days I was well hydrated and the days I slacked. especially helpful w/ gastro issues/edema. -- kept my nails dry & short (latex gloves whenever I was in the kitchen/cleaning; thoroughly dried my fingers/toes after washing). -- super-mild soap and lotion for absurdly sensitive skin. -- neosporin and/or aquafor for inner nose sores. a humidifier helped more than I thought it would. -- 'magic mouthwash' for mouth sores (mine was a mylanta/benadryl/lidocaine rinse. this site has a bunch of recipes for rx's ) been told if the rx is just for the liquid lidocaine part & you mix the rest at home insurance will cover it. -- heard this helps w/ metallic/icky taste: mberry tablets (my onc was fine with them) temporarily make savory/sour/spicy things taste sweet. helpful for obscuring the nasty/metallic taste. the 'kids' call it flavor-tripping. :) -- neuropathy: I managed it well with quite a large dose of gabapentin, supplements, acupuncture, gel inserts in super cushy sneakers. infusion center had frozen mittens & slipper-type things. dunno how much good they did, but I used them when they were available. others brought their own frozen gel packs from home. that's all I can think of for now. I know there are many more suggestions in the thread linked above. some folks say it's super harsh, others didn't have such a hard time with it. I hope tax is mind-blowingly effective for you & your liver and surprisingly easy-to-handle!",

MRI: prior hepatic mets are barely identifiable, with no features suggesting residual viable tumor. I'm stunned (and, of course, thrilled). man, when these her2 therapies work, they do seem to really work - here's hoping it's for a good long while. wishing for even better results from everyone here! liver specifics: no local liver intervention at this time as only one of the original 4 lesions were marked with a clip and that one has essentially resolved. had all been marked, surgeon said there'd be an argument for ablation. for now, he recommended monitoring every 3 months (and hoped he'd never see me again!). sounds alright to me - a girl can always hope, right? :)",
