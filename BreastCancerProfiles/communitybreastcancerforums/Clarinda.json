I began experiencing pain and stiffness throughout my entire body some time after I had a root canal.  At the onset of the pain, I also had a swelling in the gum of the tooth where the root canal had been performed.  I made an appointment with my endodontist and asked him if the root canal was responsible, but he said that it wasn't possible.   I underwent detoxification for a year which helped enormously.  However, I still wake up with pain/discomfort in my right arm (my root canal is on the upper right side of my mouth) and generalized stiffness.  I'm also not as strong as I used to be.  I thought that I had fibromyalgia, but what if all my pain (and suffering) was the result of a root canal? It would be interesting to know if anyone else who's experiencing pain/stiffness/weakness has also had a root canal. ",
