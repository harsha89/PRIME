She put on a different needle and was still having difficulty because the lump was too hard. She said that for this to happen it was rare. She was trying to get samples from the center of the lump but the needle kept on bouncing off the center. She ended up getting 3 samples but they were from the outer edges when the needle would slip off the center area. She originally figured the lump was just breast tissue or fat necrosis prior to the biopsy because I had breast reduction surgery in that area one and a half years ago. I am just wondering if anyone else has had a core needle biopsy where they had problems getting a sample because the lump was so hard? Thanks in advance :-) Log in to post a reply",

I finally saw my gynecologist 3 weeks ago and she figured it was probably scar tissue from the breast reduction surgery I had 13 months prior. She sent me for an ultrasound which I had on Friday. On Monday she called me a told me that it is a solid mass ( I have previously had an ultrasound for a lump but it had been a cyst that time). She said it was most likely a fibroadenoma but it will have to be biopsied to know what it is. The surgeons office just called and they have set a consultation which is in 27 days. I have done some research on fibroadenoma and it just doesn't seem like that to me for the following reasons : I will be 41 in a month and these generally occur in women younger than 30. Fibroadenomas are generally found in the upper part of the breast where mine is underneath. They say fibroadenomas move where this seems to be attached to my chest wall. Also if I press on it which I do quite a bit because I am constantly checking it out it can be tender whereas fibroadenoma are painless. Of course I am worried that it may be cancer and I have also just found a pea size lump under the breast lump location on my rib cage. Has anyone had a situation like this or any idea what it is? I know I can't know for sure until the biopsy is done but any info would be much appreciated. Log in to post a reply",
