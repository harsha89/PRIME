I did taxotere & cytoxan, and at the end of the day, it wasn't so bad. I lost my hair, yes, and I was fatigued, definitely. But I tried to stay active, taking walks, doing light yoga, staying very hydrated and eating well, and all that helped. That was 2008. Had I not done chemo, I know I'd be looking back now thinking...should I have...? At least now I don't have that worry. I mean anyone who has had cancer has enough to worry about for the rest of his or her life, really--but at least I'm not worrying \"should I have done chemo....\"",

I also took your advice & got a scrip for Ativan. I spoke to one of the faculty members here (I'm a grad student & teacher at University of Florida) who nursed her best friend through cancer five years ago, and her friend is fine. She was able to talk me down a bit. Also, speaking to my surgeon did alleviate some anxiety. So am hanging in; I'm really hoping that night was the worst of it. I'm getting a mastectomy. Sometimes I'm ok with it. Sometimes i can't believe it still. My breasts are just about the only area of my body I haven't had an issue with. But anyway. Life goes on. Thank you all so, so much. ---SharonÂ ",
