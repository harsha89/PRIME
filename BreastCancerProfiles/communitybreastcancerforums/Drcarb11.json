When the surgeon came out to speak to my girlfriend he told her that it did not look very suspicious but he took additional tissue ou from different areas beside the lump i had. Why would he do this? I did not speak with him after the surgery but I have a follow up on tuesday, hopefully with the results, the waiting is crazy. My mother was diagnosed when she was 46 and died on BC with age 55.I am a wreck. Log in to post a reply",

It is possible, be glad your doctor is doing a biopsy, I went through 3 different doctors who all told me to wait 1 year, which I felt not comfertable with.I finally found a great breast surgeon and I am hoping for good news.",
