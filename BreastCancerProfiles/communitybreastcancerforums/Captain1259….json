I really need to go back into my archives and hit the abbreviations list and get my first diagnosis in so I can share more easily. This is all in the same/original breast but because I have not been told it's there yet (what a joke) I won't know if it's the same or different cancer. I guess time will tell. Laid in bed last night debating whether or not to leave another message with the DR's office. That is making me more angry than the cancer being back. Would like to share more as the info becomes available. Hope you're up for the discussion :). Thanks again, Capt",

She started the conversation with, \"we have the results of your MRI.\" I'm thinking to myself ~ NO CRAP, you've had them for 5 days now, jackass!! But I didn't say that ~ I was quiet and listened to what she had to say which was very uninformative. In fact, she sounded extremely uneducated to what she was reading. That's a very, very scary thought. Nevertheless, here is what is suggested: I am to have a follow-up ultrasound on Monday, 2/29 (mind you I had a mammo and ultrasound on 2/5, a MRI on 2/19). The breast center, where this will be done, schedules time enough for an ultrasound and biopsy if needed. So . . . do we think they are planning a biopsy?? I just want a doctor to talk to me not and uneducated nurse or a secretary, which is all I have been able to speak with. I am not scared, I am not crying, I am not nervous, I just want straight answers to my questions. I thank the Lord that I did not have this the first time through or I would have lost my mind. Twelve years ago, my doctors were wonderful. Called me on the phone, let me ask questions and answered them, helped me decide on a course of treatment that worked for me. Needless to say, I have started to unpack all of the \"stuff\" that I have packed away because this wasn't going to happen again (tongue in cheek). Getting together all of my old test results, pathology reports, scans, etc. so I can continue educating myself on current breakthroughs and treatments and help my medical personnel prescribe a plan of treatment that works best for me. Only time will tell <3 I look forward to hearing from y'all.",

I know I'm probably jumping the gun; however, what if you . . . were 12 years out of treatment and a suspicious area shows up in the same breast that you had your lumpectomy, chemo, and radiation??? I'm currently waiting for the damn doctor to call with the news that I already know because I've been waiting 3 days and my sister finally asked another doctor to look at the results. So my doctor doesn't know I know and I'm trying to make a plan without him. Grrrrr! Would you opt for a double mastectomy so this doesn't happen again? Go for the recommended second sonogram (really what is it going to show that is different??) and know no more than you do now?? These questions and so many more but the one that first and foremost is WHY WON'T YOU CALL AND TALK TO ME??? I called this morning and was as sweet as I have ever been, left the message on somebody's voicemail after speaking to a receptionist that did not want to take the message and now I wait ~ and wait ~ and wait. Why? and What would you do???

I will remain active. Well ~ another day passes and no phone call. I will try tomorrow and if I don't hear anything, I will contact another doctor and have them take over. I thought this OB/GYN would be more compassionate since he lost his wife to cancer ~ boy was I wrong. Thx so much for the support ~ I'll keep y'all in the loop. :)",
