Seattle, that's one of the main reasons I post here because I know there are others who feel like I do and it makes me feel like I'm not alone. I love your quotes and you write all you want. I'm sorry you still don't have a diagnosis. Please keep me posted what/when you find out. I had my biopsy done last Wed. (yes my lump, under arm and shoulder all hurt btw). Much bigger incision than I thought I would have (3-4 inches). When surgeon did the excisional biopsy he came out and told family he removed lump bigger than a quarter but to his eye looked B9, as I was waking up I remember him saying my margins looked clear and everything looked good to him. Next day I got the call that path was back and it came back B9. I go back Monday for post op and to find out details. I don't know if all atypical cells are now gone along with lump or if I will have to be tested more frequently. This was my second surgical biopsy and this one a lot more nerve wracking since i'm older and now have my son. Kids change your whole perspective. I pray for everyone on this site every day. For healing, peace and comfort. I'm thankful that I was B9 but my heart aches for those who didn't get good results so I am staying on the boards for encouragement and to offer what info I can to those doing the waiting game. I am thankful for each and every one who has been here for me. (((hugs))) to all.",

I'm not sure about the symptoms you have described and I really can't shed any more light than we have already discussed, that being said, I do know by what the gyno told mom when she went thru her ordeal, IBC is usually something on sight they know what it is and if they've seen it before they have an idea (even before any testing) that it \"probably\" is or isn't. My mom just ended up (thankfully) being a different case even though he was very concerned at how it was presenting itself on her breast. He said he had seen it before and to him it looked like IBC (he pulls no punches) but it ended up being fine. My breast pain was through the roof (also under arm and shoulder) until I started the evening primrose and vitamin E the breast surgeon suggested. After about  3 weeks pain was tolerable and I could at least get comfortable. Until you can get in it's not got hurt anything (unless you need to clear that's ok to take with other meds you may be taking) to take it. Please please as soon as u know something let me know. I had my post op yesterday and found out more info on mine. It came back as a necrosis indicative to trauma of the breast, because of previous biopsy the breast tissue had \"died\" and often it will even mimic bc on testing, because of the dead tissue I had the atypical cells. Now that the area is removed I'm all clear and only have to have my yearly mammo's. Still having some pain from the surgery but each day is better unless I over \"do\" it. Incision site is oozing a little bit so have to go back one more time to make sure it doesn't abcess or anything. It's like I can finally breath again and I pray that you get some answers soon so that constant worry and dread hanging over your head can be lifted or at least you know what you're dealing with.",

I've had 100 lb weight variation and when I was smaller breasted it seemed the mammo was more tolerable. I go fri. For mine and am dreading it because the breast pain is so severe but I'll do anything to put my mind at ease and take care of whatever it is so I can be here for my son. Since you don't like docs maybe see if u can get some nerve pills before.",

He was almost positive my moms was IBC but after testing found she has extra veins and blood flow in breast because she's large breasted and sometimes can cause the appearance. I forget the name of the condition .",
