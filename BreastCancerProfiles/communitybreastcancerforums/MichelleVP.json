I was down for two days! It was worse than the chemo. I have had two more shots since then with barely a reaction. Now the chemo is worse than the Neulasta. Fifteen years ago when I had another type of cancer, and I took Neuprogen shots and had the exact same thing happen. Hopefully, your body will not react as severely to future shots. They do work and are worth it.",
