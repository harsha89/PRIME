I came here because I am currently awaiting a sonogram on what was a small grape-like lump in my right breast directly under my arm. Fortunately, the lump has been progressively shrinking. With every passing day the lump grows smaller. When I first noticed it a week ago it was the size of small grape and now it is the size of a very tiny pepper. Based on my online research, these are qualities well associated with a cyst rather than a malignant tumor. Nevertheless, I am overwrought with worry because I still don't have a definite answer that will allow me to move forward. The wait for testing is agonizing. I can only imagine what other women have gone through, and I look forward to hearing from others. Before I felt this lump, I was planning for my Wedding and my Graduate School graduation, and now I am not sure what to plan for. When I last posted I was introduce to a very kind member named Marie who did help settle my nerves when she reassured me it was unlikely given that I am relatively young (28), I have never lactated, and the statics are on my side. I am very thankful for her comforting words. However, the other member who commented on my last post was quick to remind me women my age and in my situation are commonly diagnosed with breast cancer. The other member's words are the ones I can't seem to forget as I lay awake at night waiting for a sonogram that might be as inconclusive as my last doctor's visits. I can't stand anymore waiting, and I don't know what to do at this time and just think positively isn't working. I apologize for being so anxious. I thought I'd go ahead and update my situation, and continue to try to communicate and learn from others who have shared this experience, for this is possibly the only place I might be able to find peace.

I decided to join during this period when I am anxiously awaiting a sonogram on a pea-sized lump in my right breast under my arm. I discovered the small lump, which has a round shape and soft texture, during a yoga session and promptly went to a doctor who confirmed my discovery. While I prepare myself for what the test reveal, I have noticed the lump has slightly diminished in size in the course of a weak, and it is often hard to locate. I am truly trying to keep a cool head and remain optimistic, but I am simply terrified and occasionally find myself trembling with dread. I am especially anxious because I am an unemployed 28 year old full-time graduate student, and I am working hard to finish my thesis, so I can attain a stable financial situation. Fortunately, I have learned I can acquire health insurance if I require treatment, but I am unsure about the quality of treatment I will receive. I am also very curious about my chances of survival. I would like to believe I have a good chance since I am somewhat young, athletic, and I maintain a strict diet rich in whole grains, vegetables and fruit. I apologize for my grim outlook, but it seems just as life was turning around for the better I discovered this lump. I look forward to hearing from others who have more experience with this, and who might help me adjust my outlook.  Log in to post a reply",

I certainly didn't know lactating and hormonal replacement therapy presented such serious risk factors. It is a shame to learn that so many women who work hard to lead healthy lives still suffer from BC. How utterly discouraging. My family and friends often tease me about my healthy eating habits and heavy exercise regimen. It is truly shocking to learn that might not be enough. I think I might try using more natural cosmetic products. It was the only thing I saw I could incoporate to reduce the risk. Do you recommend any other precautions I could take? Thank you again for taking the time to use your experience to help me like this, and bringing me peace of mind so I can enjoy the holidays with my family. Warmest Regards, Breadlebane ",
