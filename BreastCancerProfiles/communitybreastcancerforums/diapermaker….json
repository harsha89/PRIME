Sorry I haven't responded sooner but it's been a real busy weekend with out of town family visiting.  I do go to a therspist for my arm occasionally but this problem just has been gradually getting worse. I don't know of any way to drain the breast unless it's the same as what I was instructed to do for my arm.. I currently wear a sleeve when I need it and also have a Jovi Pak for night use, but none of these seem to help my breast swelling and soreness.  I decided to try the compression garment I received after my surgery and it does seem to help with the soreness but not the swelling.  I'm calling the therapist today to get her input.  Thanks for the links on this subject, they were very helpful.",
