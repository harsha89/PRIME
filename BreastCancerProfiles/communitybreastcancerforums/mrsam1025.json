    "Content": "mrsam1025 wrote: My mother in law (in her 80s) was diagnosed with breast cancer approx. four years ago around six months before her daughter (my wife) was also diagnosed with breast cancer (she's in her 50s). Both had similar cancers and both were brca negative. The doctor said my mother in law's cancer was aggressive but they caught it early and gave her a good prognosis after surgery. Fast forward to this week and her latest visit to the doctor. He seems a little confused about the most recent biopsy results. The report's final diagnosis is Atrophic and fatty breast tissue with focal in situ lobular carcinoma (LCIS) and atypical lobular hyperplasia. Initially the doctor didn't seem concerned and said they would do a follow up in a few months. This was what he said during a call on Monday. He actually called us back today and said he thought about it and now he's more concerned. He wants her to go see the surgeon again. I did a lot of research a few years back because both had it at the same time. I learned more than I thought I would ever know about this terrible disease. However I never read anything about LCIS. During my research tonight I have not been able to find anything about a person being diagnosed with LCIS AFTER already being diagnosed with breast cancer. Is this an uncommon situation? Any suggestions on how I can learn more about this apparent rare occurrence? Thanks Log in to post a reply",
