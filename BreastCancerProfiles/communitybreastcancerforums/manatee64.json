The problem is that I have excellent veins in the LE arm and have tiny veins in the available arm.  I only allow them to use my non-LE arm, as instructed by LE therapists.  The expereinces are SO BAD though (12 sticks, 8 sticks, neck sticks...) that I want to allow them to use my LE arm.  Yes, I always tell them the problem beforehand and ask for their best person and ask for ER nurses, etc.  It doesn't matter usually.  I'm simply a very hard stick in that arm. I understand the potential risk  in doing this.  However, I've just gotten out of the hosptial one more time, after 5 trips in past 3 yrs, and can no longer bear the stress and pain of these experiences. What I want to know... Have you had personal experience with allowing use of your LE arm for IVs and sticks?  If so, I'd like to hear the good and bad, esp. if in recent years. Thank you so very much. Dx 10/8/2010, ILC, 2cm, Stage IA, 0/2 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Dec 22, 2012 09:40AM - edited Dec 22, 2012 09:41AM by manatee64 Thank you for the feedback, everyone.  I appreciate the understanding and compassion of those who have been there. And Binney your perspective is most helpful! Until you have had a foot or neck draw it's hard to understand what it's like.  Or having 7 different people poking on the same non-LE arm and hand over and over.   Or finally getting an IV in and then having it fall out several hours later and having to start all over again.  That's the time I had 12 sticks on one arm. It's hard to be hydrated for surgeries because one has to stop liquids hours earlier.  All I can do then is ask for an early app't so I'm not as dehyrated as I would be later in the morning. I've had 4 hospital visits this yr., along with various blood tests out-patient and it's overwhelmed me. Thank you, Donna (went to Manatee High School in Florida:-)",
