Not like very painful, but I can definately tell something happened at the area. Plus I did have 2 doctors looking at the area now & pushing things around.  Just making sure this is normal, I thought it would be back to normal by now.

But this afternoon I relucently join you as I've been diagnosed with IDC. I don't have much information yet as I meet with the doctor on friday.    I shared the news with 2 of my children this afternoon & they were in tears for quite awhile. How do I deal with their fears as well as my own? I am terrified of this & how it will effect things. I know I don't know the stage yet , but can someone give me some statistics on surviving this? I have 4 children with the youngest being adopted. I feel so horrible, like I am putting them through this horrible fear. I have been praying & praying, I pleaded with God not to give me this, that I didn't think I could handle it. But I guess he has other plans.  I guess he thinks I'm actually strong enough to walk through this, I'm glad he thinks so. I will probably be looking for lots of help here, thank you for any words you can give me, I appreciate them.   God is Good all the time, All the time God is good!!

Am  I just sick or is this something to worry about? I'm only stage 1 & am having surgery in 2 weeks. Just think this is odd to feel sick in the middle of summer - would you call doctor or just wait a little? God is Good all the time, All the time God is good!!
