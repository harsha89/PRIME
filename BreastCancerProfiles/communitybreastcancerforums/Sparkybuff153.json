I survived breast cancer twice before, and had a mastectomy. A few weeks ago I found a large lump under my armpit, and now it has metastasis to my spine. Is there anyone out there that is a long time survivor. Or anyone that can help me or give me some guidance. Reading materials, support, etc. Log in to post a reply",
