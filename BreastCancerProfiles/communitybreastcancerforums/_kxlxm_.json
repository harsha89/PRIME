Not sure about lymph nodes yet. Best guess on size is <2cm. So here is my question: lumpectomy vs mastectomy. I originally thought lumpectomy. But I have small breasts and after surgery and then radiation, I'm not sure how successful reconstruction surgery will be. I don't like the idea of a mastectomy and honestly don't know anyone who has experienced one. I do not have anyone at home that could be of any real assistance so any information on recovery or what to prepare for would be great. Any experiences or thoughts you ladies could share would wonderful. The surgery will be scheduled for the next couple of weeks. Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Jul 26, 2018 11:11AM - edited Jul 26, 2018 11:45AM by _kxlxm_ I haven't had the MRI done yet. Thank you for telling me your story. I'm trying to find out more information on lumpectomy and radiation with the possibility of reconstructive surgery. There is so much more information on having a mastectomy which I'm not crazy about. I have small breasts (34A-32B) and feel that having a mastectomy and a rebuilt chest area would feel very alien to me. I could be wrong of course! All the research is starting to freak me out. Strangely enough I am not concerned with a recurrence. Maybe it's because I am new to this journey I just feel like \"Okay, let's get this out, do the 4 weeks radiation, it's going to suck but the goal is back to normal.\" Oh, and my nasty little cells are VERY estrogen hungry at 90% so my other concern is finding an IA I can tolerate since it looks like I could be on it for awhile. Travelling isn't really a good option for me (although I'm not too far from New Orleans and have looked into that facility and would love to talk to you more about it, I would like to message you if that's okay). The other concern is having a major surgery isn't really a great option for me. I don't live near family and do not have a significant other. But I guess if it has to be figured out, so be it. It has felt overwhelming to think about how in the world am I going to keep my life functioning and do this alone. I would like to add that I do like my surgeon and feel very comfortable with him. He realizes a lumpectomy is my preferred option and they are going to set up a consultation with a plastic surgeon who does reconstruction to learn more. I also live in a city with a university medical center and want to consult with them as well regarding reconstruction and the options. Ha! I've reread what I wrote and I do sound a little scatter brained, don't I? I just want to move forward and look and feel normal again.",
