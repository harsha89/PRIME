Make one right away and ask them if the results are in. Sometimes they wait until the day of your app. to tell you the results. This is the best i can tell you. I will be up another half an hour if you have any questions post it again . Somebody else might jump in the conversations. On this site you are never alone. One more reminder until you reach 50 posts you can only posts 5 times in 24 hour period. Hopefully you don't have too. But if you do you can PM (Private Message) to people. There is no limit on that.

Since I wasn't comfortable with my first choice I asked for Double Mastectomy which the BS wanted me to wait at least 7 days to see if I was sure. And on October 14th I had my BMX.

The itch you have I can relate to it because I had the same issue, it was so itchy and i scratched it until it was all red and bloody. The surgical tape that goes on the dressing I was allergic to that too. Just watch those sticky clear tapes. One more info you were counting your posts in another thread. Once you reach 50 posts there are no limits after that. You can post as many time as you want. Good Luck. (((HUGS))) Sheila♥♥",

You know your mothers personality...if she wants to talk during your vacation listen to her.... and one more thing I can tell you from my own experience try hard not to say  \"\"Oh I know everything is gonna be OK\" Acknowledge she has BC.... i hope I was able to help you just a little bit.

I couldn't resist and said you are calling me during my show for that and the answer was it is an emergency. I told her to get up and change the channels manually. I know this is nothing but when I say everybody wants something from me this is one of the examples. It goes on and on and on I'm not very calm right now. This irritates me even more because I was just feeling good and calm. It's before midnight so i thought I could still whine. Sorry. You don't have to reply to this post. ♥",

We want action not the amount of caffeine I consumed when I had a cup of coffee. I can't live like that. Sun was the biggest enemy for cancer now they want you to expose yourself to sun to get more Vitamin D. Well I want all the researchers to make up their minds. Yes sun or no sun The only thing was exciting for my situation was HERCEPTIN when they approved for early stage BC. That was the same month or month later I was DX yes I was one of the first patients getting it. OK ranting is over for now. If BC will strike it will no matter what your life style was.

So one night about 3 days after my lumpectomy my daughters friend came over for dinner. DD loves to cook. Everything was cooked and Im still on the couch waiting for my food. Finally I said I'm hungry. Well I have been told since I asked not to be treated differently I should get up and serve myself then they both started to laugh and they were right. I felt if I wanted to share I will.....Even now if I loose few pounds by choice one neighbor gets all nervous that the cancer is back. I really think outsiders are more afraid than we are.

It's diagnostic and get the answer before I leave. He has a new nurse and I was pocked 5 times without any results then the DR did it. 3 from arms and 4 from the hand.

I want to answer all your questions if I can but I'm away for vacation until next Friday and I dont get on the computer daily. I'm very uncomfortable with my DD's lap-tap. I had 4 DD A/C every 2 weeks 4 DD Taxol every 2 weeks Herceptin every week for a year which started with the first Taxol. No Side Effects and hair started to grow and the heart tolerated very good like most people. I used to walk to the hospital for my Herceptin treatments. They  will do a muga test (google it) to check the heart before and during. Good Luck Radiation and took Femara for 5 years which was ended in March 2011.",

I had a lumpectomy twice ( no clear margin the first time ) chemo, Herceptin for 52 weeks, radiation. port was put in and taken out 18 months later. I see my Oncologist every 4 months and still my anxiety level goes high. Tomorrow is the 4 month check up. I can say this the first time didn't drive myself crazy because I really feel I belong somewhere and I can express my fears with you BC sisters who can understand and do not tell me <Everything is behind you now> I hate that expression but I guess people mean well.

I didnt purchase my ticket yet waiting March 1st to get clean bill of health from my oncologist, When I do the first thing Im doing its to book the flight. There are very good deals going on non stop round trip $585.00 from Continental and United. Because I had a bad experience 5 years ago, we were going away to celebrate my DD college graduations, were looking for All Inclusive prices before I know it was DX with BC. Thats why I cant buy the ticket now. I really want to meet you. Oahu is a smaller Island. Where are you staying, I might even change my dates just to meet you and your family. Sheila",

Gyn checks my breasts. i don't think I need to be checked that often since I don't do self exam i guess it's better that someone is always checking  them.

Ill send you some warm weather starting Sunday. barb.....The children boy or girl they act so differently . My older DD reacted so differently than my younger one. Maybe i tried not to make a big deal maybe she thought I was dying. We talked occasionally at the beginning. I heard from her friends that she was a mess and crying all the time. She came to with me once to the BS, what a mistake that was. Poor thing was so nervous and scared I thought she was gonna pass out. We made a deal I said to her if you can pick me up after chemo I will feel very happy to see a familiar face, my own daughter. Thats what we did. My younger one who was graduating from college month after I was DX acted differently. I could talk to her. Maybe she was becoming a Social Worker and had more experience how to deal with it. And I had a long talk that she will continue on her good work been on the Dean List and graduate with honors and I wouldn't have it any other way. Until today I can talk to her openly about my tests and she listens and understands that once every 4 months I need little support. Sorry about the long post. but i just wanted to share my own experience with you. Good Night to All MY Sisters, Happy 4th of July weekend.♥",

I hated and still do when well meaning friends or family members say to me: \" Everything is behind you don't even think about it \" I heard that from the day I was finished treatment. Sometimes I think maybe I shouldn't say the words I said right after my DX \" I want everyone to treat me as normal as possible\" But I hear you once in a while you need to hear people care. And people do care but they are afraid of their own mortality like if they dont talk about it will never happen to them. Thats why most of us come here and get comfort from each other. Please post as many times as you need to. We are here and care for you. ((((♥Hugs)))) Sheila",

All I was thinking if he went home and Tim stayed.With the exception of Katie (I liked her) i think the show is going to the right direction. I don't like big Mike anymore because he is becoming little annoying. I like Aaron but he is going the next 2 episodes. I want Crystal to be the next Idol, or Casey. i have a feeling shabon (sp) and Crystal will be the top 2. Okay I feel better now. I see my BS once a year. I actually like going to him he is one the generous surgeons. He took care of this woman who didn't have insurance and no other DR wanted to do anything. Oncologist every 4 months. Probably next visit he will tell me to come once a year. Gyn once a year",

Im sure there are shorter ways......I hope I was a good teacher. I dont know how to open 2 windows at the same time I just go back and forth. I will be looking later how you did.

There are lot of women on these boards they didn't. This is the best I can answer your questions. I would call the DR and ask all those questions yourself. Not on the phone just make an appointment.

So i go to the location bunch of other people we all are waiting for our knives. The person comes and says i have to do a short demonstration after that its yours. Back to last month where many of us were complaining about memory problems and not remembering words right....so anyway the guy is holding this yellow weird looking gadget and asked the first person could identify this get this price. I raised my hand but you think i can remember the word finally i said to him \"You put it in an orange and he says to me and,,,,,, I answered you twist it and it pours out from the opening. You are the winner he says. So embarrassing like a 2 year old they know what it is but not the real name. So this was my day and i was thinking of you ladies with memory problems. I got my paring knife",

When you stopped Arimidex did you have any withdrawal symptoms/ I asked my Oncologist he said no. But i rather hear from someone who actually stopped it. Figure change is something to look forward especially my middle part. You know what you have been DX 13 days before me. What a coincidence. HUGS♥",

For us its a completely different story. i don't really like to hear comments like <Everything is behind you. < Why are you getting nervous when you see the Oncologist> or< you are thinking about it too much> the list goes on and on.My younger daughter who is a social worker she understands and listens and she agrees with me. My older one doesn't even want to talk about it she gets all upset. What are you suppose to do/ Well explain to them that Oncologist is a cancer DR (they know it already) and you don't go to her or him for your cholesterol level. I repeated myself few times and I know I'm more understood. Good Luck to you my sister. We are all here for you. Hugs",

No pet scan. I'm reading alot about MRI but it was never suggested by my oncologist. Yes the blood work is for cancer marker test. I get that every 4 months, I'm also on Femara with no side effects. But my understanding is from the other sisters you can get pain and achy joins. I'm sure someone can give you more information. Bone Density test every 2 years because of Femara.

I had lumpectomy. chemo and radiation, also on Femara. I don't know if it differs from State to State but in NY when the Doctor writes diagnostic mammo the first 5 years after your DX they have to give you the result before you leave the office or the center. Yes they make you wait in the waiting room maybe up to an hour but the radiologist has to read it right away and you should be leaving with your results. Make your appointment earlier in the morning so someone is there for sure to read it. Last June my app was at 4 in the afternoon by the time they were finished nobody was there. They even told me that if I wanted to walk out from the Breast Center with my results they could rescheduled me. I choose not to and waited for a week for a result. Please if you have any more questions post again or you can PM me. Good Luck Sheila",

Like if you want to make this one your favorite go on the top of the page in the middle where it says Add to my favorite topics click on it and you will never loose it. Do the same with any other thread after reading it just click the same thing when you come back all you have to do is click on MY FAVORITE TOPICS next to where it says My Home and you are ready to go. You don't need to bump anything. I also had a lumpectomy over 4 years ago. I'm DD cup .I didn't wear a bras in the beginning because I was uncomfortable and my scar was right under my breast. If you need to wear one make sure its cotton and soft. Good luck with your surgery on Monday and if you have any questions about it please ask. We are here to help you with your journey Have a good Night. Sheila Edited to change and correct some things.",

A lower level indicates vitamin D deficiency, which you should discuss with your doctor. This is what I learned to do today",

Probably that will be the last 4 months check up since Ill be a month short of 5 years. Meece.. You already passed that stage. Do they do any extra test or they tell you see you in 1 year. Thats making me little nervous, I wish he would still see me every 6 months. Any info will be appreciated. Sheila",

According to the National Institute of Health, these drugs can cause a decrease in white blood cell count. Sometimes, discontinued use of these medications can help to reverse leukopenia. Step 3Include certain foods in your diet. Foods rich in zinc such as oysters, pumpkin, pot roast, dark turkey meat and squash seeds can help increase your white blood count. Foods containing garlic and shiitake mushrooms can also boost your immune system. Eat yogurt that contains live active cultures of Strepococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus Bulgaricus. According to to a study published in the 2006 edition of the Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism, both conventional and probiotic yogurt helped to increase white blood cell counts in approximately 30 percent of women. Step 4Exercise daily and find healthy ways to relieve stress. This will help to strengthen your existing white blood cells. According to The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, low level aerobic exercise such as brisk walking, can strengthen the immune system. VALERIE I JUST GOOGLED THIS MAYBE IT MIGHT HELP YOU.

I feel like we became a part of a group everybody obsessed about it. But nothing has been done. I had absolutely no risks to develop BC and I did. According to my DR it was an accidental not related to my life style. I believe in keeping a healthy life style not just for BC but overall health. Enough is enough.  sorry for the long ranting but that's how I feel. We need a cure or a vaccine not a new study which is not helping us.

I don't know why 4 hours. Are you getting it every 3 weeks or once a week.? Mine took about 45 minutes + with the prep. I don't want you to get upset, because I didn't read anybody having reactions from it. If you have any other questions don't hesitate to post. o2bhealthy also is HER2+. I think there are only about 6 ladies who are positive. One more thing you can only post 4 times in 24 hours until you reach 50 posts. You can always Pm people PRIVATE MESSAGES on the right upper hand side of the screen. Just click on my name or anybody you choose. New page will open up which says send member a message and thats it.

I always thought because I suffer from Depression maybe thats why I had all these unexplained feelings. Like I wont make any plans until I see my oncologist. When I was going to Hawaii i was on the Internet for ticket prices and praying that it wouldn't change and go higher. I saw my onco March 1 nurse called me March 3 in the morning that the blood work was fine. I rushed to Expedia to book my flight. What is my excuse after 5 years. I should feel normal but I cant and I'm not even sick or anything. For a while I stopped looking at the Active Topics too much sadness was going on All these young women just because the DR didn't want to listen to them. I hate anybody who tells me (well meaning people) everything is behind you now. i don't talk about it except here. According to them i have nothing to worry about and I also being told \"Don't even think about it\" ha. Thank You Sisters we understand each other here.

Waited 2 weeks to heal then I started chemo. I'm also reading some sisters are not waiting from port to chemo. Whatever your oncologist says... Some woman want to go under during the procedure. I didn't want to. Taking it out was really nothing just a local and about 15 minutes later it was gone. If you have any specific questions about the experience you can PM me. Good Luck. ♥",

I requested 1 night hospital stay because they considered this Ambulatory and no way I was coming home the same day.....recovery was fine not pain but extreme discomfort like turning in the bed plus the drainer for 12 days.....I was able to raise my arms few days later..just my chest felt tight....

On these boards lot of women are prescribed Neurontin. Are you on any hormonal pills? Sheila",

Stage IV and mets everywhere and she is on morphine. It was originated from the breast which nobody knew to full bloom. I spoke to her few minutes. The reason I'm writing all these is. I have a strong desire to fly to Turkey and be with her for a while. i have not been there since 1983. I'm not comfortable going there for no known reason. Financially I have to put it on my credit card and pay little by little which I don't like. Hawaii trip in May to see my daughter will be jeopardized. I don't want to sound like a selfish woman but I'm thinking its selfish not to go. Please give me some logical answers. I'm very confused and need input from you. Thank You All.",

My BS calls it an accident because I was the first one in my family, never smoked, had my kids before 30. My risks were low but it happened.

The answer to your question about \"2 testing\" really is called HER2+  if she is tested positive The DR will recommend Herceptin thats beside the chemo. Its a maintenance chemo for 52 weeks once a week or sometimes its every 3 weeks Thats really something her DR has to decide. Second opinion is a very smart thing to do, this way you can have piece of mind for sure. Oncologist decides what kind of treatment she needs. Find out the status of HER2.. Good Luck Sheila",

I didnt have to go through any XRay machine or anything else. Just the regular alarm door. I have pictures mostly scenery not myself I will post them on FB soon. Time with Christine and Jo in Hawaii was priceless. I was happy really happy felt better lost 4 pounds. Every time I was in the ocean I thought of you and wished all the good things for all of us. I love the ocean as someone said it speaks to me in a way that I feel very calm and relax. I said this so many times if I was younger I would move there. People think it's expensive but if you know what you are spending on it's not any more than NY. Rents are lower. They moved to another APT in the same complex first floor with a good size Lanai and the pool is right in the front....... OOOOOH I missed my time in the pool I made couple of friends there and we had pool time every afternoon. Waikiki has its own beauty it's alive I liked going there by myself look at the stores music on the sidewalk just breathtaking. Well I did everything I could and I left there with good and happy memories. My FSIL is wonderful i love him so down the earth both of them they are so happy. I write about the Macademia Farm tour another time. It was the highlight of my trip surrounded with avocado guava and other fruit trees. To be continued............. Hugs to all♥",

I have a question and I know we discussed this here and on other threads.......please refresh my memory...............After 2 years or more how often you see your Oncologist.......he was still seeing me every 4 months i don't know why..............i believe the new one will see me less often. my primary also saw me every 3 months for maintenance visit BP and Cholesterol. It's very unusual to be seen that often since all my BW is fine for years now so my BP. The new DR which i didn't meet yet probably he will say once a year annual check up. Am I wrong?   I need your opinions please. Thanks",

She had 2 seizures this afternoon. Not responding. she on morphine and looks comfortable. They were taking her for a cat scan to find out why she was having seizures. I stayed in the room most of the time holding and kissing her hand Talking to her but nothing. I'm not God but i said goodbye and also kissed her head and face. i love her....... I'm not bringing any other topics in this post....because it's not even worth it. I will share more details tomorrow Good Night PS: Thank you all for your kind words...I don't know what i would do without you all ♥♥♥ ",

I'm trying to gather information if I need any type of test before he starts seeing me once a year. I am not comfortable with the idea once a year. But I also know thats how it will be.

Thanks for thinking of me Meece and Elimar I cant talk about this follow ups with outside world, I can but nobody understands me the way we do here.

I don't even know how to describe the beauty of it. They all have their own unique beauty. I took so many pictures. We also went to another heavenly place Botanical garden. It was so green so many different flowers, baby pineapples anything you can imagine. We went to Waikiki not for swimming too many people, just to look at the stores, the International Market etc....... Now I have to figure out or better to learn how to post real pictures. DD was going to show me but we didn't have a chance. They both have Picasa Album. I can join to that which is much more easier than FB (don't have one) I just want to post pix. And i don't even know how to upload or download????????? pictures from the camera to the computer. I have some very colorful sceneries I want to share with other threads too. I'm so  not knowing this basic stuff. Hugs Sheila PS: Nicole and I we were suppose to meet there, but i dont know what happened to her. I called left a message but no calls. She also didnt log in since April 9th. I hope she is okay. I'm worried about her. If anyone has any information please share them here. Thank You.",

My willpower is not there but I'm still trying. and no I'm not ELAB. I don't even know what is it I want from my life. At the same time Every day I say I'm grateful to be alive. I'm confusing myself.

I also learnt something today that might interest some of you who are getting TM Test. He told me that even people without cancer DX have numbers. Its not 0. Which I think answers your question Val. Even having a drink or an infection might rise the TM Test. I found it interesting. Also Im 90% ER+ 10% PR+  and the number for HER2+ is 2.2  (I dont know what they mean. And I didnt want to ask more questions. I read on one of the thread that higher ER+ is better because the pill really works or something like that. AND IT WAS A BEA-U_TEE-FULL DAY !!!!!

I had 4X A/C and 4X Taxol every 2 weeks. With my first Taxol Herceptin was added also. I had radiation while I was still on Herceptin. Before I started chemo I got a Muga scan (Just Google it) and midway of Herceptin I had a second one. This was my treatment.

I have to teach my brain that not everything is related to BC  *%&* raincitygirl.....thanks for making me laugh. onestep...are you having your treatments in the DR's Office? With Taxol i did not experience any major SE. Herceptin was really nothing  (I know we are all different) A/C was bad. By the time i was on Taxol/Herceptin SE were minimal. I got dense dose 4X Taxol. And 52 weeks Herceptin. The first time is always more difficult emotionally. I'll be thinking of you. Meece....Thanks for sharing your Hawaii ornament with me. Sisters Thank you all for being there for me while i was going through my nonsense fears. But they are real. Thank You for supporting each other and making this thread a comfortable place to discuss your issues and everything else. HUGS TO YOU ALL ♥♥♥♥",

DD sat with me close to 2 hours expecting I will learn so many things at once. I didnt even know how to turn it on and off. I took 2 classes at a local church, got even more confused. So I decided to teach myself all the basics and some. So Im really a self learner with very limited abilities the way you put it. I found BCO by mistake. Was looking some information about Femara and it was 4th of July weekend, was waiting for some results from my oncologist. To this day I dont know how I got here. But I can say 1 thing it was one of the best things ever happened to me. I wish i had support when I was first DX. Sorry I cant sleep I keep writing.",

I was there years ago for completely different reasons. My DH decided to live me with a 3 year ol and a 7 weeks old. I tried to do everything myself of course I was only 29 and had more energy. I wish i accepted some help instead of taking 2 little girls to shopping on a snow storm with a stroller and shopping card. Sorry I carried away. I'm really sorry this is not about me.",

You hardly see people walking on the beach. I'm not anti social either but you wont find me those popular resorts where you go in the water you cant find your space. Sorry by not addressing you by your name, if I go back I will loose the post but I also had very bad burns from radiation and because it was right under my breast where doesn't see daylight it took long time to heal. I was very uncomfortable, it burned my lumpectomy scar too. Its no fun I was put on some antibiotic to heal don't remember the name. Thanks hmm for clearing the Disney thing for me. Edited to add mimi1964s name who I was addressing about radiation burn. Now I have to go back to Continental site see if the plane landed already or not. She is safely landed 20 minutes ago. Now I can rest. Good Night",

As your honorary member I want to introduce myself officially. I read your posts everyday at least 3 times a day, I am sorry I don't remember all the names I know who you all are.Like I said when I was DX, didn't have much support except family and good friends yes It was wonderful but I didn't feel understood like you all do here because we all are in the same shoe. I apologized for joining to to this wonderful group of woman little late ( 4 years late ) but i feel very  fortunate, all the sense of humor, some of you make me laugh. Triple J'S I am so glad to be with you here ( Of course none of us chose this path.) My name is Sheila. I just turned 58 years young in May. I am divorced from my DH. I have 2 daughters age 32 and 28. My younger one moved to Hawaii ( Honolulu ) this past January, have a very close relationship with them. I had my first lumpectomy on April27, 2005. Margins weren't clear but my daughter was graduating so i postponed the second surgery until May 19. July 7 my port went in. My big day was on July 20, 2005. I had 4 cycles of AC and 4 Taxol treatment.Herceptin was given to me with the Taxol and until September 12, 2006. I also had  6 weeks of radiation. I kept a detail journal until the day every treatment was finished. I am on Femara for over 3 years now, SE is minimal almost none. Port is gone, so I understand every step you are going before you know it everything will come to some kind of normalcy. I forgot the most talked about topic HAIR. Became legally bold 20 days after my 1st chemo, and May 2006 on Mothers Day i had my full head again, shorter but the same color and texture. Hey Ladies I hope I didn't bore you with my BC journey. God bless all of us. Thanks so much again for making me a honorary member. Keep writing. Hugs  Sheila",

I am not saying what happened to us was our choice, but all you wonderful people getting together to be there for each other is a great comfort, AND THAT WAS OUR CHOICE. All chemo starters this week good luck. Ask any questions you have for the chemo nurse or oncology NP. I have been told by 3 nurses they really prefer if you want to know whats happening. My nurses were very friendly and helpful. TRIPLE J'S WE ARE STRONG AND WILL REMAIN STRONG UNTIL WE KICK THIS NASTY CANCER IF WE DON'T THEN JONI2 WILL PUT HER TERRORIST SCARF.

By the time my surgery was finished it was 7PM. My surgeon asked me if i wanted stay overnight i could.

I made a deal with her that if she picks me up after my chemo will mean so much to me. At that time both of them were still home living with me. I didnt talk about cancer, i use to give updates that i was doing okay. My younger one is different i can tell her that i am nervous about blood work or anything else its bothering me, occasionally. We all are different try not to take your daughters feelings personally. I hope this will ease your mind. good luck in your journey Hugs Sheila",

I will never go to those offers again. Finding this site was an accident i was looking for Femara and Herceptin.

Make sure you have a ride home because the Benadryl will make you very sleepy ( If you are getting one ) Stay away from sick people, malls where there is a large crowd gathering, The most difficult for me was not to be able hug my friends, but everybody understood.

The first day of my chemo which was 4 years ago today I wanted to do something to cope I planted lemon seeds in the flower pot,( which i have done it before and it works) if it grew i was going to be okay but it didn't. 2 weeks later i sow grapefruit seed from the fruit itself. Today I have a 2 feet plant. In winter months i keep it inside. I learn 1 great lesson from this experience DON'T EVER GIVE UP. Good luck everybody  Sheila",
