I can\u2019t tell if I have a lump it doesn\u2019t feel like it more so just swollen breast tissue would be the best way to describe it. I have a doctors appointment Thursday with my OB and definitely will have her check things out. I\u2019m just trying to keep calm until then. Thanks for listening. Log in to post a reply",
