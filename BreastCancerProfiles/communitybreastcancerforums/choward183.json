I am from Queens, NY and I have an excellent breast surgeon, he is well known in the field of diseases of the breast.  He has been in practice for over 34 years, he has late office hours, and from what I understand he is in the office some nights as late as midnight!  If you are interested PM and I will give you his name and telephone number, incidentally he is located in Great Neck NY.",

I suggest that you pray and you be a shoulder for her.  I find with my DX, that my love ones just didn't know what to say to me.  They felt so bad, that I felt sorry for them!  Thank God that my breast cancer was found early, I elected to have bilateral mastectomy, because I did not want to go through this again. ",
