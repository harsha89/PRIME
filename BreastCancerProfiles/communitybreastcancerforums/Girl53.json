If so, what usually happens next....chemo is off the table, and you move forward with radiation? I.e., the tumor is so small that it's nearly certain chemo would be of very little benefit (as indicated by NCCN guidelines)? Or -- depending on path report/tumor biology, is it wise to get another opinion, since you don't know what recurrence risk the test might have indicated? Everything on my path report pretty good except PR- status, which it seems confers higher recurrence risk. Don't know if this higher risk is independent of tumor size and other variables. Anyone with small tumor had the test done and were told that results were inaccurate or inconslusive? Do they charge the full amount if this happens?",

Apparently, I am one of those LCIS patients with no detectable mass and with pathologic/radiographic concordance (I think this terminology is correct) who still turned up positive for BC. Fortunately, BC is \"tiny\" and low grade. I live in a metropolitan area with great breast care center and have a loving, patient, supportive husband. And it's great to be out of the limbo of waiting; got my mammogram callback July 28 due to clustered microcalcifications, had core needle biopsy July 31, and lumpectomy Sept. 3. Due to LCIS and strong family history, BS and I are discussing whether to do radiation and Tamoxifen/AI, or whether PBM would be better. The latter is reasonable option for someone of my profile, she says. She recommends I get genetic test right away, and on Friday I'll have repeat mammogram and MRI. Will also have SNB. My mother had an aggressive BC, and my paternal grandmother died of it, and I have multiple great aunts and cousins who have had or died of it. Also have two third-degree relatives with ovarian cancer. So lucky as BS got clean margins on excision...if I don't choose PBM, I won't need further lumpectomy before radiation. A signficant factor in treatment decision is that my wonderful first husband had a very long, arduous battle with a brain tumor and passed away 10 years ago. We lived for 14 years on a rollercoaster of dread, anxiety, and the everyday problems of physical limitation, employment difficulties, and financial challenges. Now, I am happily remarried and want to be able to enjoy my life without so much fear and hardship. Thanks, all. Scared and upset but so glad to be in a supportive place.

As it turns out, I'll be seeing today -- very briefly, and not by choice -- the MO from Monday. She works with the genetics folks and will speak with me just before blood draw today. Outfield, you're right: she was probably frustrated with \"cart before horse.\" But there isn't a huge number of possibilities, and I'd imagine that she is confronted often with patients with strong family history, probably BRCA negative, and wondering what the heck they should do. I understand that it's a personal decision but was expecting she'd offer some perspective. Nothing. Will not try to repair relationship...will just be polite today and then move on. I live in the Washington, D.C. area and fortunately have lots of other choices. Am just new to this and had no idea about the dynamics. Will ask my BS, who I do like, and also a doctor I'll see Monday to get another opinion. This will be Johns Hopkins in Baltimore...I am blessed to be near such a great facility. Talked to my sister-in-law last night, and unbelievably, she has a girlfriend who also had a horrible experience with this same doctor. So it's confirmation that it wasn't \"all me.\" MrsGreenJeans, that is UNbelievable! That would scare the h*ll out of me, if a staff member said she didn't know why they were taking new patients. Ksusan, also can't believe doc didn't check your hormones first. Ladies, I think the whole situation is so stressful that I just hoped for empathy and caring, forgetting that there are jerks and people with no social skills in all professions, including doctoring. It is hard to feel as vulnerable as one does with a new cancer dx and encounter that kind of coolness and rudeness and impersonality. And I got so sad, newly learning about all the women in my dad's family with BC, that I just felt raw. Hope everyone has an okay day. Thanks again for great support, and hugs to all.",

Changed my mind about double mastectomy after serious thought, and didn't do it on Nov. 13, as planned. SNB was delayed due to genetic testing, which came back negative, thank goodness. But will have SNB this coming Thursday, and am hoping for clean nodes and a treatment plan. Good luck and thoughts and prayers to all who are having their surgeries this month. Quick questions: Going in tomorrow afternoon for dye injection prior to SNB Thursday at 9 a.m. Is it just an injection, or do they do a scan of some type, too, before the biopsy? Is the injection painful? My stepmother was just dx'd with breast cancer, too, and is having her lumpectomy and SNB the same day as mine. She was told she wouldn't be able to drive for two weeks. Would this be the same for me, if I'm only having SNB (I had lumpectomy two months ago)? I work part time in a library and told my boss I'd be back on Monday....will it be longer than that before I can lift/push?",

Had appointment with MO Monday...someone who appears on my city's \"Top Doctors List.\" Got confirmation that cancer small and low grade....yay. But had read that this lady was knowledgeable about genetics and thought she might be able to help quantify ongoing bilateral risk that comes with ALH, LCIS, and very strong family history. Suspect I am one of the many women who have strong, scary family history but probably BRCA negative (will find out soon). She wouldn't answer my questions, and the responses she did give were formulaic and at times defensive. She was cold, arrogant, and dismissive. She lacked empathy and didn't seem to be reading facial or voice cues. She just kept saying, \"We have to wait for the [genetic] test results.\" Positive test results would make the treatment decision for me; I need someone to guide me toward smart treatment choice if my future risk is moderate to high but not clear -- lumpectomy/rads/AI, or CPM. At one point, I said I wasn't comfortable and that the meeting wasn't going at all as I'd hoped. She replied, \"I don't like your tone.\" I returned, \"I don't like YOUR tone.\" Then she said, \"We can call it quits right here.\" WTH?! Since my BS works with this doctor, I didn't want to end on such bad note, so I stayed calm. My husband was with me, thank goodness, and we agreed it was a bizarre experience. I went home and cried for an hour. Also found a few positive but many more negative online reviews of her. Can't imagine anyone entrusted with cancer care acting that way. It blows trust out of the water. Maybe I didn't understand her role on the care \"team,\" or that having talk I wanted really was premature at that point? Either way, it was a horrible intro for me to BC oncology. Have been anxious and upset all week. Major effort not to keep turning this over in my mind and allowing it to rent space there! Rather, this was an unfortunate, brief experience with someone I would never choose for care. There are jerks in all professions and walks of life, as well as wonderful folks, right? Seeing plastic surgeon for consult tomorrow and genetics person for discussion and blood draw Friday. Also consult with surgical oncologist Monday at major east coast breast center. So nervous and so afraid trying to gather info to prepare for appointments. Having trouble just walking my dog and cooking dinner!

      "Content": "Girl53 wrote: Hi, ladies. While I am generally doing well after completion of breast cancer treatment (lumpectomy, lymph node biopsy, radiation, anastrozole), this week I unexpectedly developed heart palpitations that turned out to be -- I was told after ER visit, and being observed overnight -- atrial fibrillation. I am 54, healthy, fit....have no other cardiac problems, diabetes, high blood pressure or high cholesterol. I was sent home with two prescriptions: a beta blocker to slow the heart rate, and a blood thinner to help minimize risk of clots/stroke. My understanding is that AI will probably be sporadic...on and off (I hope mostly off). I hope not to be on the drugs permanently. Because I have virtually no risk factors for AI, multiple doctors told me the problem is very likely due to the chest radiation I had for BC....that while my heart remains structurally healthy, the radiation can cause changes at the cellular level that can alter the muscle's electrical patterns/conduction, causing AI. Clot/stroke risk aside (meds control this), the condition is more irritating than dangerous, they said, and I don't have to restrict regular activities, but be more aware of my body, lower caffeine and alcohol, and not be surprised if I'm a little more fatigued, winded, etc. I had read that cardiac effects of radiation would probably only occur in women treated on the left side of the chest (my right side was radiated). This came completely out of the blue. Anyone else have this, or heard of this? Hoping it's helpful to mention here, so others won't be as surprised if it happens to them. Am trying to take this in stride, along with all other changes that have come with BC. It just takes a while getting used to new normal, and I had thought I was over the hump. One upside: another good reason to take super-good care of self physically. Wishing everyone well on this lovely summer day. With hugs.

It seems that peoples' experiences of afib, and treatments, can vary widely. Am doing okay since paroxysmal afib episode two weeks ago...taking the beta blocker and Eliquis, having only a little very-low-caffeine coffee, no alcohol, staying hydrated, getting enough rest, and doing a 4-7-8 relaxing breathing exercise. Am going to see the cardiologist a week from today. Not sure if she will keep me on one or both meds, since I am otherwise very healthy/have no cardiac problems. If I had to bet, I think intense anxiety and dehydration probably brought this on (they also said my potassium was low). And maybe the estrogen depletion from anastrozole? Should I ask my oncologist about this when I see her? Does the body normally adjust in time to the much lower estrogen level? I can see that, after BC dx and treatment, and an otherwise very stressful last winter, I have just been emotionally overheated and wound up. Unexpectedly, though I'd read that many of us struggle with anxiety after treatment ends, it has hit me super hard...I am afraid of EVERYTHING and am catastrophizing! LOL. Am hoping that the intensity of the anxiety and fear will naturally subside. Am consciously slowing down (I eat, talk, walk, and do almost everything too fast and hard) and reminding myself that almost nothing is really urgent. And as you say, maybe knowing about afib is a blessing in disguise, and real impetus for good self-care and calming down. Will post again after seeing doctor. Thanks again so much to all for insight and tips....have a relaxing day. jlbestmcg -- I think you are right about stress. I know that different phases of this are discouraging, including the tatoos. I so get it and am with you.   ",

She said another episode could happen, or it might not...that my heart is otherwise healthy, I am young, and they'd rather go with the \"pill in the pocket\" approach rather than maintain on meds. They said if episodes become more frequent, I could carry a rhythm control drug and prescription anticoagulant and take as needed. Hope to not need. She also said that treating the anxiety with a medicine might not be a bad idea. Will think this over. Would rather not go down that road if I can avoid.

It occurred to me to check insurance guidelines for \"medically necessary\" PBM. Have checked two insurance sites so far (not my own yet), and I seem to meet the criteria (e.g., \"one first-degree relative with BC dx'd at any age, plus one second-degree relative dx'd at any age, plus two relatives with ovarian cancer\"). Question is, do insurance companies use hard data re: actual cancer occurrence/recurrence to set this coverage? In other words, if they are willing to pay for a PBM for me, does this mean this is considered by the \"industry\" a reasonable treatment choice for me? Have read that PBM (mine would actually be a contralateral prophylactic) is dramatically on the rise, and that many women with and even without a BC dx are taking this route without medical necessity. Ladies, I bring huge fear to my current dx due to my late husband's lost battle with a brain tumor, and my brother-in-law being diagnosed with melanoma last year -- three separate spots -- with an unknown primary. Huge uncertainty and fear. I just don't know whether I am being driven by stark fear, or whether I am truly evaluating my risk and comparing effectiveness of treatment options.

Ruth, you're making an excellent point about the hard data re: effectiveness and survival, and my question is this: am I one of the relatively few women who would actually be safer with a CPM? I've been told that my early-stage, low-grade cancer is low-risk for body spread. Negative for lymphovascular invasion, with SN to be checked. I have LCIS, which confers elevated, lifelong bilateral risk, and I have a very strong family history. I have dense tissue. So, am I actually at high risk for a second cancer of any type and grade popping up bilaterally? And if it did happen, might it be hard to see? Have shared on other threads that I watched my grandmother (I lived with her) die of BC; I had a wonderful husband with whom I struggled for 14 years with an ultimately fatal brain tumor; and my twin sister's brother has been diagnosed with melanoma...three separate spots, with an unknown primary. My anxiety and fear are high. Given my actual but maybe unquantifiable moderate to high risk, do I want to live with such anxiety (understanding that CPM could prevent bi-lat occurrence, but not body spread that's already happened)? I'm not sure I do. This is where Beesie's wonderful list will help. Am going today for blood draw for genetics test. Then will try to relax a little! With hugs to you, and thanks.",

Hugs to all on a Friday. I am so tired of being scared all the time!!",

Are you substantially recovered from mastectomy? Thanks so much for your reply. I feel so upset today...had huge meltdown this morning before work. Though particulars of my situation are comparatively favorable, the uncertainty is so hard. I see you have mutation...Part of my waiting was for a multi-panel gene test due to lots of BC and other cancer in family. Test was negative -- for which I am so grateful. But still struggling with feeling threatened and scared (I had a husband who died of a brain tumor after a long struggle, and now have a brother-in-law being monitored for melanoma after discovery of an unknown primary tumor). My 66-year-old step mother was also recently diagnosed with BC. And my vision is impaired now due to a cataract, and I'm only 53 and too young for this! I think the fix for that is not too bad, thank goodness. It has just felt like a scary time...like painful things happening in \"clumps.\" Guess it's natural to have some down days when dx fairly new, and before main part of treatment underway. Am learning, through this process so far, what a huge ruminator I am. Even when I get good news, I have a hard time enjoying it, as my anxiety level is high. So it's easy to beat myself up for this, too. \"Why can't I just be grateful,\" etc. etc. My inner Charlie Brown is a little out of control right now LOL. Trying to tell myself that any normal person would feel upset in this situation; that tears are a healthy release of tension and emotional energy; and that this mood is going to pass. It's not permanent. It just feels bad today. Thanks again, Exercise, and will be thinking of you.",

Am trying to be patient, but the waiting feels excrutiating. I was diagnosed with LCIS in early August, breast cancer in mid September, and am now waiting for Oncotype results now. While am so grateful for good care, just feel suspended and uncertain and droopy and angry, by turns. Want to be in mood for the holidays, but it's hard. Hoping there are aspects of this situation that will help me develop new emotional awareness and skills...but do I really want these...Cookies sound better! Piles of them don't fit into my breast-cancer eating plan...Might have to suspend the plan until January 2 LOL! So many times a day I think, \"I just want to be past this. I want to be looking back at this from 'all finished.' Yet I know that there is something very valuable about TODAY, and its circumstances and relationships and new learning. Don't want to miss these things....just wish I could have them without so much fear and ruminating and consciousness of vulnerability. Guess I'll have to make my annual (wonderful) fruitcake this weekend, and add a little extra bourbon!",

Whattheheck? My radiation oncologist told me that BC rates are higher-than-average in my county in my state. She mentioned Radon as a possible cause, but I know nothing about this. Even more exercise and fruits and veggies for me! BRCApos, I'm sorry treatment rough. Hang in there. Thinking of you.",
