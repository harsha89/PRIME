I am diagnosed with Stage 3A Invasive Lobular Carcinoma, grade 2/3, Progesterone and Estrogen positive, Her2 Equivocal at both tests, which I am told means a negative. I am going to Mayo for a 2nd opinion on the 30th. Here at home, the doctors recommend 8 rounds of chemo, then mastectomy. While only one breast is involved, both are recommended for removal. My CTs and bone scan are all clear. Obviously, I am terrified. My husband tries to be funny. He is an ex coach and tells me just to \"push through it\". I am sure he is scared too. I am totally overwhelmed. I have multiple lumps. One is huge.....7.5 cm. I am fit, active, and in very good shape.........or was. Now what?",
