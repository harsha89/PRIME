I was supposedly triple negative (ER >5%, PR >1%, her2 -, Ki67 >1%), and then the final pathology gave completely different numbers:  ER 99%, PR 22%, Ki67 32%.  No node involvement, 2.5cm, lumpectomy. Have been waiting on pins and needles for two weeks for the oncotype, will find out tomorrow.  This has been a hard two weeks. But, if I were to throw a bet out there, I'm going to bet that my oncotype score will be intermediate, and that my MO will recommend chemo.  We'll see tomorrow. Do we not know anything at all about all the other variables included in the oncotype test?",

The first day everything I read and heard sounded like I should be hopeful, but now I am back to freaking out.  I have an MRI today so I'm worried about other spots, and also am worried about the lymph nodes.  I'm a candidate for lumpectomy (depending on mri results), so I'm worried about recurrence if I pick that over mastectomy, and then I'm back to a total meltdown about the lymph nodes. I know my kids are freaked out by my constant crying. I have IDC in my right breast (approx 2.2cm), grade 2, Estrogen low pos (5%), progesterone low pos (1%), HER negative, KI-67 under 1%, p53 negative. Log in to post a reply",
