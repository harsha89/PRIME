I have found such strength and support from reading these posts - a giant thank you to everyone for sharing your experiences and advice! I am 35 with two little ones, my daughter is 3, my son is 15 months. I was a high school special education teacher for 11 years. I am happily married to my college sweetheart and he keeps me laughing. We have one completely insane chocolate lab and just added an 8 week old yellow lab puppy to our family. We are 100% crazy but enjoying (almost) every minute! I was diagnosed with IBC on 1/31/12. It came as quite a shock since my son was just two months old and I was still recovering from his birth. PET scan revealed a solitary met to T-11. I was treated with TCH x 6 rounds and had a complete response to chemo. Surgery in July 2012(BMX), followed by rads this past fall. My onc has decided to keep me on Herceptin \"until further notice\" and Xgeva. Most recent scans (Feb 2013) look good but my onc is still keeping a close eye on my skin - she's optimistic it's still healing from rads but wants to monitor the changes closely (I had a rough rads experience and my skin was fried to a crisp). Will rescan in 3 months to see how my body is behaving. Thank you for letting me share my story - I have found such solace on this board. Gentle hugs to everyone. Erin",

Yes, teaching special education was a wonderful experience but I hear you on the paperwork and bureaucracy! I miss the kids, but my own keep me busy. Our house is a 3-ring circus on a regular basis, but the insanity of two small children and two dogs (and well, life in general) has been has been my saving grace! Thanks to all for the support! Erin :)    ",
