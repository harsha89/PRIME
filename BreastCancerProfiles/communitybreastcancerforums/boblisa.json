The ENT found a \"bump\" between my nose and my throat, so now I get to have a biopsy instead of chemo on Thur. They have to take me to the operating room because of the location of the \"bump\". I really wanted to rack that doctor in the nuts, but I refrained. I am rescheduling chemo for next week. So, I am like Kimberly, strangely upset that I'm not getting started. (Like I want to have chemo???) Please keep posting those good days. I am so happy for yall. Hey, thanks to all the veterans who keep posting this awesome advice. I hope someone did that for you.",
