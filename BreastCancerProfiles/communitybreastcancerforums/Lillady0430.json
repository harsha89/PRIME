But I've started some of the exercises and it's not as tight. Of course some exercises are easier than others. And I knew there was something with the back of my arms it makes sense that it's my nerves. Glad you've got full range of Motion that's what I'm shooting for. Have you had problems with lymphedema?

I had a mastectomy of my left breast on January 9th, since I've been home I've been experiencing some shooting/ burning pain on the back of my arms and a pulling on the front of my chest. I'm sure some pain is expected, just want to know what is normal. I've been taking my pain meds every 4 to 6 hours. I find myself cradling the affected arm and my posture is affected as well because I'm afraid to move that side and I know I'm supposed to do exercises but the pain and discomfort doesn't mk exercising easy. Please let me know if these are normal symptoms and what you've done to cope. Thanks in advance! Lillady0430 Log in to post a reply",

I'm 6 months in now. Chemo and surgery has already been done. Mentally I'm still trying to adjust to this new club I find myself in. On Wednesday when you find out your treatments I imagine they will tell you your stage and that 's how they'll gage what treatments you will need. Every treatment is personalized to your type of cancer. Wishing you much success on your new life journey.  Kinds regards Lillady0430",

Thanks Vicki, I forgot to mention that I do have the camisole, it's been helpful though I never seem to get it to match my original cup. I understand this is a temporary fix. It's good to know your husband has gotten used to it.(gives me hope) do you now have full range of motion in your arm. I'm still very limited.. Thanks Lily, I understand your feelings as well. I'm hoping it gets better.. SoCal, I never thought about a sock, nice trick in the interim. I'll get fitted for my prosthesis soon. The weather is cold here in GA so I'm hoping to camouflage with scarves and sweaters. Thanks ladies... Let's keep fighting.",

I just had one of my drains removed I still have one left. I opted not to have reconstruction but I'm having the hardest time trying to find comfortable shirts, bras, etc. I know a lot has to do with the healing process everything hurts right now, but I look so lopsided and I feel like everyone is looking at my chest. I'm a large D cup so it's very obvious. It's too soon to get fitted for my prosthesis... But I'm due to go back to work soon and need some suggestions to help camouflage a little. No one else seems to understand my dilemma, this is such a nightmare Thanks in advance...  Lil lady",
