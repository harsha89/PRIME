      "Content": "Oct 7, 2011 01:51PM - edited Oct 7, 2011 01:52PM by xtine I don't think it's unusual to detect cancer in the nodes in the final pathology, but not during surgery. It's difficult to really examine the nodes in the short time of surgery. The \"new way\" is indeed to just start treatment, and recent research supports this. SeeÂ http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/surgery/new_research/20110208.jsp. While it might seem unsettling not to know how many nodes are affected, there are real risks for lymphodema and other complications from another surgery. Lymphodema is a likely complication that would affect you for the rest of your life. I would seriously question whether this surgery is necessary, and perhaps get a second opinion.",

I assume the media reports are biased. I just read this blog post that reenforces that point - at the end of her post, she points out several interesting facts that were not initially reported. http://ihatebreastcancer.wordpress.com/2011/05/13/wheres-paul-harvey-we-need-the-rest-of-the-story/.",
