I asked him why it was so suspicious if everything is benign - he said \"radial scar\" looks exactly as ILC on US and MRI. Also he said that all my ADH was taken out during MR Guided biopsy and none was found at the time if surgery, which means I'm not high risk either (still can't beleive). Thank you all again. All of you will be in my thoughts. I wish you all the best!!!! Love!! Will visit this forum anyways.",

He said that my right breast (focal ductal hyperplasia with atypia) has 10 % chance to be upgraded to cancer after surgical biopsy and my left breast (radial sclerosing lesion) has 20-30%. i'm so confused, because I thought that ADH is more concerning than radial scar. Just decided to relax and wait.... Do you have any idea what \"focal\" means? Why my BS is more concerned about my left breast? My surgery is scheduled for 08/24....................",

I will know the result in a week Plan A if result comes back B9 - There is a high risk program on Sloan Kettering. I plan to register with them (because ADH was found earlier) and then whatever follow up is needed I'll just follow their recommendations. Plan B - to tell you the truth I'm not ready and really hope that I'll not need it. BUT if... then I'll probably go for mastectomy + all procedures that are needed. I have 2 children (22 and 21) both are away in college, which is good I think. I'll go for a nice short short haircut. I'm planning to continue working as long as I'm able to........... To tell you the truth - I have no idea :(",

My question is how big is a chance that it is not just ADH but something worse like DCIS or even IDC? I'll also have my other breast excisional biopsy the same day, because they found radial scar with microcalcifications there. I'm really worried... Can you please share similar experiences with me?

I've been on this rollacoaster since May - hopefully this surgical biopsy will end it (good or bad). My first MRI report said multifocal bilateral cancer BIRADS 5. Second MRI (in sloan kettering) was also BIRADS 5(left breast) BIRADS 4(right breast). Turned out right breast has ADH, left breast has radial scar with microcalcifications. I'm so tired of waiting and worrying and guessing and surfing the web and............................ All my friends and husband look at me like I'm crazy, they say that I have to celebrate that I don't have cancer, they don't understand that it is not final yet. Sorry for complaining so much, I know that my situation is much better then others... Just worried and this is THE ONLY place where (I'm sure) people will understand. Love Lana ",

Naughty you made me think! I'll definetely let you know about my 2 plans. For now - I had surgery on Tuesday. They removed 4 cm lump from my left breast and a rea with ADH from my right breast. The surgery went very well. I didn't have an opportunity to talk to my BS, but he talked to my husband and said that whatever he took out looks B9 to him (is it even possible to tell just looking at it?). I feel excellent and back to work today. The biopsy results will be ready by next Friday and I have post op appointment with my BS next Friday. For now I feel releived, I feel like I had something dangerous in my body and it is out now! (does it sound stupid?) I feel HAPPY!!!!! This site is greate and YOU GIRLS make it great! Thank you so so so much for everything you do - it really helps!  Now I have to think about my 2 plans :) HUGS Lana ",
