Congrats on being a 19 yr survivor... How amazing! I am so incredibly stressed from this.. Much more so than my mom. She just talked to her gyno who said that the onco will probably restage her to a higher stage. Her appt is tomorrow though, so well see. Hopefully not. Has anyone had experiences where their stage/grade was changed at the onco appt? Best Monika",

Sorry I have not been good about replying, I just started a new grown up full time job, so have been busy with that along with everything else. My mom just saw dr. Bethke at northwestern hospital in Chicago, where she was re diagnosed with stage 2 grade 3 IDC. Although they didnt see any lymph node involvement, they won't know for certain until surgery. She still want to do a double mastectomy, but my dad is pushing for a lumpectomy. After talking with the women in the center who were coming back because the cancer had returned with a vengeance in the same or other breast, as well as hearing the information I've been providing that I've learned from these forums, her heart is set on the double mastectomy. She really liked dr. Bethke, however is going to see dr. Dragon to get another opinion next week. Well know what her genetics test revealed in about two weeks so far as brca -/+ and the potential for cancer in other parts of her body. Fingers and toes crossed that comes back positive!! I've been as positive and supportive as possible as well as trying to keep her mind off of it as much as possible. Prayers and good vibes sent out to all of you women... You are amazing and such an inspiration. I love sharing posts and diagnosis with my mom from this site; it is really helpful and encouraging to hear stories and see success. Thanks again :) Xo monika",

      "Content": "LoveMyMommy wrote: Hi everyone! My 56 yo mom was just diagnosed with IDC stage 1 grade 3 BC. I know that it she has DCIS cribiform, IDC luminal b. The greatest length of the tumor in a single core is 7.5 mm, and there are multiple layers of yellow nad white soft tissue ranging from .4 to 1.5 cm. luminal B, ER+ 95%, PR+ 15%, IHC 1+, Ki67 30% She is my absolute best friend so this is incredibly hard. She will visit the oncologist Tuesday 7/2, so we will know more then. She is also seeing a geneticist at northwestern hospital because she is high risk due to our family history. I am so uplifted by the posts I have read on here... It is awesome to have a place to refer to where women have experienced/are experiencing the same thing. She is planning on getting a double mastectomy even though the dr said a lumpectomy and Tx would be fine, just to get it done with. Any tips, recommendations, anything would be soo appreciated. We are from the suburbs of Chicago; tips on drs would also be awesome.  WHat is the significance of Luminal B? Does anyone have any experience of women with this Dx? She is IHC 1+, however the results from the FISH Her2 are still pending. Thanks so much  Monika Log in to post a reply",
