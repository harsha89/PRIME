They didn't take out any other lymph nodes under the arm to my knowledge because nothing of that nature is on my pathologist report - though i have a scar near my breast and underarm as if they did. They want to do a full body CT and bone scan. After that I'm suppose to meet with the surgeon and two oconolgist for their recommendation about chemo. They are recommending radiation and estrogen blocker meds for 10 years as well. I'm concerned about chemo. Log in to post a reply",
