The BS has recommended if I want to save the nipple, to do chemo 1st and then the lumpectomy. However, the nipple sparing is not guaranteed and I am concern about the side effects of having surgery after chemo and radiation. If you've been through this, could you give me your input? The second option is mastectomy and then chemo and breast reconstruction with the expander initially then the implant.

Could you explain the OncoDx testing? Did you have any side effects from it? What is TE and fills? My BS is recommending anti-estrogen therapy for me after the surgery and chemo. What type of hormonal therapy are you having?",
