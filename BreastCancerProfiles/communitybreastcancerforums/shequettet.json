This was due to my lump being really deep or in the words of the radiology tech \"it is way back there\".Â  I had my doctor I work for look up what ever results was in and the only one was the specimen, which read coarse microcalcification was noted within the specimen. Can someone please tell me what that mean? Also I am having a hard time with this waiting game. Log in to post a reply",
