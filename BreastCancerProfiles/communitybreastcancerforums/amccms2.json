When it showed uptake I signed up for cancer insurance that October. I am encouraged to have a second opinion by my friends and the insurance will even cover the airplane ticket. He discouraged me from having mastectomy. But I have three more complex cyst to worry about and I\u2019m over having to wait and worry. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve done since 09/16. His nurse practitioner said it wasn\u2019t an overkill. He said it positive for invasive ER/PR, HER2, and DCIS. I need to research because I\u2019m clueless. It is 5 mm. And it is slow growing. And my hormones are feeding it. If I do a lumpectomy I will need radiation but no chemo. And then hormone blockers. I think I got all this right.",

Went to follow up and radiologist detected jagged edges. Doctor was still not concerned. Left it up to me if I wanted the biopsy or not. I opted for biopsy. He did not do the needle biopsy. He did a vacuum biopsy and took all of it. They found cancer in the jagged edges. I go tomorrow morning to discuss \u201cplans!\" What plans? I'm scared that he won't take it serious and downplay it like he did the radiologist report. What do I ask him tomorrow?? Please help me. Log in to post a reply",
