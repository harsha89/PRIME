By the way, mine also just burns in the middle of the night.  Maybe that's when the cells are dividing rapidly?  Oh God!!!!!!!!!",

Now the breast is even smaller, black and blue and hard from the second lumpectomy.  I had the drain for about 6 days but now that is out. I think I will use my own judgement as to when chemo should start, as I had found from my first lumpectomy that the breast tissues take quite some time to heal.  The hole which is left behind from the lumpectomy gets filled with blood and slowly builds.  Bleeding is also part of the process and takes a while.  The surgeon has not given me any antibiotics thus far as I don't think I had an infection after the first operation.  How does your port feel?  Is it like a big huge lump on your arm?  Are you comfortable with it being there for  5 or more months?  Mine is like a big marble there and I hate the presence of anything foreign in my body, but I guess I have to live with this.  I hope the discomfort goes away pretty soon. ",

It is all about \"belittling\" it because he can't deal with the reality of it.  My family have now stopped asking me how I am feeling, whether I have any issues.  It is as if this never happened to me, and that I am fine.  In fact, I have a post at the TN site about my recent anxieties, mixing with people who have no clue about this disease.",

Someone at this site pointed to me about the serious side effects affecting your heart with Adriamycin.  My Oncologist avoided informing me of something as serious as this.  Honestly, I just cannot go through Chemo knowing that this drug could actually damage my heart, not today, but a few years down the road.  Here is a link for this drug     http://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-52891-Adriamycin+IV.aspx?drugid=52891&drugname=Adriamycin+IV Anyone with information please respond.  The nurse is supposed to go through the chemo process with us this coming week. I am thinking of postponing everything.  My surgery is over, the cancer is gone with clear margins.  Even with tripple negative cancer, I feel like just doing local radiation therapy and forgetting about Chemo.  My God, I don't want get heart attack instead of cancer.  Can someone please help, I am totally freaking out.  I cannot go through chemo and destroy my beautiful healthy body for which I have worked so hard all these years.

My left one is like a rock, so hard after the surgery, and there is a very deep dimple (long big cut), from where the infection was sucked out of.  When I sleep this thing burns.  Right now I have a bandage, but am wondering will this ever become a breast again.  And I am wondering this is the same place the cancer was, and then after the first lumpectomy, there was some cancer still left in there, and only after the second lumpectomy, all cancer was removed and there was a 3 cm clear margin.  And now my mind is playing games with me, imagining having infection in this same area.  The surgeon described the liquid which she took out of this area, as having a horrible bad smell.  I am so uncomfortable, not just with left, but right too.  I want to get to the treatment phase, but my God if only I can get past the healing.  I am most uncomfortable this weekend as it is hot, I am bandaged with a drain hanging out, and there is a pain somewhere in the left breast. I hope it is not another infection.  Please do tell me more about how this breast will heal, you said something about redistribution of fat.  Once healed, would I still have lumps?  How do they check a breast cancer patient after treatment?  I mean how do they check whether cancer has come back?  do they check only in the breast or the whole body for tripple negatives?",

I am also getting my right breast checked, meaning the MRI showing one highlighted area, which will be biopsied on Thurs. Surgeon says that she would like to preserve my breast and go in there and try to remove the rest of the cancer.  I haven't even seen my Oncologist yet, but was referred to a surgeon right after the biopsy.  I am seeing the Oncologist on Thursday morning, so will ask him about this second surgery.  The surgeon says if it doesn't take it all out this time, then it will have to be a mastectomy.  I don't really want a mastectomy.......please, I want to keep my original breast. What do you ladies think?  Do you think it would be safe and possible for them to take it all out.  I did not have any cancer in the one lymph node she took out during the first surgery.  I don't have a date for the second surgery yet.  Also, should the surgeon have done intraoperative radiation during the first surgery?  She said she did not, and I am not sure why she did not. Any input would be so appreciated.  Thanks. Dx 7/20/2010, IDC, 3cm, Stage II, Grade 2, 0/1 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

So happy to hear that you will be just fine, your doc sounds great.  As I was reading your story, I realized my vision has been going down tremendously, just all of a sudden.  I never have headaches though, but just recently, I have had a few sharp sensations in my brain.  God, I wonder if my petscan scanned my brain or not, I thought it was below the neck.  I am wondering what tests you had done, how did they diagnose it.  I hate this tripple negative disease.  Your doc sounds amazing, I have yet to meet someone like that.  I can't believe he removed 59 from one woman. ",
