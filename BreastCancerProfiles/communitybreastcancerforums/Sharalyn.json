Thank you Binney and BarbaraEllen for keeping me posted on all this great news!  and....\"hello\" to Erica and Rinimom too!  When I first encountered this site, I was a relatively new RIBP person.  At that time, all I did was think about it, ruminate and slowly sink into a depression I had never known before. It has been a year and a half now and my arm is getting heavier and my hand more numb....but for some reason, I don't even think about it much unless someone brings it up by saying \"how's your arm\"?  If I hear that one more time of which I did last week and \"I said...thanks for asking but it is always going to be the same or worse and it is never gooing to go away so thanks for asking but you don't have to ask again because the answer will always be \"the same\".  I smiled and laughed when I said it but I think she got the message.  Luckily, I don't experience a lot of pain now thanks to Lyrica and Zoloft but the cold intolerance is the constant killer.  Living in So. Cal. people use their air conditioners and like to keep around 70.  If the temp goes below 74 or so....man oh man, that's when I get very uncomfortable.  My hand gets very cold and hurts.  so....needless to say, I whine about it and now, all my friends accommodate me and if it gets a little warm, we turn it down for a little while and then off again.  I am so lucky to have the best of friends who are always helpful to one another.  One other lady does have LE and now is starting with BP but she says it is because of breaking her humerous bone last year in the other arm.  Ok....enuf aabout my dramatic life.  I am just soooooo happy that we are getting some attention and maybe help is on the way!!  That spells hope and it certainly is alot more that I have heard since this lousy BP and LE started (that was eight years ago) started. Am leaving today for a trip to Hawaii for a wedding.  Let me tell ya girls, finding a dress and other clothes for the trip was a real challange.  Everything cute is sleeveless!  Even thought I will shed my sleeve for the wedding, sleeveless just doesn't get it!  But...the shopping is done and the bag is almost packed.  Gotta ago for now but hope keep this thread alive by our posting each other. I will toast this good news with a Mai Tai to us all! Shari",

And I also welcome Kathy Saul from the UK.  Always great to get info on what's happening over there and make a connection.  Barbara....always good to read your post.  Where in the midwest do you live??  We're definitely in the same boat with both these sneaky little creatures of the ramification nature.  Yes...too bad that we can't get a separate thread to entice more BP sufferers but Binney even though I realize you don't have it, you have been so instrumental in keeping this site interesting and alive.  Do you guys sleep with a Jovi-Pak?  It has really helped me by keeping the LE from getting out of control. The Jovi is also good when you fly.  My LE therapist thinks that seeing this doctor in Cinn. could be promising as far as nerve implant and/or releasing the nerves from entrapment utilizing laser surgery microscopically but with me, the whole BP triangle seems to be involved.  Bummer!  We'll see! Two more weeks~ Big Hugs...Shari",

Barbara whatever the reasons, hope that you can get this all behind you soon and can get on with life!   Talking about going back to your home town and finding a specialist (as the doctor who wrote in this email)...the same kind of thing is happening to me.  As you know, I had to go all the way to Cincinnati to someone who says he has an excellent referral right here in Los Angeles at UCLA.  Now my question is why doesn't anyone around here know about him.  My oncology group are researchers as well.  Hello?????what's the deal here????? Anyway, am waiting for the report which has the new guys name and # on it.  If doesn't come on Monday, plan to call and gt it by phone.  Very anxious as it is getting cooler here nights and morns and I have a huge intolerance to any temperature under 74 degrees....pain begins.  I call it the \"rose thorn people come around to visit me\".  Yes...thorny tingling...that's what it is.  I've been getting those hand warmers that skiers use and they help along with a half Vicodin once a day if needed.   Well Bonnie, once again you have been a great help to someone in need. I am so glad that I have a new friend with the knowledge and compassion that you obviously possess!  Most of all, your willingness to give to others as I have seen you do time and time again!  Barbara, I hope that things get easier and you are able to connect with the specialist who can get you through this and be supportive along the way!  You , like me, live in major cities...there has to be some excellent specialists there.  BTW....did I tell you that I emailed Oprah regarding BP and of course LE??? I actually thought that because of breast cancer month, the subject would be addressed.  But NO....not even a \"thanx but no thanx\".    Love you guys even thought we have never met.  Now I understand how people form relationships on the internet.  Never could understand that before!  Getting educated all the time! I am going to try and post this email on the site too! Be well, Shari",

I haven't been in the site for a while and kind of caught up with everyone today.  I can somewhat relate with Ronimom and fixing the hair thing.  Although I have a lot of hair, it is baby fine and I always spent time blow drying and styling cause it's stick straight too.  When my arm and hand became more unusable to raise above my head, I had to get my hair done once a week at a salon.  but I hated the old lady look even though I am 62 myself and the economy has dictated a re-evaluation of spending.   I now use a brush that blow dries and I sit down and rest my hand on my knee for support and it works!! I think Conair makes it. Oh...and a good hair cut once a month is the real key here for me anyway.   It is a true life saver cause I have always been a little vain (hate to admit that) and between that fat arm that doesn't work anymore and and the hair that I couldn't fix right....WOW, needless to say, tuff for me!  Have had to really work on the importance of what meaningful in life and what is just stuff. Just an update cause I haven't gotten to know the newcomers on board.  Am on Lyrica (which really messes with my ability to concnetrate and stay focused but does help with the nerve burn and jumpin....so I stick with it.  Recently went on Zoloft because as much as I tried to fight depression, it came in like a lion and I knew that I needed to take something.  Still getting used to it.  I will say it has calmed me down and made my husband's life less dramatic...tee hee, if you girls know what I mean.  It's like \"poor us\" but in fairness \"poor them\" too.  Good luck with your Chrismukka party Ronimom.  Around here, we call it Hanamus...but the last couple of years...Holiday party.  I hardly entertain anymore because I am right handed and my left is a complete \"duh\", just drinks and appetizors and card playing is about all I can muster these days.  I did help with our community party this year, but used ideas and organization meaning I just bossed everybody around...tee hee.  I do have an appt. with UCLA on the 30th of Dec. for muscle and nerve testing.  Not sure if they can do full on nerve tests with the affected side due to LE.  Not expecting any miracle but would like to have someone who is expert monitor meds and any other ideas they might have.  It only took a month to even get any appt. with these guys so they better be good!  I will definitely keep you posted and hopefully will learn something new that will help us. Thanks everyone for all your great \"helpful hints\".  Oh...and re the Kindle...I have been ordering longer books.  They are cheaper then I used to spend at Costco or B&N with a book card.  But the real reason is I was finding myself looking to reading as a chore because of the physical uncomfortableness (a word?) of it and reading is something I have always loved so much so it made sense to \"bite the bullet\" get it and I just love it!  Somebody said BP is an expensive habit and boy are you right on that one!  Peace and love to you all!  (((((H)) Shari",

(the weight didn't though).  Then about my second year, underneath my rib cage in the rad side, if I would be in a certain position, I would get these spasms, like a muscle spasm.  Then that went away.  I did have LE though after the 2nd year post rad.  Not until one year ago, did I start with the RIBP which was nine years post rad therapy.  I am glad to hear that your doctor is correctly diagnosing and you will have support and knowledge that many of us didn't have.  Hope you all had a great Valentine's Day and the chocolate cravings were satisfied.  For me....been eating way too many sweets.  My weakness! xoxoxo Shari",

Ohio where I was planning a trip in October so I called and spoke at great length to this doctor's assistant.  They mostly treat BP on babies but have been seeing adult BP patients too. (Guess there are more of us popping up lately)  I made an appt. for 10/17.  The webside is (I am going to resubmit this because it won't let me post with this website cc)  Needless to say, I was excited to find these guys...the asst. told me that there are only a handful (no pun) of doctors in the US specializing in BP.  At least it's a step in the hopefully right direction.  BTW....in what state does everyone live??? California by any chance???  Anyway...I can't tell you how impressed I am with you Barbara and your clinical knowledge re BP.  And...Binney, I am also impressed with your great sense of humor which we sooooo need dealing with this unrelenting crapola!  I've picked up more tips from U2 than I have in the past 10 years!  It doesn't cease to amaze me how all the PT's seem to know about BP but it's just the same ole treatment offered and no one knows what the latest research is.  I have found with the lymphedema that a nightly message helps more than anything along with wearing the juzo sleeve (not the custom one...that was horrible) in the daytime.  When I travel I take the jozie pak (i know I spelled wrong) and at least these measures keep it soft.  Whenever someone asks \"what happened to your arm\"...I just say \"It's a long story\".  Thanx for the info on the Frogpad.  I give you a lot of credit for learning a whole new way to type.  You are right tho about causing more swelling so I don't type much like I used to.  I am going to look up the lymphedivas site now.  Before the BP i just kind of stayed in denial about my lymphedma meaning always wearing long sleeves and hiding it whenever I could.  Now I realize that I have spent way too much time being vane! And...what you said Binney about running into other people..get this...I've have LE for seven years and I NEVER run into anyone else.  Maybe they are all on another planet...get me a ticket please! Do you ladies have pain with the BP?  With LE, always the heaviness and the strangling sleeve but no real pain.  Now sometimes I feel like large needles are sticking me in my last two fingertips along with the numbness, tingling and weakness.   Are you on any meds that help?? Well I guess I've written enuf for now but am sooo very glad to have found this site and met you via internet. Hope you have a nice weekend!! Shari",

So, I'll keep you posted on that!  Speaking of the election....am so glad it's over too!  I was living and breathing it everyday for seems like a year!  I am sorry though that Barack's grandmother passed away two days before he won.  I was hoping she could hang on just  little longer.  But again, that's life!  Well, I guess I would be the tie-breaker on your votes....I mean, Chicago? ~ Arizona? Tee he.  Ok...enuf.   Now for the fun stuff!  I can't wait to meet you guys and spend some time in reality speak!  So...whatever date you pick and whatever area I need to be in, I will find a hotel and be there!!!  I would probably fly in to Phoenix and \"rent a car\". Anytime the last week of Jan, first few days of Feb  is fine for me!  Just let me know and I'll be there!    Well have to get ready for PT now.  I don't know if it really helps but at least I feel as if I am doing something besides just watching my arm swell and hand go numb.  Oh and Bonnie you asked me about those hand warmers and I don't remember if I answered that question but they are called Grabber Mini Hand Warmers and they come in packages that you shake up at first then put in pocket and it will get warm. You can get them at Big Five or any sporting goods store.  They have been a lifesaver for me cause this intolerance to the cold just kills me.  I am a Maj player and the other girls get hot so the temp is always a little cool.  I was ready to quit playing but I found these and now back at at it.  Anyway, now I'm rambling and my pointer finger on my right hand is getting tired. Bye for now! (((H)))) Shari",

(So I save a little money cause most the time I don't find anything...tee hee) I do go for PT but now just once a month because insurance only allows 30 visits a year. She tries to break up scar tissue but I don't think it helps much.  I am grateful for connecting with you and love your sense of humor.  That's helped me a lot by keeping that and trying to still have fun in life! Thank God for this site!!!!!  I will be looking for your postings! Be well all!!! Shari",

With my experience, I would advise no one to seek laser treatment for lymphedema.    I don't think all people with fibrosis get BP....but I was diagnosed with RIF soon after my radiation, within a couple of years.  That was easy enough to live with because the lymphedema was a much worse problem for me.  But this new BP is mind boggling!  I have heard recently that if we progressed more with stem cells that new nerves could be grown but as you probably know isn't being done in this country due to laws.  Now I am going to investigate that possibility in other countries....hopefully not another dead end!  Wish me luck!  Sending (((H))) back!

Ohio on the 14th of Oct.  No cutting please, information only.  I am hoping that because this is his specialty, he will be up on all the current and may I add accurate info and again I say hopefully.  This is a sport's med grp. who takes care of Cinn. Bengals and have an exellent reputation.  This doctor I am seeing is with the grp. but specializes in BP...mostly babies and accident victims but has been seeing RBP patients too.  In my case, the LE really complicates matters which has been a part of me for 8 years now.  You'd think that one would get used to this strangling sleeve but there are times when I have to take it off and just throw it!  I'm sure you can relate.  I sleep with a Jobst at night.  Well girls, that's about all tye typing my right hand can do right now.  I hope everybody is having a nice day.  Weather great here in SoCal....gonna walk the dog now.

Hope and prayers for Barbara too!  And...hope you get a chance to enjoy the color up there in that neck of the woods. Shari",

Thank you silfang for your garment tips.  I have been wearing Juzo during the day and Jovi at night.  Well..gotta go cause busy day prepping for man'ana!  Hang in everybody...we're in this together!

Haven't been on the site for a while and notice that there are a couple of newcomers.  Yeah right, another club you didn't want to be a member of.....I was reading some of your recent posts and have never heard that radiation only improves 1% survival rate.  I am interested to read any information regarding that.  Yes...this LE/BP thing is really tough and I wish that there was some magic out there but so far, I haven't found it.  I know the Lyrica has helped tremendously with the nerve pain and the combination Lyrica and Zoloft has been very helpful as well.  No weight gain with Lyrica but if I have my \"druthers\", I would definitely go up a size than have constant nerve pain.  I think the stretching exercises help somewhat.  I thought ten years ago when I was finished with my treatment that I would be able to get back to normal.  After a year, the LE started.  I don't think I took it as seriously as I should have, being careless about wearing my sleeve like I should have and not wearing anything at night until I was much worse.  So my advice to anyone who has recently been diagnosed LE...pay attention and manage it.  Please don't wait until your armis so big that you can't fit into clothes because of the girth of the affected arm.  Now, of course I pay attention but I am at a level 3 and I don't it ever goes back to looking normal or even close to it.  Then the BP started a little over a year ago and who would ever guessed that I would be double wwhammied!  I had never heard of it.  It is hard to not be angry that no one warned me about the possibility.  but, like Erica says....the lucky 2%.  Why can't I be the 2% that wins the lottery??  Anyway, I thought I would say \"hi\" and introduce myself to the newbies and will try and post more often.  Your partner in crime...
