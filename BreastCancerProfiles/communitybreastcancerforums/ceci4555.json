I've been having symptoms that might be faslodex side effects but I'm confused about something and have a couple of questions. I usually feel little weird after the shot but usually have no side effects. The other day I had smotach cramps and vomited 8 or 9 days after my shot, didn't think it was related. This time the same happened but with other symptoms (body aches, strong headache, cough, maybe fever, didn't check) every symptom described as faslodex side effects except this time it started happening 1 or 2 days after injection (I do think they injected me faster this time which may have contributed), and I again I vomited and had stomach cramps. Before the gastric discomfort and vomiting I thought I just had the flue, but then remember what happened last time I thought I might be getting side effects from faslodex, but the fact that it took a different amount of days to happen each time is very confusing for me. If you get side effects, wouldn't you get them at around the same time each month? Or does it just affect you the whole time and some days maybe you're weaker and it hits you harder? I'm trying to figure out whether this is truly faslodex or something I should be looking into. I've though I might have gastric mets but my doctor doesn't think much of it and hasn't requested tests, she just said it might oe might not be faslodex. Thanks in advance.",
