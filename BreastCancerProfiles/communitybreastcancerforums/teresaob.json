Its not plesant but you know you can do it. Believe it or not it was a relief for me when the hair started to fall out, though unlike some I got my DH to shave it off, what a laugh that was, god love him he tried to tell me I looked like Demi Moore in GI Jane.  Think he needs glasses!  The kids laughed!  I try to go through life like Pollyanna - seeing something good in everything.  Chemo was - saving a fortune by not getting hair done every six weeks, no waxing to be endured! Keep up the good thoughts  Lots of hugs",
