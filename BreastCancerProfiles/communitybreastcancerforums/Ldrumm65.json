Subsequent mammograms, MRIs, and ultrasounds of my right breast and left lymph nodes did not show cancer anywhere else. Only in my left breast. I had double mastectomy on November 1, 2018 even though the cancer was only diagnosed in my left breast. I opted for the double mastectomy as preventative. I did not want to take any chances that cancer would later be found in my right and have to go through all this again. After surgery, the doctors found three cancer tumors in my right breast and my sentinel lymph node had micrometastic cancer and a cancer cell was found in two other lymph nodes. This is also a reoccurrence of breast cancer for me. I was diagnosed with DCIS in June 2011 and chose a lumpectomy and radiation. My oncologist doctor with Sarah Cannon is recommending no chemo based on my oncotype score of 22. He recommends 10 years of anastrazole. My radiation doctor is recommending radiation to my breast (again), upper chest, and lymph nodes. He also mentioned removing all my lymph nodes as a possibility. I am in the process of seeking a second opinion on treatment from the UnIversity of Kansas Medical Center. I have met with the oncologist only so far. The radiation doctor with KU is the same doctor who ordered my radiation in 2011. I will meet with him this week. The oncologist wants to do 8 sessions of chemo every 2 weeks. Then hormone therapy also. He feels like the size of my tumor at 6 cm, the fact that cancer was in my right breast in addition to my left, and was also found in my lymph nodes as reasons not to just go by the Oncotype 22 score of no chemo. My oncologist is getting input this week from multiple oncology and radiation doctors to help determine the best treatment plan for me. Has anyone else been in a similar situation with an intermediate Oncotype score, tumor on the large size, and had cancer that had spread to lymph nodes? If so, what was your treatment plan?

I had a double mastectomy in November 2018. I also had breast cancer on my left breast in 2011 and was diagnosed with DCIS. I opted for a lumpectomy and radiation then. This will then be my second radiation. My skin tolerated the radiation pretty well the first time around. I am a little scared at what this second radiation is going to do to my skin. My doctor told me to use aloe vera on my skin. He was talking about during treatment. If I could, I would like to put something on my skin to prepare it for the second radiation. Is there anyone here who has gone through radiation twice? Thanks!",
