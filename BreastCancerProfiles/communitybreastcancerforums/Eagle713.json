I just can say that I'm so glad I'm in a smaller town, I got my news in 54 hours (last night at 8pm the surgeon's nurse called me to let me know my papilloma was benign also.) It doesn't seem right that some are so personally involved with their patients (I feel very blessed after reading all the long waits) and to others we are just another case...  My best to you- we can celebrate this weekend in spirit! ",

I don't know if I can help, but I do still hurt even 2 weeks later- I'm out just 2 weeks from my excision, and it was about 5 inches around the nipple- so the arm pain wasn't bad. When I had post op appoint. last week, I \"complained\" of the shooting pain that was like electricity through my breast. He said to take Motrin, and it really did help. I started feeling better and stopped, but just the last few days, I've got all that pain back again, so, back on the Motrin. I hate meds, so it's really hard for me to justify taking them. I also had (have left over) Darvocet sp?, but stopped that about 3 days post op.  I was also surprised that the excision made my boob look flat, the nipple is still there, but flat. Kind of a shock to think it might always be like that... but as we were discussing the shower, I'm thankful for now, that's all we had to deal with. I didn't have a drain, but do wonder if I should have, as there are big lumps under my breast that hurt... guess that's the blood that collected. Take it easy- I have a job that's flexible, so I was able to sit and do no lifting- for about a week I bossed everyone else around and let them push things around for me. I also have 3 newly drywalled rooms to paint and have no ambition at all to do it, so called for a painter today. What the heck, if it hurts, it hurts, and I'll treat myself this time. (I LOVE TO PAINT, so you know I would be doing it if I felt like it!) So, again, take it easy if you can and let yourself heal. ",

I did the yearly mammos, but for the most part wouldn't know if I had a real bc lump. Last month I started with the orange discharge, that got the ball rolling, and had my mammo, US and St. Biopsy all within 2 weeks. All B9. But still the discharge, so won't be surprised if the surgeon does the duct removal (BTW- he said any color, even blue is possible- but still no \"one\" color will predict for sure). My GP ordered the whole thing, so I didn't have a problem with insurance (exept I hadn't reached my $5000 deductable until the US). But I'm sure there are others who will respond that there's no way to predict what the lump is until it's biopsied. Try to start with a call to the GP and maybe they can just start an \"emergency\" ball rolling?  My best to you- and like they say- 80% are B9- so just keep praying for now. Nothing else is in our control.",

My appointment yesterday with surgeon left me with this explanation: the fluids are coming from a possible plugging of ducts due to pre-menopause. He will check again in 3 months or sooner if fluids come more frequently. He suggested I take Vitamin E to help keep the ducts \"open\". He also asked me if I had hay fever, because this could also be a reason for the discharge? Has anyone ever heard of this? Even with the B9 report, this all can still be unsettling. Not to mention that I've become addicted to these boards! ",

Just thought I'd get a step ahead and sign up because.... here's my story: 3 weeks ago, yellow-orange discharge from left breast, sore and only 4 weeks until my mammo. Called doctor and she got me into mammo and US early. Took the normal week to get this info- a formal report from the clinic that everything was fine and to make an appointment in a year. Nurse called back and Dr. wants me to see our surgeon. June 2 (tomorrow) I will visit him. After all the reading of these boards, I became a little worried that our little town, and the surgeon would not give the peace of mind I need. Then I Googled his name and found him to be on the \"contributing editors\" list at MEDIPEDIA- under breast cancer. That has relieved my mind a little, but hubby is ready to take off for Mayo if I'm not happy.  Anyway- I just wanted to come from my \"lurking\"- you are all so amazing- and I have learned things I'd never known if I hadn't had this scare. I don't have family history of bc, only an aunt with bone cancer, and grandma with stomach cancer. I don't even have any close friends with any type of bc experience. That's why, when I read the boards about stupid things people say, it really made me think. If nothing else, I feel thankful I've read those and hope I'm better at communicating than those \"stupid\" ones! LOL! Love you all- already! Eagle",

When I asked about the quick service, he laughed and said, \"that's the advantage of small hospitals- we can do things quickly\". So, all I can say is even though it took me by surprise, it was probably a good thing. No time to worry- and even though the biopsy was very uncomfortable for a few seconds, it's not too bad. The major sized boob patch made my hubby think it was bigger than it is (the incision) I'll let him pamper for today! And the local hasn't worn off yet, so I'm sure I'm in for a little soreness.
