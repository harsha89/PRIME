    "Content": "cptdebbie wrote: In July of 2014 I had an atypical intraductal papilloma removed from my left breast (it had atypical ductal hyperplasia). At my follow-up appointment with the breast surgeon, he said to follow up with my regular yearly mammograms. Since I found the papilloma myself (I was sweating and scratching), and my yearly mammograms had been ineffective in finding my lump, I asked my primary care physician if I could also do an mri. So, in August of 2015 I had a mammogram and an MRI. The MRI picked up a small item that looked like scar tissues, so I had a follow up MRI in March (small item is unchanged) and was encouraged in my MRI report to have another MRI in September. I happened to look at the new screening guidelines and got searching the Internet. I am wondering if I need to see an oncologist. It seems like some women with atypical hyperplasia are taking anti-estrogen meds. I also feel like I'm running this post lump show on my own. For those of you in my situation, I am curious who is handling your follow up care, if anyone, and what your follow up care is. I am 55. I had a hysterectomy at 42 and stopped taking hrt when I found the lump. My breast surgeon said I didn't even need to do that if the estrogen helped me. Thanks for any info you can give me!
