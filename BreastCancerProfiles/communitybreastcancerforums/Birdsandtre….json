I would travel a day or more to get one if I had to, rather than waste time and money on a yearly 2D Digital. My mom had BC so I went for my 2D every year since 40. Nothing ever showed up as being irregular. This year I missed my usual mammo because of an injury. When I went to my PC she suggested trying the 3D at her new women's health clinic. Thank goodness things worked out this way!! The 3D picked up a tiny lesion of combined cribiform DCIS with early tubular carcinoma starting to emerge. The radiologist said he would \"never\" have been able to see this so early on 2D and this was probably growing for years and not able to be visualized on 2D! I am so thankful and grateful for this technology. I have since had an ultrasound, core biopsy, bilateral MRI, lumpectomy and sentinel node removal. Thankfully, nothing else is there nor has this seemed to have spread and the less than 5 mm lesion is gone with large clear margins! I do not think I would have been so lucky, I know I wouldn't, if I hadn't switched to the center with the 3D Mammo machine! Will be going there every year now. I'm on AI and short-run of radiation. No chemo! Thank goodness! Another benefit of catching it early! Thank you, Hologic!! and my great doctors, of course!",
