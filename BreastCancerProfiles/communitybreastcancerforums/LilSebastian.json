    "Content": "LilSebastian wrote: I'm not sure what I'm looking for here but a friend recommended this board. I was diagnosed last Tuesday with IDC. After the MRI yesterday, they told me that what we thought was a 2 cm tumor in my right side is likely 4 cm. And now they want to look at the left side again. Nodes are inconclusive so far. I am ER/PR + and HER2 - and the genetic testing isn't back yet. I had no idea what any of this stuff meant a week ago (and still barely do). I hate the fear that this is creating in my heart on behalf of my husband and 10 year old. It feels like there is an elephant sitting on my chest and I walk around crying with my stomach clenched. I'm so afraid for my survival and afraid of the treatment (last the docs said was surgery first, and soon) too. Thank you to anyone who is reading and 'listening.' Log in to post a reply",
