Worked through my last cancer journey. I am BRAC I positive so I have chemo and another surgery to take out my ovaries. Maybe it's just that I'm 58 or maybe I'm not as dumb as I was at 49 ....worried about working with AC..I wasn't good with nausea when I was pregnant with my kids. How bad is the nausea? Can I drive to work after taking meds? Glad to meet all of you. I can't imagine doing this with young children at home. You all are brave women!",

I had 4 rounds of taxotere and something else. I had a mastectomy on the right side. And of course my chemo starts after my left breast mastectomy this year.Triple negative usually has a high oncotype score. But everything I read said if you made it 5 years out you were considered cured. I probably would not be facing this again if there would have been an option to take both breasts off. I found alot of survivors in the triple negative community. Hang in there!",
