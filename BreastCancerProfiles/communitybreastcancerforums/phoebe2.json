It had been rated as bi-rads 3. At the six month follow up--it was still looked exactly the same. The radiologists said I could wait another 6 months or do the biopsy. She did think that it looked \"odd\" but said she still felt it was low suspicion. She rated it a 4a--she said to help with insurance coverage. (I think that she still felt it was more of a 3?) The waiting and watching was giving me too much anxiety--but now this is giving me anxiety. The rational side of me tries to re-assure that the odds look good. I am a single mom of a five year old--and I think that is really driving this anxiety. Also there was a mistake in reading one of my early mammograms (a separate area that turned out to be fine) but it undermined my confidence in all this. Maybe I will hear tomorrow.",

How much weight can I give those words? The biopsy itself was fine--and very minimal discomfort. They said the results would come in three to five days--so I am hoping to hear thursday or friday. I am feeling on pins and needles--and trying to stop googling. thanks! Log in to post a reply",
