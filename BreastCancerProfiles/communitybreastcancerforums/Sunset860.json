When I asked for her opinion, she said she has gotten more conservative with her recommendations as she has gotten older and if I was 39 she would say yes do chemo, but at my age 59, she didn't think the chemo side effects out weighed the reoccurrence risk. Just don't know what to do, am afraid of chemo as I have many issues with allergic reactions to chemicals and even had anreaction to thedye used for the sentinel node procedure.
