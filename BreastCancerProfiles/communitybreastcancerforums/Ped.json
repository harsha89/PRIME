I am at my wits end in short I noticed big changes to both my breasts like spider vains on both on the left this looked purple and only when I streach the skin you can see red vains. I have an itch not constant on my upper breast left also this isn't constant and no rash but lots of deep streach marks I am big breasted. I had a stabbing pain on the side of my left breast and armpit pain in both armpits I went to the doctors who refered me to the breast specialist. I had a full examination mammogram and ultrasound. Nothing at all but nothing was mentioned about the colour or why the pain. I have been back now to the doctors twice and no one seems concerned. The pain has become unbearable both in my breast and armpits the only time it eases is when I'm in bed. Sorry to witter but I can't just leave this is iv read so much ibc has gone undetected.I am 53 and not yet gone through the menapause Any advice on what to do would be appreciated Ped Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Apr 28, 2019 08:08AM - edited Apr 28, 2019 08:11AM by Ped Well I went back to my doctor on Thursday as the pain and colouring had got worse and my armpit was really hurting. I do understand that you can be over cautiones but to be told you have health anxiety and you have been seen by a specialist so nothing wrong was beyond belief this is the first time in 53 years I have gone back to my doctors with a continuous concern I have been back three times once when they refered me twice further as further changes. We are constantly told to know our bodies and highlight changes especially breast changes but when you do you are labelled. I had photos of my breasts when the coloring was at its worst but she wasn't Interested. I know feel that I darent go back as this is what iv been told. We are now looking at getting a loan so I can go private and get to the bottom of what is wrong.",
