But shortly after celebrating my birthday with coworkers I got a phone call from my mother who just learned she has stage 2 breast cancer. She also found out that this was genetic. Which worries me because now i'm thinking if its in her gene it's in mine. So i'm totally freaking out. The whole summer was hard for me. From this day on I was in complete denial. She finally had her surgery for one mastectomy, and it was painful to watch. I still can't believe the strength she had and watching her was harder. She just turned 50 on May 26, 2013. We both had a sad birthday, i'm sure no one wants to hears this news on a day you are expected to celebrate. I cannot deny, my worries are high. I am soon going for my annual exam with my gynecologist, and I am totally freaking out! The thought of it, makes my body shake and weak, and i nearly cry. Then I catch myself and say your fine. I have a 13 year old boy, and a 7 year old girl. I worry about how they would feel, would they understand? Given the circumstances between me and they're dad, would he be compasionate and not want to try and take them from my side because I wouldn't be able to care for them? Things like these cross my mind and I become so overwhelmed. I'm only 31 years old! I shouldn't have to worry about this! But I do, because it's my nature, and it's possible I may also be carrying that gene.Â  So I just pray to God, that I dodge the bullet and continue to live a healthy life with those I love so much. -G Log in to post a reply",
