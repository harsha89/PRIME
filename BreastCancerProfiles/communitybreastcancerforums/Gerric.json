I was in an Ohio Cancer Teachimg hospital 36 hr later having a mammogram and ultra sound. They wanted to do the core biopsy that day but I had taken vitamin E the night before so it was scheduled 3 days later on Friday. By the weds after memorial day, 4 days later I was told I haveinvasiveductal Cancer which is estrogen and progesterone positive. A week later, two days ago I had the 2cm cancerous lump removed and three lymph nodes as well for diagnostic study. All of the scheduling was handled by the surgical oncology clinic I chose. They gave me a doc and gave me dates and appts and got my treatment started and explained things to me. I didn't have to flounder around trying to find a doc someone knew by word of mouth. Please start with where you got mammogram and get a dr whose office will get your mothers treatment going! You are not superman and I wish you were but find a cancer group to get on your mothers case. Best wishes to your mother and family. I wish all cancer hospitals were like mine..",
