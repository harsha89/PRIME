    "Content": "boobytrapped wrote: Hey all, I'm doing the 3 week Canadian protocol and will be doing tx #12 later today. When I started rads, I was told I'd have 21 tx's - 16 regular, and 5 boosts. Now my rad onc is saying he doesn't think I need the boosts at all so I'll be all DONE next Friday.  Hurray!  However, now I'm worrying that I should have the boosts after all. He says the boosts would give me only a 1% decrease in chances of recurrence.  Isn't there some sort of standard tx for this protocol ?  Any one have any input on this issue? dx 9/9/08; IDC Stage 1, grade 2, Dx 9/9/2008, IDC, <1cm, Stage I, Grade 2, 0/5 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
