After that they sent me down to mamography to insert a wire. My mass was about a centimeter and they had left a marker when they biopsied it. The most uncomfortable part of it was the mammogram. Other than that, it was no big deal. I am a wimp by nature, hate needles and have a low tolerance for pain. Try not to feed into the negative. I made it through both procedures and then went on to have the \"mass\" removed.",
