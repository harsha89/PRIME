Just make sure you monitor it , go to your appointments and make sure they make you feel comfortable with what they tel you. I was no tested at all until I demanded it. So the fact you\u2019re getting testing so soon is great. My symptoms were the same except I couldn\u2019t feel a lump. Just thickening in the underside of my breast. My breast was tender all the time. My discharge started out as an oily type of colour and a few months later it was bloody. But they still maintain the blood was from a papilloma they found while doing my biopsy. Hopefully you\u2019ll get a good report soon ! Most lumps are benign so you definitely have that on your side.  ",

Anyway on tuesday I noticed the lymphnode under my arm was super sore and enlarged. It only makes sense that it's likely from the surgery , but it seems odd that it's occurring this far out without an active infection. So it's making me nervous. I haven't seen my Oncologist yet about what steps we are taking, but I did go to my family doctor who gave me antibiotics. He said it didn't appear to be an infection, but it could be.He wanted to rule it out so I didn't go to the cancer clinic tuesday and have to wait another week for the meds to work or not, and then proceed with figuring out the cause. He did say it could be related to the cancer ( in that there is more ) Did anyone experience this? I know DCIS doesn't spread, but I think I'm just anxious that perhaps I have more cancer hiding out somewhere . I was diagnosed through one biopsy and no imaging, so it's not impossible.

She went on chemo for 7 rounds, and the met went necrotic. They can still see it on scans, but it's tiny and inactive. She's been on Herceptin for 8 years, no progression and a great QOL. Another woman (the two became fast friends and run the local support group), is TN, and recurred after 2 years from a stage 3 diagnosis. She did chemo as well for a certain amount of treatments ( can't remember how many) and maybe rads for the sternum, I can't remember. She had 5 lung mets, a sternal met , and a tumour at the Mx site. She also responded well , and has had ZERO treatment for close to 10 years nows with no progression and stability ( 3 lung mets disappeared and 2 are small and stable).

I was told that during my biopsy , I did have a papilloma as she suspected but that \"it was strange because behind it I found a little bit of Breast cancer\" she said it was DCIS and that it's gone. In a couple months I'll have an MRI -she said it would be too soon after surgery to be useful if they did it now. I'm beinng sent to the cancer clinic to see if there's anything they can offer but she suspects that we will just be monitoring me every 6 months. I'm also being sent to genetics. My questions are - did any of you have the biopsy, and I guess I had a lumpectomy (I have NO idea what was done , except biopsy ) and that was it for treatment ? What is the standard tx ? Anyone have no reoccurrences since ? Shouldn't I know more ? It's driving me crazy. I don't see my family dr for two weeks but I want to ask for my report.

Only a scan can confirm whether or not you are metastatic.

That is why I ended up with a mx after chemo. If I hadn't responded they wouldn't have bothered. They said \"Ypu're an exceptional case, we were scared for you\" So I'm pretty happy. In the back of my mind there is always the fear of it not working out how we all want, but for right now, I'll take it. They want me to remove my ovaries asap as well, Anyway I'll find out what they want to radiate on the 5th. The surgeon said probably the armpit but I'm thinking they'll do chest wall too. She said I could probably work through rads if I needed to go back sooner rather than later but I'm thinking it's probably not a good idea. But I am getting more strapped by the day.

The whole curative intent thing is more of treating me like they're trying to cure , or give a long disease free progression. Not treating as if I'm incurable (or palliatively). They have their reasons, and I'm optimistic, but I am also realistic. I know that for any one of us, we can recur, no matter the stage. So unless things start going downhill, I am of the mindset that I can do really well. I am scared of course, but I am also very young with a young child I intend to see grow up. This disease is awful I wouldn't wish it on anyone. Right now NED from first line of treatment. Couldn't ask for any better.

Not sure how fast things will move as my surgeon was really non chalant about it all and told me not to worry. I think she really believes that it's gone and nothing more has to be done. But you know, there's always that fear that there's more. So I'm anxious for the MRI. I know that's going to be a few months away though . I'm thinking genetics is gonna take a while as well. Where I live there's really only one cancer Center and where my surgeon thinks it's gone i might be lower priority. I guess the not knowing is bothering me. I'm only 30, I have a three year old , and this experience is something I have to live with and keep in the back of my mind. It's scary .  Thanks for the replies ladies",

After speaking to the Oncologist, treatment options seem a little unclear, but that is because we are waiting on a MRI and Genetic testing. This could take months where I live, but the MRI needs to be timed well after surgery as if I do it now, the area will light up anyway. The wait is really hard.",

One surgeon said I should stop drinking coffee and my problems would be gone *eyeroll* Had an Ultrasound that revealed nothing. Then it started to bleed, which at that point she took it seriously and booked an excisional biopsy. Had a follow up 10 days later and diagnosed with a papilloma \"with a little bit of cancer\" Was told it was gone . Not to worry. Will see the cancer clinic to which she suspects will be a one time thing , genetics which was a choice given to me , and MRI when I'm healed , but could be months away. I kinda want To have a mastectomy with reconstruction so I don't have to worry the rest of my life that it could come back , and worse , but I don't follow up with my surgeon for 6 months. Maybe it's a good thing to wait and get more info , but it's just unsettling that I don't know much. But maybe it's how it goes :) it's all new to me . Thanks so much for your input. I'm glad you're doing well :)",

I was pushed off for a long time considering my age (30), but once I mentioned blood, she was like \" Fine, we will biopsy it, but I think it's probably a papilloma\" I did have a papilloma, which is a common cause of bleeding , but I also was diagnosed with DCIS. Very lucky it was found . I think it would be fair to push for a second opinion considering your family history. I was told it was nothing, and if I hadn't pushed to get my biopsy, I wouldn't know about the DCIS. Never hurts to get a second opinion!",
