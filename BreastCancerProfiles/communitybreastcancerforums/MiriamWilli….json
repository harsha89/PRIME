      "Content": "Feb 7, 2016 03:43PM - edited Feb 7, 2016 03:45PM by MiriamWillits Hello, ladies. Had my first TX of Kadcyla on 1/18 and now another one is anticipated for tomorrow, 2/8/16. Had been on THP since October, having added back in the Taxotere to my Herceptin & Perjeta which I had been on since doing THP for a 6-month stint July 2014 to January 2015. After 4 TX's this past fall, it was determined to no longer be working. I had been on Taxanes since my DX in November 2010 (Stage IV) along with Herceptin. Then hormonals for a couple of years until they no longer worked. No serious SE's after the 1st treatment, but do now have a persistent UTI (on a 2nd antibiotic & still having a bit of an issue). I'd never in my life had one before. I also have dry mouth. Searching on the Internet, I found that 9% of women can develop UTI's, so I will have to drink a LOT of water. I usually aim for 64 ounces, but had been a bit negligent right before this developed. Does anyone here know of UTI's being a side effect? WebMD cites that here: http://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-163563/kadcyla-intravenous/details/list-sideeffects I'm reading this thread very carefully and am grateful to so many of you for listing your SE's, the things you are doing to keep up a good fight, and how it's been working. Thanks so much. Thanks also to whoever posted the chemocare.com article for Kadcyla; there were a few helpful tips on there that will be good to know. Miriam",

I can drift off if in a recliner & the TV is on. All that works is severely limiting caffeine, taking melatonin, and getting a lot of daily exercise. Oddly, if I stop walking for a week (a lot of snow here recently gave me the excuse to take a week off, very bad), the first walk increases my metabolism the first night and I don't sleep well that night. Then, my metabolism adjusts and things settle down. But lack of regular exercise is hard on my sleeping. Caffeine probably is worse than that, though, for me. If I become desperate, I'll take a 5 mg Zolpidem (Ambien) which gives me about 2.5 hours of sleep. But I try not to take Ambien; instead, I'll try Kirkland's sleep aid, which is a decongetant. I'm just happy to be off of Decadron (steroid) before treatment. That was really tough on my sleep. Am going to see my PA (assists my MO) in just a bit so will report back what they think happened after just 1 cycle. Perhaps that is too early to tell. My palpation exams don't seem objective enough to me to know if my 1x1\" tumor in my left breast has shrunk or not. ",

I always say \"OBGYN\" and she probably actually said \"Obegynie\" & told me \"everyone says it like that\". So, I'm the archaic one. My daughter is 24-1/2 (a wordsmith - actually, we generally enjoy grammar, doesn't like going to the \"Obegynie\", but who does?). Funny, I never take baths, dislike hot tubs; I'm just in too big a hurry. I don't even like taking too long in the shower, but I do wash overly thoroughly (OCD?). So, good to know that I'm doing the right thing in staying out of the tub. I'm drinking a virtual TON (exaggerating, I suppose) of water. I keep three of these Contigo water bottles full and I usually get through most of it (81 ounces) and that should help. My sister, who is a Weight Watchers counselor, rightly told me that the more water you drink, the better your bladder accomodates and holds more longer. That, in itself, sounds like a good thing. I'm so glad you got a bit of sleep. The lack of sleep is so awful hard on a person; I remember the days of young kids and wonder how I made it out of that stage alive. Lack of sleep made (makes) me a bit self destructive, eating junk more, not wanting to take a walk. I really can't get by without 7 or 8 hours, and on these chemos, you're so dang tired that you want more like 9 hours. And then you still feel tired, LOL!! Thanks, Marl. I'm very encouraged by you girls. I am excited to see what happens, and about ready to say \"it's working\"? Thanks again!",

They are down to 34, which is great. I've been trying to read everyone's posts and, while I have a few SE's (peripheral neuropathy, drippy nose, stiff joints, fatigue), the nosebleeds haven't been an issue. Reading that you girls (Denise & Peg) have had to have a cauterization is a bit frightening. Would you attribute that to being on the Kadcyla for a long time? I've only had 4 TX's, so I'm still a newbie. But, it appears that I'll be on this as long as my body can tolerate it, so I want to be prepared in the event any of that happens. I have rather poor balance, though I haven't fallen yet. It's supposedly due to the CIPN (chemo induced peripheral neuropathy) damage to the soles of my feet and my MO agreed with me that trying yoga might help. I walk about 30 minutes a day which helps me sleep better, also helps my metabolism stay normal. See one of my walking companions, below. That's Bailey, and she's one of my best pet friends. My dear husband also walks with me, and that's a help. But I think I need a bit more than that. Thanks so much for all the encouragement you put up here, ladies. You are all a blessing, I can't tell you how much. (hugs and prayers, Miriam) ",

Sorry your scan wasn't great, Denny. Not familiar with SUV score, will have to look that up. My new issue is bad neuropathy. Started Saturday night (May 7th) in the soles of my feet and toes. Bad burning, too much discomfort to sleep. Called the Oncologist and they're upping the dosage of Neurontin (Gabbapentin). That helps, but it makes me awfully sleepy. I'm a bit frustrated, and unsure how much damage (permanent) this is doing. I've never had it in my feet, after all the years on Taxol and Taxotere. Maybe I had it very minimally, as my balance is messed up (my primary physician said that neuropathy caused that). Usually just a bit in the pinchers (thumb and forefinger). Started taking my glutamine (10 grams, 3x per day) again, and added in B12 (5000 mcg). Hoping I can get a grip on this, as it's very discouraging. Wow, what we do for our health! I'm not going to let this get me down, though. I've been laying around this morning, falling asleep from all this Gabpentin. Getting up & taking a good walk with the fluffanutter (Bailey, the Golden Doodle) and maybe the sun will revive my spirits. It's not like me to get discouraged! Love to all of you, and keep fighting!

After a long writing hiatus (so sorry, but I kind of got busy, LOL), I am writing to say that my Onc kept me on Kadcyla after all, with a little lumpectomy thrown in. I've now been on this drug for 1 year. SE's are: neuropathy (manageable with Neurontin/Gabapentin), dry mouth, and some liver enzyme elevation (very normal and Fox Chase Cancer Ctr. monitors this closely). Drug has kept my CA:15-3's at normal levels (below 35, I think is the top of normal). It has also prevented metastasis to any new sites and has kept the previous sites (liver and some lymph nodes) fairly normal. I'm wearing my own hair now and it's come in with a slight curl and is salt and pepper gray and looks pretty doggone good, if I can say so myself. It's a great drug, though my initial breast cancer lump started to grow all on its own (the little rascal) back last summer. Looked like I was gonna move back to chemo and I was less than excited. Thankfully, Onc decided lumpectomy would be sufficient; thus far, thank the Lord, it has been. I'm very encouraged by all these posts on this thread; tried to read all the ones I'd missed between August and now, but gave up on that for now and will go back later to read up on it further. I'm sorry if I discouraged anybody back in August (mostly me!) but I didn't know what was in store for me. Keep up the good fight, ladies!

I fell in July and couldn't regain my balance; in fact, I was \"listing\" to the right and somewhat out of control. Was told to get an MRI, in fact, to go to the ER. Instead, saw my PCP the next morning. He saw my eustacean tubes were clogged up so put ne on Prednisone and gave me a script for an MRI, told me it wasn't STAT but I should have it done. Waited for the day my CT Scan was scheduled (my Keystone so called \"Gold\" plan, which costs us over $2,000/month, charges a $250 copay for either but if you get them done same day, only hits you with one $250 copay) and it turned out that it was a 3-cm. tumor just next to the cerebellum, affecting balance and coordination. I had thought, as did my MO, that the balance difficulty I was having was due to neuropathy. Weird thing is that an MRI is never ordered until you're symptomatic. Well, a fall is a symptom. Had neurosurgery at Temple Univ. Hospital on August 9th, Neurosurgeon said he got it all though it was a five hour procedure followed by almost two weeks in the hospital, and I'm working through rehab issues, including correcting impaired walking and eyesight issues. I am six weeks post op and doing relatively well. I will have radiation just as soon as all swelling is gone. I am not a patient person and I miss driving. Even after some tough chemo battles, I felt generally capable. So, this is a challenge. I am learning some invaluable lessons and trying to learn how to slow down. Not easy. But I've had great support. My husband, who is not the nurse type, has bent over backwards to help me. I don't know how he's doing it. Apart from some wrinkly shirts and indulging a lot in take out, my life is OK. I see that my eyesight is very gradually improving. Saw my MO today and resumed Kadcyla (welcome back, drippy nose and neuropathy!) and she is very optimistic as she notes that my original mets site, the liver, has had its tumor shrink even more. NEuro will monitor the brain issue by MRI's every 2-3 months, followed by zapping with radiation any recurring tumors. Any questions, fire away. This is apparently not uncommon.

The PA looked up some of the less common SE's for Kadcyla today and he agreed that UTI's can be a SE, after finding it in the literature. Denny, I was thrilled when my MO told me no more Decadron. I seem to be rather extra sensitive to it, so she had (for my last THP infusion in December) allowed a reduction on the premeds and postmeds. I had no problems lowering it. There IS that negotiation you can do with some of the MO's (my first one at Fox Chase was not working with me on that, even after the Infusion staff had told me that, since I had been on Taxol for a half a year or so, that I probably was more tolerant of it by that time than we thought - I finally had to be very pushy, even somewhat impolite with her and she is a highly reputable Doc, now at Cleveland Clinic...now that I think about it, I can't believe I fought that hard because I'm not usually like that, but that stuff was making me nuts). The protocols the MO's follow should be tailored to each patient, but that doesn't happen unless you argue for it, I've found. I know those steroids are a blessing, though, so it's difficult to know when you don't really need them. The first infusion I had with Taxotere (July 2014) was without the premeds and boy, did I suffer. They can be very helpful. The PA today thinks I may have had a slight decrease in the tumor size, and certainly no progression. Had another hit of it today, much faster. Tired, but excited and hopeful!

Yesterday, I had my 5th infusion and my ALkaline phosphatase was 131, though it was 134 last time (normal range is 38-126). AST-SGOT was also a tad high, but infusion nurse said it wasn't high enough yet to worry. Since you use \"70\" as a reference point, I assume you're talking about just the AST's? Maybe I need to do some reading on these But there is another support site with Kadcyla discussions about elevated liver enzymes. It is www.her2support.org. Be forewarned: Some of the SE's discussed there are a bit difficult to read. I think it's true that this is a drug that is a huge help, but the emtansine component is very toxic, so we may not all be able to sustain its effects forever ",

I never heard this was one of the SE's to Kadcyla, but looked it up on one of the Kadcyla sites and sure enough, it is. Will use sun block from now on! This is not a serious SE, so I'm glad to only be dealing with this. Best wishes to all you other girls battling on! I'm finding Kadcyla to be very manageable.

I'm not always very tech savvie, but I'll try again. Well, sad to say, the Kadcyla already has stopped working for me! I was so excited about this drug, which had given me very few SE's. Before I explain all that, yes Longtime, my skin became photosensitive while on this drug. I've been on Taxanes for 5 years and never had the photosensitivity before! Of course, I found this out the day or so before I went to the shore for vacation, LOL! But, I had been prescribed a pretty strong cortisone cream for it, and that worked fairly well. My Oncologist says it is remarkable that I've never been photosensitive before this; most chemos cause it. A few weeks ago, I told my son that I thought the lump in my breast was getting bigger and he told me not to worry, that I had always thought my own exams were somewhat subjective. But, by the end of vacation, I was certain the lump had at least doubled in size. Well, yesterday I saw my Oncologist and the lump has tripled since the last time they measured (7 weeks before)! So, it's off for me and on to something else. I'm so disappointed. The \"something else\" will be Doxil combined with Herceptin and Perjeta. I know Herceptin. Perjeta I know as well (don't love its ability to cause intestinal fireworks). I don't know Doxil very well at all except for the initial reading I've done yesterday on it. Onc says that my lymph nodes felt fine but we will get a CT Scan to find out for sure. My CA 15:3 number was very low: 28.3. So, something unusual is happening, and at first glance, it would appear that only the breast tissue is acting up. Onc says she might have me consider seeing the surgeon to remove the lump if that is the case. We will see. I am looking at the cold caps because this would be my 4th hair loss & start over. What I have now (about an inch) looks fine. So, I'm \"packing my bags\" and looking for a new thread. Girls, this IS a great drug. Just not the one for me. Hope to see you here & thon in the future.

Apparently, 3-cm. Isn't huge, but it is too large to hit with localised radiation first. So, they wanted to get all of it, and surgery is the best method. I never felt pain, but was in the ICU overnight, apparently on a lot of opioids. My good gut flora had taken a beating so my lactose intolerance has really gotten worse. I think that I now have a much better sympathy for folks who need rehab; what a pain in the butt! But I have to make myself. Sidewalks are my friend if I have my walker with big wheels (Tom helped me find some on EBay) but it's not my favourite form of exercise. The worst is the diminished convergence, which is the ability for the left and right eyes to work together. If I really want to see, I have to cover my right eye and use just my left. But I know I'll get there. Apparently, HER2 patients have this as a potential outcome. And once it crosses the blood brain barrier, it can morph into a more aggressive cancer type which mine did not. I know that God orchestrates all the events in our lives; while much of this on one hand is scary stuff, we are not in control of these situations. So I appreciate your prayers.

I can go into my portal at FCCC and see a graph of the past year on this drug, and these numbers have stayed relatively the same. If it gets too high, they'll reduce the dose. My breast cancer mets are in the liver and a few lymph nodes; all of these sites are clean now. But since my liver was the place where it was impacted, I will ask them from time to time about these numbers. If the mets are in your liver, drinking is not the best idea right now, but I think a glass of wine is fine, though I can't find any data that suggests it will improve thse liver enzymes. I believe that drinking your 64 ounces of water/day might be the best help. I was told to take B6 by my Onc; I also take B12 (hoping it might help the neuropathy). Ask your Onc the next time what number above the \"normal\" range is too much; they'll probably reassure you that Kadcyla causes this and it's OK at the levels you mention. Also, FCCC is occasionally fussy about the half hour wait, but mostly doesn't follow it. Probably because I've been on it for a year.",

My best wishes and prayers to all those of you who continue on with Kadcylal; it is a great drug. I just started, on 4/16/18, Doxil with Herceptin and Perjeta so I will look to move to that thread. I will check back here from time to time.  Love, Miriam",

      "Content": "May 4, 2016 10:40AM - edited May 4, 2016 10:41AM by MiriamWillits Hello, everyone; Like Sunny (congrats, Sunny!), I am also seeing great results with Kadcyla. Had a CT Scan (unlike Sunny, who had a PET Scan) on 4/26 and it said: * (drumroll) \"significant treatment response\" * \"Liver and lung metastasis are no longer or are barely discernible\" (said \"no longer\" in one section and \"barely\" in another section of the report) Still working the breast lump down...slowly...but it also reduced in size. My Oncologist says I will stay on Kadcyla as long as my body permits. Yes, I've got more CIPN (chemo induced peripheral neuropathy), although it runs a \"cycle\", finally settling down some by the time 3 weeks has passed & it's time for another. Neurontin (Gabapentin) works decently well on that. Yes, I've got joint aches (hands mostly), drippy nose, some fatigue, etc., but I'm managing tolerably well. Very excited. In fact, celebrated with a Sushi lunch last week (you're not supposed to eat sushi while on chemo, LOL!) since I love the stuff. Girls, this may be a tough fight, but it's a blessing to have meds that work on these tumors...at least, until a better one comes along. (Denny, Taxotere was tough on my toenails, too; they're still messed up) Sunny, my Oncologist indicates that once these drugs stop working, you have to ramp up to the next one, and the first one is no longer effective, regardless of the dose. It's crazy. When our bodies are working optimally, we hardly notice and take it for granted. Now, it's good to \"count your blessings\" because it is a tremendous attitude help. I thank God for the 5-1/2 years I've been given since being diagnosed Stage IV back in November 2010. They had little hope since my liver was so bad. And I was quite concerned when my Onc said the Taxotere wasn't really working any more (5 years on Taxanes, and they finally were no longer effective). But I'm liking the Kadcyla. (now I'm thinking about that sushi again & it's going to be lunchtime soon, heh heh)",

Because my sole tumor was not tiny, and it was seemingly unattached to the cerebellum (which was the case, surgery determined), they believed they could surgically get all of it, whereas radiation wouldn't be so precise. Radiation afterward would just be to ensure all seeds would be hit. At least, I believe this is what was said. My daughter took notes, and those are at home (I'm on vacation in the Poconos). The neurosurgeon has my confidence, having performed a couple thousand of these surgeries. Plus, I just really felt good about him after Fox Chase recommended him. I trust these guys. I've been messing around for 7 years, and I shouldn't say \"messing around\" but I am amazed that I'm still here. I am now thinking about dropping meat from my diet. We will see. There are some meats I love (eggs - are they meat?, LOL). Sometimes, it is done with radiation first. I think what probably made mine different is the location and the certainty that they could remove it. The tumor was 1/2 inch from an important area in the brain; much closer, it would have caused hydroencephalepathy. As for me, I am just glad it is out. Took a walk today on a trail, the most distance I've gone, with just my cane for support. It wasn't far but it felt good. So, I hope tokeep increasing the distance. Life is good and I want to treasure each day here. Miriam",

Your success will be ours eventually, we hope. Stay warm!",

But I remembered something my Mom had always emphasized. TAKE LYSINE! When I was young, and might get 1 little itsy bitsy mouth sore, I couldn't take my supplement happy Mom seriously. In pain with nasty mouth sores (the Magic Mouthwash just didn't cut it), I went online to do a little research. Sure enough, there were folks taking 1000 mg twice a day. That's a lot, but I can tell you from experience: it works! I never had one of those suckers again. And so much enjoyed being free from mouth pain. Keep this trick in mind for whenever that happens down the road. Keeping you all in prayer, Miriam",

I'm able to say I used it all during Kadcyla (once I understood what I was experiencing) and it manages it. I have been on the highest dosage (3600 mg/day) and it does cause some forgetfulness. I hope to get off of it now that I'm no longer on Kadcyla.  I've moved to Doxil with Perjeta and Herceptin first. So, far, only a couple of times of mild nausea for which ginger pills worked. (Ginger Rescue, I think they're called). Also, some intestinal drama, but not too bad.  Denny, I never found Kadcyla to be such a messy experience as you did except for the neuropathy. Yes, some runny nose stuff, too. I don't like the sound of what's happening to your feet!  Will try to stay abreast of what's happening here while checking out the Doxil thread.",
