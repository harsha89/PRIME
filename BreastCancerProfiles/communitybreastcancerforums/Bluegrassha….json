I'm midway throughout a 6xTC chemo regime and so have a long time to go before growing any hair back! But I wanted to tell you that advice here cleared up a nasty case of folliculitis that bothered me a lot a few weeks ago. I started to wash my scalp daily with baby shampoo, and rinsed with hydrogen peroxide followed by cream triple antibiotic until the pustules cleared up. Then just the daily shampoo keeps things clear. But here's what I think might be NEW HELPFUL INFO -- I also washed all my new hats and head scarves in Woolite to remove the sizings (the finishes that most new fabrics have). The relief from itching and irritation was almost immediate! I think if I'd done that to begin with, I wouldn't have had nearly the problem in the first place.",
