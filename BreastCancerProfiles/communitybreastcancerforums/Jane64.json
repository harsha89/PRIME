Port is still sore but def manageable. The infusion through the port was easy and glad i had it. I was scared but there was no need. The first treatment is a really long day so be prepared. This is my first post online and reading the other posts have really helped. Im just waiting now for the se to appear. Be strong everyone. I have good days and days i want to cry all day. Oh well enjoy the weekend",

They gave me more benadryl and dexadron and i was good to go. I can tell you that is very scary. Third tx i will be taking prednisone and benadryl the night before tx to see if that helps me. As i write this now there is no sleep for me. Hope i will have minimal se this time as i wish the best for everyone too.",
