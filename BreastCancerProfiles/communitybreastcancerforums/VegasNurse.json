Chemo is very toxic and can interact with many icu drugs. This can make her weaker and more unstable. She is at one of the top hospitals in the country. Trust in the doctors. They are the experts. I am praying for her and your family.",

I am now in a great support group at my local church. There are four ladies out of ten of us who have already lived a decade and more with stage four breast cancer. One of which is a triple negative gal. I am presently in Remission. I'm not going to focus on reoccurrence. I'm living life each day taking time to be thankful. Don't give up hope. Stage four isn't the death sentence it use to be",

I had a wonderful friend who was diagnosed with triple negative bc and refused conventional medicine at stage one. Needless to say she only survived 8 months...it spread that fast on her so called homeopathic treatments. When she was told it spread from head to toe and to almost every organ, she was told it was too late and to far gone. I was diagnosed with a stage four with bone mets in February. Did chemo, now NED. I'm am true believer in modern medicine.",
