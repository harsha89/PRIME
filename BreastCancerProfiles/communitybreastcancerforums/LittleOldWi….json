I guess because I had been a legal sec'y and seen the results of a person having this type of surgery and how badly it turned out (it was a new procedure at that time), she just did not want implants.  But she got one anyway, started leaking - scheduled for surgery in Dec., but mammogram showed susp. area., biopsied, surgery moved up.  Had rotation flap this time from back) on both, she'd doing great...going to see her today.  Is that a little JACK RUSSLE Terrier puppy?  We have a JR and she is SO smart and does so many funny things.  Eats the cat's food.  Wish I had camera Friday, cat eating, she was sitting with her nose about 5\" away from bowl.  Miss Kitty older and higher up on totem pole, so Shorty does not mess with her, even though she is 18 (cat) years old...so I'm sure she in REALLY old in human years.",
