      "Content": "Sep 5, 2017 05:37AM - edited Sep 5, 2017 05:47AM by jenco60 Hi, may name is Jen and I am 57 years young. Oct. 2015 I participated in a Her2+ Trial, had a lumpectomy and then radiation. I would NEVER do such a crazy thing again. I was so sick and could hardly work! ER+, PR-, HER2+ 8/2017 I had a very aggressive reoccurance 6.1 CM tumor in the exact same place as my lumpectomy. My opinion is they did not or were not able to clear the markers with the lumpectomy and it came back with a vengeance. I fired my previous surgeon and oncologist and began seeking out better care. I found it with BayCare Breast Center Clearwater, Florida. Surgeon took 9 lymph nodes; 6 were positive, 3 were negative. I just had a left breast Mastectomy and I feel FANTASTIC. I decided to have the mastectomy first, chemo after if needed. You must take control of your own care and do your research. Seek out other sisters that have had success and failures and learn from them. I lost a boob, but who cares, I was so sick in between the lumpectomy and the mastectomy. I hoped and prayed for better doctors. I finally decided to have a Mastectomy. Many of my friends chose bilateral Mastectomy, I did not because my right breast has NEVER has a lump or any signs of cancer. Also, it would have been a much longer recovery period and I work full time. Make sure your doctor orders an MRI and a Pet Scan before any surgery. The surgeon must see it all or you are in trouble. You will be injected with Nuclear material just before surgery: 4 injections and they do burn and sting but they light up the breast for the surgeon and they are well worth the small amount of pain. No one ever told me about these injections so I thought I would tell you. Best to be prepared for it all. My recovery has been fantastic, you have to wear drainage tubes for a week or so and they are really no big deal. The only pain I have is a bruised feeling under my arm and on my left shoulder muscle. Everything else is just fine. My surgeon Dr. Kathleen Allen from Morton Plant Hospital in Clearwater, Florida was compassionate, well skilled, and always honest. I would send everyone I know to her!! Not sure about the chemo , Previous experience: No more radiation it kills and burns up your skin, be careful of Taxotere and Carboplatin drugs, I still have no hair. discussion to come on 9/12/2017.",

I read on line to use Lanolin (pure). I can not wear a bra and I have to work through all this. I am so mad and frustrated. I am ending my radiation and will not do it again. It is cave man medicine and we have to do better than burning women to cure disease. It is like the doctors don't care, they want to keep burning. Not right!!! I had chemo Her2 treatment previous and lost all my hair and nails. I was sick for 8 months while working full time as a Professor in a College. I am currently getting Herceptin every three weeks IV and it is not making me sick at all. I will continue on the Herceptin. They want me to take Anti estrogen pills as well, not sure if I am going to take these. I don't like menopause and I don't want to go through it again. I want to get back to my womanhood!!!",

I had a 3.5 CM Lump and after all the horrible chemo it was still 2CM. Had it surgically removed. Had 22 horrible radiation treatments, left incredible scar tissue in my breast and I have pain all the time in my left breast. Consider surgery only, consider immuno therapy, get at least two opinions and make sure the doctors don't know each other.  This is a financial soaking! I spent 1.5 million dollars for treatment and tests I never needed. I had NO lymph intrusion at all and it was a waste and danger to my health. I am now working with an MD to get my body back to normal. I have horrible blood results and trying to keep my kidneys working normal.  I would NEVER do chemo or radiation again. ",
