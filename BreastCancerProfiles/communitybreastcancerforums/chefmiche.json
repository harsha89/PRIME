I wish I could get my onc to sign the Accelerated Benefits form, I could use that money!  I know she won't sign it due to me asking her my life expectancy (hoping she would say less than a year, which my form requires her to say) recently and she said \"I know you won't die in one year and maybe not even 2 years, but not sure after that.  I just don't think I can ask her to sign the form knowing she thinks I will live longer than a year or two.  But she did say that before I had progression and had to stop A/A and move to Xeloda this month, maybe she would sign it now, I am chicken though.  My empoyer will terminate me on last day of September of this year and COBRA begins Oct 1st, which will be very expensive.  My onc office knows of a Medicaid program for breast cancer and ovarian cancer patients in treatment, but when he called to see if I qualified for the program, the person he asked said that I was not qualified due to me taking oral chemo and that wasn't the same as iv chemo.  My onc said Xeloda is just as much a chemo as any iv chemo would be so she said she would check into that for me.  I wish there was a person that handed a newly dx patient a list of contact #s for programs and companies, organizations that help either with co-pay assistance, or help with cost of meds, and all the info needed when you have to leave your job.  It has felt like a mystery I  have to solve to find out what to do, luckilly I have this site to refer to where I get most of my info, thanks so much!",

So why wouldn't I want to hear more like them that tried things that actually worked! Personally I don't feel comfortable continuing to go down the chemo path anymore it is just destroying my body w side effects. I applaud these brave women! Also look at chrisbeatcancer.com there is a lot of great info there also! A lot of negative responses here surprised me because I was so happy when I first saw topic and looked further after watching videos.... There is a place in US I would love to try that does a lot of the therapies Shannon did in Mexico. I just can't sit here waiting to die. I hope one day I am sharing my story not to make money or because I like the attention but because I beat an incurable disease and want to help others live too!! We will see where God leads us all.. Thank you for this topic!!!",
