Also have another sister who was diagnosed when she was 38, but is a 22 year survivor and still going strong. We are BRCA - but I am meeting with the genetic team again this week. Apparently, there is a new gene identified they want to test me for. I certainly hope there is something that will spare my daughter from this road! Mammogram never showed my tumor, but with my family history they took the palpable lump seriously from the start and it showed up on the MRI. We treated my first diagnosis very aggressively, and I intend to fight this new diagnosis with all I have. I'm not a big believer in \"catching it early\" at this point. I've been diligent for 27 years, found my tumor myself, and still have mets. Enough with the \"awareness\" campaign, and let's find a cure!!!!",

I start my T/C on April 23rd, so I'm anxiously reading every morsel I can get my hands on. Thank you all so much for sharing your journey! I had BMX with DIEP reconstruction on March 12, with some major, unfortunate complications. So now, I have a BMX and will likely go the TE/implant route following chemo. One of my incisions is not healed 100%, which is why I have to wait a little longer for chemo to begin. I certainly don't want to do chemo, but the waiting is making me crazy! I hate any of us have to be here, but it sure is nice to know we aren't alone!",

Knock on wood....hope I didn't jinx myself by putting that out there!!! I was really tired, but otherwise felt pretty good. So far I have even managed to not get the dreaded rash!!! I really, really suffered with the rash the first treatment so I have been living in dread each day waiting for it to show up. So far, so good and no sign of it. By this time last treatment I was in agony with the rash and terrible diarrhea, but I actually had a really good day today. Went for a three mile walk in this beautiful weather, then did some shopping with my daughter. My doctor told me to use Benadryl cream on the rash, and it did help some, for those of you struggling with it right now. This is what I did differently this time, if it will help anyone: I started taking Prilosec 5 days before treatment, and continued for 5 days after. This helped with the acidy tummy and belching issues. I took 2 senna tablets the day before, day of and day after treatment to ward off the constipation. Worked like a charm, and so far no D train either!! Good grief, I hope this keeps up!! Took Claratin day of and 2 days after Neulasta shot. I'll try all these things again in 2 weeks for the next one and I sure hope I get off as easy again. Melrose, I admire that you still have some hair. I was so afraid of looking like a patchy burn victim, I just went for it. I have worn my wig twice going out to dinner, but otherwise I just wear a hat. When I finally go back to work, I know I will wear it all the time so I am just enjoying the break while I can. I'm sure it will be months and months with the wig after treatment, and I've just gotten used to being bald around the house. I actually go bald when I go for my walks so I can get a little sunshine on my head. :) A lady stopped her car she she saw me the otherday, took off her wig and said \"hey, we have the same haircut!\" Nice to see a little BC solidarity in the neighborhood!! Take care everyone!!",

We plan on making it a family event...my daughter is cutting off the pony tail and then my son is using the clippers. I think I will have him do it with the shortest guard, but not all the way to the scalp. He's in college, and he and all his roommates shave each other's hair. Cheaper than a barber, and now he's experienced! :) He's coming home for dinner tomorrow, so I will just skip the hair washing tomorrow morning and hope the rest lasts until dinner tomorrow! Diane- I loved your grandson's comment about the clown! And I'm envious of the Panama City trip!! I am a sun lover and my MO told me to just be super vigilant about sunscreen. The chemo does make us much more sensitive to the sun.",

I knew I was going to lose it all, and the waiting game was more stresful for me personally. I've been wearing hats, but I do go for a walk every morning bald so my head can get a little sunshine. I think it will look a little better if it isn't so bright white! Hiker, sorry to hear about the digestive issues. It was rough for me for about 6 days, and then I had another 6 days of diarrhea. Miserable....both ways! I am enjoying this week of \"normalcy\" knowing that it is all starting over again next Monday. I am going to take the probiotic advice and see if it helps. Hope things get \"moving\" for you soon! :)",

What an awesome way to spend a weekend before treatment!! :) I am in the infusion chair right now getting #2 of 4. So far, no issues. It interesting to see how some of us get 4 and some 6. My surgerical onc told me to expect 6 treatments, but the MO was comfortable recommending 4. I'm stage 2a grade 3 ER, PR +, HER 2-, and my onco was 19. A big factor for me is having 2 sisters who were diagnosed in their 30's. I'm 44, but it's a pretty scary family history. Especially having ILC that does not show on a mammogram at all....I was ready to throw anything they have to make sure I only have to do this once! I'll have to check my path report when I get home, because the Ki67 doesn't ring a bell. Probably because I had no clue what it is I just skimmed over that part! Here's to hoping for minimal side effect for all this week!! Oh, and Melrose-- welcome to club baldy! I totally agree with you that the hair falling out was much worse that just getting it over with. Frankly, it's bad enough that I have hair from my cat shedding all over the house...I didn't want another mess to clean! I have been wearing hats most of the time, but I do have a couple wigs. I got an awesome one at the cancer center last week that looks so much like my own hair, only better!! Much more volume and it's always styled and pretty looking....not like my real hair! :) I save the wig for when I got out, but I just keep a cotton cap on my head at home.",

Fingers crossed that it stays this way. I know it probably won't, but I can dream! I am very tired today, just sort of napping off and on. I gave myself the Neulasta shot last night at 7, and had taken a Claratin at 3. I felt some pain come and go with that, but again it was manageable. What is not manageable is the cost of the shots! I had them shipped to my home so I would not have to drive an hour each way to the hospital. Biometrics called me last week and said they would ship the shots in a cold pack and my co-pay is $100. Imagine my panic when I finally opened the actual package last night and saw only ONE shot included. I thought there was a mistake or somehow I threw ay the other three shots with the massive packaging they included. Seriously, the box is a one foot cube with ONE little vial of medicine in it! Apparently, they will ship them one at a time the week before my treatment and they are $100 EACH. That was a surprise I could have done without. I just have to remind myself that I am blessed to have this life saving treatment available to me, and the $400 certainly will not spiral me into financial ruin. Just another unexpected bump in the road. Let me go back to being grateful for feeling not so bad today! :) Be well everyone!",

I had a failed DIEP surgery in March, so now I have a nice flat tummy but unfortunately I have a flat chest to match it. I've bought a bunch of tops to camouflage my chest becase I haven't gotten prosthetics or anything, but I don't want to buy clothes because I have no idea how I will end up. I just rock my bald head and flat chest and remind myself that this shall pass. I spend my time shopping for the vacation we will take when all this is done! We decided to take a cruise over New Years to St. Martin and St. Thomas. What better way to ring in 2013 at sea and cancer free!!!!!! I'll have to do some serious shopping for that trip!!",

All that would suck when you're feeling100%, can't imagine how hard it is in the middle of chemo! Very glad to hear you finished your last treatment and now it's all improvement from here. Summer- I'm encouraged that you were able to go to the beach with no problem. We are heading there tomorrow, and I've been worried about the sun. I confess I love nothing more than laying on the beach for hours lost in a book. The ocean really is soul restoring for me, and I'm optimistic that if I go crazy with sunscreen I should still be able to enjoy the weekend in the sun. My sister is bringing an umbrella-- this will be the first time in my life sitting under an umbrella on the beach! Melrose- I still have eyebrows and lashes, but my lashes are thinning a little. I have only had to shave my legs twice in the past 3 weeks, and that is usually a daily chore. That has been the only upside to chemo! I was hoping to not have to shave at all, but at least most of it is gone. Oddly, I appear to have all my arm hair. It is white, so it's hard to tell if it's thinner, but it's definitely still there. All in all, things are going well. Treatment 2 was not bad at all, and I'm glad to be heading in to the holiday weekend feeling strong. Looking forward to the beach this weekend, and then we are taking the kids to DC next weekend for my birthday. Two awesome weekends, then off to treatment three the following Monday. Hope everyone is managing side effects and doing as well as we can. Hugs to all!",

I've kept myself preoccupied with reconstruction plans as a distraction. That's been a full time job, but it has really kept my mind off chemo. Take care everyone!!",

This last one was rough....nothing horrible, but it just wiped me out more than I was prepared for. this heat sure doesn't help; they are calling for it to hit 100 degrees here by mid-week. Odd thing about my hair, I had some serious stubble start to grow back in the last two weeks! Encouraged that regrowth is soon in my future, but I did go ahead and shave the stubble. The right side of my head was baby soft bald, and the right had visible growth. I thought the lopsided look was worse, and I'm hoping for uniform regrowth!!! My eyebrows and eye lashes are still here, but very thin, oddly I have every strand of my arm hair left?!? Good luck to all this week!
