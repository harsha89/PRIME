I read an article in my breast surgeon's office about a 12 year old girl, she is a 26yr survivor. This is the hardest time (limbo), just get as much info as you can. I found that taking a tape recorder really helped, so I could sit down after the blur went away and really listen to what all the doctors said. I always asked if they minded my taping the conversation and never had an objection. My prayers are with your daughter and family.",

I just wanted to tell you that I am having the same feelings you are, I think probably we all do. They don't always do the test (not sure why). I had a breast MRI and a PET scan week before last and they really gave me some relief. Before that every little ach I just knew the cancer had spread there. I feel so much better now that the tests showed no evidence of cancer anywhere else. My second opinion surgeon has been so much more thorough but I know they had to fight to get the insurance to pay for the PET scan. I don't have any family history of bc but lost my sister to lung cancer 2 years ago and another sister almost 17 years ago (not cancer). My mom is 79 and in great health, my grandma lived til she was 96. Where did we get our genes? I am still scared silly and can't decide which way to go, my first thoght is to take both breasts. I feel that would give me the best chances of IT not returning. Looks like we'll be fighting this about the same time. I started a journal and it helps me release things just to write my feelings down, it also will help me remember things. I bought a little hand held recorder to take to the doctors with me, that way after the coma wears off, I can sit down and really listen to what they said.",

Any time the lymph nodes are fighting infection they can get sore. Try to think positive, they won't know until the biopsy. Attitude is half the battle but my prayer is that you won't have to fight it. You won't know survival rates until they find out what type or how advanced it is. The tests and treatments are so much better than they used to be. I just finished all my treatment and it is, I won't say easy but doable. Good luck with everything.",

I just turned 51 and several people have told me they think I look yrs younger and I don't think they're just trying to make me feel better. I make a good GI Jane. I took lots of pics, maybe I'll post some. Good luck to everyone starting this week.",

I know everyone feels differently about their hair but I felt it was the one thing I had control of. I decided when it came out. I just think if people knew how many of us there are it would bring more attention to the cause and cure. I had no idea, what is it 1 in 6 women will get breast cancer in their lifetime. WOW! There was an article in my bs office about a girl being diagnosed at 12 yrs of age. She's a 26yr survivor. This board has taught me a lot about courage and I pray I can show that strength to my children and grandchildren through the remainder of this downhill ride. My grandkids watched my sis die of lung cancer in 2006 and I have to show them the story can have a different ending. My prayers and thoughts are with all the wonderful ladies on this site, especially those starting treatment this week. May God give us strength.",

I would recommend taking a friend or family member. Another thing I found helpful was a small tape recorder. You should ask if they mind your recording but I was able to sit down after appointments with my whole family and really listen to what the drs said without the fear fog. The tapes helped me make sure I heard all the options. I will lift you up in prayer and my God is still in the miracle business.",
