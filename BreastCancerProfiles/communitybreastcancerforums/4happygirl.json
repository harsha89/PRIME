      "Content": "4happygirl wrote: Hi all and thanks in advance for your help... I was originally diagnosed with a .9 cm mass in my left breast, then found 2 smaller masses in different quads. so I will be having a mastectomy with TE in next 2-3 weeks. I had an MRI guided core biopsy so I had small wounds and bruising from that (my booboo breast). When I thought lumpectomy was an option I told my then 6 yr old that there are lumps in my breast and the biopsy is a test that uses a long needle to get some cells out to look at under the microscope to find out if they'll grow too much and make me sick. I also told her that I would have an operation to remove them and would have stitches. So far so good, but now I need to prepare her for mastectomy without using the word cancer. My dad died in 2012 of metastatic disease, primary was prostate cancer. It spread to his bones and brain, not a good death as you can imagine, and my DD knows the cause of his death, that he was very sick for a long time, and that there was nothing that could be done to save him. The only thing that is causing me real fear is the possibility of leaving my DD motherless, and if possible, I would like to get her through this without experiencing that fear as well. I think the anxiety and stress have shut down my brain so ideas from you experienced moms are most appreciated.

Another challenge is that she's very interested in the human body and medical science. When she was 4 she asked for a book on what was inside her body, so I gave her The Human Body, which has transparent overlays of all the systems and the names of each anatomical part of the body. She had me, her father and her babysitter read every word in the book  to her, for a total of 3 complete readings. She's very interested in the problem with Mom's left breast, and wanted to know what tools were used to access the inside of my breast, so I told her about the core biopsy and the MRI. (BTW she cracked me up by asking \"How is your breast today?\" quite seriously every time she greeted me for about a week afterward.) She wanted to know how sutures are performed and what tools are used, so we watched a Harvard Medical School video on YouTube of a doc suturing a shallow flesh wound. And I'm sure I had a lot more aversion to it than she did. So you see my problem: she will want all the details of what will happen in surgery, and there isn't a chance she won't notice that my breast is suddenly missing. But despite her intelligence, she's just a little girl and a sensitive one. So, I have to figure out how to tell her the whole, or mostly the whole, truth without scaring her.",

I've been getting a lot of big hugs lately and warning her that those will not be happening for a while after surgery. Also good to know about the TE size. I'm also smaller breasted and I'm going to do that as well. Fortunately I told her already that because there were so many bad cells in my breast that the doc would have to take most of it away instead of just the lumps so it would look a lot smaller than the other one. I couldn't bring myself to tell her that it would be removed completely.",

My daughter seems to have weathered it pretty well but her acid reflux flared up at the time so I think that was anxiety. Trvlr I think this was her worrying but not saying anything as you suspected. She told her teachers she is sad that my breast has to be taken away, and asks me daily how my breast is doing. It doesn't look completely gone due to the TE. I don't plan to show her my body until the sutures are removed. Agree with all who said \"they take their cues from you\". I think the most helpful thing I was able to do for her was hide my anxiety and be matter of fact and calm about what is happening. She never asked my if I will die, and never seemed to question that the surgery is to prevent me from being sick, and now that the bad cells are gone, I will be well.",

      "Content": "Apr 11, 2017 01:38AM - edited Apr 11, 2017 01:38AM by 4happygirl The one thing no one has mentioned is problems with balance. I had a left mx in 2015 with an immediate TE placed. Long story short, I developed an infection, had the TE removed and replaced 3 months later, then had DIEP in Feb. 2016. Because of the infection, the TE couldn't be expanded much. So, I've seen both sides. I went flat on one side for 4 months and then had a mostly flat tissue expander for 7 months. Before I had the DIEP, my sense of balance was constantly off, unless I was wearing the prosthetic that was designed to weigh the same as my natural breast. When I put it on, I felt an almost audible click in my brain and I would get my balance back. I think my brain would've adjusted to the asymmetry, but only if I never wore a prosthetic, which I wasn't willing to do outside my home. I made my decision to reconstruct before the MX because I wanted to end up with a body that looked and felt as close to my natural body as I could. But, as an athletic, active person, in retrospect I would say that having my natural grace and balance restored was just as important. Finally, I hated the depression under my collarbone, and the ropy tendon under my arm. I live in a hot climate and I am so relieved to feel comfortable in my clothes without needing to completely cover my upper arms, shoulders, and chest. Lastly, I would say that women are correct be hesitant about DIEP surgery. It was debilitating, and I hope I never have to go through anything like that again. I waited to do it until I was 100% certain I wouldn't need radiation (clean margins after MX), I wasn't going to have chemo, and I had recovered strength. It still took every day of 12 weeks for me to recover to the point where I could exercise gently and lift anything heavier than a gallon of milk.",
