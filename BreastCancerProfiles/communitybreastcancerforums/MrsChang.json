For more evidence-based writings, there are the books by Dr. David Servan-Schreiber:  The Anticancer Mind, Not the Last Goodbye.  There's also a talk he gave at UCSF which summarizes what he found out about cancer and nutrition issues:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaDt3AJQ98c He died in 2011, of the brain cancer that had hit him 19 years previously.  He pointed out in his last book that he had taken on a lot of stress, traveling and giving talks about his anticancer ideas.  He hadn't followed his own advice, but he felt he had to do what he did. Anyway, Dr. Servan-Schreiber did what any of us end up doing, which is, researching the possibilities for a cure.  The same thing happened in Dr. Kelley's story, in that he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and he looked up all the information he could find to help himself.  Both wrote books to share their ideas with other people.  It's interesting to observe how there is a struggle about how to deal with cancer.  I'm sure there are charlatans out there, as well as sensible ideas that are so inexpensive that they threaten somebody's turf in the mainstream somewhere.  The story of Dr. Burzynski (sp?) in Texas demonstrates how a certified M.D. was persecuted for many years by the Texas Medical Board, and then he got a lawyer (from San Francisco, I believe) who obtained documents in discovery showing that the people suing Dr. B were also trying to steal his patents.  Oh well.  I understand that today there are ongoing clinical trials on his methods, which I find too complicated to explain even to myself.",

Good luck with your efforts.  I'm also working at finding out ways to help out my conventional medical treatment.",
