I was doing TCHP, did 3 rounds but my 3rd round sent me to the hospital so we since eliminated the Carboplatin and now I have 2 more rounds of THP. After this will be surgery then I will finish up with radiation. For being so unlucky with cancer at such a young age, I actually happen to be extremely fortunate. I am taking a break from work, do not have kids or anyone depending on me. I was able to move to the very best cancer center in the US for treatment, and have been able to fly my closest friends and family to see me so I am almost never alone. The only thing I have to concentrate on is beating this, and though everything else in my life is taken care of the one thing I am really missing is having the connection with others in my position. People that know what I am going through. This week has been exceptionally rough for me depression wise, and I suppose I was hoping to make connections in order to revive my sense of hope. I seem to be continuously having a little pity party for myself. Just one of the things we all have to battle with while we fight this. Anyway, I am sending positive vibes to all of you, particularly anyone feeling extra sad lately. I know how you feel, and its ok for us to feel like this. Today may be sad, but I am hopefully tomorrow I will feel just a tiny bit happier. One day at a time. Its all we can do! Tamira",

I'm still struggling but feeling less sad today. Actually got out the house and went to dinner which was nice. Hugs to you too friend and I hope your week is starting off well! @hopefour - thank you for your message! I actually just booked three of my closest friends to come stay with me around this time after my next round so I am not alone, trapped in a dark place the next time I feel low. I also made a point to get dressed and put on makeup today and that worked wonders for making me feel better about myself/this situation. I mean really, all we can do is take things one day at a time. It's great to finally make connections with my fellow Warrior Queen's :) @diharp - so sorry you have to get chemo :( everything fightergirl said is right and my experience, but I would like to add a few things that I really wish I knew. First, when your hair starts falling out, I would recommend shaving it that Day. I got folliculitis and the pain was awful for about 2 weeks. Then I couldn't get my head shaved because of the inflammation. I really wish I shaved it earlier. Secondly, let people wait on you. Just do it!! The people around you that love you and care about you are more than happy to cook you meals, sleep over, run errands for you, buy you groceries or pj's, books, hats, wigs, pick up your prescriptions for you, you name it! I've even had friends rub anti-itch lotion on my inflamed, balding head just to give me relief. Whatever you need, allow someone to get it for you. Lastly and very importantly, communicate every single side effect with your Onc. It's extremely important. Do not suffer unnecessarily. Also, what you may think is not a big deal - like a rash you get one day might be a huge indicator something in your regiment needs to change. For example, it could be hives which means you're showing signs of being allergic, which means the next time you get chemo you could have a severe allergic reaction. I am not trying to scare you hun, I'm trying to avoid you making my mistakes. Had I followed that same advice, I would have prevented myself a completely unnecessary hospital trip. Buy yourself a nice journal, and write your symptoms down every singleday. Best of luck to you and I hope you kick your cancer's butt!! Tamira",
