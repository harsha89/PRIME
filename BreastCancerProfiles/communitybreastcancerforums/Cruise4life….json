Glad your first sessions are going well...just a word of advice...TAKE IT EASY....you may think you have energy and are doing great and then ZAP...it will hit you hard... There again it will depend on each individual.. From my experience don't try to do too much.  Wait a few days until some of the side effects wear off and then you can walk, run or go to arobics - whatever suits your fancy.  And most will tell you that the worse part of chemo is that it does get WORSE as the sessions increase and you will be more tired towards the end of your regimen.  Just be careful and try not to get any cuts or expose yourselves to any type of bacteria...ie; shopping cart handles, door knobs and the like...there are germs hiding everywhere and you don't want to end up on antibiotics.  Take bacteria wipes with you in your purse and keep your hands as clean as possible.  Best of luck to all who are going in this week for more chemo....",

      "Content": "Mar 26, 2009 10:10AM - edited Mar 26, 2009 10:19AM by Cruise4life Hello Ladies...Just cruising through the site and came upon this thread for Starting Chemo in March.  I want to wish all of you good luck through your chemo process... I started chemo in January and now have only 2 more sessions to go.  I am on CT Cytoxan and Taxotere...3 weeks apart with the following day Nulesta shots ($3k each) and take emends pills for two days after chemo.  My therapy changed after I was on Epirubicin and 5FU...(chemo sessions 1 and 2)and experienced heart palpitations and spent the night in the hospital.  I am so glad that my onco doc realized the effects of Epirubicin and 5FU.  After a month off I will have 5 to 6 weeks of radiation after my last chemo on April 23rd.  Of course everyone has different regimens and chemo therapy...but most are familiar when looking at the postings. You ladies are doing well and your spirit is effident..Keep up with your postive attitudes. As for the HAIR situation...I had my hairdresser come to my home about 21 days after my first chemo and she buzzed off my hair and my hubbies hair.  It was the best thing...I am now completely bald and wear a really cool wig that I get many questions...like....\"where do you get your hair done?\" or \"who does your hair?, I am looking for a great hairdresser!\"  I have no hair anywhere on my body...including my vjay jay...little bit of brow and lashes...what gets me is that I still have NOSE hair...it's nice not having to shave my legs or underarms...LOL At home I wear a hat that I got at Target...its comfortable and easy to slip on when answering the door.  LOL  The best advice anyone has given me and I will pass it on to those of you who are interested....Drink lots of water before and after chemo....eat lots of protein..and don't overdo it and rest.  There are days where you will feel crappy and days where you will think you can run a marathon...be true to yourself and listen to your bodies reactions. Best of luck to all of you....stay strong and keep your positive spirit.... Cindy",

Yes, by all means get a port.  Especially if you have 15 more treatments...It is the best way to get your chemo IVs.  And if you ever have a hospital emergency during your regimen for any reason...they can access it for your IVs.  My DH and I spent some time in Australia...mainly Sydney, Brisbane, and Cairnes ...we love your part of the world.  We bought and ate so many TIM TAMS and even tried the Meat Pies.  Good luck with it...and hope you get a port soon.",

Mom of Boys...YOU ASKED....below...and I responded...  Mom of Boys The only thing that I have tried is Vaseline after every hand washing.  I layer it on and also put Vaseline on my feet and then put socks on...it will help with the cracking of your skin.  Your hands will darken and you will notice your moons on your fingers to get darker.  I have acrylic nails and it still shows through them.. Not bad though... pickle141....Best of luck today..I am holding your cyber hand....and I responded to your PM. Those of you going in this week...KICK CANCERS A$$......",

It helps to think countdown till the end of the treatment...  Hope you all have \"Ports\"....its the best thing... MOUTH SORES...I had a cancer sore the size of Texas on my tongue...and my onco doc gave me a prescription for TRIAMCINOLONE...Acetonide - its a dental paste and the darn thing went away in two days...it was a wonderful relief.  Linda...hope you can continue to work.  I tried it for a week and it was not pleasant - was in the bathroom most of the time and energy level went way down.  In addition, my employees were always coming in with colds and coughs and I didn't want to risk getting sick so I am now out on short term disability.  One other way to count down is to celebrate by buying a new pair of shoes after each treatment....that helps ease the SE agony.  As you can tell buying shoes is my therapy.... \"It's Doable!\".....

You will feel great the same day and then each day after you may notice things happening to you...don't be afraid to let your doc know what SE's you are experiencing.  They can judge what programs/sessions are best and will work the best for you.  Take your Emends...that will help with nausea.  Don't be afraid to ask questions from your onco specialists (doctor and nurses) they are there to help you.  Cpanasci...What is your chemo dose?  Do you not have a standing order for LABs?  If you get the Nulesta shot...they should be monitoring your WBC for sure...ask your onco specialists...  To all the other beautiful ladies...I am going in on Thursday for #5 of 6 and it has been an experience to say the least.  I have had many different SEs and had my therapy changed midstream.  I am currently given CT (Cytoxan and Taxotere) with the Nulesta shot on the next day along with Emends for two days.  I was previously given CE5FU (Cytoxan, Epirubicin and 5FU) on sessions #1 and #2 had heart palpitations and spent the night in the hospital for observation with that said was changed to CT.    I have heard from others who are on Taxotere and they have lost fingernails and toenails.  Mine have not fallen off but have darkened somewhat and my hands peel a few days after the session.   My throat gets dry and burns, taste buds are gone until day 9 after chemo...have had constipation and diarreah at different sessions.  Got a fever and an infection with the last one..so watch and take your temperatures...anything above 100.5 call your onco doc right away.   Buzzing off the hair was the best thing I did...GO ALL THE WAY with it...don't try to keep the hair...HAIR DOES GROWS BACK....and you will be spoiled for not having to shave anywhere...LOL Just know that what they give us is to kill those \"C\" cells and thats what we want as the end result.  IT'S ALL GOOD and we can do this... Best of luck to those of you who are going in next week for the first time....We are all pulling for you.... Hugs... Cindy",
