      "Content": "KGB1985 wrote: My 29 year old wife was diagnosed with Stage 1, Invasive Ductal Carcinoma a few weeks ago.  She had a lumpectomy and a 1.3 cm tumor was removed with clear margins and 4 sentinel nodes were negative for cancer cells.  It was triple positive and a grade 3.  She starts her ACT chemo therapy next week.  The doctor told us she would do 4 treatments of AC every other weeks (8 weeks) and then Taxol every week for 12 weeks (lowering the dose each week).  My first question is does this seem mild, moderate, or severe as far as therapies go for her situation?  And what do you know about ACT's affects on a woman's fertility? Secondly, we do not have children yet and we both really want to.  We had being seeing a fertility specialist for a few months before all of this occurred.  We went through a very fast egg retrieval process but it did not yield a great deal of eggs and only two became 1 day embryos (they are one day old today).  I wish I had asked the oncologist this, but I didn't want to seem more concerned with our future children than my wife's health.   My second question, what type of risk would we run if we delayed chemotherapy for a few months while we worked on fertility issues or even just one month to attempt another retrieval?  How crucial is to start chemo immediately when not spreading had occurred to the nodes, etc?

She starts chemo tomorrow so I'm past the point of asking if should be delayed.  The tumor grew quite a bit from diagnosis to surgery so I feel like it's something we should get started on.  We have one embryo and hope that we'll be able to try again naturally after all of this.  Thanks everyone, this helped alot!",
