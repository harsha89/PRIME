I just want to get started on a plan.",

I did get a bit of good news today. My surgeon was able to get me an earlier appointment with the MO. I'll meet him on the 8th instead of the 14th. Of course in my crazy mind, I keep thinking maybe my MRI came back terrible yesterday and that's why he agreed to see me. Wow, one minute I'm half way fine, then the next I'm in a panic. I'll just keep reading your stories to soothe my soul. Hugs to all!",

      "Content": "fidget wrote: Hi all, I was just diagnosed Aug. 26 with IDC in the right breast. I had a CT scan done Friday and a MRI will take place this afternoon. MY surgeon called yesterday and told me that I am ER-/PR-, HER2+. While he said it is aggressive, he felt the one positive would help because it can be targeted. He said triple negative is the hardest to treat. I guess I'm wondering how something aggressive is easier to treat. Do the ER-/PR- not come into play as much now? Of course I did the wrong thing and Dr. Googled and kept reading that prognosis in my case is not good. Thankfully you ladies are here and I feel better after reading success stories. I realize everyone is different, but all this is so new and confusing. The CT came back okay except for a tiny spot on the adrenal that he said is not really worrisome. After my MRI and insurance clearance for Oncology, they'll set me up with a MO. Surgeon says because of HER+ he feels chemo will come first. I've been reading these boards since the day I found the lump, but find myself re-reading everything all over again when I find that the subject actually pertains to me. Everyday seems like something new. So thank you brave ladies for being the voices of reason that I and so many others desperately need right now.

I had my herceptin infusion last week and when I go home they called and said my enzymes were elevated and I needed a CT scan. Well I did that this morning so I'll let you all know tomorrow what the outcome is. Last week I had a bone scan because of lower back pain that is just at night and first thing upon waking up in the morning. The oncologist said he would be shocked if it was cancer related. Thank goodness the bone scan just showed signs of my crappy discs. All I can think about is him saying it would shock him about my bones, but yet my liver is a different story? I really hate waiting. I've never had pain where I guess my liver is until yesterday after I drank the contrast stuff. Good luck to everyone! ",
