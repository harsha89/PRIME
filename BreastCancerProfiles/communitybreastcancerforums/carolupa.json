What are the chances I won't be able to travel due to side effects. Doc says don't worry, just keep two days gap. What does everyone think? thanks!

Am dieting, exercising etc but it doesn't seem to help. I kind of assumed it was the medicine, but maybe just advancing age and drug induced menopause? Any tips on losing this fat apart from running six hours a day ?  Also I'm not as good at resisting junk food as I used to be. That seems weird since I know how bad it is, but before bc I had more self discipline. Sometimes I feel like I owe myself that chocolate since who knows, I could be dead soon anyway? lol ",
