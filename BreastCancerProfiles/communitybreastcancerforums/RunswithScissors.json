I also had a CT scan and some xrays for the set up procedure.  Today I'm lying there as they're zapping me and I wondered why they don't cover the rest the of your body to protect it?  So I asked the tech, who gave me some spiel about how the beam is so exact these days.  So I asked, \"if it's so safe,  then why do you l have toleave the room?\" She said something about being around it all day every day - and I'm thinking, so there is some residual something...  Then she said the clincher: \"We wear these badges. We never get exposures, unless we forget our badge in the room, that is!\"   UMMMM, that didn't really help me feel any better.  But it did get me thinking - how come patients cumulative exposures are  still not monitored?  (Or, maybe they are and I'm just in some stalled in the past facility?   Do you have a badge?  Would you if they offered it?   I think i'm going to buy one on my own, just to see what I find...   I'd rather die while I'm living than live while I'm dead..

Unfortunately, I've found that most sites that translate med-talk for you  are very vague about the details - they really give an overview and not much more.   How do you know if your tx are considered \"complex\"?   I was amazed when someone wrote that she gets daily CT scans - just in the set up process... Did I misunderstand her?  Nobody told me that!  Is the radition from the scan counted in the dose the doc told me I'd be getting on a daily basis, or in addition to it?      Does anyone have a good info site that gives more than just a cursory description of the process?    I'd rather die while I'm living than live while I'm dead..
