Expect that to mean that I am starting with mets to my left lung after being cancer free since mastectomy in 2001 followed by 6 months of chemo. Am interested in hearing what treatment others are on for lung mets and how effective treatment has been. Needless to say I am devastated and in total panic.  Looking forward to hearing from you.",
