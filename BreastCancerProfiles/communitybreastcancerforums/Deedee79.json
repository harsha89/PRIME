I have been crocheting and I'm beginning to think it's the wrong thing to do. My arm is starting to really hurt and I noticed that I have a little swelling around my elbow. My upper arm hurts when I try to reach for things. The answer must be *stop doing those things\"! I wonder how long it will be before I can crochet again, if ever? Any crocheters or knitters out there? Thanks, Dee Deedee78 Dx 7/2008, IDC, 2cm, Stage II, Grade 3, 0/19 nodes, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

I just have the one incision. Maybe these are'nt sentinel nodes. They were'nt able to get a good reading on my xray. Took 10 pictures. Said the mass I had was blocking the picture. No one has said anything about lymphedema. This is the first I've heard of it. Maybe like so many, my case is different? This sight is interesting and informative.    Deedee PS : the nodes where clear",
