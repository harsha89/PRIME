As I recall, the radiologist sticks a tiny catheter in the duct, then takes a mammogram. There is some pain, but it is tolerable. I ended up having out-patient surgery to remove the duct. Fortunately, it turned out to be a benign papilloma. Maybe you could ask your doctor for some Valium or somthing similar before you have the ductogram. . .",
