I'm happy I did do the ooph, being estrogen positive I knew that having another child was not something that I could do.  It wouldn't have been fair to my daughter or husband, or the new baby.  As much as I want another child, I know I can't.  It would be too selfish. The ooph lets me be on one less drug, and also allows for a little more freedom with the hubby!  ; )",

I would say I'm somewhere in the middle.  My husband is wonderful, supportive, loving,...just plain great.  He has put up with my family and friends constantly coming to visit (we live in the US and I'm originally Canadian).  We are finally at a point where things are somewhat stable and I just don't want to burden him when not necessary.   But I did take the advice, and asked him how much he wants to hear.  Which is pretty much everything.  So that's what I will do.  He would love to be at all my appointments with me, but work and child don't allow for that.  We are about to start some counseling to help with talking about the future.  It's the one thing we don't talk about...and we really need to, especially when we have a small child to plan and care for.  PS - - I too actually enjoy my \"alone\" time during chemo/herceptin.  ; )",

One thing I have started to do is create a list of my girl friends and what they are strongest at (financial, education, fashion, relationships,...) all those things I hope I'm there to give advice to her for, but probably won't be able to,...and all those things she can't go to my husband for.  My plan is to talk to my friends, and then have a letter for my daughter telling her about this wonderful network of women (surrogate Mom's) that are there for her.  It makes me feel better to know that she will have this great group of women to go to and that will hopefully share with her some great stories about me too!  : ) No matter what it is difficult to think about her growing up without me.  It is the one thing that makes me cry at the drop of a hat.",

I have been on Tykerb for about three weeks and met with my Oncologist yesterday.  She didn't see any improvement in the lymph nodes, and actually their might be a new one!  Sooo...we decided to give Tykerb another couple of weeks and then do another scan to check how things are doing.  Then she started talking about what medications we would move to next! I kind of had my heart set on sticking with Tykerb.  I was so hoping that the combo of Tykerb and Herceptin would do me for a few months (or preferably years).  It kind of scares me that I would be moving onto another set of drugs so quickly.   The drugs I have been doing for the last couple of years have allowed me to have a pretty great quality of life (other than exhaustion).  So a couple of questions: - those of you who were/are on Tykerb, how long before it was determined it was working/not working for you? - those of you with small children (under 5), how do you deal with side effects when trying to keep up with a bundle of energy, otherwise known as a small child? - Everyone. I'm at a low point right now, and about to go to a family reunion.  How do I make it through this weekend without breaking down in front of everyone?  Thanks to all.
