I am the oldest of 5 siblings; 4 of us have been diagnosed with cancer. 6/7 of my Aunts have been diagnosed with either breast/ovarian/uterine cancer. My Dad died of colon cancer. You see my diagnosis below. I am grateful to be stage 1, but certainly have had my down days since the initial phone call. Hang in there, read as much as you can, and make the best choices for you.",

I have not been formally diagnosed, but after shoveling exceptionally heavy spring snow, my armpit felt like there was half an orange in it, and my pinkie and ring fingers started tingling. I had no idea what was going on, or why my armpit was so painful, to the point that I could not sleep on the non surgical side because I could not put down my surgical arm. Your many descriptions were very helpful and pushed me to get an appointment to evaluate what was going on. Thank you again!",
