On 9 August I learned that I have breast cancer and on the 21st of August had a lumpectomy in my right breast. I am now stuck with a few choices and need some advise please. I have a choice of chemotherapy and radiation or mastectomy. After learning I have breast cancer I totally rejected my breasts. They are small anyway and had the life sucked out of them whilst breastfeeding...lol.. Had any of you ladies had a double mastectomy and what kind did you choose. My heart is saying a skin save mastectomy vs radiation with 5 year hormone treatment.... I just been to the breast centre today and have to make my choice asap. .. would love to get in touch with other mums that has experienced the same..... thanks...",
