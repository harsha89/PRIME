My doctor had found a lump and gave me a prescription for a mammogram, ultrasound if necessary and a needle biopsy (if necessary). This morning, I had a mammogram followed by the ultrasound. The mammogram and ultrasound could not pick up the lump, so the radiologist told me that I should still see a breast surgeon just to be safe since she could feel the lump as well. I guess she did not feel it was necessary to do a fine needle aspiration of the lump. Is seeing a breast surgeon simply an extra precaution? Should I be worried? I wish I would have asked more questions when I was speaking to the nurse that discharged me. Thanks for any insight. Log in to post a reply",
