I had one to my left breast a little over a week ago, and agree with the person that said there was little or no pain. I just experienced uncomfortableness, and now that the drain has been removed, I am a little sore from the fluid build-up. But other than that, I was amazed at how easy the surgery was. I am pretty tired still, but that's not too bad either. Everyone that sees me is amazed - I think they imagine me a superwoman or something of that sort, but I'm not! I'm just a woman with breast cancer that did what she had to do.",
