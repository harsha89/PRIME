But like I say it only lasted 3 days. The following ones barely effected me at all. Made sure I took all my anti-nausea meds and drank lots of water. I had lots of annoying side effects the following treatments but nowhere near as bad as my first treatment. When I started the \"D\" I didn't feel sick at all.....just unbelieveably tired. I could barely make it up my stairs. That went on for a few weeks after I finished. I am a year out now and I feel pretty much back to normal with about 3 inches of hair. Oh, my hair started falling out after my second treatment and my scalp was really sensitive so I got my sister to shave it all off. One more thing.....stay away from sick people!  Hope this helps.",

I wore ice gloves on my hands during the \"D\" part of my treatment to protect my fingernails. Very uncomfortable but I knew I wouldn't be able to go back to work if my fingers were numb and so on. It worked very well for me. No numbness (neuropathy) or nail loss.  I did however get numbness in my toes and both my big toes and baby toes lost their nails. The reason I mentioned staying away from sick people is because your white blood cell count gets very low on the \"D\". I got a fever and ended up in the hospital in isolation for 6 days. Mind you it was worth it lol. Most peace and rest I got through my whole treatment!",

I don't even know what to say! 2 days after my treatment I felt like I was dying and on my way to hell! After 3 days of that I woke up and felt almost completely normal. It was amazing. I had no idea what to expect....I had come to the conclusion that I would never make it through this. But am now more determined than ever. Not trying to scare anyone but wish someone would have told me that it actually does come to an end. Have gotten used to the idea of losing my hair. Should all be gone just in time for my 52nd. birthday in January.  I have been trying to prepare my young sons for this by sketching pictures of myself bald. They think I look beautiful!! lol Good luck to all.",

(9yrs. and 13yrs) But everyone on here convinced me it would be best to tell them before my hair started falling out and I started looking sick (still not there) but my hair is all gone now. Just had my second chemo 6 days ago. I just tried to explain to them that it was the cure making me look so odd not the illness. I also sketched pictures of myself with no hair before I lost it so they'd have an idea of what I'd look like. When they finally saw me with no hair their eyes kind of widened but they didn't really say much. My youngest son just asked me if it hurt! Good luck to you.",

My lashes came back very full and longer than they were. I have had friends ask me if I'm wearing falsies! I have seen lots of women say they fell out 2 and 3 different times but that didn't happen to me. They came and they stayed! Be patient, it doesn't take long. There is nothing vain about it, I wore eyeliner everyday so it would look like I had eyelashes whether I was going anywhere or not. lol",

To get there I have to drive through a mountain pass. Weather can get pretty nasty up there in the winter months and sometimes they have to close the highway. The  dr. doesn't want to take any chances that I might miss some of my treatments. Wow, all the replies I have received about when to tell my sons about my cancer kind of surprised me! Certainly has me re-thinking. Someone on here mentioned (sorry, can't remember the name, it was on another thread) that before Xmas would be a better time to tell them with a great distraction like Xmas coming. I think maybe I agree with that. Just have to think about it a little more. Thanks ladies. Hi onestep, my sons are 13 and 9 years old. ",

Everyone here seems so informed with what's going on, I really feel in the dark here. Have called my onc. twice in the last 10 days but won't talk to me till he has all my test results back. I know he just wants to be able to give me an accurate and final diagnosis.  One more thing.... I have breast implants, under the muscle so the lumpectomy didn't affect it. I still don't even know if I have to have the implant removed! Anyone else?? Thanks for any replies. Oh and by the way, I hate pink too!",
