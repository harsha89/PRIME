Still no pinkness or fatigue (knock on wood ... lol), but I'm pretty fair skinned and if I go out in the sun I don't so much tan as get rare, medium or well done, so I'm kinda nervous about that. But it is what it is, and worrying won't help. If I get irritation I'll deal with it, and until I do I'm not losing sleep over it. And who knows? I may get lucky and not have to deal with it at all! I love all you strong women here. Together we can beat this! ",

Works well for me. I put them in a snack size zipper bag and carry them to radiation, squeeze out until they are not real drippy and apply before I get dressed. Hope this helps. Lin",

I'm just now starting to get a little pink, and never did have any more fatigue than usual, so I've been really fortunate. Good luck to all, and glad that all of you in Florida came through Irma ok.",

In fact, she said she has had other ladies with painful nipples put a wet green teabag over their nipple inside their bra. I think I'll keep that one in the back of my mind, just in case.

I rarely got sick, and if I did catch a cold or something it cleared up quickly and completely. Until this year, that is, and it has been a real roller coaster ride so far! About 2 weeks before I was diagnosed with ILC, my left foot and ankle became swollen and my ankle began to ache, while the right side was not affected at all and remained normal. I went in to urgent care and they found a blood clot behind my left knee, so I have been taking Elequis for that. The interesting thing is that my regular doctor told me that there is a correlation between cancer and blood clots, so if you have cancer you are more likely to get a clot. I also asked my RO about that and she confirmed that is correct. I had never heard of that before. So now I have one more reason to say CANCER SUCKS! What fascinating things I've learned on this journey! Lin",
