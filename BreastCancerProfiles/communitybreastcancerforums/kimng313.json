My doctor referred me to an ultrasound & they found nothing. She kept saying I'm too young & there is nothing shown in my family history. However, it is still there after almost half a year. My doctor seems to refuse to go any further after seeing the result. I am just really worried. Please tell me if anyone ever had the same thing & let me know your opinion of what to do. Thank you.

Well, it's been worrying me everyday as long as it's still in me ): And yes, I have also told my parents but they still think it's probably nothing. Since almost everyone is telling me that the chances are very very small for my age (the same exact thing my doctor said), then at what age, if it still would be there, should I get a look at it again?",

It's really nice to hear from someone who has so much more to say than just \"you're too young & it's probably nothing\". Thank you so much! :)",
