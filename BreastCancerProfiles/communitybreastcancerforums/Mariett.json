My surgeon said there is no way to do a re excision because she took as much skin as she could and I am stitched really tight as it is. She suggested radiation after chemo because of the close margin. Nothing is ever straight forward in this cancer treatment.

The one part that bothers me is where it says that the invasive carcinoma extends to the superficial margin, spanning 2.2mm. The surgeon was ok about this but would've preferred a bigger margin. I will be getting chemo but she thinks I should get radiation also because of this 2mm margin. I had radiation 12 years ago for dcis so I don't think I can get it again in the same place but she wants me to meet me the radiologist and see what they think. I have my MO appointment next week to discuss treatment so hopefully she will be able to give me a clear plan of action.",

I have been walking alot since my bmx and the chest doesn't feel as tight anymore. I am gonna see if my mo can start chemo sooner then January 9th.
