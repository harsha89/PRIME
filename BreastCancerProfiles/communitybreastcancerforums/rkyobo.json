I'm worried, as I'm at the age my other sisters were diagnosed. I had prophylactic bilateral mastectomy five years ago due to strong immediate family incidence of breast cancer. The surgeon left some breast tissue on the left underarm area, and that is where I am feeling the pain. I noticed a lump about three months ago, and went for an U/S, but they said all was well....just fatty tissue. There was slight tenderness at the time, but now there is pain even when I'm not palpating it. I'm embarrassed to go back for another U/S, but getting worried enough to do it. rkyobo",
