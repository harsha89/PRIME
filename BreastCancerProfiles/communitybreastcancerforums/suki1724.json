I see the breast surgeon next week and I think we're going to talk about genetic testing. Now I can move on for awhile until I start panicking again in the Fall. Thanks for the kind words, it's so great that people here understand.",

Turns out there's an opening tomorrow at noon, which I wasn't expecting! I have some complex cysts in my right breast that they want to look at again. My mom, grandma and maternal aunt all had or have BC. I think that eventually these cysts or whatever they are will go bad. My mother had a cyst that they watched for years and it wound up being her first BC, she is going through the hell of a recurrence 15 years after her first BC diagnosis. Ironically, tomorrow at 3:30 is the meeting with the caterer for my daughter's wedding, and the hospital is pretty close to there, so I'm hoping to be celebrating with my daughter tomorrow when this is over (or over for 6 months at least)!
