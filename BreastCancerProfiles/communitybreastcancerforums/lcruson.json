Everything checked out, just dense tissue. Well two weeks ago I found a rather, what I say large, hard lump on my right breast. And let me say, I have had cyst over the years, simple and complex. I have had to had a couple drained by aspiration. So I know how cyst feel. This is unlike any I have ever felt before. I went today and had another mammogram and ultrasound on my right breast. There is absolutely nothing showing. The technician even felt my lump and stated it was very hard. She left to show the radiologist, she came back and just said that nothing is showing. That it may just be inflamed tissue. To watch it and if it grows that they would get me back in. I am 39 years old with a family history of BC. My mother was diagnosed at the age of 45, and two of her sisters have had BC. I do plan on speaking with my dr about having a breast MRI done. But surely this couldn't just pop up this fast and be this big. I just don't know what to think about it all. Log in to post a reply",

I have been reading so much on here so it's really had me thinking I need to have it checked further. I see that everyone has so many different symptoms, so it's not something to take lightly. Not with my family's history.",

They even mentioned to me that it could just be inflamed tissue....but my lump is rather large...and then around the actual lump the tissue seems thick...idk. And then you start reading things and you get really freaked out....I never knew that having itchy underarms and breast could be a sign....I have been having that for months now. I will be seeing my gyno next week...so hopefully will be able to have the MRI soon. And I hope everything goes well for you too!!",
