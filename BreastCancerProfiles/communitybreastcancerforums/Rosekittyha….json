What they found on the mammogram/ultrasound is a 1 cm dense lump, Birads 4.  On the mammogram you can see it is shaped kind of like the state of NC turned on it's side. I suppose the lump is in the middle, I can't see the lump on the mammogram. Guess it was probably there last April but at that time all I had was a screening not a diagnostic mammogram.  It was even checked in April by a CAD program.  Well, they found it this time, that's a good thing.
