I return to work part-time within 3 weeks. Fortunately I was able to adjust my schedule. I was not permitted to do any transfers or lifting for four to six weeks post-op. A lot depends on what type of work do you perform. The drainage tubes came out within eight days and I was thrilled. By the 6th day the insertion site of the tube was very itchy and uncomfortable.

She continued to minimize cancer and the effects of chemo. I reported this technician to her supervisor and followed up with a letter of complaint to the cancer center. Generally, I find that staff is usually very well trained, compassionate and professional. A few Chemo patients have told me there are times they don't have the energy to report these individuals because they are conserving their energy to deal with the Big D, constipation, nausea, vomiting, severe fatigue, port issues, Etc. I suggested to them if they're not able to report it at that time have a family member or friend report it or follow up at a later date.",
