I felt a small lump under my right arm about a month ago, it's painful and tender to touch. It hasnt gone away so I made an appt w my OB/GYN. She also felt it, said it was probably just the gland or muscle but set up an ultrasound considering I have BC in the family - my great grandmother on maternal side. When she asked the receptionist to make my appt, she said it should be done ''assez vite\" which in French means \"pretty quick\". I'm not sure she knew I understood since we only speak in English as I'm not fluent in French. SO I'm not sure if she didn't want to tell me it's urgent to not have me worry, or if it's only urgent so I don't have to wait a long time. They called one center but the wait was 2 weeks and she didn't like that, so she asked the receptionist to call another center...but the best they could do is set an appt for 10 days from now. I feel pretty fine except for a lot of night sweats in the past 2 months and occassional sensation of fever but not high - around 99F. I also feel the same kind of small little lump now in the top corner of my left breast near my armpit. When I touch it it's the same kind of isolated pain and tenderness. I can't help but be really scared. I try to think it's probably nothing, but the waiting for 10 days until my ultrasound is driving me crazy. Does anybody have any comments/advice about my symptoms...or how to cope with waiting time? Log in to post a reply",
