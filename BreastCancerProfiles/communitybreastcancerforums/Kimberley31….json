I am sorry that your husband won't be a part of that but that is something he will have to deal with in his own terms. Surround yourself with love and positive.  Maybe this will be your \"me\" time.  Find something that maybe just you or you and your children enjoy and DO IT..     Do one of those somethings that \"you would have done but the hubs wouldn't like to do it with you\" type of things.  My prayers go with you",
