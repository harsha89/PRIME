My first concert was in 1980, Little River Band, first under the wire at the Memorial Colosium in Portland, OR. They played at our County Fair this past summer and they were awesome. I love concerts. I miss the days of general admission at $10. Not sure what you all will think of me, but my favorite concert of all time was in September 2015 - Kid Rock for $20. Foreigner was the preshow and they were awesome too. I have seen them many times. I also really enjoyed Kiss in 1997. For all my sisters on the chemo and radiation train. I'm here cheering you on. You're always in my thoughts and prayers!! You are all champions As for Disney World count me in!!! Never been but have been to Disneyland several times. Bucket list item for me and if I got to meet all of you that would make it even better!! Love you ladies! Xoxox",

It had an abscess encapsulated with it causing major fluid build up. It's strange that it took so long to get agrivated. I was checked out this morning at 9:30. I do have a drain tube but I am hardly draining. Hopefully I'll get it removed early in the week. I am amazed how much better I feel. I've never had an infection and didn't realize how sick it really made me. I appreciate all the kind words, thoughts and prayers. I honestly don't know what I'd do without all of you.

Vargadoll you are so cute and amazing. Congrats on completing rads. You do need to slow down a bit and treat yourself to some R and R. Thanks again everyone. I'll keep you posted on my progress. I love reading everyone's stories, all 99 pages of them. Wow we've been through a lot together and we are all stronger together. üíû Love you all! Xoxoxo Lisa",

My PS called yesterday and went over a few more details about my surgery. Risks and other factors.... blah! I am trying to stay positive. I do not have an appointment with my BS after surgery until the 24th. That seems like it will be the longest 20 days of my life waiting on results. Geez cancer is not for the weak! LisbethS - I am sorry to hear you too had to do chemo before your surgery. Yes, do look at the Sizing 101 thread. I discovered it the other day and it is very informative. For me deciding what type of reconstruction or none, has been the most difficult part of this journey. My prayer is that I will not have to do chemo or radiation, but will not know until after surgery. I am still struggling with the fact that I have cancer. Still seems like a nightmare I am going to wake up from and everything will be ok! I have a question for everyone going through this... Have you all had a PET scan before your surgery? My husband thinks I need one but my doctor has not ordered one. Will I have one after surgery? I did have a 3D mamo and a few US's with biopsy's. I just want to make sure I am doing everything I can to kick this cancer in the butt! I know this is a question for my doctor, but thought I would ask all of you too. Thank you for the feedback!

It is great to feel human again. Those in recovery, for me 3 weeks until I felt well enough to leave the house. Got to watch my son wrestle last night and he had the best match of his high school career. I was so happy that I got to be there to watch! It was my first outing and I had bad anxiety. I was greeted by so many and they all lifted my spirits. It is great to live in a small town. I have had so many praying for me and I know God heard their prayers.

I'm sitting in my chair with my feet up for the first time in a couple weeks reading all of your posts. I needed to read each and everyone of them. You are all truly amazing, everyone of you! I am so happy for those of you with great results, sorry for my sisters on the chemo train, those with drains still in, and those facing the tough decisions of what the next treatment step is, if any. Well I am going back in for surgery on the 27th. My right nipple is not taking and my PS is going to remove the scab and wants me to be sedated and in the OR for the procedure. There are four seniarious that could happen. Best case scenario is I have viable skin under my scab and he can do a skin graft and make me a new nipple. Worst case, he has to remove TE, sew me back up and lay my skin flat for 3-4 months letting it heal, then another surgery to start the entire process over again, including skin grafting and nipple building. If I could get all of you to send me some positive vibes and prayers that would be much appreciated. I know many of you are facing much worse decisions and treatments but I wanted to share what I'm going through. I know you all understand.

I'm sending you positive vibes for a good nights sleep. Vicwitch - Having to work a week after surgery may be a bit ambitious. However everyone is different. I am 2 weeks today post op and have not left my house except to see doctors. I did have a double mx with reconstruction so my healing may be more intense then yours. Either way I wish you luck. I put in for 6 weeks of FMLA, returning intermittently for 2 more weeks. My doctor left how much time off I wanted completely up to me. I just opted for what the average time off needed was. I am kinda of working, checking email and replying when I can. I work where I can go in for an hour or two and get done what I can. The hardest part of being off work for me is our office is moving on Monday and I have not been able to help and I am the office manager! Cancer does not have good timing üò¨ Just so you all know all Tillamook products are a staple in this house!

That's awesome. I had to get up and pee all night after surgery. PS said they gave me 4 units of iV during surgery. I peed blue for a good 3-4 days I think. The die injection was not bad for me at all. Just felt like any other shot. Little sting. The epidural they put in my shoulder area was much more uncomfortable for me. But I'm told my pain was lessened tremendously by having this method used. I was off pain pills by day 4 post op. We all have a different story and Everyone's pain tolerance is different. My doctor started me on tomaxifan at my first appointment after diagnosis, November 17. I am premenopausal and hormone positive. I will be on it for at least 5 years. I have not noticed any side effects other than anxiety, depression and my husband would say, a little grumpy. Only before surgery however so I am chalking that all up to the huge amount of stress of being diagnosed, waiting on results, more testing, more waiting on results, then finally surgery. I have really felt nothing since surgery other than the same feelings we all seem to be experiencing together. I thank God for you ladies every day. Knowing I am not alone helps tremendously. üåàüèù Went to PS today. He removed my steri strips and my nipple started to bleed around stitches! That's great, means I have blood flow! Yippee. Still have my lovely drain tubes but they were redressed and I feel much better. I'm going back on Tuesday and I'm positive they will come out then. Now I'm off to enjoy some berry cobbler with some Tillamook vanilla bean ice cream üç® If there's anyone out there with surgery tomorrow and we don't know... We will all be waiting for you on the other side with a cocktail in the cabana. Cheers to the weekend ladies! üçπ",

I love you all so much and have missed the shit out of each and everyone of you üòò Such an emotional roller coaster we are all on. Please know that I have been praying and thinking of everyone of you sweet ladies. Do we have any men? I don't think we do, but I know of 2 guys in my small town that have battled BC! To all of you brave ones that have to continue your journey with rads and chemo, I am here for you and always will be! I am a lucky one, I know. I just have to take tamoxifen for 5-10 years. I am going to ps once a week for fills. I have to say now that most of my swelling has gone done, I can feel my tissue expanders. It is not pleasant and do not like having a foreign object inside me. Now I have the TE shit fairy to deal with every night while trying to sleep. I still am confined to sleeping on my back and it is getting very old. I have back pain that I have never had before. My right nipple is still black, it's a thick scab. Ps thinks it will come around. If not, he said he'd have to start over on that side. He said I am not to worry about my boob, that is his job. My advice to all of you still in recovery from surgery, take it easy, except help, and just concentrate on healing! I got my drain tubes out and felt like a new women. I resumed my normal crazy schedule (why I've been incognito) and it caught up with me. I was sick all day Friday. I am going back to work tomorrow but think I will keep my days short for a few weeks. Today I am going to go to the grocery store for the first real big shopping trip since my surgery. I did run to the store not long ago to grab a few things and had to ask for help getting things off of top shelves. I will make my son or husband come with me today! I'm not much into the super bowl but will cheer on the Falcons for my girls! Xoxoxo Lisa - how many Lisa's are there on here?",

I was very big breasted. He did what he called a reduction pattern on me. I guess I really didn't understand how they did this procedure.

Bring change of underwear, toothbrush, toothpaste, hair brush, chapstick, hand lotion, pad, phone, and charger. That is all I needed. Remember you have to pack out whatever you bring. Make sure you have pillows for your drive home. I was given some by a nurse navigator and a friend who recently had surgery. I also threw a step stool in my husbands truck. It's not high, but I am short and you cannot use your arms to help you up and in. It really helps me get in and out. To all my sisters waiting on results, I'm praying for you! Cheers to clean nodes and margins. PugsMama I love your attitude, you amaze and inspire me. Have a great week ladies. I think tomorrow is the day I will finally get rid of my drain tubes. I have appointments with BS and PS tomorrow. I meet with an oncologist on Wednesday. Xoxoxoxo",

You've got this girl! I got my drain tubes removed today!!! Today my breast surgeon told me she didn't need to see me anymore. We hugged and I have to say I was very teary eyed. She was/is a blessing. I feel so fortunate that she was my surgeon. I also went to plastic surgeon today. He removed my drain tubes and put 50 ccs in each side. I can't really notice a difference. He thinks my nipple that is still black will come along. It's pink around the edges where the stitches are. I get to finally shower tomorrow afternoon! That is huuugge! I will also meet my oncologist tomorrow. I am feeling so much better. I totally understand the dark days, as I have had a few lately. I am thankful to hear I am not alone. Love you ladies. Sweet dreams.... no shit fairies allowed!! Xoxoxo",

I haven't even caught up on your posts but needed to write and ask for your prayers and healing thoughts. I'm going in for surgery again today. I have an infection in my left breast. This is not the breast with my nipple problems. Thank goodness that is healing. I have so much to fill you all in on. Nothing about my reconstruction has gone right. NOTHING! My plastic surgeon is in Italy so his colleague is performing my surgery today. Most likely my TE is coming out and I will have to heal and start the entire process over again. They are keeping me over night to be on iV antibiotics. Yes, I am depressed. I should be thankful I'm alive, but it is very hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I'm happy for all of you that have completed your treatments, exchanges, etc.! You are all rock stars! Even though I haven't been on here in awhile you are all always in my thoughts and prayers. I'll meet you at the cabanas tonight when I'm out of surgery. Thank you for your thoughts and prayers. Love you all üòò Xoxoxo Lisa",

I have really struggled with what is best. Hope you feel better soon! I spent the day cleaning and putting away Christmas decorations. I want to have my house clean and organized before surgery on 4th. I'm praying for us all! Hope everyone has an awesome last week of 2016! Keep your chin up and remember this to shall pass....",

As with any surgery there are compilations that can occur but I do trust her to do what's best for me. My PS showed me lots of photos of his work and I think I can trust him as well.

It sucks we are here, but it's great to have each other. Anxiety has kicked in big time for me! My sister in law had a New Years party that was also doubled as a good bye boobies party for me. I made myself sick with worry over this whole thing. Didn't feel well at all on Saturday. Ended up going and it was a wonderful time (I didn't even drink). I live in a very small town and most of my friends and family are life long friends. They were all there to cheer me on. They made me a \"fuck cancer\" sign out of cupcakes and a huge get well poster that everyone signed. They also all put on pink gloves and took a great group photo with me. A friend also gave me a tshirt that said cancer picked the wrong chick to mess with! Super cute. I did not want all this fanfare but bottom line, I am blessed and feel so loved. We all need support. Yesterday I cleaned most of my house and bought a few needed items. I'm working today and tomorrow packing and moving my office, and cleaning out my car. Keeping busy is good but I have had a major headache for 3 days! Anyone else get headaches on tamoxifen? I'm sure its stress and anxiety. I'm praying and thinking of you all. I will post as soon as I can after surgery and let you all know how I'm doing. I check in at 10 am and surgery is at 1:30 on Wednesday. Everyone stay positive and remember, this too shall pass!! ",

Today I feel like a new woman. I too am in the short club. I say I'm 5.3 but I know I'm really only 5.2! I hope you all have a better recovery than me. I have been very nauseous and just not feeling well. This morning seems better. I have already had a green smoothie and left overs from dinner last night. I am so tired of sleeping on my back. It is sore. I'm hoping today I will be able to take short walks around the house and get my nasty hair washed. My pain seems minimal and I too am starting to itch. I know that's a good sign of healing. My husband has been an amazing nurse. I am so thankful for him. My nipples are looking ok. One is still bright blue like our beautiful water under our bungalows. I am hoping that will turn pink. I go in for pathology results from surgery on Tuesday and an appointment with PS to redress me and see how my nipples are doing. I have been thinking of all of you. Hurray for all of us with positive node results during surgery! I'm praying for you all facing surgery next week. I will be there holding your hand. This may be tmi but my husband said to ask you ladies, are any of you plugged up? I have yet to have a BM since surgery. I have been on so many drugs including stool softeners with no luck. Hoping the green smoothie will help! I'm not uncomfortable but starting to be concerned üò≥ Have a wonderful relaxing Sunday! Lisa Xoxox",

Good news is my breast surgeon called last night and the OncoDx score that was on my original biopsy was for the same tumor (15) so she doesn't think chemo will be necessary!! Whoop whoop happy dance for me. I still have one nipple that is very dark blue. She wants me to call her acupuncturist to see if she can try a blood circulating procedure on me. I say it's worth a try. To those struggling with the first look - I hear ya. I feel like I came off the set of walking dead when I look at myself. However we are healing and at our worst!

They had a pathologist on site to run preliminary results. It did take a week for me to get the final thorough results. They were clean and the margins were clear. One test that I'm aware of to determine if further treatment is needed is the OncoDx score of the tumor. Pray for a low score. Less than 18. Mine was 15. According to my BS at this point the only further treatment I need is taking tamoxifen for at least 5 years. I know I am a lucky one. I meet with an oncologist On Wednesday. Hopefully she will have the same results. I hope this helps. Xo",
