I did have a sentinel node biopsy and they only took two of the sentinel nodes out and none others. Preliminary findings were negative-have to wait for final path report. She did not take any other nodes out? Is that common? I thought they always took the sentinel along with others. Surgeon assured me it is all she needed. I a little nervous that she didn't take more.

Both the breast surgeon and the plastic surgeon have to be there and they had to coordinate their schedules. I was so relieved when my surgery day came. I wasn't even emotional that day. I worried so much before that day that I don't think I had any more worries in me - just relief to get it over with! See if one of your doctors can prescribe something for your anxiety.

If you have reconstruction at the same time of surgery, the two surgeons need to collaborate in order to find a suitable time that fits both of their schedules. I was told that the tumor takes so many years to grow that a few months doesn't make that much difference. I know that is hard to hear at this time but hang tough! You will get through this!

My family is ready to move on but it is very hard for me to. Don't get me wrong - I have many days where I don't think about BC that much but then there are some days when I think of all that I've been through and get really sad.

I did attend a bc support group but felt like I didn't belong there. Hearing the women talk about chemo, etc. made me feel guilty for being there because I did not have to go through any of that. I left the meeting feeling very guilty and sad. Hence, I never went back. I have since found a support group for mastectomy patients and am going to give that one a try. Maybe I will fit in there. I, too, was more nervous about my exchange surgery than the BMX but everything went smoothly and honestly I really didn't have much pain. It was a piece of cake compared to the BMX. I am now four weeks out from my exchange and have to say things are starting to soften up and taking shape. Happy Birthday to you and good luck on Tuesday.",

I just want to offer my opinion that you should think about it and not just suck it up if that's what you really want. And - no you don't sound ridiculous!

My BS said I only needed a lumpectomy but I decided on the BMX. Long story short - my right breast was always the lumpy one and it turns out I got cancer in my left one. I would have driven myself crazy wondering if the lumps I felt were cancer or not so I decided on the BMX for peace of mind. I did not have to do radiation or chemo. I had the oncotype test done and it came back with a score of 11 which is considered low.  I did get two opinions on the chemo thing and one told me I could do if I want and the other one said chemo would not benefit me. I trusted the advice of the 2nd opinion because she specializes in breast cancer oncology. I was then put on tamoxifen for 11 months. Had a hyster/ooph in May and just started on Arimidex July 1st. So far so good. I also don't think the type of surgery you get depends on if you get chemo or not. Hope your oncotype score comes back low and maybe that decision will be made for you. Good luck!",

Everyone thinks because we are early stagers we have nothing to worry about. It is always in the back of our minds. I am hoping that this turns out to be nothing at all!
