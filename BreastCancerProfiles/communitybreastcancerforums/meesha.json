    "Content": "meesha wrote: Hi all, I visited the GYN today for a lumpy area in my left breast.  It's been there about 6 weeks.  It can be tender but not painful unless it's palpated.  The doctor described it as \"chordy\".  She said that it is in an area where there are lots of glands (upper left toward armpit) but then got off into talking about lymph nodes.  I really couldn't follow what she was saying but I think the gyst was that she wasn't sure if it was glandular or lymphatic.  She said that she was \"encouraged\" by the exam but that she wanted to send me for mammogram and ultrasound.  That appt isn't for a week.  Obviously, I'm a little freaked out but mostly trying to read up a little so that I'll know what they're talking about next week, whether the news is good or bad.  I've tried to search for discussions of \"how it felt\" but haven't found too many references to a \"cordy\" lump... Are tumors generally round or can they sometimes feel more oblong?  It's smooth and near the surface, but not visible.  If you palpate it, you can move it back and forth as if there were a rope under the breast tissue.  If I press down on it, it is tender and the pain radiates toward my armpit.  Does this sound familiar to anyone?  I'm 36 with PCOS.  I stopped cycling on my own over a year ago and they've had me taking progesterone for force periods.  Wondering also if this could have anything to do with it?
