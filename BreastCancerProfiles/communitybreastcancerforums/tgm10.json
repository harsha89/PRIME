My GP just left the practice right before this all came up and they left me in the hands of a very new P.A. They referred me to a general surgeon that cannot see me for 2 weeks but not sure that\u2019s the type of doctor I should be going too? And then to a breast center that cannot see me for 3 weeks. I had the mammogram mid December and biopsy 2 weeks ago and just got the results this past Monday. I am very new to the area as I only moved here 2 years ago and have been to a dr 3 times since the move. Any suggestions on what I should do? Thanks Log in to post a reply",

I received very limited information when I picked up my images and report and it doesn't have any of the numbers you mentioned. But I will definitely reach out and get those as they obviously are very important. I am going to reach out to my PA and get the full report as well as asking for an breast cancer specialist, that was one of my major concerns. I will post again, once I have more informaiton. Thanks again for realing me back in, I will breathe for now :) ",
