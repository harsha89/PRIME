I also hate the sharpie marks and tape (I'm afraid I'm going to shower them off!) but I guess I can put up with it.",

I did not need chemo and I'm told that's much more difficult than radiation. I'm six treatments in and so far my breast is just a little sensitive and I'm a bit tired (but I'm having a little difficultly sleeping since I sleep on my side and if I roll too far my breast hurts) My hospital has a number of support services for cancer patients and I am trying to take advantage of as much as I can. I met with someone about stress management and an learning to meditate. I met with a nutritionist and had a lot of my questions about diet answered. I am meeting with a social worker as well. That helps a bit. I start hormonal therapy at the end of August after radiation ends and I'm apprehensive about that as well. Good luck to us all -- just getting through it one day at a time.    ",

I go for my dry run tomorrow and will probably start the treatments on Monday I wasn't worried about radiation aside from the challenges of scheduling it around work. But now that it's here, I am feeling very anxious. I was awake a good part of last night tossing and turning. I just couldn't settle down. And I was teary eyed and feeling like I wanted to cry. Could it be the stress has just built to a tipping point? My lumpectomy was in May and went smoothly, and I won't need chemo, just the radiation and hormone therapy. My care team is amazing and I have a supportive family. I'm not sure what's up with me!",

The fatigue has been worse the last few weeks and my doctor said it will probably continue. A couple of days I had to take a sick day. Other days I barely felt it at all. It could be related to diet or activity level, but I haven't seen a pattern yet. While I'm relieved that the radiation is over I can't say I'm happy -- I still have hormone therapy to deal with and cancer is now a part of my story. Don't get me wrong -- it could have been so much more difficult. But this story isn't over. Just this chapter.",

But I'm also tired, itchy and have a little pain that is not that bad but is really annoying me. My family has been through a lot this year -- we lost three family members in the last year to cancer and one was my 55 year old brother. I got my diagnosis the day after his funeral. So I try to maintain a positive attitude because its just been so much. But there are days -- like today -- when it just gets to me. And as positive as I stay, i still have (had) cancer. I see my medical oncologist at the end of the month about hormonal therapy and I'm also afraid of the side effects , especially because this is for seven years. Hoping your cyst is just a cyst and that you have no side effects from the hormonal therapy. May we all find much peace and joy among the uncertainty, pain and annoyances. ",

My skin is starting to get pinker (I am very fair skinned) and is a little sensitive. I am religious about applying the Lanisohn cream twice a day -- once after treatment and once before bed. I have X's on my back (really more back and sides) because I am face down for my treatment and they help with the alignment. They're just black sharpie and look awful. I have 21 treatment and the last five are boosts. I've seen the doctor once and am told I'll be seeing her once a week just to check in and I'll need blood work once a week as well. Everyone is wonderful, and I get in an out of my treatments fairly quickly. It's just a half hour drive to the hospital, but that amounts to a 90 minute chunk out of my day at least. And I'm working. Best of luck to you and all of us just trying to get through this!",
