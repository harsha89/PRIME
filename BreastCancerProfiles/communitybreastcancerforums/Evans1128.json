I am having so much anxiety. For those of you who read my threads in the past few weeks you know that I have been through the ringer with pancreatitis, gallbladder stones and sludge and elevated liver functions. Dr started me on Xeloda while in the hospital and this was supposes to be my off week but once my levels kept getting higher I pretty much refused to sit for a whole week. Dr says it's to early to see if Xeloda is taking effect and a plus is that it is one one of those meds that can be given with elevated liver functions. I just feel like my body is going through so much. I have been a little jaundice in the eyes. Dr says it's elevated functions. I am praying to God that the Xeloda starts to take effect and turn things around. I will win this fight!!!!

There is a clinical trial that I qualify for now. Name is Cabozantinib. I guess it's a targeted therapy for triple negative. She gave me the option of that which would be monitored in Boston or Xeloda and another chemo which can be monitored by my Onc here at home. I am really scared first of all that this beast may have gotten worse while waiting. Dr in Boston says that the targeted therapy has been effective for many women however what I have researched says it works very well for the bones but no mention about the liver or lungs. I have to say I am more worried about those areas than the bone met. I did sign the consent for the trial and I am due back in Boston next week for repeat bone and CT, and blood work to start the trial. Now I am really scared to have these scans done again. I don't know what to do. They claim they are not focused on the results but that scans have to be updated to qualify for the trial. Urghh. Does not help ease my mind at all. What if things are worse????? What would you ladies do? Chemo or the trial? Dr didn't really suggest one over the other, but did say that I had plenty of chemo options for the future. I am sick of being a sitting duck and just want to see the best possible results. Thank you ladies. I will win this fight!!!!

The reason being that I know them both well enough to know that I would end up supporting them through it which I feel like many people with illnesses have to do with their loved ones. My son is only 11 months and sometimes I don't know of that is better or worse. My boss knows that the cancer is advanced however she does not know specifics. I feel like some of the other women who have posted, I don't want to be on a \"death watch\". My family is large and had a hard time just with my initial diagnosis. We have lost several people to other cancers and one to complications from BC so I am sure everyone has done their homework. When asked about my health and recent scans I simply say that I am \"hanging in there\" which is true. Just taking it one day at a time. I do realize that everyone's situation is different and you want to make sure that your son has supports especially since he has voiced a concern. I think you can have a conversation with him and find out what would make him more comfortable then try and come up with a solution that would work for you both. It is a very personal issue and I understand not wanting everyone to know. Sorry that you have to be here in the first place. ((((((hugs)))))",

Last CT showed two small nodules on lungs and liver.

I refuse to tell my family and friends, I called my mom and completely chickened out and didn't tell her about the lung and liver spots. I just couldn't stand to break her heart. She has been my best cheerleader and hopeful that I will beat this. At the same time I am sure she has done her homework so I know this will completely devastate her too. I'm so weak and drained right now. Emotionally and physically. NP said spots in lungs and liver are small and that I shouldn't have any symptoms from either. It does not soften the blow at all for me though. Just the thought of them being there is awful. I can't help but look at my boy and weep. What a mess I brought him into. I feel like such a bad mother.",

When I first met my Onc I felt really confident that she was going to fight with everything she had. After I gave birth and went into heart failure, I feel like doctors Became scared to touch me. I understood not having any more of the red devil but I still expected them to treat me aggressively. I had to ask for a scan before surgery and that's when the nodes in the chest were found. I think she is very intelligent and wants the best, however she seems to be overwhelmed. I'm really glad that she did refer me to Dana Farber. I have been sitting like a duck for the past month after finding spots on both liver and lungs. I am finally starting a clinical trial at Dana Farber. It took three weeks for them to get me an appt in Boston. I am really starting to freak out. Having more pains and feel like my liver is failing by the minute. I am so scared that they will refuse me treatment after a while although they keep telling me I have plenty of treatments to try. I just had a repeat CT at DF to qualify for the trial yesterday. I terrified to know the results. I feel like things have gotten worse while waiting. I am so sorry to rant on your post. This has been heavy on my mind. I don't know much about second opinions. My Onc referred me. Could you possibly ask yours if they recommend any place? Dana Farber is supposed to be good. Don't know if that is close to you. Whatever you decide I wish you the very best and pray that your next treatment kicks some butt!!!",

Nanian- I spoke with my Onc a few hours ago and it seems Dana Farber may have two clinical trial options. Both pill form which is good I guess. Will likely be heading there next week. I'm still grieving. Blossoms- I am very sorry to hear of your progression. I wish I could wish this beast away for all of us. Prayers and positive thoughts your way. Thank you ladies so much.
