I am now quite red, somewhat sore and itchy.  One thing my nurses did that I haven't seen mentioned much on here was put a surgical dressing over the whole breast after my session yesterday.   They put on cream, then actual dressing strips that were soaked in more cream, then dry dressings on top of those and tucked me into a surgical bra for the day.  I was able to get through the day, even went for a run - by dinner time I was dying to get it off, so showered and just put my usual cream on - while I really got tired of the dressing on there (started to feel too hot and sticky), I do think it helped quite a bit.  I slept much more comfortably and today have just used normal cream routine.  Just an option, if anyone else wants to ask about it.  My techs and nurses have been awesome.  I don't post often, but send daily prayers and good energy for everyone on this journey.  The end - and the happy dance - are indeed in sight!

For those near the beginning, if it helps - I finished all 33 with no skin issues beyond a really bad sunburn effect (and I'm a Norwegian blonde, so very fair) and with no fatigue to speak of at all.   I say this feeling bad for those whose roads I know have been much tougher, but because I want to provide hope in knowing that it can be a very manageable road, too.   In either case, the road is better traveled with friends, and the end does come.  Hang in there!!

Praying for your grandson, GrannyDukes.  I learned after my lumpectomy last week that pathology showed a micromet of .04mm in the sentinel lymph node.  I have requested an oncotype, in the hopes that will help guide treatment, but haven't received it yet.  One onc has vicariously opined that the micromet does not change my node status from negative to positive.  I have my first appointment with my oncologist next Friday, then a second - I was advised to get a second opinion as well by my surgeon - on November 30.  The waiting is driving me crazier than the choices.  Of all my stats, only the node finding would suggest chemo, I think - and perhaps my age, which is 47.  I hope both oncs agree, that the oncotype comes back low,  that waiting isn't a bad choice in and of itself, and that I don't go nuts before treatment can even begin!

I was recently diagnosed with Grade 1 IDC.  I had a lumpectomy Wednesday,  and at the time of surgery, the sentinel node appeared clear.  Pathology today confirmed removal of a 8mm tumor with clear margins, ER/PR +, HER2 -, but also showed a .04 \"micromet\" in the sentinel node.  I was so happy til that last bit - now it has me down and worried about how much more extensive treatment will be, plus the odds of distant mets.  Surgeon said stage 1b.  Will be meeting  with two different oncologists over the next two weeks, but would love to hear encouragement from those of you who have dealt with similar diagnoses.  Thanks!  Julie",

The waiting for the next steps is somewhat nerve-wracking, I'll admit.  The post-surgical pathology found a micromet in my sentinel node, so my treatment plan might not be as straightforward as yours, but the lumpectomy itself - a non-issue!  My one tip:  Have someone bring you a really good, big pot of soup for after you come home - it was the best medicine.
