For me my diagnosis took 5 months of trying to get tests done and results back. I had found a lump that had gone away the year before but had a mamo in June and got the all clear. Then in Sept I found another lump. Thats when I new something was wrong and I had to push to get tests done. Because I had had the mamo in June and it was all clear, the hospital was refusing to do another in Oct. Then it was just constant pushing to get the test and results. I had ILC and it wasn't showing on the mamo ( some results were lost because I had tests done at a lab and then at the hospital,. The hospital would not use the lab results) So I would say if you are not comfortable in waiting get your results now. You never know how long it will take to get the diagnosis. I had to go all through the Christmas holidays in my mind knowing something was very wrong, but didn't want to worry my family for no reason so I told only my mother. Five months was a very long time.",
