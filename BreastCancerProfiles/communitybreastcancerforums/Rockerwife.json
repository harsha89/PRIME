While I was there they gave me Neupogen and that helped bring by counts up. It is so frustrating that we have to end up going to the ER and then get hospitalized for the Oncs to realize we need the shot. I get my second treatment on Wednesday the 29th and I am for sure getting the Neupogen shot. I am a little more apprehensive this time even though I will have the Neupogen because I got so sick so fast. I feel like I need to be hermit, just to stay away from germs. Making me paranoid because I don't want to end up at the hospital again.",

Some nights soak the sheets other nights I just wake up before it soaked through. It is gross and even with 2 fans it continues . It is forcing menopause on our bodies. I was premenopausal before and never had night sweats like this. I was always freezing cold. I did get my period right on schedule during my first round. I doubt it will show this second one",

Can you see it? They decided to keep me over night because they ran three Tropopnin tests and 1/3 had elevated levels that meant possibly something wrong with my heart. The other two were perfect. I am on a heart monitor, had an echo done. I still think it was a reaction to the massive rise in WBC counts from 7 days worth of Neupogen that caused my heart to race and me to get dizzy and lightheaded . I doubt my Onc will buy that. I track everything and I know that after shot four I had heart palpitations . It continued with each shot and then the lightheadness kicked it. Neupogen can cause heart racing in rare cases. I will see what the dr on duty today says about my theory. Oh and the want me to do a treadmill stress test. It is the weekend and they don't do that until Monday . I hope they let me go home and then do out patient for that. I don't wan to stay here until Monday",

My focus is to get rads going and see if I am strong enough and not having heart palpitations, so I can get back to the gym. I am so weak now. I will probably have to start back at 8 lb weights. My gym is circuit training so it is a mix of cardio and strength. Both of which I no longer have the endurance for. I will basically be staring from scratch. Ironically my whole body is staring over.

Only did four because of the reaction last time and the doctor was fine with that. I called the doctors office to see if I can go ahead and use the fifth shot and no one has gotten back to me since yesterday.. I also emailed the doctor yesterday and asked him the same question with no response. So ladies, do you think I should go ahead and use the one extra shot I have left to help raise my neutrophils?

One of my parents that finished treatment for breast cancer two years ago, came in. She is so creative and basically put up all my bulletin boards in less than three hours. She is so creative!

On day one I did an activity in which they got to tell me what they already knew about me. So they knew my son is also in 5th, but in another class and a few other things. Then one student stated, we also know that you always wear that thing on your head. So I said,\" do you know why?\" Jokingly I told them it is a brain warmer. Of course, they all said, \"no it's not.\" We know you went through cancer,but we didn't want to say because we thought it would be mean. They were too funny. One of my boys told me he liked it and that I look like a gypsy especially with my hoop earrings. I said thank you that was the look I was going for. Meanwhile I have no bottom lashes and only a few top ones. About 1/4 of my left eyebrow and maybe 3/4 of my right. My hair is coming in super gray. No more super smooth lady bits. That stuff is growing faster than the hair on my head. All healed up from Rads. I used an organic aloe by Aubrey and medical barrier cream by Epionce. Seemed to really helped. I did get super red and itchy. Also had the stiffness and a rash that KSusuan wrote about. It took 2 weeks to feel better. Good to be back at work and not focusing every second on cancer crap. Just trying to get back to normal. Have a great weekend. Lisa",

So I began teaching at 31. I married my first husband at 29 and divorced him at 42 in 2011. We have one son as I mentioned before and share 50/50 custody. Soon after, I met my current husband. Married him March 2014. We had only been married a year when I got diagnosed. He is my rock, my soulmate, and my best friend. I would not have been able to get through this with out his support.   My Husband's best friend married us. In CA you can deputy commission someone for one day to perform a wedding. He had on clown shoes and at the end gave us clown noses to remind us to always laugh.",

Tomorrow, day after chemo, to get the tattoos. I am starting rads 3 weeks after last chemo. I have 20 sessions with boosts that will just focus to on the incision. Probably because the tumor was so close to the skin. I was pushing to get started because I wanted to be done before school starts. I have to be back Ist week in August and didn't want to drive an hour plus in traffic after school to finish rads. The sex question. Yes I have done it just not as frequently as before chemo or cancer. Too many changes down there. Honestly, my nerves shut down due to chemo and I don't have sensitivity back until around day 12 after chemo. Plus it hurts and it never did. Even with lube. Thank you chemo. I was a nymph always the one attacking DH. Now he gets to be the instigator . I want my sex drive back. Oh yes water retention here and weight gain.

Maybe it has to do with tumor size and whether there was node involvement. I chose to do a lumpectomy after research and surgeon confirmed that lumpectomy + chemo + radiation = mastectomy. Plus I didn't have node involvement. The nurse at my preop kept questioning my choice as she thought it was not aggressive enough. Who knows what the answer to this evil puzzle is? I did receive the highest dose for all four infusions. I think I hit it aggressively ! Seems like even the number of radiation sessions differs too. I start tomorrow July 1st and will get 15 and 5 boosts directly at my incision.",

Today, I have slept on and off for a few hours. As far as the nausea meds, my nurse gave me a triple dose of Zofran at the infusion. I took another 6 hours later for the next day. Then I found I could stretch it out to 10 hrs and then finally 12 hrs. The last Zofran I took was Friday Morn. Never took the Compezine. The Zofran is highly constipating",

My WBC counts started to come up on their own, but not enough so they gave me the neupogen shot on Friday and by Saturday they were at an acceptable level. My fever went down and I wanted to get the heck out of there. I got the shot again Saturday a few hours before they discharged me. When my Onc visited me he said for sure I would be getting the neupogen next cycle . The bone pain is not fun,but didn't last too long. I hope this neutropenia stays away. LBF- I had a sore throat starting around day 4 after chemo and it can be part of the chemo according to all my paperwork . So I just kept rinsing with salt/baking soda.When mine persisted I still thought it's the chemo. Then my fever spiked on day 9 and I knew something was wrong. The ER got me right in when I told them I was on chemo and had a fever. It was fast! Then they did labs and sure enough my WBC was super low and my sore throat was infected.If your not running a fever, then you are probably okay. Go with your gut. Even when I called my Drs the assistant said , \"Oh it sounds like a common cold.\" I told her I don't think so and I am going to the ER. Glad I didn't listen to her.",

Once the infection is at bay the counts will shoot up. They even sent me home with antibiotics. Ksusan- My Onc just basically said I won't give that shot unless you need it. Well, I needed it. Did my pre chemo labs today and all is good. Higher than when I started.. WBC total 8000 and absolute neutophils 7600 yes! I wonder if my Onc will do labs during the Nadir to monitor. Good question for tomorrow. Lbf- I am shedding prickles too. My DH cut it to a number one last weekend and it hurt so bad that this past Sunday I had him take off the guard. ",

Now it is day 9 of TC #2 and I am here again , this time because I have been light headed and have had heart palpitations. Oh and my neutrophils are not low, they are crazy high from the neupogen. Like 23,000 high and not anemic. hemoglobin numbers are good. They drew a lot of blood and my Troponin levels are elevated. That is an enzyme that is released when the heart may have been damaged. Waiting for Echocardigram and more blood work. Did the Neupogen cause this by making my body work so hard or is it the chemo? I hope my heart is not damaged or they find I had a heart attack. I am irritated by this. I was perfectly healthy before cancer decided to come along for the ride uninvited. I worked out 5 days a week and was muscular. Now I am a floppy vegetable that wants to be a beast. I was walking and now can't even do that consistently. Sorry for the vent",

For a few months prior to finding the lump, I would experience intermittent pain when I lifted my left breast to plop it into my bra. When I went for appt prior to surgery the nurse said that the pain was the tumor coming out of the milk duct. Must've been because once I had found the lump the intermitant pain ceased.",

I teach 5th grade and today my principal and I told my class that this Friday, April 3rd is my last day because I start chemo for breast cancer next week. My class took it pretty well and asked a lot of awesome questions which led to a science lesson on cells. One of my more challenging students got really emotional and was crying. It's been tough love with that kid and boy does he have a heart . So from classroom to chemo chair I go knowing that I have made an awesome connection with my students.",

Littleblue- Thank you. They are a special class. Sheshe3- Yes, we have great communication. They are very bright 5th graders. Wow! Kbeee cool hair! SpriteB- I am a teacher and I chose to take the rest of the year off. I had enough sick time to cover. My principal didn't even question my decision. My MO really said it was up to me. I feel as though I won't know how chemo will affect me and in my job in order to take a sick day I need to leave sub plans. I didn't want to risk thinking I would be okay and then finding out that I couldn't make it through the day. I had unexpected complications with the lumpectomy and went back only to have to take the next day off. It was difficult to be there one day and out the next. I want my class to have consistency. Make the decision that is best for you.",
