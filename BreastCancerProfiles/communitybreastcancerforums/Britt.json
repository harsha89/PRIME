Anyway, starting my 33 weeks of rads (or, I prefer to call them, \"zaps\") on Monday, 3/30.  Had the \"simulation\" last Tuesday, where one is scanned in a CT scan and mapped and tattooed (didn't hurt at all - just a quick pinch - looks like little freckles) so they can be sure where they are exactly going to \"zap\" you.  Each session - Monday through Friday for 33 weeks - lasts about 15-20 minutes.  If all goes well, I should complete the zap course on May 13.  I wrote something very funny about this recently and if any of you are interested let me know and I will PM it to you. Then I have an endometrial biopsy scheduled for April Fool's Day (how appropriate) with my new gyno onco. So we shall see. Otherwise, doing ok.  Feeling physically great - staying busy.  No assignments yet, but I am continuing to try each day. The best to ALL of you - my admiration for what you are all going through is enormous! Big hugs, Maria P.S. - in answer to Marshall, I have joined the April 2009 rads group!",

You still look the same!  What gorgeous outfits!  Can't wait for you to post the picture . . .  And, like Janet, people always admire my hair (and thankfully I didn't have to lose it since I didn't need chemo) but was fully prepared to . . . .  even had my wigs ordered, so I do so understand. And I do woefully miss my gel nails.  Since I had all of my nodes taken out in my second surgery, artificial nails are a BIG medical no-no . . . and even professional manicures!!!  So I try to focus on my toenails - pedicures - and try to keep my feet looking as pretty as possible. Alas, valiantly trying to grow my fingernails . . .  but it's hard.  I feel so unfinished without The Full Package - and from the Wonderful World of Rads, where I am currently residing, must share that one cannot shave the underarm of the treated area AT ALL during the radiation time period - so there go my beloved tank tops and sleeveless dresses (and it's getting hot down here in FL!) for the time being . . . . well, it's still numb anyway although the arm mobility is really doing very well.  And another thing:  according to my own rads onco, can never sunbathe again.  Adios careless days on the beach without being mummified. Enough of this vanity!  But we are all women and vanity is nothing to be ashamed of . . . . as I have always said, this is all temporary.  Hair will grow back, underarm will be shaved once again, and one's nails will grow again - all after chemo and rads . . . health will trump vanity every time. Now dealing with possible side effects of Tamox, which I am slated to be going on at the conclusion of radiation (second week of May) . . . So that's it . . . . Time for a glass of Cabernet Savignon . . . . Everyone have a great holiday weekend!  Maria",

Here is what I believe:  this board should represent acceptance, tolerance, caring and concern for and of each other.  One should not be hesitant to express oneself.  Everyone does not agree with everyone else concerning certain matters.  That is where tolerance comes in. We are all in this together with the common bond of breast cancer. Christian, Catholic, Jew, agnostic, animist, athiest . . . . let us all respect each other's beliefs.  Let us not be afraid to express them with respect for others who may not agree.  And if one does not agree, do so respectfully.   Or say nothing at all.  Or just ignore that particular individual and focus on issues that are far more important - dealing with The Ailment, as I now refer to it. To quote Abraham Lincoln, \"A divided house cannot stand.\" (okay, that's a paraphrase or a partial quote - have to hunt for my Bartlett's!) Let's be mature women . . . there is no need for such major dissension among The Warrior Princesses . . . patience, tolerance, understanding, caring, and concern. That is The Mantra. Stick together, Princesses. With the greatest respect and love to all on this Easter Weekend, Maria",

However, here is a question:  my BS did not meet with me after my surgery.  She did speak with my mother who accompanied me on Friday for the surgery and told her that so far the nodes looked clear, no drain, and that she had to take out more tissue than anticipated to get clear margins.  So far, so good. My printed post-op instructions stated to remove the dressing on the second day after surgery and take a shower, and not to remove the steri-strips.  Since I am wearing an Ace and have no idea what kind of dressings I have beneath it, I called my BS's office this morning and asked for the nurse,  The receptionist told me she was busy with patients,but did schedule my post-op exam for this Friday, 1/23.  I told the receptionist that I needed to know whether or not to take the Ace off today - and if so, how to address the dressings beneath the Ace.  I still feel a little dizzy and really not up to taking a shower!  Also, BS did say she \"fixed\" the left breast that had suffered from the MRI guided biopsy that had a stuck artery that kept bleeding.  I want to know how she \"fixed\" it and whether I need to keep steri-strips on that, also. (my lumpo and SNB were on right breast) Must admit it is still tender and sore under the right armpit where the SNB was taken out - but I also want to know how many nodes were taken out and the results of my path report, if ready. Has anyone else been through something similar?",

What an experience you had!  I am seriously considering getting a second opinion myself.  Similar thing happened with me - was told after my lump and SNB that margins were clear and no node involvement as far as BS could tell.  Then the path report said tiny micromets found in SNB - the other node taken out was clear.  BS gave me the option at the time for ALND but said it was not really necessary since the cancer was so teeny.  So here I go, merrily on my way, healing very nicely, great mobility in my arm, etc.  Made appts with rad and med oncos for next week.  Then the phone call today.  You know how I felt - it was an out of body experience - but I did express my anger at the path department.  What I am afraid of is that they may have misdiagnosed the other node, also - since they are SO gung-ho about the ALND - apparently not giving me a choice this time.  But I am speaking with my BS tomorrow and will discuss pros and cons and also tell her I am not happy with the path department and want a second opinion.  That's it.  Your experience has helped me to make my decision!  Thanks so much!

Oh well, back to looking at post-ALND bras!  Any suggestions? Have a great weekend and thanks again - and it is also inspiring  that you had little difficulty with chemo. ",

So - one week after surgery, 2/17 (if drains are out) med onco scheduled me for a bone scan, CT scan and echocardiogram at the hospital.  I then meet with med onco on 2/23 to discuss results and appropriate chemo cocktail - which will depend upon whether any other nodes are found to be positive and of course results of the scans.  I must admit I always sensed that I would need chemo, but the reality of it all was quite daunting.  Checking out wigs, etc. since med onco said I will most likely lose my hair. I am not a candidate for \"chemo lite\" since my tumor was 2.3 cm, margins to the chest wall, and node involvement. Will most likely start chemo first or second week of March - which is why I started a March 2009 chemo thread - no responses yet! So there it is.  Any input would be appreciated.  Thank you all so much again for concern, advice, suggestions, and sharing of similar experiences. Maria",

Called the gyno last Friday and results are not yet in. What I am asking about is if anyone else has ever had this procedure done prior to taking Tamoxifen.  My last period was on 4/11.  However, lo and behold, I started my period this Friday, 5/1 - very heavy bleeding and horrendous cramps.  This is not unusual for me - I usually experience periods of this virulence every three months.  I bled very slightly right after the biopsy for several hours and then it stopped. I am wondering if the biopsy itself brought on an early period.  Luckily today, the bleeding is beginning to dissipate and so are the cramps.  But I am still concerned. I did not have to have chemo due to low Oncotype score and am presently in the midst of radiation treatments - completed 19 to date.  Thanks for any input any of you may have.  Britt/Xena the Warrior Princess Dx 11/24/2008, IDC, 2cm, Stage IIB, Grade 2, 1/11 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
