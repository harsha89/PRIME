I do not have notable redness. In the last 3 weeks I have had the following symptoms in my left breast: Breast Pain/ Achiness. sometimes worse than others but never goes away completely. The pain can be intense enough to wake me up from sleeping Pain in my shoulder blade- seems to radiate around to my armpit and side of left breast Some swelling and a full feeling in breast Very faint bruise about the size of a quarter on the side of my breast- radiologist thought it might just be skin discoloration... Extreme itchiness (on and off)- feels like its coming from inside and I can't get relief Nipple pain and tenderness I have had a mammogram and US, Both came back normal and an MRI was suggested due to my family history. Mom had breast cancer as did her sister, my aunt. Father had colon cancer, and my brother had testicular cancer at 28, I do not want to overreact, but they have scheduled my MRI for almost a month out so I could be done with my cycle. Everyone seems to not be in a hurry and of course I got the 'breast cancer doesn't hurt' speech. From what i have read quick diagnosis is key to a better recovery. Can any of you tell me if you had similar situations and if I should contact a breast surgeon or advice of any steps you would take ? Log in to post a reply",
