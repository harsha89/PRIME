Fast forward I got sick and had to go to er and the dr not looking at my chart does a pregnancy test on me! the crazy part is it was positive! Imagine mine and my hubbys reaction. We told the doc tHere was no way he seemed to be concerned. He mentioned possible malignant tumor and I needed to see my pcp asap. So I did of course he ran his own blood test again Hcg positive 6.0 8 was a 5.0 in the er. I was shocked! Then he ran another 1 week ago 7.0 it's going up. I noticed a pea size lump in left breast along with swollen lymph node. My pcp said we needed get a ultrasound done and transvaginal. So Thursday I got them both of course t was confirmed no fetus and no parts. The tech did my breast ultrasound she seemed New at It. I honestly don't think she scanned the areas right. I left there thinking ok God something has got to show. Got the call Friday all clear. I was shocked I thought something would have showed. Meanwhile I have every symptom of pregnancy with no baby! Doc doing ct of chest abdomen and pelvis. My left breast is tender hurts in my arm and shoulder. I'm 33 do y'all think I just need to see a breast specialist. My gyno didn't want to fool with the hcg! I have a bad feeling something ain't right. y lymph nodes have been swollen for over a year. I'm very tired exhausted even . I do believe I have some kind if weird red sore on my right breast. My body should not be throwing HCG and it should bot be going up! My PCP is stumped. Have any of y'all heard of a hg beta tumor? n breast cancer be HCG positive? My pcp says they are agressive and can hide! High chance of malignancy.My mind is just reeling. I thought that the lymph node would show on the US and the lump too. Any advice is much appreciated. Log in to post a reply",
