I don't fully understand all of this.  I did agree to a lumpectomy followed by 5-7 weeks of radiation.  Most likely will be on hormone therapy.  To be determined after final path report.  Drs. said this is all very good, positive info.  Is it??  Please share any information you may have for me.  Thanks in advance.
