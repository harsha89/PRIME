At my six-month check-up with my onc. this week, I mentioned this and that I had spent the past month worrying about what a low white blood cell count meant. My onc told me that I was a little low (3.8-ish as compared to a normal 4.0  or above, I think, but don't quote me completely), but it was nothing to be concerned about and that a lot of times, wbc counts take a long time to recover and some never do. I should note that after every round of TAC (which I had six of), I was neutropenic, so chemo totally wiped me out. But, you know, still... Has anyone out there had/have this and/or heard about it? I finished chemo two years ago this month. BTW - as a side note, I didn't think I'd get a Zometa infusion this time due to the recent stuff out there about it (I've had two infusions already), but onc. said that there's still a benefit for post-menopausal women (I went into chemopause, but also had my ovaries out last year), and that we would continue. Just thought I'd share that because I know many of us were/are wondering what the deal was.  Please chime in about the white blood cell count issue.

I wish I found all of you when I was first diagnosed, instead I found a lot of depressing info that scared me away from connecting with anyone. All's well that ends well though! KerryMac, I often identify with you. PureE, you've come a long way since your initial postings. Bugs, and all those out there who are a few years out, I hope you know how much inspiration you offer to newbies (that and those awesome Survivor Stories that I read at least once a week!) Myself, well, you can see my stats in my signature. I was diagnosed after my mom (an 11-year, stage 4 ovarian cancer and 2-year breast cancer survivor) and I both tested positive for the BRCA gene - and the story there is strange enough that I think it was serendipitous. Anyway, it's been a long journey so far, but I feel fortunate that I'm here, that the awesome APRN at my OB-GYN took me and the BRCA finding seriously and pushed for an MRI when both a mammogram and ultrasound found nothing, that the cancer was actually found, and that I emerged relatively unscathed from treatment. I have my challenges like everyone else, but I'm turning 40 next week and I'm all about turning over new leaves. SO, hi ladies. It's nice to meet all of you.
