Anyway, I am going in to discuss this all with my oncologist, and I am wondering, again, if I should consult other surgeons, too.  Although, I do know that the surgeon is unable to see the cancer/tumor during surgery, I just find it very frustrating that here I am, two lumpectomies in April, and they still did not get all of the cancer Good luck to everyone who has surgeries coming up!  This is such a helpful group. ~Renee",

I agree....  I am not going to burn any bridges just yet (I have been pondering this all tonight), I think the best thing to do is have the current surgeon go back in there and clean up the area.  The nurse navigator wasn't sure if a second surgeon would want to take over the surgery at this point, but she did say that if I wanted to consult another surgeon that she would help me do so.  But, I think I may as well stick with my current surgeon, get the second surgery over and done with... and then I can move on. Starting today, I have had much increased pain, I hope it is not infected... it doesn't look infected, although of course the area in and around is red and bruised, but no streaks and the incision itself doesn't seem to be reddened.... but the pain is starting to get much worse, glad I am actually going in to see the surgeon tomorrow, even if he is sort of a jerk now and then.  I have been needing to take more pain meds for the discomfort, and now I have been experiencing some short quick stabbing pains, and the pain has spread.  I am a week out from lumpectomy, really had almost no pain or discomfort at all, until the last day or two.  Like Roseanne Roseanna Danna says, \"It's always something\".    LOL. ~Renee",

The surgeon, however, wants to do the surgery next week (he doesn't want to wait a week after that, until I feel better and get my strength back, I tend to get weak and fatigued with my colitis flare-ups).  I guess I am wondering, this surgeon just seems to rush things, doesn't take into consideration my other health issues, and he has not gotten oncology involved yet at all (I have not seen an oncologist yet).  None of this seems good to me, so now I am wondering if I want to proceed with this surgeon for the second surgery... also, I took it upon myself to make an appointment with an oncologist (I did discuss this with my family doctor and he was in agreement with me), but this oncologist is at another clinic (this is an oncologist my mother had seen, so I know this oncologist and I am comfortable with him),since the surgeon was not talking to me at all about an oncologist, I decided to go ahead on my own.  At what point does the surgeon get oncology involved?  I have to say, I am not comfortable with this surgeon at all, and wonder if going to a new surgeon at this time would be better, or would be a bit of a mess since I am sort of right in the middle of things at present.   Hope that all made sense... it's been a bad day here... this surgeon is arrogant and doesn't seem too inclined to even read my medical record to know that I have had problems with colitis all of my life.  And, not having oncology involved yet is worrisome to me.  I am used to having doctors talking and consulting with one another for other procedures.  Makes no sense to me why he does not have oncology involved.

I am not sure I want radiation, and if this test could shed dome more light on everything, I want to have this test done.  I am looking forward to meeting with the oncologist next week (at the other clinic, where I plan to transfer my medical care).",

I am ER positive, so I have lots to consider. Unsure if tamoxifen is the way to go, as I am 60 and postmenopausal, aromatase therapy was mentioned by one of the oncology nurses I spoke with on the phone.   I do have a large choice of surgeons here, so if tomorrow doesn't go any better, I will most definitely search for another surgeon for the second surgery.... really makes no sense why this current surgeon is in such a rush, and having such a fit when I told him I wanted to at least wait until the end of this month.  Tomorrow should be an interesting day.  If he is as nasty as he was to me on the phone, I may just get up and walk out.  I will also make another appointment to discuss all of this with my family doctor, he's been really great and he knows me very well.  It is going to be a rather unusual way of doing things, in my case... because my family doctor is at one major clinic, and the oncologist that I like and will be seeing, is with the \"other\" clinic in town.  My family doctor already knows of this, and was wonderful about it, stating that he knew this oncologist well, and he thought it was a good choice for me. Thank you for all of the advice and letting me know your experiences... I read thru each and every one's posts here... it has been very helpful to me.  This forum is  so wonderful!!  So glad I found this place. ~Renee",

For sure I am going to get another opinion (I had actually made an appointment to do so many weeks ago, but it is taking awhile to get in)..  I just do not like this surgeon's attitude even after yesterday's appointment, and I spoke with him again today because I noticed he had stated some false comments on my last progress/office visit note... I felt it was bad enough that it warranted a discussion with him (he stated that I \"demanded\" genetic testing, he basically made me sound like I was a jerk about it... but what actually occured was that I had just asked him about it and said I was interested in learning more, I never demanded anything...this just only shows he truly does not listen to me at all).  This surgeon is still in a rush, still wants me to cancel and reschedule my oncologist visit (even after he knows how I feel about it all), and basically he is still just unpleasant and talks AT me rather than talks WITH me.....  So, yes, most definitely I will seek a second opinion.  It's just taking awhile to get in to see that other doc for the second opinion. Thank you for the information regarding the genetic testing... this is all so new to me.  I had hoped to avoid radiation therapy, I'm concerned about my heart issues in relation to the radiation.  I have quite a lot to discuss with the oncologist next week.  I did recently find out that the tumor was fairly large... 5.5 cm... so perhaps that in and of itself would disqualify me from genetic testing. Right now, it looks like I will be having radiation, as well as hormone therapy (I am ER/PR-positive).  I plan to talk to the oncologist next week about the problems I am having with this surgeon, and that I would like a referral to another surgeon. I still have so much to learn about all of this.  I used to work as a Medical Coder/Abstractor, and have some background in ultrasound as well, so I have some background in healthcare, but I really do not know a thing about breast cancer...  I am trying to learn all I can so I can make good decisions.  The big question is.... will another surgeon want to do a re-excision of another surgeon's previous mess....  I'll find that out.

I have had almost no pain at all.  Someone had mentioned that they were nervous because they live alone.  I want to let them know that I also live alone, and I know it can be pretty scary while you wait for your surgery to come up.  My imagination was far worse than the surgery was.  I made sure I had everything I needed here at home, stocked up on easy food (just pop it into the oven or microwave) and laundry done and supplies ready to go.  I felt good enough that I came home same day as my mastectomy (no reconstruction).  I do make sure that I stay on a pain med schedule, I found this to be very helpful, and I write down when I take my pain meds and I take them round the clock. If you stay on top of it, it doesn't get bad at all.  The drain has not been a problem, I make sure I have it taped securely. So, actually, living alone and going thru this surgery was not as scary as I thought it would be, I had rides pre-arranged if I needed rides (medical van service), and made sure I had my groceries and supplies that I needed.  Found out that having a hand-held showerhead is very helpful, since my surgeon did not want me to get the drain wet, so I have been able to shower easily with the hand-held shower I have here.",

I had my drain out yesterday (there was only one), I had it out a little early as it was getting beyond sore and painful, and there was not much output any more, so the surgeon on call was nice and removed it for me.  Otherwise I am feeling pretty good, just 5 days out from my mastectomy.  The sharp burning jabs I was getting in the shoulder blade area, near the lymph node site, have let up, so maybe they will continue to go away and not be a bother.  Doing better than I had thought I would, but still taking it easy and still take the pain meds on a regular basis (without the pain meds I am still a bit too uncomortable). Glad you are doing well marilynllli, your doctors and team of nurses sound wonderful, that makes such a huge difference. MrsWinnie, your party sounds fabulous, staying busy helped me too. I have so many questions for the surgeon... I am obviously very relieved no cancer was found after my mastectomy... but I find it very odd that after two previous lumpectomies just a few months ago, both which showed extensive cancer at the margins, and the first surgeon I had was very pushy and real rude and was very aggressive about me having this mastectomy \"as soon as possible\" and even got mad at me when I was too sick to have the mastectomy and had to cancel.... I then switched surgeons....  And, now, after the mastectomy I am told no cancer was found, at all, anywere.... How can that be with the last lumpectomy showing extensive cancer, a \"larger tumor than we thought\" and cancer well into the margins...  I expected some cancer to be found, due to the extensive cancer that they said I had after the last lumpectomy. I have so many questions for my upcoming appointment next week... Sending healing vibes to everyone who has sugery coming up.   ~Renee",

I had hoped to post on here more often after I joined earlier this year, but had some other health issues popped up this summer and the fatigue from that laid me up for awhile.  Previous to my cancer diagnosis earlier this year, I was recovering from a mild heart attack with stent placement (when it rains it pours).  I am doing better now. I am postop day three, had a simple mastectomy on the 15th, with lymph node biopsy.  The procedure to map the lymph nodes went very well (I was so nervous about it), they numbed the area with lidocaine, and then only did one injection, I was so relieved. I was in and out it seemed, and all went well, what a relief, and I went home same day (my preference, the surgeon did ask if I wanted to stay, I wanted to go home).  I'd had two previous lumpectomies, but the margins were still very very close on last lumpectomy, and the tumor was quite large, so we went ahead with the mastectomy (no reconstruction).  I do have a question... I was surprised to learn today that there was absolutely no cancer present in the breast, I am very happy and relieved, but after two lumpectomies with so much extensive cancer and margins so close, I expected there to be some cancer found.  Does anyone know if this is normal, or that it does happen?  It seems odd to me that I go from having a very large tumor, with cancer on the margins of the last lumpectomy, and now no cancer was found at all in the breast (or maybe I am just being paranoid, as I had to switch surgeons after the lumpectomies after some very bad experiences with the first surgeon, so now I will admit I am suspicious).  I am very glad no cancer was found, but it doesn't make much sense to me.... to go from extensive cancer, in the margins, to none at all now after mastectomy.  I hope I make sense.  I had no pain untl day two, after the surgery... and now I am experiencing the most intense burning stabbing pain around the lymph node biopsy site, it goes back to my shoulder blade and armpit, very intense and makes you drop everything you are doing.  I have read that this can occur, my other question is, is there anything that can be done to help control the pain.... lidoderm patches or lidocaine cream?  I do take an oral pain med, and that does help, but this intense burning and shooting pain is pretty bad at times.  I have read that this may be caused from the nerves? Appreciate any suggestions or advice.  I did mention it to my surgeon this morning, and was real disappointed when he acted as if he did not know anything about this sort of thing, he looked at me and actually shrugged his shoulders.  Sort of floored me, as he is quite a well known and respected surgeon here in my area, and very up on breast cancer. It was not the response I expected, and I do plan to discuss it more with him next week at my next appointment. Thanks for reading my post, I wish everyone a speedy recovery,   Renee",

This forum has helped me to become better educated about this awful disease, and about the procedures involved.   Tomorrow is the Big Day.  After two lumpectomies I am having a unilateral mastectomy tomorrow (June 16th), no reconstruction, I am not overly worried about the mastectomy (well, OK, I am), but I am scared to death about the SNB, so very worried about the pain.  My surgeon has told me I will have 5 injections of the radioactive dye, WITHOUT lidocaine.  The procedure sounds bad enough, but after two lumpectomies (April 2017) I am still quite sore and sensitive in that breast, and so I cannot imagine having 5 needles inserted and then the dye injected.  I have put in a call to the nuclear medicine department this morning, at the hospital where my surgery is scheduled, to get more information as to how they perform the procedure, but most of all I am going to request that lidocaine be used.  I was shocked when I was told (by my surgeon yesterday) that they will not use lidocaine for this, my surgeon was adamant that no lidocaine would be used even when I mentioned that I would like to have lidocaine, so now my surgeon has suggested I could have Versed if i wanted (and I know that will not help me much at all, as Versed does not do much for me unless I am given enough to put me out). Is it common that they do not use lidocaine?  Or is lidocaine used more often than not? Hugs and healing vibes to everyone! ~Renee",
