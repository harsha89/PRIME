Weird things to bond over but I'm here if you want to talk. I have a 4cm solid palpable lump vu-raids rating 4,and the surgeon is \"very worried\". I get the feeling lost. Being scared in your own mind is hard. I joined yesterday and just reading makes me feel less alone even without any answers yet. I don't know much but... When I was 19 I got stretch marks in both breasts and I was a size 3 then. My breasts have always slightly different in size. Just recently my left one started getting squared at the bottom.  As for the mammogram results, I had sonogram and results on the same day.  Good luck to you",
