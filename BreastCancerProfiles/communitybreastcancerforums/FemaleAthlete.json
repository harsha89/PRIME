I did not go for reconstruction at that time. About a year or so ago, I noticed a \"lump\", very small in size on the upper left side of my chest. I was told to not worry about it since it is probably the spot where my sutures were tied off. So, I didn't give it any more thought. Now, this very small lump is now three times it's \"normal\" size, and it is not soft, kinda like a marble that moves around. The other thing is this tiny sharp pain fI am getting from the area. Again, I was told it could be scar tissue - really? Scar tissue grows? So now I am all freaked out and cannot stop feeling it nor looking at it in the mirror. What should I do? you will all probably suggest I get it checked out. Which I have been putting off all week. I'm just worried is all.
