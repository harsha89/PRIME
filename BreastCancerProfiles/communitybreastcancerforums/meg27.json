      "Content": "meg27 wrote: Hello, all!  I'm a 27 yo female who went in for an ultrasound last week after my PCP found a lump on my breast at my annual exam.  Assuming it was a cyst, she sent me to the Women's Center at our local hospital to check it out.  I've been through this 2 years ago, when she found a lump. Following both an ultrasound and a mammogram, the radiologist back then said \"Don't come back until you're 40\" which was great news!  However, the lump has not gone away, and here we go again.  This time, I had an ultrasound--- the tech only saw normal breast tissue.  The radiologist then wanted to do a mammogram since the lump was palpable but not visible on the ultrasound.  The mammogram came back \"abnormal\".  The radiologist took me to a private room, her arm around me as she walked me there.  I had a weird feeling this time-- The doctor told me that she is seeing a mass that appears to be very dense breast tissue and she just can't pinpoint what it is on the US or Mammo.. She told me she was sending me for an MRI to take a look at what's inside of the tissue.  She then immediately jumped to the question: \"Do you know of a good breast surgeon?\"  Of course, I did not.  She provided me with a list of surgeons.  She never once mentioned cancer or biopsy.  She appeared to be emotionally involved, as I assume I was her youngest patient that day.  I don't know what to think.  I'm prepared to hear bad news, but I also can't believe I feel so in the dark about this.  My MRI is tomorrow.  I have a follow up appt. with a well-respected breast imaging clinic on Friday where they can do a biopsy if needed AND provide a second opinion since I will be bringing all my test results with me on a CD.  Any thoughts on this?  Thanks for your help/advice!
