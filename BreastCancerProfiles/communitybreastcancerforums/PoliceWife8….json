I underwent 6 months of chemo, followed by a year of Herceptin infusions, as I am Her2/neu positive. Personally, I LOVE full sized quilts - my cancer center is wonderful, but I always found the infusion rooms to be freezing, even in the midst of summer. My infusions would last from 9:30am till around 3:00pm, so - it made for a long day! Thanks for donating your talent and time to chemo patients - it is much appreciated! Love, Brandi",

My longest surgery was 12 hours, and my shortest was 4 hours. My only issue was a sore, scratchy throat after waking up - that lasted only a day or so, then I felt fine. I also had no issue with any sort of acid reflux or nausea. Now, the fatigue following those surgeries is a different story! You will do just fine! :) Love, Brandi",
