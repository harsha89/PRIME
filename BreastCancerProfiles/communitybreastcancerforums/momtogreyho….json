My implant took it well but I did burn quite a bit the last week of radiation and about 2 weeks after. They kept telling me it would eventually get better. At the time I didn't think it would ever get better, cried all the time, it was gross....but I DID get better and it;s been a year since radiation and aside from a slight tan the skin is smooth and pliable. Don't want to scare you  but when they tell you you might burn they really didn't make it clear as how much you could. Not everyone burns but just in case you do burn bad....remember it WILL get better. Well wishes for a speedy recovery.  Most important thing is don't be afraid to ask questions even if you think it's doesn't seem important....ask and make sure you get an answer you understand if not have them repeat it until you do understand.  I found all the nurses and tech are very willing to explain things to you.

Don't settle for the I'm the doctor and know best. Always take a support person with you.  I have 3 dearset friends who have come with me through surgeon, Plastic surgeon,Chemo and Radiation Doctors. They help you focus on what you want answered and they don't hesitate to ask a question they feel is pertinent. So far I have not had a doctor that has not taken the time to explain and answer any questions from me or my support team. If you don't understand something the first time ask the doctor to explain it again and again until your comfortable with the explaination. If they don't or seem impatient with you their not the doctor for you. You have a lot to process and should not be rushed out of the office.  Most doctors are doing what they feel is best for you but their not Gods, thier doctors and egos are unacceptable, YOU are the most important person in that office. You have to be pro active in your care and that is why I feel it is very important to have a support member with you. Well wishes, hoping you have a speedy recovery.  Joanne",
