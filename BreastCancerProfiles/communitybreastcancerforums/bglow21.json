Whats strange is I get a call to set up an appt for a surgery consult but the dr said nothing about a referral for surgery? Why see a surgeon before the mammogram? To make matters worse the guy specializes in surgical oncology, so I feel like the drs know something I dont. Its military, so picking up the phone for answers just isn't that simple. Does everyone get a surgical referral with mammograms? Log in to post a reply",
