Tammy, hang in there.  I am scared as hell too, but I know we'll get through it.  The port will be worth it as it will not tax your arms and veins.  Okay, thinking of you all and will post once I get started.  Hang in there you all.  Hey, did we should come up with a name for our month, don't ya think.  Who's creative out there?  Vicki",
