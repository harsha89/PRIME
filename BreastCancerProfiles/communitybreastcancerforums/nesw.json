He told me they were symptoms of depression and were normal, that I was grieving the loss of my old self. I do think I needed the Lexapro, but after my early July surgery, I spent the summer sitting around looking at things to do and not knowing how to get started on so many things. Even cooking one meal, I would find myself standing there trying to remember what I was going to do next. Based on my experience, I would say between 2-3 months after surgery I just START to feel better.",

I've attributed it to the anesthesia in the past year (about 15 hours total in four separate surgeries). I do feel more competent if I exercise; however, my internal med doctor put me on 10 mg daily Lexapro (he says depression) and 50,000 IU weekly D (low in bloodwork). I can concentrate on complex thinking for an issue at hand, such as developing a PowerPoint presentation, but can't seem to plan out multiple things, like what to get at the grocery store for the next few days of meals. And it seems like I have such a vocabulary loss - that's what bother's me most. I've been on the Lexapro and D since this past March, and I really felt good after about a month of it, but I had my 3rd and 4th surgery in July and October. I remember feeling really good during September when school started, so I'm convinced the anesthesia has a strong effect and it will wear off again over the next month. However, I do feel like I need the Lexapro and D also.",

If they had simply biopsied my assymmetry after the mammo and ultrasound and found benign fibrocystic change, I would be in trouble because I would still have three regions of DCIS, and one of them was already microinvasive. I would request a breast specialist and at least ask about MRI.",
