      "Content": "Aug 23, 2011 05:22PM - edited Aug 23, 2011 05:38PM by Ashvegas Hello everyone - first post.  I started T/C x 6 on Augest 18th.  I got the Nuelasta shot on the 19th.  The first couple of days were ok, but then on Saturday evening I started feeling sick with some mild/moderate bone pain.  I described it to my husband like a brain freeze that picked a new spot on my body about every 3 seconds.  Each was intense.   Mostly I felt it in my head, jaw, feet, back, chest, hips and pelvis.  I took a Percoset and went to bed.  Fever was mild and less than 100.    Then on Sunday night the fever started about 7 pm and lasted all night long - regarless of percoset or advil.  Bone pain was more intense and was isolated to torso.  But then last night I was in so much pain i was screaming and crying and could not keep still.  Fever and chills to 101.  Called ONC andwas told to take 2 Percoset and monitor temp but that it was likely too early for low WBC.  The pain was so severe it felt like back labor - which I have had!  Went mostly away by morning. Went in this morning at 9 and the did blood and urine.  WBC low end of normal but urine showed bladder, UT or kidney infection.  I had no signs!  Temp tonight is starting again and so is the back pain.  Anyone with similar issues?  Is this all related to a bladder infection or is this nuelasta?  I hurt :( ",
