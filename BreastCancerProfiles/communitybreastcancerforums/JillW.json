Did fine until 2 weeks after the surgery and the breast only swelled apparent lymphedema which has never gone away.  Finally my Harvard surgeon dx as lymphedema not any other of my 8 doctors had diagnosed it and I didn't know I hadn't heard of LE in the breast only.  I was at the point where I was going to ask for the breast to be removed.  There was no excuse for this.  Finally after the dx I began tx with my PT with a Certified Lymphedema Therapist on the second tx I could already begin to noticed and improvement.  She is very involved with the medical community here and tries to educate them that this is a big problem. I've been searching for compression specialty bras and have only found two that are made to fit and have pouches to hold different sizes of compression devices. Sports bra's just don't cut it with my severity.  My ? is does anyone know of sources for quality bra's? The Bellisse bra meets all the needs and Anita bra 2nd. Price $100 - $200 and is not covered by my Medi-care or State Medi-cal programs.  Legislature is working on this.  For a bra comparison chart you can got to bellisse.com/comfort_bra/comparison.shtml. Thank you for any resources info anyone may have. JillW Dx 11/11/2006, ILC, 1cm, Stage I, Grade 1, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR+ Log in to post a reply",

When you're new to this club you don't have the information yet and are so dependent on the doctors.  Doctors are not Gods - far from it - or they wouldn''t need malpractice insurance.  I also just became a NLN member and will try and get a copy of that newsletterr. What is \"SNB\" short for? Jill",
