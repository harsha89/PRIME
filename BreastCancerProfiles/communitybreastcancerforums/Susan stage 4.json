All has gone well since, until I started having weird twinges and pains. Tumour markers have gone up \"a bit\". Whatever that means. Now I'm waiting for the call with my appointment times. I've done everything right. I completely changed my life. Everything from my job to my diet. I even have an organic vegetable garden where before I store bought and microwaved. I hate the waiting and not knowing. And I hate the smug confidence of my onco who originally said one to six years. Help Log in to post a reply",
