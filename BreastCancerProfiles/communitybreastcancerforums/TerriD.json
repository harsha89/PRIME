BACKGROUND: She just finished radiation. Not sure how many treatments, I think it was for 5 weeks.  She was stage 1, and this is her second cancer episode, first time was 10 years ago (me, her and my youngest sister have all had breast cancer twice each, and each recurrence was 10 years later...) OK QUESTION:  mom just called me her radiation dr told her she has cellulitis (last week) She has been on a sulfur oral antibiotic and has had no relief, hot-to-touch rash on rad site and tenderness. Now I have had my own issues with cellulitis, I have had many episodes (over 40) and have only had it 2x with out a fever present.  so I wonder... I also had a lot more rads then she did, so could it be radiation burns??  That she has?  I finished rads in 2009 and lost my skin etc, I did not end up with a hot to touch rash that was from radiation - that I am aware of, I did have hot-to-touch cellulitis issues (that started way b4 rads ever did) and was usually accompanied with a 103.5 fever. Mom  has no fever.  The rad dr gave her an oral antibiotic a week ago and it is still hot-to-touch. COULD THIS \"JUST\" be a radiation burn???  (I HATE to say \"just\", I know how hard it is...) If not, I have to assume it is cellulitis, like the dr said, but I know how hard it is to dx this animal. Mom is in FL I am in MI so I cant look at it, she says the \"rash\" is on her chest on the radiation site. In my case my rash went up my arm, and across the chest and back...hers is not spreading...so I wonder if this is just a rad side effect and NOT cellulitis??? The problem is she has heart issues and has also had c-diff in the past, so allowing a strep bacteria unattended is a real bad idea, and having IV antibiotics would be hard too (due to her c-diff history).  She is ready to go to the ER, either way I told her that this should not be treated by her rad dr, that she needs to see an infectious disease dr.  Suggestions?  comments?  Oh, and just in case can anyone recommend an Infectious disease dr in Ft Lauderdale area?  THANKS Terri",

Left arm became bright red, actually at that time the \"sunburn like rash\" spread across my stomach and back half way and from my collar bone to my belly button, hot to touch, high fever (up to 103.8) body aches, soreness in arm, increased lymphatic swelling (you know the drill). All during chemo (for 7 months) I got this once a week. During radiation it was every other week, and then the episodes got less frequent down to 3-4 a year. It took drs 1.5 years to diagnose me and I began IV antibiotics for 6-8 weeks at a time, then moved to oral antibiotics Augmentin 875 for the past 5 years or so. Finally, in 2013 (4 years in) I got a reprieve; no cellulitis for 14 months. I had taken steps to get my diabetes in check, have done Physical therapy to reduce lymphedema swelling, use compression sleeves and use a Lymphatic pump daily for 1-2 hours (for 4 years now). Alas, the cellulitis returned and for the past 14 months the cellulitis episodes have been on a 6-8 week loop. Despite the symptoms reducing --to \"just\"spots/blotches, fever's stay low grade etc. Before I see any visible signs, I get the body aches, arm pain, back aches, I get irritable (blood pressure spikes)...and then I see the spots (which means no pumping of course so swelling get pretty bad again). Aside from Augmentin I have been getting a 3-day in a row shots of Recepitin \u2026 and I admit I just realized I have had a defeatist attitude lately. A few months ago I was at the drs and I was like, this is my new normal, I will never be well, I just have to learn to live with this...but yesterday I was talking to someone who brought up a few good points and gave me HOPE! New plan: 1- I need to lose weight, it's not good for my diabetes or lymphedema, so there's that battle of the bulge to begin...2- I called for a consult with a holistic dr (yeah right $700 not including labs to get a diagnosis- so that's not happening. And 3- I am now exploring Hyperbolic Oxygen Therapy, so, MY QUESTION is: Has anyone out there dealing with lymphedema or cellulitis TRIED THIS? I hope to hear tales of healing, but since there are not too many of us with recurrent cellulitis; I understand the odds of that are bleak. Anyone care to share?

I met with my new oncologist and when he informed me that the nccn guidelines...blah blah blah...in my situation does'nt reccomend folowup tests (other than tumor markers and thourough exams) He said although I had breast cancer twice, and it was in my lymph nodes, I was not high risk, high risk was 4 lymph nodes and I only had 2, sooo he was only reccomending tumor markers every 6 months (i must have looked like i was going to pop a boil-cause he changed his opinion to every 3 months for now) I asked him, \"why is it my sisters who have never had breast cancer get mris every year and i am refused, since i have already had the disease, shouldnt i be followed closely?  they used to do that (years ago)\".  he said well, studies have shown if they catch the initial breast cancer sooner then the cure and survivorship stats are way up, but (are you ready for this?) if a person who has already had breast cancer gets mets it doesnt matter whether they find the mets thru a test of if i have symptoms, either way studies have shown no increased life expectancy.  NOW, I am not in agreement with this at all.  i think that there definately would be a longer time to live and a better quality of life if mets was found while it was small and new rather than after you are showing signs of illness.  He doesnt even do chest xrays!  to check the lungs.  WOW!  He said all comprehensive cancer facilities were in agreement with teh no follow up scan mentality and sure i could find a dr to accomodate me based on emotion, but that would not be \"good doctoring\".  I am so fed up with this cancer  bol---der---dash  stuff!  hugs",

And because they can't find your last films they have no comparison to determine the status of your suspicious area. WHO ordered the mammogram? Your internist?  I see you did not have chemo for your breast cancer treatment. THAT being said, if you do not need a referral to see Drs, which it seems like you don't, and being that the oncologist has never treated you for your breast cancer, \"I\" would call my surgeon or gyn dr and ask for an ultrasound and/or a breast MRI.  Who do you have the best relationship with? FRANKLY I do not trust needle biopsy, as both my hubby and I have had them come back inconclusive or 99.00% a-OK (and they were malignant).  I would demand further testing.  In MY experience, both my surgeon and gyn are the most cooperative under these conservative guidelines times for testing put out by the NCCN.  Your gyn dr could do it also for you, but at this point you are a step above the qualifications of most internists (JMHO). Sometimes my surgeon (who I still see once a year) will actually order the tests or scans the week before my appointment, if you call and explain what is going on they can do this and save you a co-pay.  IN any event, GOOD LUCK!!! to you, AND please please please be sure to KEEP COPIES OF ALL ALL ALL YOUR TESTS, I have found drs are more thorough (and actually read the scans) when you ask for copies.  My hubby's test showed cancer 3 months before we were told, it showed up on the scan, and the dr didn't read it til the morning we went for his \"at you convenience we'll remove it\" surgery.  Hugs Terri",

      "Content": "TerriD wrote: ***URGENT*** HI Ladies, I need a pretty quick response, so Thanks you to anyone who can help/share:  This question is for my mom. BACKGROUND: She just finished radiation. Not sure how many treatments, I think it was for 5 weeks.  She was stage 1, and this is her second cancer episode, first time was 10 years ago (me, her and my youngest sister have all had breast cancer twice each, and each recurrence was 10 years later...) OK QUESTION:  mom just called me her radiation dr told her she has cellulitis (last week) She has been on a sulfur oral antibiotic and has had no relief, hot-to-touch rash on rad site and tenderness. Now I have had my own issues with cellulitis, I have had many episodes (over 40) and have only had it 2x with out a fever present.  so I wonder... I also had a lot more rads then she did, so could it be radiation burns??  That she has?  I finished rads in 2009 and lost my skin etc, I did not end up with a hot to touch rash that was from radiation - that I am aware of, I did have hot-to-touch cellulitis issues (that started way b4 rads ever did) and was usually accompanied with a 103.5 fever. Mom  has no fever.  The rad dr gave her an oral antibiotic a week ago and it is still hot-to-touch. COULD THIS \"JUST\" be a radiation burn???  (I HATE to say \"just\", I know how hard it is...) If not, I have to assume it is cellulitis, like the dr said, but I know how hard it is to dx this animal. Mom is in FL I am in MI so I cant look at it, she says the \"rash\" is on her chest on the radiation site. In my case my rash went up my arm, and across the chest and back...hers is not spreading...so I wonder if this is just a rad side effect and NOT cellulitis??? The problem is she has heart issues and has also had c-diff in the past, so allowing a strep bacteria unattended is a real bad idea, and having IV antibiotics would be hard too (due to her c-diff history).  She is ready to go to the ER, either way I told her that this should not be treated by her rad dr, that she needs to see an infectious disease dr.  Suggestions?  comments?  Oh, and just in case can anyone recommend an Infectious disease dr in Ft Lauderdale area?  THANKS Terri 2x survivor. 1Peter 2:24 Claim Victory!

      "Content": "Jun 5, 2010 08:31PM TerriD wrote: Well I just got my bead-foobs and I am amazed at how light weight they are, they weigh nothing!  I was trying to fit one over my reconstruction side to even out with my non reconstructed side and ordered several sizes. In the end, I decided to leave the reconstructed side alone and go with a size 7 on my non reconstructed side (I \"was\" a 42D once upon a time).  What I am saying is that because I had a reconstruction on my right, which looks like a demented hamburger bun, and decided not to add anything on top of it, even though the chart said I should be a 9, I am wearing a 7 beanie boob.  Now, about the sport bras I got at target. They have thin bra-like straps, not thick regular sport bra type straps, and they do not have pockets!  BUT they are very comfortable and I just tucked my beanie boob in and it seems secure.  Comfort was important as I am still a bit tender from radiation, my spandex camis were too hot and These are pretty enough that if they peek out of my shirt it would be OK, and they are not clingy, I had a hard time wearing t-shirts over my spandex camis cause they clung to my cami top and it looked weird.  The sports bras code is Champion Duo dry seamless 214 05 0376 - the last 4 digits indicate the color; I got fuscia, dusty blue white and gray. These do not have clips you pull them over your head.  You can always have foob holder cups put in if you need to but these foobs are so light I don't think it is necessary.  This is just temporary till I figure out what I want to do reconstruction wise; I am trying to clear up the cellulitis first.  ; ) Hope this helps someone somewhere. And thank you all for you help! too.",

      "Content": "TerriD wrote: ****CAUTION****PLEAS DONT READ IF YOU HAVE YET TO DO RADIATION****I AM SURE NOT EVERYONE HAS THIS HAPPEN TO THEM... Ladies, I finished radiation In November. It was pretty harsh, they used a bolus (sp?) towel and basically acheiv d the \"desired effect\" of scalding the skin right off my body. I am healed up pretty nicely, still have a postage-stamped area though.  Lately I feel tingles in my chest, like maybe my skin is trying to rejunvinate?  What I need to ask is I seem to be having chest pains, like contractions. I am hoping this is not due to heart troubles, and maybe it is NORMAL for after radiation to have your muscles or skin contract as they heal???? I did have untreated cellulits for over a year and know that strep affects the heart, and am hoping that this contraction crap is just from rads...any ideas?  I DO have a cardiologist appt set up buy the earlies they could se eme was not for another 2 weeks.
