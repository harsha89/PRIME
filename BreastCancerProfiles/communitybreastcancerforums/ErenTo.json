I had 13 nodes removed with radiation to axilla as well as chemo. I did a lot of research just prior to surgery and after and followed every rule in the book. BCO and this forum is a great resource, BTW. I'm very active and started exercise very gradually, saw a lymphedema specialist and got fitted with a sleeve and gauntlet to use for exercise and for flying. Avoided lifting heavy stuff and sleeping on my left side for nearly a year post-surgery. I still remain vigilant, but am not as paranoid. I'm back to my pre-surgery weights at the gym and fly without sleeve and sleep normally. Still avoid blood pressure cuff and injection, had to let blood taken once as the doc couldn't find a vein. I believe the highest risk is the first 3 years post-surgery, even though there is always a lifetime risk and vigilance is warranted.",

I mean I had just survived a cardiac arrest and all I was worried about was my surgery arm! But thankfully, I didn't develop lymphedema. I don't know how much of this is true, but I remember reading that some people may have genetic predisposition to lymphedema. I'm not overweight, but I have the other two risk factors mentioned above and had IVs for 2 days in my arm and still didn't develop it. Saying that, remaining vigilant is a good idea.",

Haven't had any issue from lumpectomy and reduction and the axillary dissection healing was uneventful with very little pain. I also gained full range of motion fairly quickly. However with dissection and being at increased risk of lymphedema I saw a LE therapist 3 months after surgery who gave me exercises and got fitted for a preventative sleeve and gauntlet to wear during exercise and flying. During chemo I wasn't able to get into my old gym routine, but started with some low-level exercise and light weight training and used the sleeve and gauntlet with no issue. After each 3 rounds of taxotere experienced some pain, tingling and discomfort in the affected arm but they mostly went away (it's been 2 weeks since final chemo). Also developed cording (but had full ROM) and saw my LE therapist and she showed me some gentle massages and exercise which seems to have soften the cord. However I still have some dull pain in the upper outside part of the arm and shoulder when it's strained, for example while driving, and it goes away once I stop that activity. I had this pain all along since surgery but it was gradually getting better until taxotere started. I have to add I've been babying my arm a lot with LE preventative measures, and being the non-dominant left arm it wasn't too difficult to be extra careful and not overwork. So my question is, is this pain normal 6 months post surgery? Could it be because of cording? Could this be an early sign of lymphedema? Or is this just normal part of recovery? It's hard to distinguish between an overstrained arm, chemo effects or early stage lymphedema. And with radiation to axilla starting in 2 weeks I'm being extra vigilant. I'm curious to hear how others' recovery has been after axillary dissection.

Since I posted this, I made an appointment with my regular physiotherapist who also has experience with breast cancer patients. She examined my shoulders and thought they're both very weak and need strengthening, esp. the cancer side. She gave me 5 resistance exercises with the lightest band. Have been keeping up and it does feel much better. Although now I'm in the middle of extensive radiation and she told me to go easy during this time. But it seems that we found the cause of shoulder discomfort. I agree with not babying it too much, I'm hoping this gradual strengthening will allow me to get back to using the affected arm as before. DayLily, did you get the neulasta shot after taxotere? If that is the case, pain and tingling could be a side effect of taxotere. I had that after each round of taxotere and I can say it started to ease up about a month after my final chemo. ",
