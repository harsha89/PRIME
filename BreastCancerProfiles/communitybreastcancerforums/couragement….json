Waiting to have testing and then get the results is truly one of the most trying times there is. It puts on edge on all of life, even when one thinks they doing fine with the stress. I am also sorry it is taking so long to get to your biopsy. It sounds like it is this coming week, yes? What day are you scheduled for? Have you ever had one before? You are strong with your ability to fast like that. It certainly helps promote a sense of control when there is a feeling of none. I don't know if you have read the data available on fasting for breast cancer, but there is a lot of supportive data for fasting and helping fight cancer. So it could be supporting you in many ways. Do be sure to get good nutrients now before your biopsy so that your body is strong. Protein is always advised for supporting any procedures and surgeries. Go for wild caught fish, grass fed meats and good poultry if you eat any animal products. Do you have any practices for calming and self soothing? Having good self care is clutch as you probably well know. Are you working? Do you have good distractions? I will be holding you in my heart, hoping for the very best, and sending you all good energy. ",

I am a long writer (and am a writer in life) so whatcha gonna do :). Where else if not here, is what I say! I hear you, now is the time to focus on living, that is for certain. I also did my best to stay positive throughout, but one also has to release anger and fear in life. I saw a great post in the \"I see stupid people everywhere thread\" which made me crack up. When someone told them to be positive and they didn't feel like it they said something like \"I am positive, I am positive you are pissing me off!\" haahahaha. I laughed hard at that. Although people will say all sorts of things, I took the tack that I have said all sorts of stupid things in my life, but I always hope that my intention was pure, and that I was grateful that anyone cared enough at all to say things to me they hoped would help throughout any ordeal. Oh I think Reiki can be a beautiful thing. How good you are to go to find a practitioner that you can trust and believe in. That is half the battle in all of this, I reckon. Reiki is so good on the self love side, as our culture puts such a premium on blame, particularly around illness. I have been ill off and on since I was 13, and I still struggle with feeling like I could be stronger and smarter, and healing and being healthy has been a huge part of my life. I am only just beginning to accept that we don't always have much control. I am grateful to be coming to this space. The control thing is so interesting. I found the need to have an exceptionally clean house while going through treatment, and it helped me moving my body. What works, works. I also fast daily, from 4 pm to 7 am, as they found that fasting can reduce the chance of a recurrence by about 38 percent. Stunning! I have always overeaten and I think my husband was curious to see if I could do it, and wow, the day I said I would do it I did and I have never looked back. Stoked! And I love the less clean up and meal planning. Good to have such a great spouse who encourages whatever I need to do and picks up whatever needs doing. Your post does not sound depressing. It sounds real. Let your real fly! But do temper the impulse to go to dark places with a balance on what is good and right for you in your life. There is certainly darkness but I truly believe we can dwell in the light if we practice and focus on such. Walking in the light with you right now.",

It is so true that there is so much to learn in this process (if indeed this becomes your process... we don't know anything for certain yet!). I have indeed been incredibly fortunate in my life in that I found the love of my life. There may have been illness and other woes in my life, but I have had an amazing time. One of the best things I told myself on this cancer odyssey was to replace fear with curiosity. I have never turned down an interesting adventure, and I truly worked at approaching this like any other challenge with a \"well, let's just see what happens.\" One truly never knows what is around a corner. There are things in my life I would have bet everything I had on and then things turned out completely unexpectedly. So my mantra for going through treatment was \"Relaxed, brave, curious, and grateful.\" This is not to say I followed these concepts to a \"t\"... I have certainly been the opposite of all of them, often!, but I have been able to return to these feelings and words over and over and they hold me in good stead. Remember to try and have fun this week before and after your biopsy. I don't know what that might look like for you (fun that is) but the little things add up. And if you like music a good playlist can be very uplifting. We watched a lot of movies about fortitude and overcoming obstacles and it helped (and still does) a lot! Rest up, eat well, and know we are all out here cheering you on",

I work from home and my husband and I have our own business so taking time off is a different story from yours, but I found that if I took something, like a valium pre-biopsy then taking some time off was helpful. I could have worked the day after all my biopsies as interestingly they did not flare me. I had one that was very difficult and I had excessive bleeding and even then I was able to return to desk work. The pain was not overwhelming with any of them, but certain situations surrounding them were exhausting. Overall, if I needed to take time off I would have and think it is wise to prepare to have the time off, as you have done. You know your body best, and treat yourself gently. I think having the front closure bras is smart and they will probably give you ice packs that you can place in them. I needed help at home with taking off my shirt and bra when I was ready.

May you feel your nervous system gently return to a calm state soon. It will! It takes a lot of being very kind to yourself. As my husband says to me after something like that \"what little treat are we going to get you today?\" I hope you can go get yourself a treat, or take a nice nap, or watch a good show on Netflix! Be sure to mention this to all your practitioners from here on out so that they can plan for what can happen. I had a very similar experience in 2014 when I had some calcifications. I had such pain and severe bleeding that the doctor said he had never seen that much blood and the nurses jumped up on the high table, flipped me over and both pushed down for so long and so hard that they separated the connective tissue between my ribs. It took about a year for the pain to subside. Major hematoma. They found no cancer on that biopsy. Fast forward two years later and my mammogram showed more calcifications so they said I needed another biopsy. I was like a dog who had a bad experience at the vets :). I almost backed away from the radiologist out of the room. I had to have 3 doctors convince me to get a biopsy. Thank goodness I did as it turned out to be cancer and I could get treated, but the fear put me into a state where on the next 3 biopsies I needed I cramped up and was triggered with PTSD (which I developed from other old medical issues as a child). I used valium each time and had someone drive me. But the tension created muscle spasms in my back for a bit. But they controlled for pain well. One of the most frustrating things about the first biopsy is that they would not note the bleeding in my chart (and I am an excessive bleeder). The medical team really circled the wagons and wouldn't document what happened. My main doctor (a major rheumatologist) was livid. I haven't had that kind of bleeding since. I use Vicodin for pain and often have to remind doctors (my husband works in pain management) that women often require about 30% more opiates for pain relief than men. I am like a broken record with my doctors about pain and bleeding. I have to remind them at every turn, and it has turned out to be very important that I do. I have gone so far as to have them repeat to me what I have told them! They often say \"oh we never see that\" and make me feel a bit ashamed, but I have gotten over that and advocate for myself in a very strong way. Stay strong! Do what your gut tells you to do, and advocate for yourself as you would your dear children (because you are by making sure you are there for them!). I send you much love and good spirits for a good recovery and very positive outcome!!",

I know things have improved in mastectomy surgery a lot over the years, but the fact is that it is an amputation(s) and with that comes all sorts of difficult stuff. I have read doctor's papers and spoken to some that state if we were to call it an amputation vs mastectomy people would more readily understand that it is a big deal and that the body has to rearrange in many ways. The word mastectomy sanitizes all that we go through and makes others think it is no big deal and we are just back to normal.

I had a double mastectomy with expanders back in Feb of 2017 and then replacement with implants in July of 2017. I had bilateral breast cancer and many nodes removed, but 22 on the right side. My entire right side looks different. About 3-4 ribs all jut out further on the right side and I have truncal LE there. It doesn't look obvious with a blouse on but with a t-shirt that is tighter you can see this area that curves out a few inches more than the other side. It is uncomfortable as well with that classic feeling of \"carrying a football or roll of paper towels\" under your arm pit. That is the way my PT described it and it fits to a \"T\". If I get too warm, work out too hard (or even carry a heavy purse on that side) the swelling feeling creeps up to my neck and down toward my waist. The inside of my arm gets sore and heavy. If I eat much sugar or a lot of baked items that entire area swells up. All my doctors say it is a results of all the tissue that was removed and the shifting of muscle and fat. I agree with them, it just looks odd and feels odd. The tumor board has met several times on my case given what a low percentage of women have bilateral breast cancer with multiple sub-types (plus an odd medical history) and exactly one half of them said not to do radiation because my right side would more than likely have such severe LE that it would become a disability severely affecting my QOL. I have a very large rib cage and can imagine if I were thin (I am about 20 pounds overweight) that it would be even more pronounced. Wishing you some relief and answers. Let us know how it is going. Sending hope and love!",

I kept it for a few procedures, like a colonoscopy, etc. But I will have it removed in two weeks, and then have them take blood from my ankle or foot. Not so easy sounding to me, but the nurses at my infusion center say they can do it easily. So I will go there for all my blood draws for any samples needed. If I have an emergency then I am asking for the one that had the fewest nodes removed. All BPs are currently taken from my leg. They have to adjust for it (legs run higher) but they seem to cope okay. Planning on getting a medic alert bracelet as well. Best of luck!",

It is a whirlwind and it sounds like you have appointments lined up. Steady on, getting all the data you can get. I hope you can allow yourself to just be right now, and not worry about your concentration and such. And allow your dear ones to help you. I think lists are a fine way to just keep going right now. My feeling was to stay as steady as possible while going through all stages, but in particular, this one. The just having been diagnosed one, before you know what the details are and before you have your plan in place. Eating well, resting, exercising, distracting yourself with positive things like movies, TV shows. I found reading more than bits and pieces to be difficult in terms of concentration. One foot in front of the other. Trusting in your strength. I send you strength and love, and let us know how you are doing.",

It was about two years ago that I was diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer and I had (and still have) many underlying autoimmune conditions, as well as other comorbidities. I also have always looked healthy, eaten clean, was an athlete, etc. which led pretty much all my doctors to always assume I was fine on all counts and not take things too seriously. The looking good part is a bigger deal than most people think. I now have doctors that listen to my words vs just look at me and make assumptions. The biggest advice I can give you is to stick to your guns about your concerns for your health. Even though I had shingles 8 times my doctors played down the neuropathy issues. I developed bad neuropathy from chemo after my second round and it took several visits and multiple tumor board meetings to finally decide to give me gemzar as my chemo to avoid worsening neuropathy. I had botox injections for migraines which we discontinued during chemo so that I was not overwhelmed with meds. I also discontinued other meds as well (like plaquenil). What I have found to be the case with my doctors is that they will downplay any potential complications but once they arise they will take them seriously. I did a lot of research on what issues can arise with chemo. A lot of folks said not to, as it can make you kind of crazy with fear, but I found that I was prepared when side effects presented themselves. For example I developed hand and foot syndrome and when I saw it I immediately knew what is was and was able to get help immediately. I had a kidney stone and was able to handle it well. I just took one symptom and side effect or emergency at a time and stayed present throughout. I did not worry about going to the ER for UTI's, dehydration, or anything, and was adamant that they separate me from the crowd so I didn't pick up any illness' from others. I stayed kind but firm always with everyone helping me. Due to illness' since I was about 19 my main course of caring for myself has been self regulation through meditation and it has held me in good stead in this terrifying process. I am not saying I don't feel like falling apart occasionally (and do), but I usually bounce back in strength once again. Fear is a big thing throughout chemo and I found my therapist to be invaluable. I used everything at my disposal to stay strong and healthy throughout. Eat well, drink plenty, exercise even when you don't feel like it, even if it is just walking around the block. Use pedialyte if you can't stand the taste of water. Gargle with baking soda and salt and warm water a lot, swish with coconut oil if it doesn't make you feel sick. Treat yourself to good things, positive and uplifting movies and music, write, get in water. One thing you may want to check out is the use of fasting during chemo. I explored it a bit, but honestly was so overwhelmed and scared that I didn't do it. But the data is good. A guy named Valter Longo at USC has found that people who fast around the time of chemo (his studies have the specific times and hours of fasting) have fewer side effects and the chemo does the job better. If you google him and also see him in youtube videos to get the exact info.you can watch videos of him and his work. I now fast 14-17 hours a day due to data that shows it can reduce roccurance by 39% (check out Dr. Ruth Peterson's work at UCSD). I hope some of this info is helpful. I am thinking of you with much hope and send it your way. May you be well and strong.",

I also had such a hard time that I could not work, work out, or do much of anything. I basically was homebound and bedridden. I was able to do little tiny bits of movement up until my 4th round and after that it was all about just hanging on. Her2+ is something to really approach with everything you can. I have friends that were Her2+ before Herceptin and they are still with me (25= years), so the constant feeling of it returning and you might as well throw in the towel now is a very familiar mindset for us (and frankly everyone with cancer). I too was an incredibly active person, even with my life long illness' (distance ocean swimmer, surfer, kayaker, backpacker, etc.). Fortunately or unfortunately I have honest good friends with major illness' that they will not recover from and that do not have pharmaceutical options. When I complained around them they would roll their eyes and tell me \"it is just a year of your life and you have a chance to beat it.\" When I really took to heart the time line of a year (even though it went a little longer) and saw how many people I know who have had to recover from more radical illness' or injuries I knew that I could manage a year. I just kept going to the next round of whatever (chemo, Herceptin) and told myself that I could stop after each one. Emotionally it was rough. Just remember that depression and crying jags are also a response to the meds, it may not be organic to your mind. When I considered that the drugs would make me cry and feel desperate I just reminded myself it was the drugs, and not who I was at my core. Use what meds they offer you for symptom management, tell them every thing you are feeling. I found my oncologist's PA would address everything, as they really wanted me to keep going. Your younger age will hold you in good stead with strength. That life force will get you through! Yes, treatment sucks something awful, but this is what we have on offer for lifesaving, and lifesaving it does. If the emotional part is the worst for you I would suggest finding a good therapist. Mine was a lifeline for me. You can do this. I used to think I was tough, but now I can truly feel my inner strength. It is amazing how resilient we are. Nonetheless, Vent on, I say! Do what you need to do to keep putting one foot in front of the other! I send you love and strength!!",

Yes, all my docs (and I have many as I had many comorbidities prior to my breast cancer) are in agreement that it is a \"variety of ANS.\" It is indeed quite uncommon, but it does happen. My tongue has neuropathy (tingling, numbness, mouth dryness, etc.) and my gut stops up quickly and severely if I use anything that might slow it down (ie: opiates, benzos, really almost any med). After taking one drug in particular to help with severe fatigue I had my gastrointestinal system stop working for 18 days. Nothing! The ER threatened NG tubes, etc. and as this has happened to me after every surgery I have learned to fast for a week or so and only have clear liquids until my system starts up again. It is very scary. I can use everything under the sun for constipation but the stool with just liquify in my intestine and then my intestines collapse around the stool and there is no motility or anything at all happening until my nervous system comes back on line. It is a neuromuscular response like folks with ALS or Parkinson's can get. Unfortunately, we knew that the T and C would probably do this, as I have had shingles 8 times in my life, as well as being struck by lightning at an early age. My nervous system took the biggest hit it could! But we still have the T and C a chance but then called it off after two infusions. My MO didn't believe me when we started but after my very first infusion she was shocked at my body's radical response to things. Most doctors have very little experience with this type of response (or lightning strikes for that matter), so if you think you have it a neurologist could be a good bet, but they often want to do nerve testing which is painful. My docs know my pain is very severe so they just called it without doing the radical testing. How are you doing? What do you experience? Sending much love and care your way!",

I made it through two rounds and had such severe neuropathy, hand foot syndrome, kidney stones, etc. etc. that we stopped infusions for 5 weeks while my primary MO spoke with MO's at several institutions and my second opinion MO at a research school agreed that I should go on Gemzar, which is usually used for metastatic BC. I was able to do 3 rounds of it so I got in a total of 5 rounds of chemo. Had to stop the last round due to low blood counts. I made it through all the Perjeta, but ended up in the hospital on the last round, and made it through 17 of the 18 Herceptin when my EJ from my last echo dropped to 50. I had all sorts of side effects on each drug, with Herceptin being one of the hardest for joint pain but I am now 2 years out, just had a PET and was all clear. Surgery showed I had an almost complete response, just a couple of micromets. I have yet to meet or hear of anyone who did Gemzar at this earlier stage. I was so grateful to have an MO who listened and worked with me to get me as much as we could given my wonky physiology. The neuropathy was our biggest worry, and indeed, now I have neuropathy in my gut from tongue to stern, which has been rough, even though Gemzar rarely causes it. It was the T and C that did the damage. We can only do what we can manage and live with. I am thinking of you all with much love and care.",
