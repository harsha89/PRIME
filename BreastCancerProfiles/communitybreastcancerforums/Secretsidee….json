My theory is that if radiation can kill cancer cells, it can kill the good bacteria in your stomach. The stomach is very close to the breast. Probiotics do help! 2 more weeks for me! Joanie",

I started with the cream once a day and then used it twice a day as radiation progressed about the 7th day. Even though the cream was working, I had some mild \u201csunburn efffects\" that began around the 14th day. For years I have grown Aloe Vera plants in my yard. They make a gorgeous flower two to three times a year. One evening after radiation I cut a long leaf from the bottom of the largest plant. Using gloves, a knife and a peeler, I cut away all of the thorns and then chopped it in 3-4 inch pieces to use for the week. All except one piece went into an airtight container. I skinned only one side of the section to use for that night. The section of leaf was easy to rub onto the area because the skin of the leaf kept it intact. As I still use the Lemongrass cream twice a day, the aloe treatment really cools the area down after treatment!! The radiation techs talk about how good my skin looks compared to other patients. I plan to share my aloe plants with the radiation center for the other patients. Stay cool! Joani",
