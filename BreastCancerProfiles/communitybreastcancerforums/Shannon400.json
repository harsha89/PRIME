All he said, once the infection clears up he will send me to get a Mammogram to make sure nothing else is wrong that I had a few cyst and tissue swelling but it was not a major concern..    Im just scared shitless ( pardon my language) because I don't like the redness on my left boob and I don't like that it feels like a hard rock... Has anyone ever experianced this?? Im to the point where I want to run the the ER... Oh, and I am not pregant, can't get pregnant..
