Peace & Wellness to all.  ",

I'm relieved to hear that this isn't an absolute w/ rads.",

Now in the last week I'm seeing little red bumps and small bluish area on the boob, with some soreness in the ribs and the breast itself.  So, does anyone know can/ does a body produce both types of cancer?  Luv to all,  ",
