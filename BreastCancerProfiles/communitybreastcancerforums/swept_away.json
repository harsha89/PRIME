    "Content": "swept_away wrote: I'm 25 years old, in relatively good health, but in the last few days, the upper side area of my right breast is in terrible pain. It also expands into my armpit. It doesn't feel like a bruise, or a strained muscle. I don't feel any lumps though. I also don't have a family history of breast cancer, but there is a history of other types of cancer. I know breast pain isn't a symptom for almost all breast cancers, but this is very worrisome for me. Should I go to the doctor? I really can't afford to, so if anyone had any insight, the advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. Log in to post a reply",
