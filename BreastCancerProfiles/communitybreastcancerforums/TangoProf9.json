I am scared to pieces! and want to make an appointment with my doctor today but have to wait until May 15th until my insurance kicks in. My left armpit started feeling swollen about two weeks ago and now there is a prominent bulge--round, squishy, tender but not painful, maybe an inch long. Is an enlarged lymph node a sure thing for bc? I am 60 with no recent infections although I did injury my shoulder about a month ago (carrying a ridiculously heavy book bag slung over my shoulder). Has anyone had a lymph node that was not cancer? Looking for some perspective and hoping for piece of mind. Log in to post a reply",
