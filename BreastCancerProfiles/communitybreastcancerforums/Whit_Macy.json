      "Content": "Whit_Macy wrote: Hello all! I'm new to this, first post tonight. To start off, I'm 23 with no history of breast cancer in my family. I found a lump about 2 months ago in my left breast at about 3 o'clock. I went in to my Dr to have it checked out. She reported it was most likely fibrocystic breast tissue, but recommended I have an ultrasound. I got my ultrasound done yesterday. The u/s tech told me it looked like a fibroadenoma, but couldn't tell me for sure with out the radiologist looking at it. After the radiologist reviewed it, they came back in, and told me the borders are irregular/undefined, and there was a \"lobulation\" present, so they recommended a biopsy. I proceeded with that, and am now waiting for results! I should get them tomorrow. I'm trying to stay positive, but these are the longest couple of days I am ever experiencing. I'm just ready to know the results, even if they are bad. Log in to post a reply",
