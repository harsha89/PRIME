The radiologist was vague and really would not tell me my results she just told me that there is a cluster of tumors closer to my nipple and to make another appointment with my Dr and she would discuss options with me. What could this mean. I asked her to be more specific but she just kind of brushed me off and told me to make that appointment with my primary and take it from there. Log in to post a reply",
