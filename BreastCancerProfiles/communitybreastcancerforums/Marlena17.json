Single mom of 2 bacholers 11 yo and 13 yo,working type A hairdresser who is scheduled Jan 24th for bilateral masctomey,nipple sparing,skin sparing with tissue expanders. SCARED TO DEATH!!!! Add me to your group. I NEED encouragement. Usually pretty brave but I am not handeling this well as my date nears. My doc's are TOP NOTCH and take my case very compassionately. (Cooper MD Anderson,Camden Nj.) and I trust them 1000% but I am beginning to get physically ill. (Worries,stomach issues etc.) I have a \u201cbuddy\" who had the same doc and same diagnosis. She goes for her exchange surgery next week. She did AMAZING however,somehow I know I won't! My luck is like a bald guy who just won a comb!!!! My mom is a cancer survivor. She I said a feisty 95 year old who is encouraging but I am really scared. I am an only child as well so my support is limited to my bf who is a blessing that I still can\u2019t believe came true and some friends. I NEED to get back to work. I feel very happy to have found your group. Positive thoughts to all of you❤️👍🙏🏻💇🏻♀️🌻",
