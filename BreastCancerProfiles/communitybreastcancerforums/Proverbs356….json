Feeling pretty discouraged and frustrated today at the delay. Prayers for those platelets to increase would be so greatly appreciated. I hope all of you ladies are having better luck this week! I am reminding myself that God's plan is better than mine!!",

I had a rough few days after my first round on June 3, with days 3-5 being the worst, but am feeling much better now (just in time for another round Wednesday, of course). I enjoy reading your posts...it makes me feel less alone. I am currently being forced to deal with the hair loss, which has been something I have really dreaded. All of you are in my prayers!

I'm not looking forward to it either, especially after a somewhat \"normal\" week this week. Days 3-7 were the worst for me, then they got progressively better from there. This week has been pretty decent! I drink tons of water and from everything I've read, that is key. I also try to make myself be active and do things, although I do tire much easier than before. I will be thinking of you tomorrow...I pray all goes well",

You will find a lot of comfort and support in this group! The port surgery is a breeze! I had more discomfort after than I expected but I started treatment the following day, so that might have been why. It is actually still a little sore 3 weeks later, but not unbearable. The surgery itself is a snap, though. Don't worry! You'll get through this!",

They went ahead with the 2nd round but said they would have to watch them very closely. I was so discouraged to see that just one treatment could effect my liver that much. I also feel like all the other medicines they have me on played a role in that, so from this point forward I am not taking them just to be preventative. I'm going to wait until I have a SE and then address it. Pretty sure my body is in total shock...",
