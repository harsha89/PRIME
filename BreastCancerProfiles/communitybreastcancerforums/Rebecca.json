It sounds to me like your lump is very likely an infected or inflamed lymph node. That said, I am NOT a medical doctor, and it is difficult if not impossible to diagnose anything over the internet.  The only way to know for sure is to see your Dr...the sooner the better. I hear your concerns regarding the medical community, and in particular the insurance companies, but you must remember that your health is more important than anything else.  Do not let yourself be paralyzed by fear....there are systems in place that can offer help to indivuals such as yourself.  See your Dr and then check back and let us know how you did. Feel better, and good luck! ",

I left it that way as it started to thin, but when it really started to fall I found it so upsetting that I just buzzed it off. I still have hair, but it is more stubble than anything right now...and I have big bald spots now. I did not think I would be able to look at myself with no (or shaved) hair, but I found it was not as bad as I anticipated.

After all, when it is done, many of us will be re-entering mainstream life much as we entered it the first time...bald and weak. I am not sure at which point I will view my rebirth as complete, but I imagine that it will be the first day after treatment is completed that I feel \"normal\" again.

It is relatively painless, but I am sometimes a little sore afterwards. Right now my new breast is very slightly larger than the other one, but I can still pass. I have no idea how it is going to look in the end...right now my new breast is a LOT higher than my old one, and I have more cleavage than I have had since highschool(albiet on one side only). I will have to have another surgery to place my permanent implant, and I will have an augmentation and lift of my existing breast at the same time. Sounds like a lot of surgery...and I guess it is, but as I said, my options were limited, and I was not interested in spending the rest of my life with a prosthetic.",

I was told about Biotene before I started chemo and I have been using the toothpaste since day one. I am wondering if that has helped with the prevention. I also use a salt/baking soda mouth rinse several times a day.

There is no denying that you have cancer when your hair is coming out in your hands, and you have bald spots creeping up the back of your neck. In contrast to your experience, I find that I need to look at it so that I can remind myself of my fight and keep my focus. I view it as a sacrifice so that I can enjoy the years ahead with my wonderful husband and children (I have three...4,7, and 9). I gave up my breast, I gave up my hair. I can not look back because I will cry...but I can always look forward with hope. Be well, my sister...this will pass.",

Hopefully it will be a relaxing trip...lots of friends, but I am a little nervous about being so far from home and being unwell. Ah well...I guess life moves on chemo or no. Have a good weekend everyone, I will post when I get back.",

This damage was worth it because the bad guys were vanquished, and the city will repair the damage. I think it is important to express to the children that your \"sick\" appearance is not because you are sick with cancer, but a result of the treatment.   Also, you should be aware that the chemo does not make your hair fall out immediately....it takes about 14 days for that to happen. My last comment is that you might wish to send a letter home to the parents BEFORE you speak to the children.  This way you do not step on toes, and you allow the parents to be prepared in case the children are upset.  You can do it!  stay in touch here.  There is a January chemo group here...join it!  I had my chemo last january, and i still talk to my chemo sisters who were and are an enormous blessing in my life. keep your head high and smile.   be well and good luck ",

When I was going through chemo I had my two daughters in public school (germ-hole #1) and my son was in preschool which is even WORSE if that is possible.  I was so terrified that I would get sick and have to delay treatment!  What I wound up doing was sending hand sanitizer in to the school and instructing the teachers to make sure that my kids cleaned their hands frequently so that THEY would not get sick, and hence not bring anything home to me.  we had the healthiest winter on record LOL! For you, Angie, since you are the teacher I think it is a bit more complicated.  I would suggest that you keep some hand sanitizer on your desk and clean  your hands after touching your children.  You might also advise the parents that you will be immune compromised and that they should therefore be very cautious in sending a sick child to school.  I am also a teacher (albiet for college kids) and I told MY students that if they were sick that they were forbidden to come near me. That said, the Neulasta that is often given does a pretty good job of keeping your immune system kicking. post back and let us know how it goes! ",
