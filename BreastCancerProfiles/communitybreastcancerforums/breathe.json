      "Content": "breathe wrote: First, hello! I was diagnosed back in July and have never posted on the boards before. I finished chemo and will start radiation after recovering from my exchange surgery next week. I am stage IIIa, grade 2 with a bmx. I was given 4 rounds of CMF and 12 of Taxol. If it weren't for struggling with the whole mortality thing I'd say I'm doing great through the treatments. Here's my story. I had Hodgkins when I was 17. I am now 42 and fighting bc. Problem is I already had radiation when I was young, which likely caused the bc. My doctors didn't want to radiate again but when I turned up as stage 3 they feel they have to. All the problems we face by having radiation scare me. They really scare me when you add having been radiated twice! I'm being seen at Memorial Sloan and the board recommends that I have proton radiation. It will hit less of the areas that don't need to be radiated (like my heart and lungs). Problem is it's experimental and my insurance company is known for turning it down. I'm trying to wrap my head around it all. I'm feeling like I don't want standard radiation at all if Proton gets turned down. Has anyone here even considered not doing the radiation? I have young children and my goal is of course being around as long as possible, but also having good quality years. UGH breast cancer sucks!! Looking forward to hearing others stories. Really looking forward to anyone that might have a similar past. diagnosis 7/14, bmx 8/1/14, 9/14-1/15 Chemo CMF & Taxol, Proton Radiation, Hormone therapy Lupron shot & Letrozole, Stage 3a, 7 of 22 lymphnodes Dx 7/2014, Left, Stage IIIA, 7/22 nodes, ER+, HER2- Surgery 8/1/2014 Mastectomy: Left, Right; Reconstruction (left): Tissue expander placement; Reconstruction (right): Tissue expander placement Log in to post a reply",

I'm not sure what you mean by idealistic approach, but knowing you chose them over sloan makes a difference whatever the reason. I just think of them as THE breast cancer hospital. I have to wrap my head around others being just as good! I probably would have followed her earlier but now that I am done with treatments I'm unsure. So hard!",

My hospital is Memorial Sloan Kettering and I was glad I was able to go there and hate to leave it. BUT I love my Oncologist and she is going to Columbia Presbyterian which is a damn good hospital too. Also my nurse, whom I love, will be staying with Sloan. What would you do? I am so completely divided in this that I'm not even close to a decision!
