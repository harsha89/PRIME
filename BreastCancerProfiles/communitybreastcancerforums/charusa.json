May be they are serious at first to get everything aligned right and being on point. I warmed up to them as time went on and now it is almost time to say our good byes. Hope it gets better for you also.",

I do have a question to throw out throw out there. A lot of you are C/O fatigue and weight gain which I am also going through. I saw my MO just before I finished my rads and had blood drawn. Today I had my follow up appt. with my MO and my TSH (thyroid levels) are through the roof and just so happens fatigue and weight gain are symtoms of that. I know pre-cancer my TSH was within normal range. She told me it most likely is a side effect of rads. I showed her how high up my neck I had discoloration and she really didn't understand why he (the rads doc) went so high above the clavicle. I am sure they will get together and talk about that but in the mean time I got put on synthroid, starting off with a very low dose then increasing it little by little. I go back Dec. 1 to have blood work then see her again a week after that. You would not believe but one side effect of this med is MILD HAIR LOSS!!!! I am praying I don't loose what little hair has come back!!! Just wanted to know if anyone else has found out they also have high thyroid levels post rads? Char",

The only thing I haven't been able to get through at all was the MRI. I got through the PET/CAT and so far everything else has been alright. I do have medication for it and a few \"tricks\" that I have created to get me through things. Peppermints help a lot making my airways open so I feel I am breathing alright is 1 of them. I have been fortunate to have doctors that somewhat understood what panic/anxiety is. I kept my eyes closed the entire time and pretended I was floating on my back in the water...that is what I did to have natural childbirth so it relaxes my body somewhat.  My sims did not take as long as they said it could have. I was in and out even seeing the RO in about 30 mins. Each visit gets shorter and shorter. I started with 4 fields then 2 and now 1. I lay down, 1 quick zap and I am up and out the door. I do have the same techs each time I go. I have only 2 more to go and I am done. I remember the first full treatment and then again on the boosts they called in the RO to double check the area and I was always good to go. They know their stuff although some of them need to learn better patient skills but we all have a bad day but then again that is no excuse. They should understand that we are scared and we have been through hell and a little compassion goes a long way. I think radiation and scans are the hardest thing b/c we can't have someone hold our hand or sit next to us like we did during chemo. We are alone, half naked, laying on a table with a huge machine moving around us and we feel vulnerable.  I forget who posted they were going on a trip/retreat during rads, you will be fine especially since you are already active. Just protect your skin from the sun.  I started counting my days down 33, 32. 31....then I started counting how many treatments left 12, 11, 10...then I just stopped counting and before I knew it I am almost there with just 2 to go. I went today and spent more time talking to my nurse and getting vitals then talking to the doctor...He asked how I was feeling, looked at my skin, then said I would have a follow up in 2-4 weeks....less than 5 minutes!!!  This process is over before you know it, for me I think it was #20-25 that I started having any real skin issues but that cleared up very quickly. They reminded me today how fast your skin heals once you are done. Somedays the fatigue gets to me other days not so bad but at least with fatigue all you have to do is rest and drink a bottle of water and you are up on your feet again. Good luck everyone and hang in there!!!",

No matter where you are in this journey everyone is moving forward with 1 less treatment then yesterday....we celebrate every step in the forward process!!! I don't think no one evades skin issues of some kind but honestly I think even with the 2 small areas that got somewhat broke down I have had worse cases of good old sunburn!!! I was done on the 24th and have been slacking on aftercare with the lotions but honestly I just turned tan in those areas. Last week I picked 2 rooms and did some light cleaning, really just dusted and swept and mopped. It was not overwhelming although I wanted to more but resisted that urge until I am more 100% or close to. It felt really good to accomplish a goal. Over the weekend I kept 4 of my grandchildren; ages 15,13,3, and an almost 2...it was pleasantly chaotic...lol!!! Chaos has broken out in my family and I am kicking myself in the rear because under the stress of it all I started smoking again....oh I am so angry with myself!!! I have to buckle down and get some more patches and start over again. Other then that life after cancer treatments has been good....different but good. At the end of this month it will be a year since diagnosis and I can not tell you where the year went. Every segment...chemo (4 DD of A/C + 4 DD of taxol), then surgery and dealing with the drain for such a long time and finally radiation, seemed to take forever and I thought I would never reach the end. So those of you just starting your radiation, it does end and rather quickly!!! I forgot who is having the long waits/rides and is blind, so sorry but scrolling up and down these pages is hard to concentrate. My city offers a program through the transit authority called DART and if you are disabled and unable to ride a bus you can get door to door pick up and return trip through a taxi company. It cost me $4 each way and sometimes there was a wait to be picked up on the return trip they always had me to my appointments on time. I was fortunate that my facility ran very smoothly and on time. I hope you get some kind of assistance. I know when I go to my PCP the office is always running behind schedule so I learned to get the first appointment after lunch and can get in and out quickly. Continue the fight girls...you are almost there!!!!",

My skin held up ok, I do have a bad area on my clavicle/ neck/ chest area which turned a very dark color and is now very dry and peeling even with all the different creams and the prescription they gave me and 1 area under my arm pit right over the scar from the the node removal incision that is almost brown. The rest of the area is just very red and tender. I have worn nothing but a cotton camisole, no bra, the entire time and lathered, hydrated, and slept when tired. Everyone will be to some degree different but everyone seems to get through it alright and they said the healing process is very quick. I saw my oncologist last week and don't need to see her again until November...that is when it finally hit me....ON WEDNESDAY I AM GOING TO BE FINISHED ALL MY TREATMENTS....when it sank into my brain I was a bit terrified yet so happy....now what do I do? Since last November I had some kind of appointment/ treatment/or dealing with SE's and recovery every week....now the door is open and I feel like that bird...do I stay or do I fly?? Funny feeling....but a great one!!!! To those of you suffering from the fatigue, my got a bit better last week but it is easy for me to take naps since I don't work or have children or a husband to take care of. Listen to your bodies...if you are thirsty; drink....if you are tired; rest...if you are hungry; eat....our bodies have been in the combat zone and are working on overtime mode to get stronger and repair the damages. So onward and upward sisters and we will get through another week and be another week closer to the finish line!!!",

My underarm hair has somewhat come back, not much and leg hair is very sparse but still don't need deodorant. I don't know what the difference is. My sister asked if maybe I lost my sense of smell which got me thinking maybe I did so I asked everyone to sniff me to make sure I wasn't really stinking which made everyone think I lost my mind not my sense of smell...lol....but no, no underarm smell nor am I sweating there. (but I haven't sweated normally in years but that is another issue) Well I am done with everything...yippee...cried a little when I left Wednesday (yesterday) and today I just \"took the day off\" and did absolutely nothing. The only skin issues I have is some peeling in the clavicle area and an area on the scar area underneath my arm. These areas are the ones that most effected and I used a prescription cream that I think dried it up way too much so they told me just use tons of aloe. I have been using my cream they gave me since day 1, I did not wait for my skin to have issues so perhaps that helped. The clavicle area is starting to peel like sunburn does and from time to time I get little \"zinger\" like pains in my breast. Other than the numbness/tingling I still have from my elbow to my underarm on the back side of my arm from surgery I feel fine. Congratulations to all who have reached a milestone in their treatment!!! It is hard to believe that next month will once again be \"breast cancer awareness month\" and where my journey all started....I gave cancer a year of my life now I intend to take my life back!!! I still have reminders...my hair is still so very short and a few scars and a few aches and pains and for a while I will have a lot of follow up appts with the various doctors but that is it...I am writing down my goals for this next year...getting my house back in shape, losing the weight I gained, and I am going to enjoy the holidays this year are some of my priorities. I do want to find a way to use my experiences so I can help others going through it as much as I wish no one would need it.",

Your body is worn out between the diarrhea, blood clots, pneumonia.... you need to rest as much as you can and stay hydrated and nourished. I would not worry about fatigue from rads, it seems to be hitting people about midway and perhaps by then you will be on the mend from the other complications. I wish you luck!!! MomMom- I knew there was someone else on one of these forums that was going to be done the same day as I was. Funny what a difference a couple of days make....I am less vigilant about my skin care, it seems to be healing up on it's own. Peeling in a couple of areas, a little red in others but no pain or discomfort no where. Congratulations on reaching the finish line!!! For all of you starting out, I know it looks like it is going to take forever it doesn't. Start creaming up your skin and keep it moisterized from day 1, you have to be lotion free 4 hours prior to your treatment so the rest of the time lather lather lather!!! I used different creams and made combinations, drank a lot of water, went braless just wore a camisole under a shirt, stayed out of the sun, no swimming (wha wha wha....LOL) and made it through the 33 treatments just fine.  My only mold was for the back of my head to my lower back, had a wedge under my knees, and always refused the blanket b/c I am more comfortable being cold. Mine were over very fast and I was in kind of like a ballerina pose with my arms over my head.  Good luck to all of those setting out this week to continue their treatments.",

Also they gave me a cream my very first appointment and told me to start using it 2x's a day but not within 4 hours of treatment. I did graduate from the cream to other things as well. When it really started burning much like sun burn they told me to do dumburo soaks. That helped a lot and is good for poison ivy, insect bites and other things as well and can be found in the first aid section of the drug store. Hope this helps! Char",

Welcome to everyone that are new to the groups!!! I got the tattoos and they didn't hurt at all and I can not really even see them. They are so tiny. I also have a sticker on my breasts with a big green X on it that I am suppose to be careful bathing with. Not sure why I have both. I just finished #10 today and nothing too much to complain about...a little pink, breast and nipple a bit tender, and just slightly fatigued but a quick nap and feel better. I decided just to forget the bra all together and wear a cotton camisole or a man's undershirt under my shirt unless I am going out out...then I will put on a bra. As soon as I get home I put on the lotion they gave me and then again before bed. I am also trying to drink a lot of water to help keep skin hydrated. I was told no antioxidants as far as supplements but I can eat them...something to do with building up cells in the body and cancer is a cell we don't want to build up. I have always found it very helpful throughout this journey to look back on the previous groups forums and ask questions there. Everyone throughout this whole process has been very helpful. As far as what to expect....everyone is different, everyone's skin is different...but in general terms everything about rads is happening about the same time to everyone just different levels of severity.I have seen pictures of 2 sisters that their skin turned black and 1 actually the skin opened up...I don't know how they continued but they got through it and others just complained of a little redness.
