I'm 20 days into chemo and facing that nasty Taxotere / Cytoxan combo punch again on Monday morning. The hair thing officially chews. The lack of doo-rags that A) fit and B) don't scream \"chemo patient in aisle 7\" chews even harder. I am somewhat \"allergic\" to chemo (is there anyone who isn't) as well as to the neulasta, so the imminent Wednesday pain will be horrendous and I'm really wanting to get my hands on those pot-pills. I don't like taking a pill to prevent fluid build-up in my lungs that keeps me awake for days, causing the need for a sleeping pill. I take a nausea pill to counter-act the chemo and the combo pack causes pain, but the pain pill gives me nausea so i need another anti-nausea med? WTF? Give me one pill for nausea, pain, and sleeplessness.....the cannabis pill...please. ",

My hair never completely fell out and I have this baby fine tennis ball head which I believe is gray (too thin and short to tell the color) except for this one plum-sized bald spot where I attempted to shave my head with an electric razor but the sound and feeling tweaked me out so I pulled away the shaver and never got the nerve to try again. Wanted to go to salon, but that never happened either. So, now I'm wondering if this bald spot is going to grow out differently than the rest of my head. Does anyone know if shaving your head makes hair grow back faster, slower, curlier or what? Will the non-shaved part grow back closer to the type of hair I had pre-chemo (which was straight) and the shaved circle be super curly? Yikes. Wondering what to do.",

My next ride on the chemo train is this coming Monday and I'm interested in learning about the odd-ball side effects that can accompany treatment. I'd like to be more prepared than I am, and maybe share a laugh on the bizarre nature of chemo. So I'll start....my weirdest se thus far has been the sensation of someone slamming my left thumb in a drawer every 30 seconds or so. It lasted for a few days, then just went away. Slam, bam, thank you ma'am! What's YOUR side effect story? (How do I edit the Topic line? I spelled weirdest wrong and can't fix it LOL) Dx 7/2008, ILC, 2cm, Stage IIB, Grade 1, 1/14 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I give my name at the window and sit in the waiting area for a bit. A nurse comes to get me, she weighs me, takes my blood pressure and temperature and walks me to the chemo area where my regular nurse is (you should be assigned the same nurse for each treatment) She takes a blood sample and puts in my IV (you may have a port, so this would be different for you) I then get to put on one of those not-so-lovely hospital gowns and sit in an exam room for quite a while waiting for my oncologist. Her assistant (an APRN) comes in first, then the onc checks me out, we talk about whatever, then it's back to my chemo nurse. I sit in a recliner and she hooks me up to a bag of saline (you want to be really well hydrated) and a bag of steroids and/or zofran (for nausea) The lab mixes up my bags of chemo (which are based on my current weight) it can take a while for the meds to be mixed and sent up, but usually about an hour. I have 2 bags, 1 Taxotere and 1 Cytoxan. The bags are hooked up to the IV one at a time and each bag takes an hour to drip in. While you're sitting there, you can read, watch TV, eat, drink or sleep. The room I'm in has several recliners and I chit chat with my fellow patients, go to the bathroom (because I'm pounding bottled water and have a saline drip) and I hit the fridge for some lunch. There's a sandwich cart, yogurt and jello, coffee and tea, warm blankets if you get cold and an effort to make you comfortable. Be prepared to spend the better part of your day there, at least for your first visit, they want to get everything right. Good luck Monday, I'm sure you'll do fine. ",

I was very much a Cleopatra (Queen of Denial) When the biopsy came back BC, I was SURE they'd mislabeled it, or mixed it up with someone else's. After the lumpectomy I still wasn't convinced. I did rads before chemo because I couldn't wrap my head around the reasoning for chemo in the first place. You are quite normal and everything you're feeling is more than justified. This is a bad reality tv show and there is no right or wrong way to deal with it",
