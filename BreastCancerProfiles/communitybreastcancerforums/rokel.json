He said all the bleeding is actually a good sign (ick!). I have to keep putting xeroform on it and keep it moist and it should heal in two weeks. That was a relief- there were a few moments this weekend when I thought for sure I was going to lose it. How did you make out cyclegal I'm wearing an American sports bra- its a double bra that's supposed to help with shaping. It's very uncomfortable but I was told to wear it 24hrs a days for the first month.",

It gives me the creeps to look at it. My doctor says what I am doing is overkill, but it's working. I shower in the morning and let it air dry, then apply a lot of antibacterial ointment and vaseline. I gob it on because otherwise if it's too dry, some of the scab will come off with the dressing and bleed more. Then I put the xeroform on and then a nonstick bandaid pad and then gauze over that. The compression bra holds it all in place. I add more vaseline every few hours otherwise it dries out and I change the dressings twice a day. Crazy I know, but I was so worried to lose that nipple!",

I am very tired when I get home from work but otherwise fine. I started tamoxifen this week and so far no side effects (knock on wood). Regarding massage, I have been told to massage my implant (I had direct-to-implant reconstruction) but it really creeps me out. I try to do it a couple times a day for a minute or two. My PS said it is to get circulation back to the breast, but it doesn't feel like it's doing much.",

I had actually requested to have the injection in the tumor but the message must have not made it to the radiology department. My surgeon hadn't been too happy my wanting to do the injection differently so I went along with it. But if I were just having a lumpectomy I wouldn't have had it in the nipple or if I'd had my surgery at Sloan, where I was originally scheduled, it would have been different too. The other places in the breast where they injected did not hurt at all. Even though that was painful, I chose this surgeon because he does over-pectoral direct to implant reconstruction. It's supposed to be much easier to recover from and I've had very little pain so far.",
