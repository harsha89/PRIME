Part of my problem, I think, is that I've been here in NY for treatment, staying with my wonderful sister and her family; they've been so good to me.  On the 18th I leave to go back to Japan, where I live and work.  Even though my sister is only a phone call away, and I have many, many wonderful and supportive friends/colleagues there, I'm worried about how I'll handle getting back to \"real life\"...if today is any indication, I don't think I'll do too well. This afternoon I see my oncologist for the last time before leaving...I know it'll be the same soggy, blubbery scene again.  Next Tuesday, it's the surgeon's turn to see me break down.  Then I'll leave my sister...  I just feel like my supports are being taken away, one by one. I know I'll be fine once I get back and get into the swing...I haven't posted much here even though I've lurked a lot.  I have a feeling y'all will be hearing much more from me.

The downside of this place...a 50-mile round trip every day, partly on an interstate under construction with horrible traffic; and there was construction everywhere with parking almost nonexistent.  Still, I thought I should come here because of this woman's sterling rep. For a 2nd opinion, I made an appt. at the cancer center at the hospital where I had my surgery.  It's a beautiful, new place, with a young dr. who had also trained in NYC.  The drive was 20 miles round trip through a beautiful forest with the leaves changing color.  The center has complimentary treatments like acupuncture and massage.  There's reserved parking for patients up front that costs $1 daily, no matter how long you're there. Guess which one I chose?  While I still felt a little like I was settling I just couldn't make that long drive every day.  When I talked to my medical onc., who I love, about which one to go to, he said the center I chose actually had the newest radiation equipment--newer than the first place.  My humble opinion...since you're going to be schlepping there every day for at least six weeks, there are multiple factors to be considered.  I figure that anyone who's board certified in rad. onc. is going to be fine, if everything else works for you.  Boy--I really rambled.  Sorry...good luck with your decision!

I'm doing fine...just went to Yokosuka a couple of weeks ago for my 6-mo. mammo, which was clear.  I'm on Tamoxifen, which causes some joint pain and whatnot, but all in all, I can't complain.  Hope your problem turns out to be minor, but it's best to get things checked out.

Maybe you're in a little bit of shock over everything--who knows?  When I was diagnosed at the end of July w/ stage 1 cancer, I cried once in the shower, and then that was it.  Last Thursday I finished radiation and had a complete meltdown...cried for several hours. Again, who knows?   While this whole medical process has been a big disruption in my life, I've sailed along pretty calmly until now.  I guess we just have to take it as it comes, since we're all unique.  Maybe our minds protect us from strong emotions until we're ready to deal...a defense mechanism of sorts. Good luck to you...Lynn",

As women, I think we get the impression that it's up to us to keep everybody happy and on an even keel; not to disappoint anyone.  That's the message I've always gotten, but it went out the window w/ my diagnosis.  I was feeling like you at the beginning of the process of assembling a medical team, but my sister, a retired nurse, convinced me that no dr. should feel slighted by my going to someone else for an opinion.  All the doctors I saw, either 1st or 2nd, were supportive of my fact-finding, and no one seemed offended in the least.  Unfortunately, there are more than enough cancer patients to keep all of them very busy. Just encouraging you to go with whoever you click best with, Jump.  Good luck! Beesie, your diagram was very helpful.  Thank you! Lynn",
