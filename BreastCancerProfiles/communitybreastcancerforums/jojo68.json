My own belief/theory/understanding is that there are really only 2 stages of cancer, not 4: Â people whose cancer has not spread past the initial tumor (whereby surgery alone would be curative) and people who have circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and Â circulating tumor stem cells (CSCs) in the blood (who are thereby at risk for recurrence/metastasis). Â  This explains for me why most people diagnosed stage 1 do not have recurrences but some do - those that do have CTCs/CSCs in the blood even though they were labelled stage 1 by conventional criteria. The lab RGCC in Greece can detect CTCs and CSCs in the blood. Â  They have found these cells even where the initial tumor is only 2mm, leading to the conclusion that cancer goes into the blood a lot sooner than one would think. Â  My German doctors and the doctor who founded this lab believe that as long as you have CTCs/CSCs you are not cured, only in remission. Â  This makes logical sense to me. Â  The more you have, the higher your risk of recurrence, because the more of these cells you have, the greater the odds that one of them will acquire the gene(s) that gives them the ability to invade other organs. It's extremely difficult to get rid of the CSCs in particular, but they are working on it. Â  In the meantime, with the right supplements, nutrition and even medicines (such as chemo under certain circumstances) we can kill off or bring about apoptosis of many of the CTCs. Â Through epigenetics we can even down regulate some of the genes in the CSCs. Â  This is why eating right, exercising and taking the right supplements is so important. Â  This is my understanding of the notion of remission vs cure - Â you are cured when you have zero CTCs and especially zero CSCs. Â  Most people who have had cancer will always have some CTCs and CSCs for the rest of their lives. Â  The goal is to die with your cancer not from it. Â Although they are making strides on getting rid of CSCs and this will truly be a cure if they can do it. ",

Where has the OP gone? Im sorry but makes me skeptical. ...if this were someone who did all natural treatment and proclaiming this miracle, many of you would be asking a zillion questions for sureðŸ˜„ Btw...I never did chemo...no rads...no hormonals.
