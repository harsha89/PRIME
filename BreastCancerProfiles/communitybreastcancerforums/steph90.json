I was dx with DCIS in Aug 2008, had a right modified mastectomy after having a lymph node removal from under my right arm (was about the size of an egg). It took the doc's forever to even figure out that the mass under my arm (adenocarcinoma, with no specific characteristics relating it to any body part). My breast \"tumor\" was microscopic in comparison. I followed with both chemo and radiation due to the large size of the initial lymph node and that they also found 1 other positive node. I had a total of 14 nodes removed. Last treatment for radiation was this past August. I started having intense itching below my shoulder blade, thought maybe it was a mole and had it removed. Itching continued. During radiation, I developed numbness and tingling in my right hand and right foot. I went to see a neurologist, and had an EMG/Nerve Conduction Study done, and am considered permanently diabled due to severe painful neuropathy. I was already taking Lyrica for fibromyalgia, and he increased the dose and also added oxycodone (long acting percocet). This doesn't seem to work near as well as the percocet, even though the total dose is larger. About a week ago I started having severe pain at the same place as the itching, and now the pain in under my arm, and across the chest wall above my mastectomy scar. The pain is very sharp, and also feels like I am receiving one good fist punch after another. It's bad enough for tears, and taking my breath away. I had a bout with shingles (on my left side) about 4 months ago, and the pain I am currently having is very similar to that.It also looks to me like there is swelling under my arm. I've felt there was swelling for months, but the docs all agree that it's nothing. Probably just fat, since I seem to add 10lb everytime I turn around. I finally called my oncologist today (I just picked a doc, not knowing who to call for this). Anyway, the NP looked at my records and feels this is also neuropathy. I'm wondering what he would have thought if he had not seem records from my neurologist. Anyway, he increased my pain meds for break thru pain and ordered a chest xray to start with. I have no idea what he feels a chest xray will show, but will have it done. So, does this sound like any neuropathy any of you have heard of? Does this sound like anything anyone of you have? It seems like I read about the chest wall and underarm pain, but nothing about adding back pain to it also. I'm just so very tired of having pain. It just plain wears on a person after a while. I'm also taking an antidepressant, and went thru three weeks of the horrible withdrawal of Effexor, just to be put on a newer form of it. I get so down, as there just seems to be no end point with all of this. Sorry this is so long, but I just felt the need to confide in someone, so my poor hubby doesn't have to hear me whine about all this so much. Thanks for listening!  If it seems a bit convoluted, I can owe it to my chemo brain, that just came and never went away.",
