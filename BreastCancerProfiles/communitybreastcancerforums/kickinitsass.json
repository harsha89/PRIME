    "Content": "kickinitsass wrote: hi everyone. I have my port implanted next week and 3 days later I start TCHP. I really want to hear from anyone who feels that they tolerated their treatments well. I really want tips on managing side effects. I know there is some contradictory info about supplements of antioxidants any one here trying them during the treatments? I've read icing toes and fingers will help prevent blackening and falling off nails. Right now I'm just trying to get my cells as healthy as possible so my body can handle the treatments well. Thanks for all input. Log in to post a reply",
