Triple Negative, Stage IIA, Grade 3, 0/28 nodes, lumpectomy, no vascular invasion,2.8cm, clean margins, 4x ac and 4x taxol, then 33 rads. The further out you get with triple negative, 3 yrs is good and five years is even better, the less chance you have of a reocurrence.Good luck with your chemo, you will get through it, take care of yourself. Keep coming to this board for support. There are alot of ladies on this board with triple negative and doing very well. Hugs Patty",
