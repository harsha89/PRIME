Weird I know..so if I sat for awhile it was painful to get up..another trick I used was to soak my feet w/ warm water and epson salt each night while I watched t.v. Towards the middle after the 2nd dose I did start to swell mostly my ankles and feet..I ended up on Lasix( a water pill) and that helped.. The Taxol was easier to handle as far as it didnt affect my taste or smell like the Ac.. I did do dose dense so that may have affected me different..I was told by my chemo nurse that dose dense and taxol is not a great idea.. Big Hugs to you",

It did go away although I am not sure when (chemo brain) I could barely stand to touch that area. I also had rads and had to apply lotion daily. I about went through the roof not because of pain but it was just soo weird feeling. It does go away but it did take awhile. I never used an electric razor,was just real careful w/ the regular one. the intuition is very nice..i would highly recomend it. I am also a D cup and wish a had a bmx..(long story..i am BRCA 1 so I would have had no problem but didn't get the results in time prior to sx) At 1st I was okay w/ the mx but since living this way a year I am really sick of it.

I was 6 years old at the time. She had wrote me letters and once a year when I got older, I would get them out, sit out on the deck, have a glass of wine and read over them. I love the fall..the crisp air..the colors..football..mums..the smell of leaves burning in a distance and being outside has always made me feel closer to my Mom. I don't talk much about all this anymore since being dxed w/ BC myself..I can't bring myself to read her letters w/o breaking down..her words to me have become my words to my boy's..and sitting here 34 years later I have never felt closer to her. So English...you have somehow managed to reach thru the computer and heal my heart..you gave me a new way to remember my Mother and Grandmother and to share this w/ my boys... I would also like to add my youngest son was born Oct 10,1998..his orginal due date was Sept 28th..I used to tell him his Grandma gave him a great big hug before she sent him down to me..thats why he was late getting here. Anyway thanks so much for this idea and I will be thinking of you all tonight",

I also take 2 Aleve every 12 hours and Zantac to help w/ acid reflux. I was thrown into all this after about 5 weeks of extreme pain. I ended up in the hospital to get it all under control. Anyway I just wanted to add that it does take some time to get the meds working I believe they told me 72 hours. But I know exactly what you are feeling when you say you were pain-free for an hour. I have been on my meds for a month now and there are days I only need 1 pill for the break-thru pain and I feel like dancing. I have adjusted the timing of my meds so that I am able to drive my boys to school in the am and than I come home and take the 12 hour. I don't drive in the afternoon yet as I am not really trusting of my reflexes depending on if I need to take anything for the break-thru pain. I am happy to hear you are feeling better and you had a fun time w/ your Mom and sister. If you ever need to talk feel free to PM me anytime",

I just recently cancelled my trash service as the produced a \"pink cart\" I found myself offended at the very site of this thing. Of course when I called to cancel they were shocked that I a woman w/ breast cancer wouldn't be thrilled over this. It's 25.00 for the cart...5 smacks goes to the ACS( another sore subject) Anyway I second guessed myself and worried that my whole neighborhood would be litered w/ pink carts. You know what only 1 person has this cart and I proudly wheel my green cart to the curb. You aren't alone. I agree w/ Elizabeth that the paintings are shallow. I would also like to add I nevr thought of Magneta as a mature color..please. welcome back Hugs",

If and when I am offered a break or \"chemo holiday\" as they call it..I will take it. My reasons are this...I am 40 years old and have to boys that I am rasing by myself, I need to be able to get them to school, practices, make them dinner and in general be a Mom. That is what gets me through my day. I have no husband or other so its just my guys and myself. I worry about the long term effects chemo will have. I look forward to my \"holiday\" were I can just focus on myself and my boys..and not worry about appointments every other week etc...I don't look at it as not fighting BC, I look at it as taking a much needed break and coming back stronger to continue to knock the p!ss out of this disease.",

I didn't have the results in time before sx. I have arrived 24 hours early for my pet scan --sigh-- I guess I am just trying to let you know you aren't in this alone. We all have had are days..weeks or moments. Thats why I come here b-c I know someone always \"gets it\" Now I get myself quite \"nutty\" before a scan. Angry..screaming at everyone and everything..than crying at commercials...more yelling...walking...cleaning..crying over and over and than I remember my Ativan and I take it.

I had problems with the area under my arm. There is also a type of bandage they can give you there. I cant remeber the name but it is a self stick deal and actually helps with the weeping but at the same time keeps the right balance of mositure in. I had to demand this too.  Now depending on your area it may be tricky to keep it on.. if your are dealing with the under arm area you can also buy athletic self stick tape. ( it has no glue and sticks to itself) It can be found at Walmart, Walgreens etc...Now the trick is to wrap it around your body to hold the bandage on. For me because I am by myself.. I found this both amusing and frustrating. Hope this helps",

I just feel this is really between me, my parents, and my children. I have no husband. I look good..feel pretty good..and for the most part don't want to talk about \"my cancer\" unless I choose too. Somedays I hide from the world and others I jump right in...somedays I feel so good i cry and somedays I feel so bad I scream..sometimes I feel so blessed for the people in my life and others I feel so alone as if no one gets it. Right now I am feeling alone so I jump on these boards, so I see that I am not.. Your feelings are totally normal and you are truly not alone keep us updated",
