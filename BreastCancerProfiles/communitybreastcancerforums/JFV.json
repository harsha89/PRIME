I went scarfless to work when my hair was very, very, short and the first time I walked into the room a kid asked me if I had \"got a haircut\".  I said no and told him my hair was just growing back.  The kids are very matter of fact about illness and frequently forget you are ill.  At home I went topless and although no one thought I was gorgeous they all got used to the way I looked much faster than I did.",

You must be heading to the end of your treatment which is wonderful. The quick answer to your question is you DO NOT have to be strong.  You can cry and scream and be as frightened and cowardly as you want.   Cancer and cancer treatments suck.  You have every right to be miserable.  I thought about death and yelled at God a lot through out treatment.  I found that there was no good reason to be strong. My treatments and recoveries were fairly uneventful.  But, I still felt awful.   Your body will need a few months to recover from treatment.  I went back to work during radiiation and it helped me mentally.  The other thing that helped me was realizing stage 3 is a weird blessing because every treatment is thrown at you. That cancer has been hunted down and killed !   I also found that survival statistics for stage 3 are better than commonly posted.  A recent study showed 98 percent of women treated with dose dense ACT are still alive after five years. Why 5 years is a magic number I don't know.  But, those are great numbers.  Finally, I continued to freak out after treatment. If I just allowed myself a few hours to freak out I would then calm down.  Slowly, time heals you mentally and physically.     Dancing diva, what is an ANLD ? I was 48 at diagnosis with one kid in middle school and one in high school.   Hematomas take their sweet time absorbing into your body.  Glenfea, I think your doctor wants to make sure your underlying health issues are watched in ICU after your surgery.  I have been told a mastectomy is fairly easy surgery.  I think you just have a very responsible surgeon.  Hang in there everyone",

I was a basket case for months and months. But, I am still here ! Please remember that survival statistics are at least 5 years old by the time they are published and there have been many improvements in BC treatment since these studies were started. Please know that the early stages of diagnosis and treatment are the most physically and emotionally difficult. Be kind to yourselves and try to do something each day to lift yourself up or at least distract you. Believe it or not one day you will wake up and your first thought will be something other than cancer.",

Both of those chemicals affect your body and your emotions.   Be kind to yourselves.",

I was always hungry during infusions and would grab my IV pole and wander to the snack area frequently.  I was in a huge treatment room and we were all in separate cubicles.  Once, when returning from a snack run I actually got lost and couldn't  find my cubicle.  To make matters worse the nurse pointed out my cubicle and then I told her it was the wrong cubicle.  Of course it was the right cubicle but my chemo brain refused to believe her. Kathec, that sounds like a great dinner.  I have developed a taco craving tonight.  Guess I'll make them for dinner tomorrow.",

Spent 'quality time\" with two of my sisters this weekend.  Both talk about death and illness endlessly.  I love them but just wish they didn't try to compare problems with me.  It seems to be a major conversation theme with everyone I meet.  I have very little patience for other people and their problems these days.  I hope I don't turn into a hermit!",

I know her mortality rates line up with alot of info you can find online.  Yet on our first visit she went to adjuvant online plugged in my tumour status etc and plugged in my treatment and got a really good number for survival without reoccurence.  So I went to cancer math site and plugged in my tumour info.  Their mortality rates are very similar to what onc said when she scared me yesterday.  Then, I did the math on the cancer math site  for same tumour etc with my treatment plan and my survival rates go way up. I really don't understand what she was trying to communicate with me.  She and I do have  communication problems.   I think I am at the point  emotionally where I am ready to believe I can live a long life.  I am a worrier by nature and I guess I got an onc with the same nature.",

I feel like the pill queen.  But I think generally it helps me. I drink water like a fish and have begun to add cranberry and grape juice for taste variety.  Brought a friend to the infusion who had had chemo a year ago.  We discussed how you can get through this and get your life back.   She helped me visualize the end of the road.  Talked to her and the infusion nurse about Taxol.  They reassured me that Taxol is easier in some ways.  Nausea but less, less fatigue.  May lose the rest of my hair plus lashes and eyebrows but not definite.  Talked about fingernails, getting dry or \"weird\".  Suggested tea tree oil for the nails.  Nurse said I should report neuropathy right away.  I had ask onco about taking B6 prior to taxol for neuropathy and she said no. Oh I was also told I can take an Aleve for help with pain from Neulasta.  Will be doing that later today. Once again hugs to everyone and prayers for blessings and health and strength.  Probably wont hear from me for a few days as I turn into the couch Zombie! Joan ",

I forget who asked but I had BRCA 1 and 2 tested.  My grandmother died of ovarian cancer otherwise no family history.  But, since I have three sisters, a daughter and a son I felt the need.  Also, my cancer is relatively advanced and diverse ( more than one type) and I have node involvement.  Anyway came back totally negative. Saw onc today my tumor markers have risen two times in a row.  But, she said that it probably means cancer cells are being killed.  It just takes a long time for the liver to process it.  Then she laid some nasty statistics on my chances of survival without mestasis.  I won't share them.  But, I am beginning to hate that woman. Then... she told me I can't work while I am having radiation.  I need to think that one through.  We aren't exactly rolling in the dough! My GP seconded the no work idea.  I work with kids and I need to be able to fight off infection.  GP said I should think of it as me time.  Ugh.. I am beginning to feel like I am in prison.  Thanks for letting me vent.  I am trying to stop wallowing in self pity.  It's just that you ladies are one of very few safe places I have to share.",

My guess is that if your Onc hasn't talked to you about them by now either they are fine or the Onc sees them as unreliable. ",

You support me, guide me and even protect me in ways that I can't even explain.  So believe it or not I would reccomend doing an event like that.  It is another way to acknowledge the struggle to survive.  And since it is a huge event with people milling around everywhere if it's too overwhelming it's easy to disappear into the crown if need be.

Re lymphedema I was told by my surgeon to wear a sleeve and gauntlet every day for six months post surgery to avoid lymphedema and squeeze a soft ball 400 times a day.  I would like to say I followed those rules, but I can't.  I wore the sleeve for about 5 months and never wore the gauntlet as it cut off circulation to my thumb.  I do try to wear the sleeve when I exercise or do yard work.  I have no idea if it will keep lymphedema away.  Just thought I would share what I have been told.  Re hair.  I got it colored about three weeks ago and am pleased to see a quater inch of roots.  It is taking a long time to grow in.  Now at least I can see some progress.

A friend is coming and we will go for a walk.  I am sure that will help me.",

Now I am freaking out.  I have had a rash on my face since Sept.  GP wrote it off as allergies.  RO looked at me yesterday and said although she has never seen it in real life the rash looked like Lupus to her.  As soon as the RO left the nurse said she doesn't think it is Lupus.  I don't think it' s Lupus.  But that little paranoid voice in my head is saying Lupus.  I will make an appt with a dermatologist to get this figured out.  As Bon said paranoia is just another \"gift\" cancer gives you. On a good note my skin is holding up well through rads.  I have five more.  The rad tech said any redness or pain should peak five days after my last rads.  Then something like a tan.  Then somthing like a flaky, icky tan. ",

Physically I still have some post radiation and post mastectomy pain everyday.  I can often forget about it and it is fairly mild.  But, it is always there.  I caught my third cold.  It is very very mild.  But, my sinuses are very clogged and I am dizzy and tired.  I may have a little bit of an infection.   I can tell I have an infection because the dog steals my tissues out of the garbage.  I go for a physical in about 10 days so I am trying to hold on until then.  Like all of you I am sick of doctor appts ! Emotionally I have my good moments and bad moments.  Yesterday a co worker spent the entire lunch break literally screaming about her insurance bills and physical problems. There is no other place to go in my building to eat lunch so I listened and bit my tongue.  I had such a tremendous desire to tell her to lighten up it ain't cancer and then tell her about all the ladies on this board and all the terrible problems we have faced and conquered without ruining lunch for all our co workers.   When I got home I had a good cry and feel better now.  Since the weather is improving I think I will start going for walks during lunch break so I don't have to spend as much time with this woman.  Listening to her scream and curse and complain triggers too many emotions. Gotta clean house and do some errands. After that I plan on taking a nap and hope to do some scrapbooking. My husband is ice boating today.  My daughter is at play practice at the high school and will then attend a sweet 16.  My son worked at a fund raiser for the museum he works for parttime last night.  I think it was the first time he was ever at a country club.  He was impressed.

Sherri-  I started taking Tamox at night and switched to mornings.  I thought maybe it would cut down on night sweats if I did that.  I have no idea if that is why I have fewer night sweats or if the Effexor worked or my biology just changed.  But, I do have fewer night sweats now. I was never given a strong reason as to why I was to get a second scan.  I did find out after the second scan that my first scan (prior to chemo) showed I had growths on my liver.  The doctor said that since my second scan showed no change in the growths they would be classified as cysts not cancer.  So... maybe they wer suspicious of mets prior to chemo with me and used the second scan to check for mets to my liver.  So far it sounds like I am in the minority as far as scans go.  I haven't asked if they plan anymore.",

Forgive yourself for everything and do whatever it takes to make it through the day.  I think I have felt every  negative emotion in the universe during the first year after diagnosis.  At times they were overwhelming.

I have lost alot of weight since my diagnosis.  Over 20 lbs.  I am actually at my correct BMI but of course this is not a good way to lose it.  When I feel hungry I eat whatever tastes good and will worry about healthy diet later.  The metallic taste stays with me longer after each infusion and messes with my appetite.  I try to focus on protein and have  a \"boost\" drink during the day.  Onc said the metallic mouth should go away with Taxol.. I have been having many pity parties.  I am trying to coach myself into the idea that fear and anger and pity are OK.  But, whether I have a long time to live ( like I have been promised) or a short time I don't want to be a vicitim, so I am trying to live it one day at a time and be as happy as possible with what I have.  Gonna have a snack and sort some laundry.  Be well and be blessed.  I too believe in prayer and will pray for anyone who wants me to and apreciate prayers for myself.  I can also send out good thoughts for anyone!

I now know that deep margins and the lymph nodes are both reasons I get radiation.  I already know I am getting the full buffet of cancer treatment.  Already bilateral mastectomy and dose dense 4th generation chemo, radiation for six weeks and then Tamoxifen or another drug depending on my menopause status.  I am convinced that I am being hit as hard and as heavy as I can. It is just that reading the path report made me feel very vulnerable all over again.  Thanks to all of you for letting me vent and giving such thoughtful replies.  Family and friends either do not want to hear the scary stuff or I don't want to tell them because it will frighten them too much.",

I have good news to share.  My tumor levels are down and my oncologist is happy.  She the change in marker levels  indicates I am responding to chemo and my tumor is NOT growing (as she suggested before) instead the tumor markers are showing that the waste from the dead tumor is being filtered out of my body.  As many of you have said this tumor marker test is not given to all of us.  That is probably a good thing considering how much stress the numbers have caused me. My D levels are back down so I am to go on 50,000 units again. My oncologist was shocked that I was not complaining about body pain.  Although I definintley had some and was not happy the entire week post Taxol she is suprised I did not feel worse.  That's good I guess. Designer Mom-Speaking of weight, my oncologist wants me to keep off the 25 pounds I have lost since diagnosis.  Oh brother will that be hard!",

Obviously, denial is a big part of my cancer life.  I have been ignoring alot of info or forgetting it.  I don't know if it is irresponsible of self preservation.  I am gonna be happy about er at 80% Julia2 my PR is25% and that was called strong.   80% was very strong.  so I'm thinking your ER at 20% is still strong. Latte-  Migrain and sinus are my two best votes.  With me if the sinus infection is small  I can almost feel where it is in my head. Anything green coming out when you blow your nose.  ( I know yuck) Migraines can be very weird and if there ever was a time for Migraines this would be it.  I guess I am not really in menopause.  Just a temporary chemo pause ( I am 49)  I have 3 older sisters who hit it at 52. Wow I hope these hot flashes don't last for three years! Julia- congrats on the rads!  That does sound like the light at the end of the tunnel. TMarinna-  Thanks for the kindness and prayers.  It is time to ask questions.  How are you doing with the empty nest? Thanks for letting me vent.  Oh I did find a group discussing multi focal BC on this site.  There are a few of us.  Turns out you are staged according to your worst diagnosis.  That does make sense.  So, in scientific eyes it doesn't really channge thing,  It has just given me an increased feeling of vulnerabiltiy.",

I took protonix twice a day.  When that didn't work I am now taking protonix once a day, and prevcid once a day and carafate up to three times a day.  No one seems to have any problems with this.",

I also made arrangements to do my medical oncology at the same place as rads.  I have had some unhappy experiences with my medical Onc where I did chemo.I wanted to change once chemo was done.  So I made the contacts to have my records transferred.   This place will also flush my port every 6 to 8 weeks. I am starting tamoxifen on October 1st.  I have read a little of the other threads on Tamoxifen and think  that the side effects are really different for each person and they don't always know what problems are caused by tamoifen and what are just aging problems. I am having lingering joint pain from Taxol which I am most aware of when I get into bed at night. My knees and ankles ache.  My fingers and feet still tingle and are a little numb.  Now I need to make some decisions about returning to work! I hope everyone is Ok.  I meant to send people personal posts but my mind is all over the place today. Love Joan",

I have some interesting \"discharge\" which I think is due to tamoxifen or maybe a mild urinary thing,  I asked the rads Onc what I should do.  She said the Medical onc ( the one I left) should have had me have a gyn exam prior to Tamoxifen to set a baseline for my reproductive system so they can monitor any changes.  So, another doctor appt to make!  Two and half days done at work.  The place is a real germ factory so I am washing my hands constantly.  I am very very tired when I get home.  But, I work with a really nice class and teacher.  I am glad to be out of the house and a little productive.  I am reminding myself that I should take a sick day if I get too tired.  In some ways the hardest part is people are still welcoming me back and I see them get tears in their eyes.  So hard!",

I am getting whacked by hot flashes, chills and night sweats.  I plan on calling my GP for an increase in effexor because I am on a constant thermal rolller coaster.  It's exhausting.  Work is making my neuropathy worse.  My hands and feet burn at the end of the day.  Also, I have some sort of mild UTI discomfort and I forgot to call the doctor last night about it.  It may be a long weekend. No SE's from rads and the nurse says my CBC is good.  She will retest me next week.  We are both concerend it will drop and I'll catch one the jillions of viruses floating around the classroom. Having done all that complaining I have to say I am glad to be working.  I really feel like I can survive this now.  The mental boost I am receiving from work is huge.  I don't feel as much like a cancer victim any more.  That is huge for me.  It is also so great to be able to vent to you ladies.  Thanks for being there to listen!  Joan",

For me it is a tingling sensation with some numbness.  I haven't tripped or dropped things because of it.  I don;t know what I would do if my onc gave me an option to drop a treatment.  I guess I would still go ahead unless I was really really sick.  I really want to blast this cancer out of my body.  It seems there is always some weird decision that needs to be made when you have cancer. baby-  could you have a sinus infection or ear infection?  Are you eating enough?  Call a doctor to get checked out. Someone mentioned a skin rash on radiation side of their chest.  I am on week 6 of a rash on my face.   It is itchy and is gradually getting better.  My GP thought is was allergies.  I do have alot of pollen allergies.  If it gets worse I will go to a dermatologist.  But, right now I am just treating it like another indignity of cancer. Latte- re BO The thing I notice is my head smells bad.  I think it's because of the extra sweating from hot flashes coupled with no hair to buffer the smell.  My armpits are sweatier.  I am using deoderant that the rads people recomended.  It doesn't really work.  Also my breath smells.

I was just reading a magazine about coping with cancer treatment and it states that the period of time we are going through now ( as our active treatment winds down) can be the most emotionally tough.   BUT, the magazine indicated that those who allow themselves to process the bad feeling now will be better off emotionally in the years to come.  As you all know I frequently deal with deep fears and some depression.  There is no way out except through.  Your bodies are still very tired and messed up from chemo.  Rest when you can.  Vent here as much as you can.  Other than that common wisdom says try to get some exercise.  I know they are a bit of a taboo subject, but, consider antidepressants.  I am taking one that helps my mood and my hot flashes. On a more routine note my medical oncologists thinks my rash is Rosacea.  So I will get some cream for my face.  The lump I thought might be cancer is just a part of my rib.  I will have blood work, port flush and a recheck in the first week of January.  I might get a body scan then. I am not 100% sure about that .  I was asking when I could get my port removed and the Onc said I should just wait until after my first scan.  I don't know it that means I will get one in January or not.  The Onc also thinks my menopause symptoms will calm down the longer I am on Tamoxifen.  I will stay on Tamoxifen until we are sure that I am in menopause.  This Onc also mentioned that she read my chart the night before.  That made me feel good as it was obvious my other onc read my chart after she walked into the room to see me. May everyone find comfort today! Joan",

Kitty- You'll do great with your speech.  I am always so impressed when I remember you have fought the beast twice. Grneyd-You're right about the flip flop in weather between us and Ohio.  Here on Long Island we have snow to our knees.  My sister was supposed to fly East from Iowa and instead rented a car and drove here because our airports are a mess. Bon- So glad you are on an antibiotic.  Are you getting any sleep?  Hang in there with the Herceptin you are on a long road.  How are the side effects for that ?  Dmom- I think we got the same amount of snow as you did.  I am sure you are a great hostess and your friend is feeling very comfortable with you.  Which museum will you go to ?  I hear that the parks department was hosting sledding events on the day of the blizzard. Tomorrow I see extended family from my Mother's side.  My cousin who is 4 years younger than I has been struggling with macular degeneration all year.  His vision is much reduced.  He and I are the babies of the family and have been the \"sick\" ones.  We will toast each other for good health and good coping skills. What is everyone planning for New Years.  We never do much of anything.  But, this year we are meeting my sister's new boyfriend and having a little party.  Don't know if I will be able to stay awake to midnight.  My energy is getting better everyday.  But, I do love my sleep! How is everyone's hair growth.  Mine is still only a quater of an inch long and all grey.  I am getting more comfortable with how I look.  But, I still wake up thinking I have hair and get a little sad when I look in the mirrior.  Funny thing is I have never woken up thinking I still had my real boobs and gotten sad when I realized I have fakes.  I am sure a psychiatrist would have a field day with that!",

Latte-  Rads are tough.  It's like \"Ground Hogs Day\" with pain. Cotton t shirts, no bras and go easy on yourself.  We are counting down the days with you! Like a dummy I went out and shoveled without my compression sleeve.  I have pins and needles in my arm and soreness on the back of my hand.  Hope I haven't messed myself up. Good to hear from everyone!  Are you out there Chey ? Go easy on yourself Sherry.  You need to recuperate physically and emotinally. Hi Danielaes and Angel  toni and Julia !",

Kitty I am jealous about your port removal.  I have been promised that if my PET scan is OK the port can come out.  The oomphrectomy sounds like it will be a big surgery.  Is it ?  Once that surgery is over are you done with treatment ?

Carol and Jackie:  My hubby went to the first two chemos and then began to balk at going.  So I had him drop me off and a brother in law pick me up.  He also never did any of my radiation stuff.  The center invites family to come to the last visit and celebrate when it's done.  I went alone.  He is excellent with washing, cooking and food shopping.  But, even he shuts down on me when he thinks I am asking for too much.  And too much in his book could be anything from going to chemo, to folding the laundry.  Carol you are so right about the inner little girl who wants to be held and comforted. I have that ineer girl and she ai't that little ! Also, I agree with Jackie.  If a guy can't fix it they ignore it.  We gals want to talk and share and we chemo gals know that we are never really done with cancer. Those nearest and dearest to us don't want to realize that.  Having said all that I know we all love our husbands and can accept their human faults.  Like everyone else I am so glad you ladies are around for me to vent to ! Maybe we should start a list of care and feeding tips for the chemo husband.  Hmm I know what the first thing on the list is....  But I promised to clean up my writing on this board.  Anyone have an idea for care tip number 2?",

The friend was diagnosed 17 years ago.  The friend was offered Tamoxifen 17 years ago but she turned it down because it was still experimental.  According to the Principal that was her friend's one regret was that she didn't take the Tamoxifen as maybe that would have gotten those last few cells.  Having said all that the Principal also said this friend lived really well in the 17 years of her battle and only went \"down hill\" in the last three weeks before her passing. Kitty I am hoping that your shrinkage is just normal post rads. Dmom-  My daughter had a good time being a tourist in the city.  I am so sorry about your son.  The flu is the pits !  I always told people having chemo was just like coming down with the flu only no fever.  UGH for him ! Mimi- thanks for the cheer.  I am glad to hear I am not the only one with the low WBC.  Do you find you get mouth sores ?  I get a few. Carol- glad your fill went well.  Ice cream is a wonderful thing.  Tell your hubby we are all pleased that he went with you ! Today feels like a Spring day.  But, instead of being outside I am going to the mall with my DD and helping her shop for another Sweet 16 dress. Oops looks like I'm dominating the boards again.  Hope everyone out there is well.  Jackie, Chey, and all those ladies who signed up at the beginning.  How are you ?????????",

One of the strongest feelings I had after hearing those homilies is that your loved ones want you to be happy.  All three spoke in detail about the simple pleasures this Aunt enjoyed and what made her happy.  Her children seem to be taking great comfort in her happiness.  So,  the lesson I learned today is,   do what you need to do to be happy. The ones who care about you the most will appreciate it.",

Very stressful.  Part of me thinks I am being very morbid, and part of me thinks it is smart to have a set of plans if the worst does happen.  I would like to leave this world knowing I have done my best for my husband and children.  But,  if I become immobilized by fear everytime I think about it, it's useless.  Sorry to share this stuff here.  But, you ladies are all I got.  Other people will listen to me.  But, they have too much invested in me being OK.  I can't get honest answers.  I think I need a life coach.  I don't really want counseling.  I know pretty well how cancer makes me feel.  I want to develop a plan as to how I want to conduct the next few years of my life so if I go I will feel like my family is as ready for life without me as can be.  Am I making sense or just sounding self pitying ?

We are sweltering today.  Drove to Ohio for a family wedding this weekend.  My hubby did most of the driving but I did a couple of hours at a stretch also.  This time last year I could get to and from the grocery store and that was about it !",
