I also have duct ectasia in the same breast (dilated ducts that leak milk spontaneously) and after I refused the core needle biopsy, my surgeon pushed harder then he had previously to remove the ducts - and the lump at the same time. ;) I wasn't going to go ahead with the duct removal at this stage, but if this next biopsy comes back as even slightly suspicious still, I think I will look at getting it the lump and ducts removed together. Oh, and the receptionist didn't seem at all surprised when I rang back and asked to be booked after all. I'm not sure if the surgeon told her to expect my call or if it's just a fairly common thing. :blush:",

I'm very concerned, given how many symptoms I have and very cross at myself for not realizing months ago that I should get it checked out. I have 4 little boys and the thought of being too sick to look after them is very scary, so I want to get to the bottom of whatever is going on as soon as we can. It's nice to know I'm not overreacting though. ;)",

I just keep thinking, there has to be something going on with my right breast. I mean, now that I really think about it, it's not normal to drop a cup size or two on one side, or to see your breast cave in and the nipple retract like mine has over the past few months etc etc etc. There has to be something going on to cause it all and regardless of it is cancer or not, I just want to know what the hell is causing it!",

Given my symptoms of swelling in armpit, shrinking breast, indent on breast that is getting bigger have been there for months plus the new symptoms of nipple discharge and a lump, should I be asking for a referral even if the ultrasound is clear (which is what the u/s dr suggested at my scan)? There's clearly something going on my right boob and whether it's cancer or not, I'd like to know what it is but don't want to be seen as overreacting and I'm not sure if I've just worked myself into a huge panic over nothing.

My surgeon told me last week he wasn't happy with the results of my FN biopsy and suggested a core needle biopsy. I asked if we could wait 6 months then do more imaging and decide then and then proceeded to discharge myself from his care! :o That was stupid!! ;) (For the record, I rang back and apologized later and an having the second biopsy on Tuesday). Please don't feel stupid - I think most of us walk away from tests/appts like that thinking \"OMG, why did I say that?\" or \"I'm so stupid, why didn't I ask that?\". I wish you luck that it's benign. :)",

Because mine was against the chest wall, the surgeon actually came from the other side and went through the breast to get it. It's all about angles (not angels as I just realized my phone had autocorrected to!). So just because they went in from a different location doesn't mean they didn't biopsy the right lump.",
