What really helped in how it looked and felt was getting regular, gentle trims. I started at 4 weeks after my last treatment and continued every month until I hit the 6 month mark when I went for full cut and color. Each trim, I had her do it dry and just comb gently and trim 1/2\" the first time and then just about 1/4\" each time after. Really made a huge difference for me. As for styling, I would blow dry on cool until just about damp and then carefully set my hair on velcro rollers, spray with DermOrganic volume spray and then either let air dry or blow dry on cool the rest of the way. It created a lot of volume to my very thin hair and while it was a bit of an effort, since I was only doing it once a week, was worth at least the day or 2 of 'good hair'. The other days, I just pulled it back in a low barrette - that spread out my tiny ponytail so it looked like more hair. All during this time, you will be growing new hair that may not be so obvious for awhile and before you know it, you'll be back to your old routine\u2026hang in there, the finish line is in sight! HockeyCat - I took the biotin and silica faithfully until I stopped shedding and also noticed more facial hair - ugh! At least I knew it was working :). In any event, I'm now about 3 laser treatments in and happy to report the darker facial hair is gone!",

I like all my docs but my RO is my favorite - I didn't want the tattoos on my chest so he said no worries we will mark with a sharpie and keep it under a clear piece of surgical tape. If it fades, we'll remark it. I did get tiny ones on each side but they are tinier than a freckle and I have to really search to find them. I hope yours will fade in time. Hang in there! I found rads very easy - best advice is to stay very hydrated inside and out. I drank a gallon of water every day and slathered myself with the lotion they gave me and the Aquaphor at night. 28 rounds and my skin didn't even get pink. You'll do great - hope the new RO is awesome",

I cleaned out my hairbrush yesterday from the past week or so and had enough to build a small mouse, so I think you are doing great. I'd say when you hit the 5 month mark if shedding is still that low, you can celebrate your success with a proper warm washing and styling! Regarding deodorant, I tried several before I found one that worked, it's called MooGoo and I have to order it from Australia but it's a roll on and lasts forever. I've never been much of a sweater, so I can only speak to what worked for me. Thanks, Daniela for the natural alternative - I'll have to try that.",

Rain, I'd say maybe start that way - dry cut, just a bit off the ends and see how you feel. good luck!",
