Then I had an already scheduled hair appt 8 days after surgery so I had my hair dresser wash me twice and scrub really hard because I felt so disgusting. Then another 10 days later I went to Great Clips and had them wash me twice and scrub hard too. I had four drains and they were covered with clear tegaderm so I was able to shower after 48 hours. Wore IV tubing like a necklace with drains threaded thru when I took a shower. Can also use a lanyard or shoelace and safety pin drain loops to it for shower. At 2 weeks he let me raise arms out straight from shoulders and but not above head, and at 4 weeks after both sets of drains were out (had four drains for three weeks then 2 for one more week) I could raise arms above head and wash my own. But I still leaned over in shower and did T-Rex arms as much as I could. So I got my hair washed three times basically in 4 weeks. I won\u2019t say I liked it but it was doable. My husband had already done so much I didn\u2019t want to ask him to wash me. Plus I would of had to lean over the tub with hand held sprayer and didn\u2019t know if that would be ok to lean on the implants. ü§∑‚ôÄÔ∏è",
