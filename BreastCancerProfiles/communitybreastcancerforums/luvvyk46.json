      "Content": "luvvyk46 wrote: Ok I also have the post 46 with no known cancer in my family.  Have a different question though.  I have always had very cysty breasts. My cysts will get very large to the point of being visible through my skin.  I have an aspiration every year of one or two because they end up getting so filled with fluid they get hard and painful.  I now have one that has been there over a year. Was on my last mammo and is very palpable. Over an inch long. With such big cysts, is it possible that something could be behind them that doesn't get seen on the mammos? They never seem to want to drain them until they get painful. I have a couple of others that are at least a half inch wide. Log in to post a reply",

Also I am right at the changing age where the risk goes up even more so with the 3 tests, (mammo, us, mri) they will be able to follow me more productively. Great visit.

Said cysts are benign. Looked at my report and said the spot compression mammo showed everything was normal. I told him that the radiologist suggested a follow up 3 month US of the cyst and the BS negated that but wanted to do a 6 month mammo to follow the calcifications and distortion. (calcifications and distortion that are normal?)  So I said I was confused with the different opinions and would like the MRI. He called the BS. They discussed it and he just called back and said for me to call in to get my MRI scheduled. He said I am not the typical case and because of this they both agreed that an MRI was the best test for me. He said he wished they could do that on every woman. Best screening test possible. So I am going to call now!!!!",
