Was immediately put on Picc line for a month with IV antibiotics.. After being off the drugs one breast relapsed. Im trying to get answers on which drugs to take that can actually kill off this infection once and for all. Thankfully no fluid buildup, otherwise i would have had the expanders removed asap  What meds did your wife take on the IV? I just need to find the right combo of drugs  ",

Thankfully where I live i had 3 core biopsies performed within a day and results given to me within 24 hours. I had mammo guided, CT guided and ultrasound guided core biopsies. I had stage 1 and DCIS all on left breast.  Definitely get the right biopsy and hopefully you get answers soon! Playing the waiting game is no fun!        ",
