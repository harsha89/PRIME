    "Content": "Aleksandra30 wrote: hello all! I have recently finished my ACT chemo (Dec 18) and I am scheduled to have double mastectomy on January 17th. Immediately after chemo, I couldn't feel the mass anymore and it didn't really show on ultrasound imagining (is showed as a general grey area, but the technician and doctor could not locate the mass anymore). Today, one week before surgery, I can feel it again. It is the size of small pea. I freaked out a bit and started to wonder if it is possible that the mass started to grow again. I also have a pain in my left upper arm when I bend my elbow and raise my arm (same side as cancer). I am not sure if I strained a muscle or this is bone pain. Am I just freaking out unnecessarily? I have not had lymph involvement that appeared on previous imaging, but I am still pre-surgery. Dx 7/6/2017, IDC, Left, 2cm, Stage IA, Grade 2, 0/4 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
