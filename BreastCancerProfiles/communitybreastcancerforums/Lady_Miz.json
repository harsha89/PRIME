Kitty - I would love to help you along this interesting little path known as breast cancer.  I am so sorry you are a member of this club but you will NEVER be alone in it!  I, too, am in Dallas and Steph (a.k.a. the5owens) told me about you.  If EVER you need to talk, scream, ask questions or just sit in silence, don't you hesitate to contact me!  I can tell you that my Dr. - Dr. Joyce O'Shaughnessy - is one of the most respected Oncologists with a specialty in breast cancer in the country.  She does symposiums, conferences, research journal entries and other publications all over the place and everyone I have ever mentioned her name to says that I have the best MO there is.  However, I know that any of the Texas Oncology doctors are very well-respected and both Dr. O'Shaughnessy and Dr. Laidley are in that group, just out of different hospitals.  Mine is out of Baylor. I hope you are keeping your head up and I will PM you with my contact information. God bless... Michelle ",

I had originally posted here about some pain in my hips, femur and feet and have since seen my doctor, spent 5 weeks on vitamin D therapy (my level was an 11) and yet no relief.  As a matter of fact, I can now add some lovely rib pain, dizziness and inability to feel sure on my feet to the list of fooishness from before.  Now, my MO is waiting on insurance approval for a brain MRI as well as  nuclear bone scan that will take place this week, after which she will discuss the results with me at my July 27th 3-mo. follow up.  To say the least, i am starting to get pretty terrified and being the type-A personality that I am, I just want straight forward answers at this point.  Have any of you had these symptoms that I am describing and if so, could you please give me your imput on what your experience has been as far as necessary scans, diagnoses, tx, etc.?  My diagnosis is listed in my signature with detail but basically, I am one blessed with TNBC stage IIb, grade III as of August 2011. Thank you all so very much! Blessings ~",

I am at a loss really.  I just know I hurt and as the weeks go by, more and more areas of my body join the owie parade.  I apologize for whining though...this week has been a rough one with the loss of three of our sisters on the TNBC thread so I am just glad to be here and doing relatively well.  This can be such a frustrating, confusing and terrifying journey...",

So, after requesting a PET or CT scan to determine what the pain in my ribs, femur and hips was about, I wound up getting a bone scan and though several areas (right shoulder, both hips, right knee) showed \"uptake\", they think it is \"PROBABLY\" degenerative joint process.  So i am to be okay with the assumption that in a year's time, I have developed degenerative disease at 38 years old when there was no evidence of it last September? Has anyone else encountered this?  My onc doesn't check tumor markers unless someone is diagnosed Stage IV so I didn't have any reassurance from that either. I am not quite sure how I feel about the whole thing.  The pain isn't really local to my joints - it is in the middle of my right femur and no amount of rubbing or massaging will relieve it.  This has been going on for several months now and is starting to get frustrating because by the end of the day, my feet and legs make it almost unbearable to even walk to my bedroom.  The spot under my right breast on the ribs is so tender that I won't even touch it and am extremely careful putting a bra on.  Due to the aggressiveness of my cancer (TNBC; grade III; Ki-67 of 75%) I get checked out every 3 months so I guess I will wait until the October 26th visit and see if anything is better by then. I apologize for whining as I am the type who doesn't acknowledge pain unless it is really bad but this is just getting exhausting and I don't want to find out down the road that there is something going on that needed to be addressed.  xoxoxo to y'all...",

I wouldn't know if the tumor marker tests are accurate for me because she has never done them before - that is what I thought was so bizarre. That's a great idea regarding my PCP.  I think I will get on that as I am due for a physical anyway - although those somewhat scare me now.  When I went for my physical in August of 2010, I wound up having to have a total hysterectomy and at my physical in 2011 - well, you already know that!",
