I had a surgical consult last Thursday and am in the process of setting up a surgery date for a lumpectomy. Once I have the results from the lumpectomy testing and staging, I am getting then a 2nd opinion as to what to do going forward. I need to get the mass removed so I know what I am dealing with first. I do have family history (my sister had BC at age 31) so I am also getting BRCA-tested, though probably not until January. I don't know if any of that helps you!

My sister is visiting from back east so we had a get-together last night with family. DH got takeout (since I am not cooking yet): authentic smoked BBQ ribs \u2014 lean and meaty and mighty delicious! I have not driven since my re-stitching last Tuesday, so tomorrow will be my first day back in the driver's seat (getting our nails done). I have a hike planned for Wednesday. Like Annie, I have been getting my sleep, taking a 2-3 hour nap every afternoon (unusual for me) ... my body is really craving rest.  Melanie, sorry to hear about your cording. How are things today?  Redsky, how wonderful that you have your exchange date. I'm sure PS will take the time he/she needs to get you filled where you want to be. Have you spoken to Whippetmom yet about sizing? SueBee: Hey girl! Good luck on the job interview this week! And it's only 15 hours a week! Sounds perfect. Fingers crossed! Your family bike ride sounds so awesome. My DH and I were at a stop sign the other night and a guy peddled by looking so carefree. I want to feel that way again! Hopefully I'll be strong enough to ride a bike again this summer. Maria, congrats on getting the healthy cucina up and running! You have lots of great info listed and it will help lots of women! Looking forward to reading more. (PS I've added both your links to the \"my favorites\" section of my blog. ;-) Have a great day everyone! ",

Suebee, congrats on your \"C\" cup bra!! I saw my PS yesterday, he is pleased with how my incision is healing! It doesn't look completely normal yet, but it looks better than it ever has. My next appt. is in a month. He'll take out the 4 stitches then. He said NO fills though for a couple months. (Gotta make sure this thing heals inside and out.) He was actually surprised to see things were looking good; I have been a puzzling case for him. Now that I am on the right track, DH and I can make some plans to go away in May.

Went back to the hotel and I took a shower. By dinnertime, the incision was soaking through the gauze pads. It is so crazy! (It has finally stopped.) I am seeing my PS on Tuesday.

I was diagnosed Dec. 8 and did not have surgery until Feb 3. My mass was 3.2 cm and I am on the small-busted side. My case was presented before the tumor board at my hospital and it was determined that I needed an MRI to get a better look at the size of my mass. Well, turns out a lumpectomy was no longer an option after the MRI... my mass was right under my nipple & they would have had to remove 1/2 of my boob plus the nipple. So my surgeon said a mastectomy with recon was really the best way to go. I was completely shocked as I was mentally prepared for lumpectomy! But then, after time thinking about it, I decided if I was going to have 1 side done, I wanted both done so 1) they would match and 2) I wouldn't always be wondering if I would get BC in the other boob. (My sister had BC and a bilateral \u2014 and that was 26 years ago. I like those odds!) My point is, the waiting accomplished several things in my favor: It gave my doctors time to look at my case from all sides (and get the MRI that determined mastectomy was better than lumpectomy for me). But equally as important, it gave me time to wrap my head around what was happening! It is soooo much to digest...cancer, really? I can relate. It is shocking. By the time my surgery date came around (2 months after I received \"the call\"), I was mentally prepared and had the surgery that was absolutely right for me and that I knew I could live with. My advice: Try to view the waiting game as mental preparation, in the same way that athletes prepare for a race. An athlete doesn't jump into competition without first preparing himself physically and mentally; facing a cancer diagnosis is no different! PS: It's also OK to visit The Land of Denial. I could not have gotten through this crisis without frequent (and prolonged!) visitations there! ;-)",

Let's not forget that you exercise 5 days a week (even during chemo). And you kept your hair during chemo with Cold Caps. And you completely revamped your diet and cleaned out your entire pantry and spent $$$ on new foods. And you started a healthy eating website. And you blog. And your exchange surgery is coming up. And oh yeah, you might be moving. And then you went back to work full-time. And THEN you started Tamoxifen.

It was like PMS to the nth degree!  You need a few hours of Maria time. Can you fit in a foot massage or get your nails done this weekend?

I knew they would be, since I haven't use them much the past 5 months! But when I raise my arm straight up in the air, the muscle feels like a cord. Guess I need PT next. PS said no before. I wonder how soon after TE comes out I'll be able to go for PT. Anyone know?  Annie that is great you are able to take another leave from work. Wishing us all low expectations regarding difficult friends & family. No expectations = no disappointment! PS I just posted updated pics on the pic forum.",

Most are very attuned to what we are going through and a new Rx may be in order to help you get through this difficult phase. Maria, you already take Xanax at night to sleep so you know how well it works to calm the chattering mind. It's a 12-hour drug; maybe you need to take a half dose during the day as well? Ask your doctor. You are going through so much right now, it is beneficial to your overall health if you can feel more calm. When my internist told me on Tuesday that I could up my Xanax at night, I said \"Really? That's OK to do?\" He looked me straight in the eye and very sympathetically said, \"You have a lot on your mind right now. It's OK.\" And ya know what, he is right! It's OK! I went on a 90-minute hike with my girlfriends this morning. YAY! It was pretty hot by the time we were finished. That sun is brutal. We saw another snake on the trail...not a rattler but a boa constrictor this time. He was BIG but also a real beauty! A mountain biker was speeding down the hill and we waved him down so he wouldn't run over it. He told us to make noise next time we see a snake, that they are just sunning themselves on the trail and don't like to be bothered. Never a dull moment out in the wilderness! You gals need to come hiking with me! ",

Alas, I can only watch DH frolic and swim. I sit on the edge with my legs in. Anyone have an estimate for how long after surgery you can swim (provided everything heals up nice & normal?)

But certainly keep you appointment and see what the breast surgeon says. Get that 6-month mammogram, and make sure they continue to refer to your previous mammograms to note any changes or distortions. THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR ANYONE WITH SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY THAT TURNS OUT TO BE BENIGN. Always get copies of your pathology report (not just the page that says it's benign, but the *full* report) and if you can, also get the mammogram films (or on a CD). That way, if you move or change doctors, you have these important documents in hand and they can more accurately interpret whatever they see ASAP. Congrats on your wonderful news!!

However, there is simply no excuse for them leading you to think the timeframe for your exchange would be in June, before summer. You are halfway through your chemo so you're right, June would be ideal and you would have plenty of time post-chemo by then! ERGH. And we both know that the exchange surgery is not as long as the BMX surgery so he should be able to fit you in..ERGH again! You could certainly switch to another PS but I would check with your insurance company first to make sure they won't give you a hassle (or God forbid, make you pay for it!). To have to deal with all this crap when you feel like crap, well, it just ain't right!!  What did the nurse tell you after you let her have it? Did she apologize to you? Did she say the PS would call you? Is there an office manager you can call tomorrow? Or maybe you can trot down there in person and really get things cooking! ;-) This sounds so frustrating!! I know that once your exchange happens, you'll feel you can really put all this behind you and get on with your life \u2014 the life you are already trying so hard to get on with! And you are doing a stellar job, BTW!! You are exercising and cooking healthy dinners  every night baking and taking care of your child and hubby... and I know you are taking care of yourself too, but to that end... I would NOT cancel your family vacation just yet! It is only March 29. You have time to sit with this PS/exchange problem and figure something out. Don't cancel yet!  And if I were you I would totally have a sip of something alcoholic!

Supersally & Maria, yes, the citrus blossoms are amazing and there are so many wonderful scents in the air at this time of year! CA's natural beauty is the main reason I have lived here for so long. Ladies, I did not exercise at ALL yesterday or today. Very low energy. Last night did not even feel like making dinner (DH brought home takeout) and tonight? Who knows. I think I am feeling down because of my incision. And the Tamox is also affecting my mood. Blech! I did a little gardening at my mom's house this afternoon, but could only use my left hand. Then her garage door got stuck and wouldn't close all the way, and I couldn't reach up to pull it back down. (I am still not allowed to reach over my head.) My 78-year-old mother finally fixed it. Very frustrating! I have a long hike scheduled in the morning with a girlfriend and I am really looking forward to that. I know it will help me clear my head.",

Really helps to promote confidence. Looking forward to your mexican lasagna recipe. My DH actually prefers Mexican to Italian Lasagna, go figure! Last night's chopped salad was awesome. I always make lots of it so we can have it for several nights, as it takes me so long to chop. Here's how I make it: 1) In a fry pan over medium heat, place asparagus spears, brussel sprouts and broccoli. Sprinkle with garlic powder, salt, pepper and a spray of olive oil. Cook 5 minutes, until fragrant and starting to brown on one side. Coarsely chop, then set aside to cool.  2) Next, chop up some romaine lettuce, spinach, carrots, red & orange peppers, mushrooms and tomatoes, and place in a big bowl. If you like garbanzo beans, add a can (drained). Add in the cooled roasted veggies and toss well. (This salad, at this point, will keep for 3 days.)  3) When ready to eat, top with diced beets and cubed avocado. You don't need much dressing (balsamic works well) because there is so much flavor from the roasted veggies. I had it for lunch without dressing but with a scoop of egg salad on top.",

      "Content": "May 17, 2011 01:34PM - edited May 17, 2011 08:05PM by Rennasus YEAH for last chemo day for Melanie and Barbara! Good luck! Maria: I hear you on the stress of keeping BC a secret. It has been the story of my diagnosis. But I am coming to terms with this important fact: If it causes me *more* stress to keep it a secret, I need to talk about it and tell people. Cause keeping it in is not healthy. You are in a tough situation and I feel for you. But let me share one thing. I was at the farmer's produce stand a few weeks after I had my BMX. I asked the woman who owns the place to put the produce in several bags, as I could only use one arm right now to carry it as I just had surgery. (I wasn't about to get into my BC details!) But she said, oh, did you have back surgery? I said no. She said shoulder? I said no. Then I decide, what the hell, just tell her. So I did. Guess what? She is fighting pancreatic cancer! I couldn't believe the bond that was immediately forged with that one admission. My point is, if it feels right, tell them tonight. You don't have to get into all the details. Simply say I have BC and I'm taking care of it. You never know what other people may also be going through. ;-) Ladies, DH and I are heading to Vegas tomorrow for a few days. I am excited about getting away. But now I have a cloud hanging over me. My oncologist (I'll call him onco #1) has little bedside manner. I knew this going in; he is brilliant but lacking in social skills. He staged me at Stage 1B because even though my mass was 3.2 cm, it was a Grade 1 tumor, slow-growing. He said Tamox, no chemo. I was good with that! I removed both my breasts to reduce my risk and was willing to take Tamoxifin but I was *not* willing do chemo if the risks outweighed the benefits. Onco #1 felt there was no statistical benefit to chemo for me. He gave me an Rx for Tamox and said to see him in 6 months. Then I started reading on here how women have blood tests to check their liver on Tamox and if they are metabolizing Tamox properly. Hmmm. Onco #1 had said nothing about this. I asked my primary care doc about it; he said not necessary. Hmmm. So I got a referral for a 2nd opinion to a different onco. The appt. was this morning. I think you know where this is going. Onco #2 said, \"You are Stage 2A [not 1B like onco #1 said]. I would never have given you an Oncotype test in the first place; your mass was over 2cm, putting your at Stage 2. The Oncotype Test is only for Stage 1 cancers only.\" Then he continues: \"Breast cancer is a systemic disease; if it goes to other parts of your body, you will die from breast cancer. If you do chemo now, you have a shot at getting rid of the cells that may be floating around.\" I said well, isn't that what I'm taking Tamox for? He said yes, tamox is a very important drug. But if you catch the cancer early [which I did], you should do chemo early.\" Well I suspect he would say the same thing if I caught my cancer later, right? Onco #2 then asked me who my first onco was. (Onco #1 is well-known in my area.) Onco #2 said, \"Oh, you're seeing Dr. D.? I'm surprised he didn't tell you you needed chemo!\" Oh brother. My DH warned me that chemo is how onco's make their money. DH is not keen on chemo. His first wife did chemo right out of the gate, had a recurrence within a year, then 2 more recurrences before she passed away. It is a tender subject. There are no guarantees, I know that. Every case is different; I know that too. I also know that I have to do what I feel deep down is best for me. Maybe going away is the thing I need to digest all this...",

So as much as I want to get back to a more active life, when I do, my incision seeps. (Two steps forward, three steps back.) My PS put steristrips on it, and I'm wearing waterproof bandages when I shower so no water gets in. But since the steri-strips are covering up the incision, I can't see how it's healing! Probably just as well. I was always looking at it with my magnifying mirror! The more days I can string together without it seeping, the better chance I have of healing this thing. I slept a lot this weekend and had no leakage today. So there you have it. OK that is my boring and repetitive update! ;-) Have a great Monday ladies! ",

Though I'm far from being on the other side of this BC escapade, it *does* get less stressful. The key, for me, is to not let my thoughts take me beyond today. Pre-BC, I never really lived \"in the moment,\" but BC has taught me that I have to take life day-by-day or I will drive myself bonkers. When I stay in this moment, I do not feel anxiety. When I find myself worrying about the future \u2014 will my incision will ever heal? Will I be able to get fills without springing a leak? Will I have to live with TE's until 2012? Will my cancer return? \u2014 I stop myself from thinking that far ahead. I can spin out thinking about the what if's. The nighttime is the worst time for me; I can't control my thoughts as well when I am laying there trying to fall asleep. Thank goodness for Xanax is all I can say! Suebee, I think people take their cues from us. We \"look\" good and don't complain or talk about \"it\" unless asked and so people think we are fine and therefore everyone just goes back to life as they know it. No one can understand our situation who hasn't walked in our shoes. That's why we have to be a little squeaky wheel and ask for what we need, even if only from just one friend.  Maria, so glad your rash has faded! I was worried about that. And you survived the MIL BBQ! YAY! It blows me away how some of the people closest to us can hurt us the most by not acknowledging our situation in any manner. I have a couple of close family members who know me well but have never asked me anything to my face, ever, about how I am doing or feeling. Zip. They have never even sent me a card. They ask DH how I am but they don't speak to me directly about it. I don't get it. Obviously they feel so awkward about it they can't get past it. So I no longer expect them to say anything (and they don't). And I am no longer disappointed (most of the time!) Annie, your line \"off to bed to have some night sweats\" had me howling!!! I can so relate. A funny thing has happened with the Tamox. The first 2 months, if I took a few sips of wine, I could feel it right away. So I stopped having any if we went out. But last night, we went to a birthday party with our group of friends and I had 2 glasses of wine before I realized everyone around me was tipsy except for me! I didn't feel a thing! Anyone else on Tammy notice this?",

I have to admit I have not talked to my DH about anything other than my incision healing. We have not had any tension yet about this, tho I'm sure we will. I feel so \"behind\" in this process. I have not taken reconstruction as far in my head as you all have. It's like I am glimpsing my future reading your posts. Thank you for being so candid.  Did I ever tell you guys that a friend of a friend had BMX with recon 2 years ago and I got to see her in person a week before my BMX? When I saw her result (first recon implants I had seen since I wasn't yet on the pic forum), I was freakin' AMAZED at the wonders of science. Was she perfect? No. Did she have setbacks? Yes. She had scars. She had some dimpling. She even had a pucker in one of them and was considering a revision. But she was a DD, and she looked like she had REAL BOOBS, and in clothes she did not even look like a DD! She was very normal looking.  Had I not been able to see what a recon looked like in person, on a real woman, I don't think I could have gotten through this process. The image of how great she looked keeps me focused. No one tells us what a ^&%$-ing nightmare this is. Certainly not our PSs!! I guess there is a reason they are all so cagey when talking about \"next steps\" and what lies ahead. If they really told us, we'd all run screaming from their offices. I went into reconstruction with blinders on and very little info but with a good outcome image in my head. And my experience thus far has been pretty horrible. I even told my BFF that if I had known what lay ahead of me, I don't know if I could have done it. But, I'm in it now, so have to soldier on. Blech.",

However, the person who it put it on my car 20 minutes after I parked. THAT is not fair! And I don't have the time or the energy to go down and fight the ticket! Just had to vent.

I hated that they were hot from my own excretions. I hated that my DH had to squeeze the fluid out and measure it because I was too squeamish to do it myself. However, I bought a double marsupial pouch and that made all the difference! I tucked 2 drains into each pouch, and also had a pouch for my pain pack in the front. I was quite the sight. (I'd post a photo but i can't figure out how!) It might be a little hot in the summer tho (it's made of terry cloth and was cozy when I had my BMX in early FEB). Rant away, that is what we are here for!! Hopefully your dizziness is gone and you have found the right balance of pain meds. Shannon, so sorry you have that family drama going on. I think you're doing the smart thing...just let his messages set a while. After all, he took his sweet time contacting you; I think It's Ok to wait a week or two to get back to him! You HAVE been a little busy! Do what your gut tells you to do. If it tells you you can't deal with this right now, then don't. Give yourself permission not to do anything you don't want to do. So Melanie I think we have to start calling you Cover Girl, or CG for short! So glad you got to experience a photo shoot. You will also have to post the pic once it's out! Can't wait to see it. DH and I are heading out to the beach tomorrow to breath in some cool air (we walk the boardwalk, we don't lay out) and visit with our grandbaby and his parentals.

I was sitting in the oncology waiting room today (waiting to see my Onc. doc to get my oncotype score and find out if I need chemo or not) when my husband asked if I was OK. I said, \"I can handle anything he has to tell me.\" And that is because of all you ladies on this board who have gone through chemo or are going through it. I felt like I had a huge support group that had my back. I did not feel alone. I just wanted to give you all a shout out and a thank you!!  As for my Oncotype score, it was 16... the high end of the low-risk group. Given my age (52), peri-menopausal status, tumor grade (1), Stage (1B) and the fact that I had a BMX, my doc said statistically there was no benefit to me having chemo. So he handed me an Rx for Tamoxifen and told me to see him in 6 months. My husband was SO relieved! And you would think I would be too. But you would be wrong! I was unable to allow myself to fully feel the power of that diagnosis. I have been suppressing so many fearful and negative emotions since my journey began that when I hear good news, my reaction is still one of denial. Crazy isn't it? I should be thrilled that I don't need chemo!  The main reason I can't relax is because of the delayed healing of my incision. Another tiny opening appeared along my incision line yesterday that has me additionally worried. I feel like my body is letting me down and I have no control. I just hope I can make it to surgery on Monday without the gap getting any bigger.   Thanks for letting me vent, ladies. I think I just need to process everything that has happened this week and put it all in perspective. A nice long walk tomorrow will help.",

You already know there are people at your cancer center who can help you physically get to your treatments and back, and you also have this forum for your emotional needs. You can do it! Alyad: Bravo to you for hitting pause with regard to your mum. As everyone here has said, you gotta focus your energies on YOU in order to get better. And just an aside, I am certain my DH was brought into my life to help me through this. After I told DH I was diagnosed, I also told him how unfair I thought it was that he had not one but TWO wives who got BC (his first wife passed from breast cancer. What are the odds that BC would strike his life twice?). He teared up and said \"Now I know why she sent me to you \u2014 she knew I would take good care of you!\" Gave me goosebumps.",

So much so, that I was as active as I was before my surgery, and I paid the price yesterday. My incision started seeping and it wouldn't stop! We walked a LOT yesterday and I got back to the hotel and took a hot shower. I think the combo of the heat and the exercise (and my being really tired) did it. Anyway, I rested some and sent DH out to make an emergency run to the pharmacy for more sterile gauze pads. I put about 10 pads on, and then placed a washcloth over that, and off we went to the show. Good thing I thought of the washcloth, cause I leaked through the first layer before it finally stopped. I didn't have any leakage overnight at all. The weird part is that the incision is looking really good! It is just so weird. So I have to keep taking it easy.  You all look like you are doing well and keeping busy, sorry I can't comment on everyone individually tonight.  I have been taking headless photos of myself since my first surgery. I posted 1 photo of my first incision healing problem, but when I am completely healed I will post more. ;-)",

I am willing to reduce my risk by altering my diet and increasing my exercise and dropping 10 pounds and keeping it off. In my heart, I truly feel this is where my healing lies. And I am good with that. It feels good to feel certain about my treatment plan again. I am hoping that also helps me heal my incision for good this time.",

Picking up a child at school is easy-peasy, and it's hard to turn a child in need down! Have a list of people to ask; that way you don't sound disappointed if whomever you first ask says no. Just move on to the next person on your list. RE: Helping... This is such an issue for me. I was not surprised that no one offered to helpyesterday. They never offer. Over the holidays my stepson and DIL said that I always make entertaining look so effortless, but now they realize how much work is involved! (They had DIL's family over for Thanksgiving and stepson did all the cooking; DIL's mother did all the cleaning up.) It felt good that they acknowledged my hard work and I thought that they might offer to help. But nothing changed. How do I teach this lesson to stepkids? They do not take the hint when their father (DH) helps me clear the table. He has been very reticent to ask them to help me. I think he wants them to have fun and enjoy themselves when they are here. It's his way of spoiling them. Sorry, now I am rambling! But this topic confounds and frustrates me and actually prevents me from hosting more parties!",

When i wake up in the middle of the night (and I always do with my hot flashes), now I know I have something to look forward to reading! HELLO to all and GOOD LUVK on E-DAY today, Annie! Check in when you can. I have more pain today than yesterday. Mostly at the drain site but also the incision site.  I am on the Vicodin and Colace and also taking Tylenol which is helping. I cannot shower until I see PS on Tuesday. (Only below-the-waist shower only.) I am already sporting that familiar \"eu du mastectomy\" smell... you know the one. It's a combo of that yellow-staining antiseptic skin cleaner, my sutures healing (I hope!), surgical gauze and tape, a big ole Ace bandage, summer sweat and, the big stinker, my drain and bloody bulb. I'm sure this is also the featured perfume of E-Day Exchange as well (aside from the drain et al if you were lucky!) When I got home yesterday I sat at the edge of the pool and put my legs in. (It is so hot here the pool water is 89 degrees. That is a dreamy temp for me. i like it warm.) To my surprise, I immediately started to cry. I wanted to go swimming. But when I didn't stop crying, i realized i was finally grieving the loss of my boobs. I know a lot of women come out of BMX and MX with TEs that don't have many ccs in them yet (and some for a variety of reasons don't have TEs placed yet or at all). In those cases I imagine the grief hits when you first glimpse your flat chest. because my PS filled me to 350ccs on each side at the time of my BMX, when I looked at myself post-surgery i was only slightly smaller than i was before. I didn't have nipples but that didn't bother me. I actually was please with the way I looked. So in effect I kinda \"avoided\" the whole grief thing (aside from one meltdown in the hospital when I first got to my room after the BMX). Anyway, there I sat with my feet in the pool and it triggered a meltdown (and I haven't even been able to look at myself yet; that will happen Tuesday when PS takes off the bandages). I guess I was long overdue. I put my feet in the water again this morning...same thing happened. Tears started to flow.  Guess I should just stay completely out of the pool! ",

I started a recipe group there a while back and it was very fun. Regarding DH: We dated for 3 years and have now been married almost 3 years. During that time we lost 3 out of our 4 parents. I thought that would be our toughest test. Nope! I pulled the BC card. But here is the terrible twist of fate...my DH lost his first wife to breast cancer. What are the odds that he would pick a 2nd wife who ALSO gets it? Geez!! When I got my diagnosis I thought OMG, how can he go through this again?? I actually thought I was safe from getting BC because, well, what are the odds of it striking the same guy twice? Anyway, all that is to say he has been *way* down this road before, so he knows what may lie ahead and what to expect. He has been a model caregiver due to this previous experience (though in the beginning he had a lot of displaced anger that had more to do with his first wife's illness than with mine. We talked about it, he got it, he's been fine since.). He's also in the medical field so that helps a great deal with the doctors and my medications. I waited a long time to find the right guy and get married (at age 49!) so this all seems like a little too much $%#@. Thank God we have our sense of humor, it is the only way he and I have gotten through any of it. Sorry for the divergence. I've been lurking on this thread in the hopes it would get me off my butt, but so far I have only managed one hike a week. Working on it!",

At least that explains your back pain but what a disappointment to maybe not get to be the size you want after enduring all this %$#^. I can certainly relate. Anniemomof3: Thanks again for the warning about incision care. I am still in a pickle about it. SuebeeBC: What kind of issue were you having exactly with your incision not healing? I am curious if it is what I have been going through. I had a very small dot in the center of my incision that was pale yellow, and it has been slowly getting bigger. The color remains the same... a pale yellow/green. It is NOT infected. The skin is thin. I have been doing the bactriban/Xeroform/ gauze thing. When I saw my PS Friday and he mentioned \"fixing it\" if it got any worse,  I did not ask what he meant because I was afraid to hear the answer.Well now I know it. This morning his nurse called to see how it was going and so I asked her what he meant. She told me my body is trying to reject the implant. Yikes!! I had NO idea! I just thought my TE had too many cc's and was keeping the skin from healing. Oh brother. I feel really uninformed and scared. The area that is trying to heal is about a half-inch in length, 1/4 inch in height. The nurse said they have seen sooooo much worse and they feel mine will heal, but tomorrow he might have to clean it out and get rid of any skin not doing it's job. She also said this is done in the office, but that I will be \"prepped\" in case I need to go back into surgery. I wish they had told me how serious this was from the get-go! It is alarming to hear a month after I had revision surgery (they never told me the TE was rejecting back then) and I really, really want this to take. My other TE is perfectly fine and the skin healed wonderfully.  Anyway, majorly disappointed here; thanks for listening. I think I am going back to bed. ",

Yesterday I set out on what was going to just be a walk in the neighborhood. I had no intention of going to my usual hiking path. But I ended up at a trailhead to a different hiking area in my neighborhood that I had been on once before with DH, and so I just started walking. Kept going straight so I wouldn't get lost. Ran into 2 women with a baby on a papoose. I asked them if the trail ended up ahead. They said no, stay left for about a mile and it ends at another trailhead \u2014 turns out it ends at the trailhead I usually hike at! I was SO excited to find this trail! I ended up walking back home via the neighborhood (rather than backtrack on the new trail alone) but I hiked about 4 miles yesterday. My butt is killing me today (one part was very hilly)! I really pushed myself, and was tired the rest of the day. All those surgeries took a toll on me. Anyway, I have a hiking date tomorrow morning with one girlfriend, and Thursday morning with another, and I am excited about showing them both the new trail! I posted this on another thread but will share here too: I saw my PS this AM and he is happy with my incision healing since last week's surgery and I see him again in 3 weeks. If no problems at that point, he will consider me out of the woods. I hope to start fills in May! Maria: You mention above that you are having your exchange in JUNE?

And due to my healing issues, DH has been steering clear of them. ;-( I know what you mean about getting sidetracked on this site and lurking on forums that we should probably stay away from. I have my favorite threads and I try to stay focused on them. Whenever I look at the active threads I find myself getting swept up in stuff I really don't need to know about. (My mind has enough imagination, I don't need to feed that fire!) I went for 65-minute hike this morning and thankfully am not as tired as I was on Monday. Afterwards my friend and I went to Trader Joe's and bought organic, Made in America items. Regarding support groups: Once my incision is healed and I am \"out of the woods,\" I am planning to look into one. Being vulnerable in a supportive group will help me in my healing process.

Then I tossed in a can of drained chick peas (for extra protein) and 3 tablespoons of capers. I used white wine instead of chicken stock. (Can you tell I like to improvise?) Served it over whole wheat couscous and DH loved it! Thanks for inspiring me! I did a mini-hike late yesterday afternoon (which means I took more photos than I did steps I think)!

And I had to laugh at your plan for Sat night! I had some homemade green tea at the lunch place I was at today and in the back of my mind I thought, Mmmmm, I wonder if this interacts with Tamoxifen? So I did some research and came across a 2006 study in the journal \"Carcinogenesis: Integrative Cancer Research\" that says it actually *helps*! So green tea it is for me now that I am on Tamox!! Here's the abstract: Combination of green tea and tamoxifen is effective against breast cancer\u2014 Epidemiologic data have suggested that green tea may prevent breast cancer. Studies in our laboratory have provided evidence that green tea extract inhibits breast cancer growth by a direct anti-proliferative effect on the tumor cells, as well as by indirect suppressive effects on the tumor-associated endothelial cells. In this study, we asked whether concurrent administration of green tea may add to the anti-tumor effects of standard breast cancer therapy. We observed that green tea increased the inhibitory effect of tamoxifen on the proliferation of the ER (estrogen receptor)-positive MCF-7, ZR75, T47D human breast cancer cells in vitro. This combination regimen was also more potent than either agent alone at increasing cell apoptosis. In animal experiments, mice treated with both green tea and tamoxifen had the smallest MCF-7 xenograft tumor size, and the highest levels of apoptosis in tumor tissue, as compared with either agent administered alone. Moreover, the suppression of angiogenesis in vivo correlated with larger areas of necrosis and lower tumor blood vessel density in treated xenografts. Green tea decreased levels of ER-α in tumors both in vitro andin vivo. We also observed that green tea blocked ER-dependent transcription, as well as estradiol-induced phosphorylation and nuclear localization of mitogen-activated protein kinase. To our knowledge, this study is the first to show the interaction of green tea with the ER pathway, as well as provide mechanistic evidence that the combination of green tea and tamoxifen is more potent than either agent alone in suppressing breast cancer growth. These results may lead to future improvements in breast cancer treatment and prevention. ",

Please forgive me! On the toxic sisters (or toxic anyone) topic, my analogy has always been: why do I keep going back to the well searching for water when I know the well is dry? People don't change. No, I take that back. Most people don't change, especially the ones that are wacky to begin with. As much as it hurts not to have the kind of relationship we wish we could have with certain people (especially family), it simply ain't gonna happen.  That being said, it's important to cultivate relationships with kind people whom you can trust and whom support you. But that takes energy. So, better to spend your time finding new support avenues rather than expecting people to behave differently. Another great analogy: A woman tells her therapist she is upset when her husband (an alcoholic) comes home drunk. The therapist says, \"What did you expect? He's an alcoholic. That's what alcoholics do.\" 'nuf said. Lumps, bumps and boobies: Everyone on this board should pat themselves on the back for getting through this past month. It's been a tough one all around! And how nice to hear a plastic surgeon be so proud of his work and that one of our \"own\" has had the pleasure of being the recipient of said work. (Yeah, Suebee!) Suebee: I am feeling job B for you; stability, benefits, plus you are a mover (and a ta-ta shaker), so I know you'll move up that ladder if you want to. (BTW I was howling at Shannon's \"take job DD\"!!! You are SO funny!!) Maria, I think we may have the same mother. Same age. Love her dearly. Emotionally supportive. But not able to help out physically. She doesn't drive so I am her wheels. She too likes people to wait on her. She has a lazy streak. But, God bless her, she is not a nosy momma and she stays out of my business (she hates gossip of any kind), and she will hate you forever if you ever hurt me. (She can hold a good grudge, and I'm thankful she never holds one against her kids!) A friend of my BFF's (and mine) has Stage IIIC ovarian cancer. Last week I was talking to BFF about my TE issue. She said, \"well it could be worse. You could need chemo.\" I know she was trying to make me feel better. But I felt invalidated, unheard, and her comment negated what I am going through. And this taught me a lesson. No matter that someone is going through, never play it down by saying it could always be worse. I went for a 1 hour and 15-minute hike this AM with 2 girlfriends and one of their husbands. He carried a big walking stick but there were no coyotes or rattlers to be found. Nice having a bodyguard though! Now onto my news. I posted more about this on the pic forum, but I woke up this morning realizing my TE was not going to heal. It's been almost 5 months. It's time. So I called my PS and I'm having surgery on July 6 to remove my right TE.  I feel so relieved that I have made this decision. I have spent too much energy on this. I gotta move forward.

Suebee, any changes to BFF status during a crises in our lives is def. cause for complaint. I hear ya! I had coffee with mine on Friday and tho she is a great listener to all my troubles, and we have been through thick-and-thin the past 30 years, I also had to listen about her complain about her \"new\" BFF (my term). This woman really, really wants my BFF to fly to NY for a Bday party someone is throwing for her there, and so my BFF is going! (I really doubt she would do that for me.) My BFF goes out of her way to do things for and with the newbie BFF. And we always end up talking about her. (She is a nice person, BTW). But I always end up feeling like I never receive the same special treatment. I know their friendship is different b/c their daughters are best friends (sound familiar Suebee?) so they have different things anchoring their relationship (my BFF and I have been friends from our early single days). I know my BFF & I will always be there for each other. But it does hurt to see other people get so much more of her time and attention. Guess I have myself to blame; I do not make demands on my BFFs time, I don't ask her for anything. She has offered to help me, and I always accept that help. But if the newbie BFF were going through cancer? OMG, people would be falling all over themselves to help her. Because that is that woman's personality. She's \"just a little\" helpless. I'm a \"buck up\" kind of girl. I get it done. I don't play the victim. I do';t look for sympathy. And therein lies the difference. I always come back to this old saying: The squeaky wheel gets the grease. Guess I need to either start squeaking or stop complaining. ERGH!",

The one I have is too far away and i have not seen her since any of this started.I also thought one of my docs had told me I still needed mammos despite my BMX. So I have to figure out which one that was. I see my MO end of the month and my list of questions is VERY long! He has me on an every-six-months plan. So I have only seen him twice before, once after my diagnosis and once after BMX for the \"Tammy Talk.\" Shannon, I think I would prefer being seen medically every 3 months. Maybe I'm going through doctor withdrawal.",

Not a lot, and no where near like last time, but I recognize this beast. I have an appt. next week. he said if it gets worse before that, to call him. I have to go back to doing as little as possible (aside from walking). I don't know what else to do. Activity is the only thing I have changed up in the past 2 weeks. I also ran out of greek yogurt last week so hadn't been eating it, but we loaded up last night. This healing issue is really getting old!",

Apparently my body felt that my day yesterday (BBQ with friends + no nap) was too much, because my incision started weeping again last night. ERGH! (Luckily, I see PS in 2 hours.) Despite this continual problem, the incision IS getting smaller, and is now 3 stitches big rather than 4! I'll post what he tells me when I return from my appt later. Suebee, WHOOT WHOOT on an E-Day for you! That's 2 weeks from today! Congrats on this hard-won victory, g-friend! And good on you for listening to your body. I hope you rest up and feel better soon. You had an action-packed weekend! Redsky, thanks for mentioning PT, I would have forgotten to ask my PS for a referral at my appt. this afternoon.  Maria, thinking of you today in your first day back in the work saddle. Stay strong! Take it a day at a time, just like BC, and you'll get through it. I see lots of light at the end of that tunnel for you! So happy you had fun in Chicagoland. Shannon, welcome! I am impressed you were back to yoga so soon after BMX & TE! You must have healed up quickly! Rehm, I was given post-op exercises at the hospital upon discharge but I couldn't do any of them due to incision healing issues. Your PS should determine when it is safe for you to start them.

He said the incision looks great, but he was dismayed to hear I was still having some seeping issues (including today). I told him the incision only seeps when I do too much. He said well, don't do too much. (ha!) He steri-stripped it and now I'm holding off on the Xeroform and just taping gauze pads over the steri-strips. Also am showering with waterproof bandage so no water can get in. He told me we have to keep being patient, it IS improving. Guess that is as good as it gets right now! Oh yeah, he also asked me how I liked Las Vegas. I didn't remember telling him I was going, but I told him it was great. He said how did you like the Wynn? I'm like, How did you know we stayed at the Wynn? He says you were on the 60th floor, right? Now I'm like, WHAT are you talking about?! How do you know that? He laughed and said he saw me and my husband getting on the elevator just as he and his wife and were getting off. He called out to me but I didn't hear him, and then the elevator doors closed. Whenever I see him in the office, he has a suit on; he said, \"I guess you didn't recognize me in my pool shorts!\" I swear I never saw him at all. I did say, \"If I *had* seen you, I would have told you I had a washcloth stuffed in my bra because my incision was leaking that night!\" We got quite a laugh out of it. I just told my husband the story, he couldn't believe it! It's such a small world!",

I sometimes think I will never get an exchange because I will never heal. Cancel that thought! Melanie, yes you have been through sooo much! I'm glad you have your Mom to cook for you and spoil you (maybe a little?) Shannon, yes, I agree, it takes time to heal our emotions. Much longer than our physical selves take to heal (with me being the exception! LOL!) Maria, I definitely deserved an Academy Award for the performance I put on through the Christmas holidays! (Suzy Sunshine, everything is fine, blah, blah, blah). I completely relate! It's hard not to \"act\" like we are OK so our loved ones don't worry. But it also helps to check in with the younger version of ourselves (not just the adult, logical version). Because that little girl is terrified! This may sound silly, but I imagine that my younger self lives inside my heart. And I talk to her. I tell her she no longer has to feel afraid, because I will take care of her the way I take care of everyone around me. I think that is the missing link \u2014 we take care of everyone, we even take care of our \"adult\" selves, but deep down, WE still need nurturing. Especially at times like these. Sorry to get all sappy. I say it's time to have more FUN. Because %^$#, if you can't have fun once you know you have cancer, when can you, right? ",

Gives us all something to look forward to! You are paving the way, g-friend! Maria, Shannon, Suebee, Red, yup, our DH's are programmed by nature to solve problems. So when we \"complain\" (tho we ladies call it sharing!), they feel they need to find a solution. And when they can't, they often get angry or shut down. Sometimes I remember to frame what I'm saying with, \"you don't have to do anything about this, just let me talk\" and that helps. But Iusually forget. Ladies: I wrote about all of you (collectively) on my blog yesterday! I'm sure I will again, as I am blogging in 20/20 \"reflective\" mode (i.e., writing several months after events have happened). Anyway, I wanted to share a wonderful 3-minute relaxation video that a friend of mine with whom I did some \"interior\" work posted on her Body Freedom blog; the link is listed in the \"my favorites\" section of my blog (along with links to Maria's blogs too).

You are a wonderful writer and funny too. You are also wise beyond your years. You have a strong support system between your friends, family and church folk, and for that I am thankful. None of us should have to deal with what we are dealing with, but to get BC at 26...well, it just ain't fair. So I am glad that love surrounds you! You have been through a lot, I didn't know you had such trouble with the chemo and having to go to the ER. I'm glad you are on the other side of it, and that you got your tats and are entering the next \"faze\" of this journey! Keep writing, girl. Happy Father's Day to all.

I'm telling my story in hindsight (I kept copious journels) and I can't wait until I catch up to \"real time\"! Well I wore my new 36D (yes you read that right) Danskin front-clasp bra to a reunion lunch today. (I got together with former co-workers, some of whom I haven't seen in over 5 years). There were 8 of us. It was really fun! And I didn't even cry when recounting my story. Which I kinda expected I might, because I have not \"told\" the whole story to very many people. I feel so much stronger (and less vulnerable) since I made the decision to remove the TE!   Oh, and my PS has just joined my HMO plan (he was out of network before) so that means our co-pay going forward will be zero. Yippee!!!  Maria, we are thinking about you girlfriend and hope you are in Vicodin-induced slumber! ",

OMG. I would have to move. I started a \"hot flash forum\" thread because they are driving me nuts. Don't be afraid of tamox, tho, melanie...it is a cancer cell killer and so I try to EMBRACE Tammy in all her glorious colors. SHANNON how long have you been partaking of the Tammy Juice? I had awful moodiness the first 2 months on it. Like PMS to the nth degree. My doc put me on Effexor. That is definitely helping with the moddiness BUT not with the hot flashes (it is reputed to help with both). Had my pre-op today in preparation for July 6 TE removal. He has had several patients who had a rejection in just one boob, had the TE removed, healed, then it worked when they had it redone. I hope I am so lucky. My doc gave me an important piece of news today. We were going over all my recent tests and stuff upcoming (the glories of being over 50). He said I needed a colonoscopy. I said already? I just had one in october. I had polyps removed. remember? (Of course he doesn't remember, because this office is crazy busy. But I digress.) he looks up the results and says, you DIDN'T have polyps. You had a lymph node removed. WHAT? OK, so now I get scared. He told me the colon has a ton of lymph nodes and one of mine must have been slightly raised and they took it off and tested it but it came back benign and is not a polyp. \"You don't need another colonoscopy for 10 years.) Well that is just the best news I have heard all year! And I told him so!! He went on to explain how marvelous and magical a system the colon is. I was definitely talking to a science geek! It was all pretty funny. Whew. Amazing what will make my day these days! ",

You're the only one who can and should make that decision. The people around you want you to be \"done\" as much for you as for themselves. That is normal. Just sucks for us. Suebee, you are doing exactly what you want and need to be doing. You made your work life a cancer-free zone. You are creating your new \"normal.\" There is something very strong and challenging about what you are doing by not telling these new folks about your \"past.\" Props, g-friend! Melanie and Suebee (and Red and Maria), you guys are in that \"new\" place of being past the major hurdles. You've crossed an important threshold. It's kind of like running around a cross-country race. With each lap you cross a small victory line.",

Things move fast on the reconstruction train. I saw my PS this AM and lucky me, I have to have a second revision surgery to \"debride\" the unhealed area and have it re-stitched. Surgery is Monday morning. Saw my primary care doc this afternoon for my pre-op blood work so I am ready to rock 'n' roll. I'm actually glad PS is taking the precautionary road and caring for this surgically; my only other choice was to continue to take a \"wait and see\" approach with ointment, which I have already been doing, but the hole has only gotten bigger... Oy. The good news: I've lost 5 pounds since my pre-op in late January. Yeah! And on that note, I am putting on my boots and heading out for a hike. If any of you weren't able to fit in any exercise today, count my hike as your own. 'Cause next week I may ask you to take one for me! ;-) PS I have a theory about incisions not healing & lymph node removal. I had 8 nodes removed on my right side, and it is my right incision that is not healing. I'm going to start a thread asking women with healing issues if their trouble is on the same side as their node removal. Because doesn't it make sense that the fewer nodes you have, the less circulation you have? (Just my own little theory here!)",

And I'm glad you got a good cry in. My Onco also told me they had been over-treating with chemo so this new onco test really helps. BTW, the flip side to this no-chemo coin is that we *still* have chemo in our arsenal should we (hopefully never!) need it in the future. And that really is a good thing. My oncotype score came back just last week...16. On the high end of the low-risk group but since I am Stage 1B, Grade 1, and I had a bilateral b/c of family history (and not wanting to worry in future and also wanting my reconstructed girls to match), my Onco said NO chemo, NO rads, JUST Tamoxifen for 2-5 years, then the Arimedex. yippee! I really, really wanted a super-low oncotype score and I was actually disappointed when I heard the number 16 (my DH, however, was completely relieved!!). In my heart I knew my score would not be low-low, but my head really, really wanted it to be, to remove more of my worry. Oh well, I should not complain. So many ladies on these boards would love to have such a low onco score, I should just be thankful! And I am. I had incision revision surgery on Monday, a hole opened up in my incision and would not heal. Set me back quite a bit as far as fills (so far I have had NONE and my BMX was on Feb 3! And now my right TE is half the size of the left since he had to remove more skin to re-close the incision). So I won't be looking at an exchange surgery until after the summer. ;-( Diane, let us know how your path report comes out, and continued good healing to ya!! ",

I too had trouble coming out of anesthesia. (3 hours throwing up in the recovery room. Not pleasant!) But once they tamed my nausea I felt SO much better. TMI for some but useful for others: Pain meds like Vicodin are very constipating, as is anesthesia. So take your colace!

Couldn't reach anything myself, couldn't scoot myself up, couldn't move my pillows, basically could not move and had to wait and wait for help.

I also had my pain pack removed on Tuesday, so I was afraid my breasts would hurt. But they don't. I can feel them on my chest... a sensation, but not pain. I took my first shower yesterday and got a look at my little \"mounds\". It wasn't so bad. The weirdest part was how they feel... like I have two small water balloons tacked to my chest. So foreign. Wearing the constricting surgical bra helps a great deal. Hardest part to this recovery is chilling out and not picking things up. So for those heading into surgery soon, know that you will at least be able to finally get some rest! (oh the things we do to give ourselves permission to relax!) ;-) ",

Do you know what Grade your tumor is? (Grade 1, 2 or 3?) This can influence how quickly they move to get you into surgery. I had a low-grade (Grade 1) mass, so there was no rush, since I have a slow-growing cancer. I AM still waiting for my oncotype score (which I just learned this AM won't be in for another 10-14 days!), because the tissue sample was just sent out last week. This *should* have been done right after my surgery. Since I already know I have to take Tamoxifan, I too didn't understand why I wasn't put on it right from the start. But my oncologist needs to see my oncotype score first to make sure it is not high, which would mean I might still need chemo, even though I am Stage 1B and Grade 1. And I did not see an oncologist until *after* my surgery. (Which is why my oncotype test was delayed, as he was the one to request it.)   So please make sure you ask your surgeon NOW about getting your oncotype test done ASAP after your surgery so you don't lose any more time. I hope that helps! Much luck on March 31. We will all be pulling for you! PS What is TUG reconstruction? I haven't heard that term before.",

Just wanted to hop on and say yup, the waiting is hell, but you *will* get through it and it was not as bad as I imagined! There is one thing I didn't do but you should if you can: Have someone stay overnight with you the first night in the hospital after your surgery. Or at least stay with you until midnight, then have someone else come early in the morning.  I was in recovery for 5 hours (very sick from anesthesia...if you tend to get that way too, tell the doc *before* you go under, there are many meds they can give you so you are not violently ill when you come to). My DH left at 8PM after I was settled in my room. Didn't think I needed him and he thought I would be taken care of by the nursing staff. Wrong! I could not move to reach anything...not even the call button...and was stuck in the same position for hours while in pain. Suffice to say your life will be MUCH easier if you can manage to have someone stay with you.  One more thing: I bought a terry cloth belt with pouches before I had my surgery and wouldn't have been as comfortable when I got home without it. Got it here: http://www.turnerhealth.com/ Good luck ladies! Wishing you all the best and then some! ;-) ",

I am lopsided Nelly. So far it looks to be healing. I am using Xeroform and have noticed when I *don't* use it, clear fluid seeps from the incision. (The Xeroform seems to prevent this.) I am hoping this fluid is the body's healing mechanism in action. Did you/do you have any fluid drainage?  PS Congrats on your low oncotype score! ",

Talk about not having time to wrap my head around having a 2nd surgery just 2 weeks after the BMX. OY! Turns out there was too much pressure from the TE, causing the skin to not heal. He removed 50cc's on the one side and resutured it. I had necrosis on the top of my incision, and there also was a spot that was necrotic UNDER the skin and that was the dangerous part. (PS said had we not fixed it when we did, he would have had to redo the entire TE process. Luckily the anesthesiologist put together a great Rx cocktail (along with a patch behind my ear) so that when I came to, I was alert and not dizzy or nauseous, and was able to go home 90 minutes later!

I am 52, perimenopausal. My first onc put me at Stage 1B. My Oncotype score was 16 \u2014 high end of low-risk score. He told me low-risk women have been over-treated with chemo and that the benefit of chemo to me does not outweigh the risk. Since I am 95% ER+/PR+ he said Tamoxifen for 2-5 years, followed by Arimidex for 5 years. I started Tamox on March 24. Eventually, my gut started telling me to get a 2nd opinion just to reinforce that I had made the right decision. So in May (almost 2 months after starting Tamox), I trotted off to see a 2nd onco who was *shocked* that I was not doing chemo! He said my tumor size was large (3.2 cm), and even though it was only a Grade 1, with NO nodes involved, I should absolutely do chemo. So what did I get for getting a 2nd opinion? Confused. After much soul-searching, I came back to my original conclusion. I was willing to remove both of my breasts to reduce my future risk; I was willing to do hormone therapy for 10 years; but I was *not* willing to do chemo for a Grade 1, slow-growth cancer. I am glad I got the 2nd opinion because it allowed me to feel committed about my decision. You really do have to go with your gut. Good luck to all of you ladies still struggling with this decision. And make sure you get your Oncotype Score; I think it is an important piece of the BC pie.",

The problem with getting seriously ill (and even though I don't \"feel\" seriously ill, how much more serious can it get than hearing a cancer diagnosis?) is that we want to maintain a semblance of normalcy for ourselves (so we don't go insane) and the people around us. And those people don't like change. As women, we are the glue that holds the family together. But then \"The Big C\" creeps in and dissolves our glue, leaving us unhinged and unable to fully care for those who depend on us. I have found the process of having cancer is very similar to grief. When my father died, I was confounded by how little support I received from many of the people closest to me. Some people never even acknowledged my loss (including my stepchildren!). I tried not to judge; I know people don't know how to deal with death, they don't know what to say, and it's the same thing with cancer. It forces people to face not just your mortality but theirs as well. The good news: Guilt is good. For me I feel guilty when I begin to mother myself instead of everyone else \u2014 I somehow feel I don't deserve it. But ladies, we DO. So the next time you feel a twinge of guilt about taking care of YOU, pat yourself on the back and congratulate yourself! We can't wait for someone else to do it. I believe that is the lesson that cancer is here to teach me: To care for myself as much as I care for everyone else. (Gotta find some silver lining, right?) Happy weekend to all!",

DH and I spent all of December keeping the news to ourselves so we didn't ruin anyone's holiday (just our own). I feel your pain and can relate entirely. Cancer is cancer in that the feelings related to it are the same. We all still need to grieve our former \"carefree\" life, grapple with medical terminology and research and doctors visits and surgeries and talking about nothing else but The Big C... and, oh yeah, facing our own death. None of it is easy. And yes, we DID get lucky that we found ours early! And I will never take that for granted. But it still sucks!! Just yesterday I found out my oncotype score (16) and met with my oncologist for only the 2nd time. He gave me an Rx for Tamox and said \"see me in 6 months.\" I should be jumping for joy! But I've repressed so many of my feelings just to get through this whole ordeal that even positive news is taking a loooong time to seep in.  Instead my focus now is on one of my incisions that keeps opening ... and I am heading back into surgery on Monday for a 2nd repair. Haven't had a fill yet because my incision refuses to heal. Perhaps it's my subconscious refusing to accept that I have cancer. Hmmm... I think I need to meditate on that one! ",

It is terrifying to fly in the face of the medical community when they are telling you to wait 6 months. It is very difficult to have to fight for a real biopsy when you are feeling your most vulnerable. We've all been there. You can and will get through this. You are stronger than you know. I almost skipped my mammo because, like you, I had just had one the year before. I am SO glad I did not let my cancer cook for 1 more year.

But since 80% of biopsies are benign, chances are in your favor. Am hoping for B9 results all around for you! Keep us posted what happens on Wednesday. {{{hugs}}}",
