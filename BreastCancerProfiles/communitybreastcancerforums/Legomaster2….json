I never once felt nauseous although I had a couple prescriptions to take afterwards if I did. I took zyprexa for 3 days after chemo but ended up being able to cut the dose in half and stop a day early after the second round. I still have a giant bottle of Zofran that I haven't used. I was very sleepy the first day I'm sure it was a combination of the drugs -especially Benadryl. I am a lightweight. I had a port but the adriamycin was still pushed and not hung in a bag. The first time you pee afterwards will be Red. Don't be alarmed. I did AC first. You have already done the Taxol so you kind of know how it will work and what things work to comfort you. I recommend Biotene toothpaste and mouthwash to help keep mouth sores away. I did not have issues with that but used the Biotene a lot. Good luck to you!! You are stronger than you think! ",

They will guide you through this process.  No question or concern is silly or to small to mention.  If it bothers YOU or if YOU think it is concerning just ask the question.  It is better to have an answer just to put your mind at rest.  The core biopsy was not really painful and they numb you prior to the procedure so that helps.  The bruising can be pretty significant and takes a while to fade , or at least mine did.  One thing that I didn't expect was when they actually took the sample it sounded like a small staple gun.  They should let you know when to expect that.  Ice packs and Tylenol help afterwards.  Praying for good results for you!",

I had my mammo, ultrasound, core biopsy in the same day and results the next day at 5pm. I got the call at work. Thank God on of my closest friends and coworker if 25 years was there. It was awful. I was a wreck until I met with my breast surgeon a week later. Once he explained things to me and we had a plan forward to take action I felt better. We did not tell the kids until a few weeks later, although they knew something was up. My boys are high school/college age and finals were coming up though. We figured there was no sense telling them until I had a few answers and a plan. I'm sorry you have to deal with this at all, the waiting and worryingis the worst part!",

I think you and I think about things the same way and have a kind of sarcastic and tell it like it is personality. I also think that we are all \"living with breast cancer\". Call it surviving or whatever you want but we are all vulnerable. It's hard to even try to tell people that there really is no cure yet. There were several stage IV women in the couple support activities that I have done so don't let that stop you from participating. We can all be there for each other regardless of what Roman numeral we are currently branded with. Elootz, I'm sorry for the delay. I know how hard it must be when you have your heart and mind set on being done. It is so hard to tell whose skin is going to react to radiation. I usually tan really easy so I thought it would be a breeze but I'm all red, raw and peeled. Some of my \"radiation friends\" are very light skinned and had no issues at all. Is your open skin weeping? I think that is what they are concerned about as they don't want infection starting. Hopefully, this weekend will heal you up enough that you can fly through next week. Plan something good for next weekend!! Mama Oz, how many more treatments",

I take Motrin round the clock and have spand gel pads that I wear in the worst areas under my arm. Aquafor, which I hated because it's so greasy, is my best friend now. If you are traveling to see family and would be comfortable with that and the sleeping and skin care needs then go. If not and if you can easily reschedule that might be good.

That will be a great help to your daughter. I'm also sorry about your mom. Sounds like her chemo is working well. I had neoadjuvent (presurgery) chemo as well. It did a wonderful job of shrinking the tumor that was estimated 4.5cm to only a few smattering of cells in a dead tumor bed upon surgery. It totally cleared a positive lymph node as well. Many people get immediate reconstruction at the time of BMX. I got immediate implants above the muscle but most people get tissue expanders under the muscle. These expanders are then filled with saline over time to the desired size and exchanged wih implants in a second surgerÿ. Question #2. My MO ordered the port input but any of your surgeons can do it. Since you know. Chemo is going to happen You might as well gwt the ball rolling. The port makes it much easier to do chemo. Sounds like your BS is being proactive. That is a good thing. I know it seems overwhelming. Please keep asking questions.Many people are here to Support you. Sounds like you have a good team lined up.",

No nodes were taken as there was no indication of cancer in that breast even after mammo, ultrasound and 2 MRI's. I did have chemo and currently radiation on my known cancer side (right). Right was low ER/PR and surprise left side was 100/73. I will be taking tamoxifen after radiation which is only on my right. No radiation on my leftside and we are closely watching the nodes that were not tested. I still always wonder about the nodes on that side but with it being small, low grade, chemo and tamoxifen I hope I have I done enough.",

Ultrasound, X-rays, and liver enzymes were all good. Initially my pain was directly under my implant and tender to touch. They decided it was muscle tightness and possible cording betweeen the rib cage from Radiation and surgery. I went to pt and that helped but it is still there. We did lots of exercises and myofacial release. I am now having aching/fullness In what feels like under my ribs and sometimes on the right side of my back under my rib cage. It almost feels like the stitch you get in your side when you exercise except it's almost constant if I think about it. Obviously I am thinking liver so even though I don't want to,I'll bring be making a call to my PCP/MO to figure it out.

It might be nice to have help with the shower and even dressing while you have drains in. You would want to make sure you have prescriptions filled ahead if time too. I could not even open a prescription bottle for a few days. Frustrating, but you don't really realize his much your chest muscles are involved in daily movement until you have a surgery like this. I wonder if your hospital or cancer center could arrange a volunteer to help you out even a little bit the first couple days.",

I'm one week out today and still have my drains and wounc vac attached. Appt tomorrow so I hope they come out. I do a little stretching but not much. I think I'm getting a little cording on the right side. I'm very thin and small busted. Dr said it was more common in thin women??? Got my final pathology report back today. You know it's going to be interesting when the nurse (dr reviewed but is on vacation) calls and says \"there are some surprises\". Good news is that all 4 nodes were cancer free - including the node that was positive with Dec-16 prechemocore biopsy! Margins were clear and the tumor bed that was 3.5 cm had only 5% of cells that were cancer. Neoadjuvent chemo was very effective. Surprise was that there was cancer in my \"clean\" left breast. DCIS 9mm grade 1. Thank God I made the right decision and did the BMX. Mammogram showed nothing in Dec. January MRI showed suspicious areas, follow up with ultrasound could not find anything, post chemo MRI had no suspicious areas on left and it was compared to first MRI. Anyway clean margins and the breast is gone. Awaiting HR status and will make a plan after that. So overall very good news but again the roller coaster continues. One last thing... does it hurt when the drains come out? I'm still sore and not looking forward to people tugging on me to remove drains, wound vacs and the Saran Wrap that's binding it all together.",

I was afraid to look too but I only had tight Saran Wrap in my chest so no avoidance. It looked great. No bruising, my scars are under and to the side of my breasts so I can't even see them unless I use a mirror. Hopefully you will be similar and you willing be pleased with how you look. For those of you that are a few weeks out from surgery, did your PS tell you to moisturize the breast and scar area? My PS did not specifically say that but the nurses in his office did. She said rubbing the lotion in would help with circulation and swelling.",

I started out at only 115 so that's a big %. Still working on getting that back. I drink a special high calorie boost (special order) as well as high protein boost that I get from sams club. The weight is not going back too quick though. I know it's not an issue that most people have but just as frustrating as someone trying to lose weight. I'm feeling good though. Keeping active. Just got back from a trip to the Michigan U.P. I was able to hike 4-6 miles each day. Missed the kayak trip around pictured rocks but the rest of the family enjoyed it.

      "Content": "Aug 17, 2017 07:58PM - edited Aug 18, 2017 07:46PM by Legomaster225 I can give you my experience if that helps. I did BMX with known cancer in my right breast. Upon testing of the removed tissue a small tumor was found on my \"clean\" breast as well. We did not take nodes fr that side as there was no reason to think we needed to. Mammo, ultrasound, and two different MRI's did not see it. In hindsight i wsh we would have done sentinel node testing on that side as well. It has caused confusion over radiation treatment. Doctors think the risks of Auxillary node dissection at this time outweigh the benefits due to the size, path report, ER, BMX, chemo and tamoxifen. For now we are monitoring and will re-evaluate and do ALND on that side if necessary. They say the risk of node involvement is very low and there are no clinical signs to push for testing. We just don't know100%. But unless you take them all the nodes I guess you never know 100%. I guess in hindsight I would Have wished for sentinal node testing in both breastsbut I could second guess myself all day.",

I'm reading in your post that they don't think radiation will be needed as they expect complete chemo response in any cancer that remains in any lymph node. Maybe I'm reading too much into it though. I'm kinda in the same boat. I had neoadjuvent chemo though. I had a positive node biopsy in December-after chemo my path report showed no cancer in that node or the other 3 he removed. Now the team is going to discuss the need for radiation since the cancer was gone. My case goes to tumor board next week but so far I've seen my BS and MO and they both seem undecided. Both did did think the RO would lean towards radiation. We will see. I have an appt with him the day before tumor board. I too get quick pains and a crawling tingling feeling from my back to my breast. It's weird. JenRuns - celebrate each completed session! Hope they all go smoothly.",

Barely remember recovery and they will keep you comfortable afterwards. It is not fun but more uncomfortable and achy than painful. Each day gets better. Drains are a hassle but not painful. Focus on the outcome. You are a strong woman you can do this. Good news on the auxiliary nodes ouray!! RRusso my hair started growing back after about 5 taxol treatments too. Its about 3 cm long 2.5 weeks PFC. I never wore a wig, just pre-tied scarfs. I dontwear anything around the house anymore. And almost went to dinner without my scarf until my son said \"wow mom, way to go out without your beanie!! \". I turned the car around to go get it. Not quite ready for public but pretty close. Hair is now salt and pepper though when it was dark blonde. Not sure what I'm going to go about that yet. Might just leave it.

Something on the imaging that they are concerned with? The more knowledge you have regarding their reasoning the better. I understand your concern regarding the loss of feeling in your breasts and your sex life. My breasts were very small and my tumor was fairly large. I would have needed reconstruction on both regardless just to match up. That weighed heavily into my decision. I also had very cystic breasts which made it difficult to read themammograms. I too did not want to have to go through it again. Although I still worry about recurrence. I chose to have both removed. Pathology after my BMX discovered a .9mm tumor in my \u201cclean\" breast. I say this not to scare you and I know it is not the usual outcome but it happens. It did not show up on my imaging. I got lucky either my choice. On the bright side I did have nipple/skin sparing BMX and they look pretty much like they did before. I have sensation on the sides of my breast but not the nipple area. That may never come back. I would delve into exactly why they are suggesting a BMX. My doctors left it up to me but gave me enough information to make decision that was right for me. It is ultimately your choice.",

      "Content": "Nov 27, 2017 09:22PM - edited Nov 27, 2017 10:13PM by Legomaster225 I had my BMX two weeks after my last chemo. At the time my WBC count was 2.8 and neutrophils were 1.5. My surgeon was ok with that and I did not have any issues. I specifically asked him about them before surgery too. If I had to wait until my WBC counts got back to 4 I would still Be waiting for surgery almost 6 months post chemo. My counts have fluctuated but was 1.9 WBC (1.1 neutrophils) last week. I'mstill low but feeling fine. MO said it will take time to get back to normal I had neupogen shots after my last taxol was delayed a week due to low counts. It worked very well, actually too well as my counts we're too high. Good luck with your surgery.",

I ordered super high calorie Boost from Amazon to help me keep it from getting worse. I could not find this version in any store. It has 500 calories and tastes like a melted milkshake. Only comes in vanilla.I drink it very cold, with a big straw right before bed. I don't know if you can could stomach that but it's worth a try.",
