They also found another area which came back as normal cells. Obviously this was a relief as they had mentioned if this area was cancerous I would probably be looking at a mastectomy. So these other two areas I will be having them removed possibly around the beginning to mid June. I had a meeting with the breast care nurse yesterday and was told all about the surgery from before having guide wires put in and how they do it. To the surgery and after care and possibly radiotherapy 2-3 weeks Monday to Friday and I would have to stay on site as the hospital treatment is not near me. So this would mean time away from the family. Although I can go home at weekends. But before the radiotherapy etc, if the results of the areas removed turn out to be invasive, I might still need to consider a mastectomy. So last night I hardly slept as I was thinking about all the biopsies I have had, this impending surgery, with guide wires the morning before. Then I may have to go in and have more removed if the cells are outside of the margins Then once healed after so many weeks possibly radiotherapy, which can leave you very sore, extremely tired etc. I also will need to be monitored regularly as I am now at risk of further cancer cells. What I am trying to say is I had the choice of having a mastectomy with breast reconstruction, but thought no i don't want to be hasty and save the breast. Now I am wondering should I have a mastectomy so that I don't have to keep worrying about it all! I have a good supportive husband family, but I still feel so mixed up about all of this.

All the breast screening is done initially in the mobile vans and then the follow ups are 58 miles away in the larger city. I could have opted to stay with the local hospital, but I wouldn't have been seen as quick and I don't think the care would be as good.",

I had my Pre-op assessment yesterday afternoon and I am still going through with just having the pre cancer and DCIS areas removed. The consultant informed me that once the results are back after two weeks, will determine whether I will need further treatment or not. He advised to take each step as it comes, but stay positive. He answered all of my questions and I did feel more positive by the time I left for home. I am fit for surgery and they asked if I would be available to go at short notice. So hopefully I may go in for the surgery quite soon. Thanks again Debbie",
