I had my stereo core needle biopsy Aug. 17 and am scheduled for an excisional biopsy this Thurs. (Sept. 1).  They had a very difficult time with the needle biopsy.  My dense breast tissue kept moving the area they were trying to biopsy.  I ended up with a large hematoma and am very bruised.  The excisional biopsy will be done as out-patient surgery at a local hospital.  I have already discussed a BMX with my husband and he is very supportive.  The surgeon, on the other hand, thinks I am crazy.  I have already decided that if my diagnosis is changed due to the excisional biopsy (like DCIS), I will pursue a BMX.  The surgeon keeps telling me that the statistics show that \"survivorship\" numbers are no better by having a preventative BMX, but like I told him my quality of life is much more important to me than survivorship numbers.  The stress that this has already caused me and my family is just too much to go through every time I have to go for a mammogram.  I completely understand the stress you are going through.",
