    "Content": "iso wrote: This is a long post (sorry!) I'm new here. Constantly worried and very confused. Have never had an anxiety attack until this whole thing started, but now I've learned what it feels like to have them on a regular basis. I'm also experiencing problems with sleeping and constant jaw/gum/teeth tensions (I went to the dentist the other day and was told that I'm a grinder, which I've never heard before either). Basically, this affects my whole life right now. I would be very thankful for any help or support I can get! Current status: - Female - 30 years old - Right breast bloody nipple discharge (unilateral, single (12 o' clock) duct) - Right breast solid mass (~2.3 cm @ 11 o' clock), diagnosed via core needle biopsy to be fibroandenoma - Right breast pain - varies between stinging, throbbing, underlying pressure, and nothing at all and the size and center of its location varies as well (also have felt random stings and weird feelings towards armpit area). With general pressure, the right breast seems a little more tender than the left one (I've always had somewhat tender breasts, but they've always followed the same pattern). Past background: - Have had nipple discharge for at least 4 years, but probably around 10 years (I honestly don't remember, but I sure feel stupid about that now), this is generally not spontaneous and needs nipple/breast stimulation, but I believe in the past that it at least once appeared more or less spontaneously, which is how I discovered it - Nipple discharge has always presented itself as chronic bilateral, green-yellow and \"multi-ductal\" with the addition of that single unilateral bloody duct - I remember having an inflamed feeling, sore, itchy, swollen and red right breast in my mid to upper teens that went away by itself before I had a chance to go see a doctor - I thought I felt a lump around age 19 which I remember made me worried and I told my mom about it, I got sent to do a mammogram as per my own request and was told it was fine (I do not remember for sure what breast, but I'm at least 80% sure it was the right breast) Recent background: - Moved to the US almost 4 years ago - Finally was able to get health insurance in 2014 - Went to see my (then brand new) PCP for recurring UTI's. As this was my first visit with her, she asked if I had done a pap smear in a while and since I hadn't, she sent me to their affiliated women's clinic to get that done and have a general preventative care check-up. I had just turned 30. - Dec 3, 2014: At the women's clinic, I had a pap smear done (which later came back negative/okay) and was asked a bunch of general questions, which is how my chronic nipple discharge came up. I had never really thought about before that and after finding out about it, my doctor did a quick physical exam of my breasts. She was able to make the bloody discharge come out and after seeing it, she wanted to send me off to do an ultrasound. - Dec 23, 2014: At the imaging center, I was given a manual exam that found a lump in my right breast. This was confirmed on the ultrasound. US findings report: \"Right breast: At 11 o'clock right breast approximately 4 cm away from the nipple, there is an irregular hypoechoic lesion measuring approximately 2.3 x 1.1 x 1.8 cm which may present a complicated cyst, a solid lesion or intraductal debris or mass. No definite internal vascularity is seen. Mildy dialated retroareolar ducts are seen in the right breast. There are simple cysts at 9 o'clock measuring 10 mm and 3 o'clock measuring 6 mm. Left breast: Mildly dialated retroareolar ducts are seen. There are multiple simple cysts in the left breast measuring up to 10 mm at 1 o'clock. At 2 o'clock there is a 10 mm cyst with low level internal echoes likely representing debris. Impression: BIRADS Category (4) - Suspicious. Recommendation: Ultrasound guided biopsy of the irregular lesion at 11 o'clock right breast is recommended for tissue correlation. The patient was scheduled for biopsy prior to her departure from the imaging center. - Jan 2, 2015: Back at the imaging center, I had an ultrasound guided core biopsy. - Jan 6, 2015: I called the imaging center to make sure the results were in and my women's clinic doctor would have them for my next day visit. I was told the results looked good and the findings were benign and that my doctor would be able to tell me more. - Jan 7, 2015: Back at the women's clinic, I was told the results indicated that the lump/mass was a fibroandenoma. This was good news, but it still didn't explain the bloody nipple discharge, which could still be a caused by a type of cancer, so I was getting a referral to a \"breast surgeon\" (paperwork later received said this person is a general surgeon and nowhere does it indicated he specializes in breasts at all). US guided core biopsy report: \"Pathology results: Pathology results indicate fibroandenoma. See pathology report for complete description. Pathology results concordant with imaging findings. Impression: BIRADS Category (2) - Benign findings. Recommendation: Annual screening starting at age 40, unless clinically warranted sooner.\" - Feb 2, 2015: At the general surgeon's office, I was given a physical exam and after the doctor had put that together with the previous paperwork/test results and my back story, I was told that I with almost guaranteed certainty need to have surgery to remove the duct where the blood is coming from. But first, I need to get an MRI so that he can see even more and better what is going on. I leave the office crying, feeling overwhelmed. - Feb 24, 2015: Back at the imaging center, I have an MRI without and one with IV contrast dye. - Feb 25-26, 2015: I start feeling pain in my right breast, similar to the pain I felt for about 3 weeks after the core biopsy (which has since disappeared). This is 8 days after the start of my last period and I don't normally feel hormonal changes in my breasts around this time. I just performed my first thorough self-exam after having the core biopsy and I also was laying at a weird angle in the MRI machine, so I'm thinking I've either \"disturbed\" some scarred/healing area from my self-exam or maybe stretched my underlying muscles in a strange way while doing the hour long MRI exam in a position I would normally never be. - Mar 3, 2015: I receive a letter in the mail stating \"Thank you for choosing [name of imaging center] to perform your breast MRI imaging on 02/24/15. We are pleased to inform you that the results of your recent examination are normal and/or benign.\" - Mar 6, 2015: Back at the general surgeon's office, I was told the negative MRI is good in itself, but that it gives even more light to the fact that there's no clear cause for the bloody discharge. He told me that he had a policy to not leave lumps in women's breasts and that a core biopsy can miss the potential cancerous parts of a tumor. He therefore suggested that I have a single surgery that will take care of both the problem with the bloody discharge and remove the tumor. He wrote down notes for me to keep, mentioning that he would like to send me out for a one-sided mammography and a ductogram. He also noted the two \"potential operations: lumpectomy and subareolar duct excision (wide excision)\". He pushed for the latter one and I asked him more about it. He said he would make an incision halfway around the nipple and cut out parts pretty far down underneath it as well as reach out to grab the area of the tumor while they're at it. After hearing that there's a fairly high risk of not being able to breastfeed after the subareolar duct excision, I also asked what my other potential alternatives are, at which point he mentioned ductoscopy. He said that's not very common, but if I'm interested, he can maybe ask around and see if that's a possibility. I mentioned the breast pain I've felt in the past week, but nothing came of it. Future appointments: - Mar 24, 2015: Diagnostic mammography at the imaging center - Mar 25, 2015: Follow-up visit with the women's clinic (they gave me a time slot about two months ago, just in case I wanted to come in) - ????? Follow-up visit with the general surgeon - ????? Ductogram What do you make of all this? Any recommendations? Thank you! Log in to post a reply",
