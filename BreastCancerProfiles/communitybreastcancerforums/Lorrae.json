They said the films worked out fine.  Eventhough I am sure that I now probably have a lower chance of the lump being cancer cause no calcification showed up on the mammogram I still booked into a breast clinic on the 30th of October for another ultrasound and further investigation if needed.  My way of thinking is that in the slight possiblity it is something it would be quite treatable at 5mm and I would probably have a very good outcome. Once again ladies thank you.... Lorrae XX Log in to post a reply",
