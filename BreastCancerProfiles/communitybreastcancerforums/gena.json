The statistics out there not do not always reflect the trials and treatments that are going on now.  Stage IV breast cancer survivors are living much longer than women 20 years ago.  My prayers are with you.

Even when I took it off when my hair came back they just thought I got a short hair cut.  My hair has now thinned out too  much so bought a new wig with a shorter cut.  The stylist again trimmed it to contour to my face.  I went back to work after the summer and no one, not even the ones who knew I had a wig before, knows I have a wig on.  They just think I got highlights.  I will tell them if they ask. ",
