DeeDee and Dani, you are so close to being done! Time to think about celebrating! I've been done for just two weeks. I had 15 regular sessions plus the five boosts, so it's really been three weeks since I had a whole-breast zap, and that skin looks really good. Not like the un-radiated side, but definitely heading toward normal. The boosted area is a bit more pink still but also improving quickly. The nipple is looking a lot better too and really isn't painful any more. Today I don't think the breast is any more painful then it's always been at certain times of my cycle. So, those of you still going through it, it really does get better! I've been pretty sleepy in the afternoon, but that might not be related to radiation. I am set to take my first tamoxifen pill tonight, and I am a little nervous about that, but keep telling myself what it's for and that if it's unbearable I'll just talk to my doctors about possible alternatives. Hang in there, everyone! One day closer!",

After my sentinel node biopsy, after getting good results but still experiencing a lot of pain, I told someone that I would far rather be experiencing that physical pain than waiting for that initial biopsy report. Waiting for test results is just torture, and there's nothing that makes it better. But if you can get through that, which you just did, you can get through the rest. As to whether IDC would have been seen on the biopsy, I was told that 10-15% of the time the final pathology report from DCIS surgery (my initial diagnosis, although it's not in my signature) reveals IDC too. Unfortunately, I was in that small percentage, which was pretty upsetting because it meant a second surgery to get lymph nodes, then additional waiting to find out if they were clear. They also did oncotype testing on the IDC, so I had to wait for that score too. But the nodes were clear, and the score was low, and in the end I had the exact same treatment they had outlined for me after the DCIS biopsy: lumpectomy, radiation, and tamoxifen. So the only thing that really changed was that after a month of thinking I had Stage 0, which never gets chemo, I spent about two weeks bracing myself for the possibility that I would need chemo after all. By then I was so sick of the waiting game I would have happily accepted chemo if it meant just getting ON with treatment! Hang in there, Pegasus. I'm praying it's just more of the same-old same-old for you! ",

I am also feeling a little hopeless. ¬†Benign is great, but my goodness, how many more of these things am I going to experience? ¬†Will I ever learn not to panic, losing sleep and appetite for days until the results are in? ¬†I can't take for granted that the next one will be benign. I found my first lump at 28. ¬†The doctor said it was almost certainly benign, and sent me for US since I was too young for a mammogram. ¬†Open biopsy confirmed a fibroadenoma. ¬†Seven years later, I found a second lump, and again the doctor thought it felt benign. ¬†This time I was old enough for a mammogram, but the lump didn't show up due to my dense tissue. ¬†Ultrasound and needle biopsy confirmed it was another fibro, and I opted to just let it be. ¬†It has since disappeared, or become too small to feel. Last week I felt my third lump. ¬†I was almost calm about it at first, because it felt so much like the first two lumps: ¬†firm, slippery, maybe about 1 cm. ¬†Anxiety took over within minutes, but what got me through the next several days until my appointment was the thought \"This is probably just another fibroadenoma. ¬†If there's one thing I know by now, it's what a fibroadenoma feels like, and this feels just like the other two did.\" ¬†The nurse who did my clinical exam said it felt like a fibroadenoma to her, which was reassuring. ¬†Next came the mammogram. ¬†Again, no findings, due to dense tissue, so off to the ultrasound room. Now, here's where it gets interesting. ¬†The radiologist plunked that sensor down and announced \"You have a cyst.\" ¬†Cyst??? ¬†I asked how big it was: ¬†one inch. ¬†ONE INCH??? ¬†I was flabbergasted, but relieved. ¬†Cysts can be drained. ¬†But the thing I had been feeling felt way more like a 1 cm fibro than a 1 inch cyst. ¬† While I was still wrapping my head around this new information, she moved the sensor a bit and said \"And over here is a solid mass, but it's probably too small to feel. ¬†Looks like a fibroadenoma.\" ¬†I asked how big it was: ¬†8 mm. ¬†Okay, so I have TWO lumps? ¬†I asked which one I had been feeling, and she said it had been the cyst. ¬† So now I'm completely gobsmacked because the one thing I was sure of was that I knew what a 1 cm fibroadenoma felt like. ¬†Now I'm learning that I do have a solid mass in my breast, but I probably wasn't able to feel it. ¬†And if I wasn't able to feel it, that means I DON'T know if it was smooth, slippery, and moveable, which means that now it definitely could be cancer. ¬†All my confidence about it being a benign fibroadenoma melted away, and the total fear I'd been fighting off for days just took over, even though the tech and the radiologist were both referring to it as a fibroadenoma. So I asked the radiologist, \"What do I do about this? ¬†You're telling me I have a solid mass, but I wasn't able to feel it, it didn't show up on mammogram because of dense tissue, and if I hadn't found this cyst right next to it, I never would have known it was there? ¬†How do I know I don't have anything else going on in there?\" ¬†Honestly, I was so wound up inside (although outwardly calm) that I don't really even remember what he said, but he mentioned MRI as a possibility if there's a family history of BC (there isn't). ¬†He also said something about how looking around more could lead to a lot of unnecessary biopsies, which gave me the impression that my breasts are probably just full of little bits of junk just slowly growing until they're actually big enough to find, and the best I can do is just pray that none of them are malignant. ¬†Ugh. Is there anyone who can relate? ¬†Honestly, I am so grateful not to have cancer, but right now I don't even feel confident about that. ¬†If mammograms can't see confirmed lumps in my dense tissue, how do I really know I don't have cancer? ¬† Dx 10/2018, IDC, <1cm, Stage IA, Grade 2, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Surgery 10/4/2018 Lumpectomy Surgery 10/18/2018 Lymph node removal: Sentinel Hormonal Therapy Tamoxifen pills (Nolvadex, Apo-Tamox, Tamofen, Tamone) Radiation Therapy Log in to post a reply",

Moral of story: ¬†let the experts do their job. ¬†They really do know what they're doing; they see thousands of these things each year, and the ones I had the other day were confident enough to pronounce what they were seeing right on the spot, even before the biopsy. ¬†¬† (But - FWIW, what you described sounds like every cyst or fibro I've ever had. ¬†Hope that helps! ¬†)",

I underestimated how sore and stiff I was going to be after the SNB, which took just 3 nodes. I used the arm as little as possible and mostly held it close to my body, so much that coworkers commented on it. There was noticeable improvement week by week, and by the end of the 4th week I felt not quite back to pre-surgery comfort but close enough that I could use the arm normally again. It would have been difficult to take care of young children, but kids old enough to fetch and carry things and help with some household tasks would have been amazing.",

Doctors told me it was fine to leave it be, but I wanted it out for peace of mind, and they obliged. ¬†It left a 2 inch scar and evidently enough scar tissue to perplex radiologists. When I found a second one a few years later, my initial reaction again was \"just get this thing out of me\" but ultimately decided that one 2-inch scar was enough and opted to leave it alone. However, for reasons I can't fully explain, finding this second lump had been really frightening, and every time I touched it I flashed right back to that moment of terror. I felt squeamish enough about it that it deterred me from doing really thorough breast exams.¬†In hindsight, I probably should have just had it out. ¬†Ironically, once I finally got brave enough to go looking for it again, I couldn't find it. ¬†Even the nurse who did my clinical exam four days ago didn't say a word about it. ¬†I think that one just went away on its own! With this third one, I don't know what I'm going to do. ¬†I'd love to avoid another 2 inch scar, but I think keeping it is going to make me anxious. ¬†I'll see what the doctor says. If I were you, I think I'd have it out and be done with it if the alternative is going to be checks every 6 months. ¬†That sounds a lot more stressful than living with a scar, which I probably could have minimized if someone had told me about Vitamin E oil at the time. ¬†Oh well, live and learn, right? Good luck, and sleep well tonight! ¬†",

The pain and flexibility in the left arm have improved quite a bit in the week since I was referred there, so between that and the techniques I learned and the sleeve I'm about to get, I feel pretty well talked down off the cliff, so to speak, regarding my fear of lymphedema. Well, this morning I woke up with pain in my RIGHT armpit. It feels a lot like the left side has: tightness when I stretch, a sense of tenderness but feels OK when I actually touch it, etc. One of the massage techniques she showed me was to massage that armpit, so maybe I was just too vigorous and it's complaining now, or maybe it's referred or sympathy pain from the other arm, or maybe it's the cancer coming back. Or maybe it's a swollen lymph node because I do feel like I\"m catching a cold, but I'm afraid to go feeling around for it because feeling a lump would bring on PTSD. This post probably belongs in the \"emotional health\" forum, but I thought maybe someone here would know whether a first lymphedema massage can annoy the rest of the lymph system?
