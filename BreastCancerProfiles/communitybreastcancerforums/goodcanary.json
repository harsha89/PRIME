    "Content": "May 27, 2015 10:28PM - edited May 27, 2015 10:30PM by goodcanary My breast surgeon as well as my radiation oncologist were able to lay out plain numbers (percentages of recurrence, both invasive and noninvasive for the various permutations of treatment) for me as I was trying to make my choices. The breast surgeon even had her nurse practitioner looking up studies for me to find the scenarios I was trying to consider. The RO is at an academic medical center, which I think makes a difference, that she was on top of the latest studies and data. I also liked looking at the Memorial Sloan Kettering nomogram, but it is specific to DCIS; perhaps a similar tool exists for your diagnosis? I turned myself into an \"expert\" on DCIS but don't have knowledge beyond that. Best of luck to you! P.S. just noticed there is another current thread that called \"rads percentages\" that might help.",
