Until then would it be alright if I join in the conversation? Since \"chemo brain\" has struck, I know it would be easier for her if I give a little information on her journey so far and let her pick up and introduce herself after that.  This group seems to be the best place for both of us since she had her second round of Taxotere/Cytoxan today. Mom lives with my husband, my 3 1/2 year old daughter and myself and I'm her primary caregiver through all of this.  She is a very vibrant, young 71 year old woman. She was diagnosed in October and although she is completely capable of doing all of this herself, it's been a whirlwind of information and sometimes it becomes too overwhelming for her so I tend to be the  one who does the research so that she can just focus on getting through this one step at a time. We're a good team. Mom's first round was pretty rough. Her treatment was on a Wed Nov 30th and she experienced some nausea and fatigue, anxiety and irritability for the first few days then on Sunday the train hit her hard. She had constipation and stomach cramping, passed out in the bathroom and hit her head and we spent that day in the emergency room.  Monday and Tuesday was hard as well: more stomach cramping, body aches from the Neupogen shots (fortunately a friend told me about Claritin so it wasn't as bad as it could have been) a small fever, some nerve pain, and overall exhaustion. By That Thursday she was feeling better. Last week her scalp started hurting and that was the beginning of her hair falling out. We had already explained to my 3 1/2 year old that the doctor was giving \"Gammy\" some medicine to help her get better and the medicine was going to make her feel tired and icky for a while, but once we get through the hard part she'll be feeling better. We also told her that when Gammy's  hair started falling out we would know the medicine was working. So we grabbed some scissors and had a little \"The medicine's working!\" party in the bathroom. She could not believe We were letting her cut Gammy's hair short. The next day my daughter and husband shaved Mom's head. It was quite the family affair. I know losing her hair was VERY hard for her, but letting my daughter be a part of the process and keeping it light and fun was the best medicine for my Mom and the best way to keep it from being scary for my daughter. My Mom looks awesome bald!  She has a wig for going out and found a great head band with bangs that she can wear under her hats that looks beautiful as well. This past week she was feeling much better and we had a lovely Christmas. She is tired from the treatment today and although we are bracing for anything we are hopeful that her oncologist is right when she said this round should be a bit easier on her. I'm learning that everyone's experience is different so we have prepared as best as we can for whatever the next week holds. Tomorrow Im going to be making soup and a few recipes from a great book called, \"The Cancer Fighting Kitchen\" I highly recommend it! It has recipes for every stage of treatment as well as information on what foods help with specific side effects. Well that's it for now. I so grateful for this forum and all of you. I hope you are all having peaceful restful nights.",
