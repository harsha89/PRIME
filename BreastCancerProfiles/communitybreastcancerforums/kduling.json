I'm still so new at this, I went to write to you all on Friday and it said I had already done 5 posts within 24 hours!  OOPS!  Now I know why you all write all your messages in one post!  DUH! Let me start with \"personal\" responses then I have some questions (at the end) for everyone:  CCBaby:   Glad your hair is growing!  YEAH!   I'm watching mine every day!  (I know it's too early, but one can hope, huh?) GinaGina:  YES, you can add me to the \"roll\" list.  THANKS!  :-) Alyad:  - I had Tram Flap - but my PS was the opposite.  I was a size 16 (double D) and he kept mentioning that he'd do a slight reduction in my \"real\" one.  At first I didn't want that (I'm used to what I have) but since the tummy is flatter -- he was right and the fake one looks good.  He did a good job.   I'll probalby have the surgery to \"lift\" & slightly reduce the real one in August.  I see him on Wed. to get a definite date.  Pickle:   Sounds like we are on about the same path.  My mom had a mastectomy (R side only)a couple years ago and you can see when she's wearing a nighty (at Christmas, etc.) that she's \"lopsided\".   I never liked that, so I chose reconstruction at the same time as mastectomy.   I also like it for when I'm wearing a tank top or swimsuit or something where a little cleavage shows.   I look really naturally right now.   I even wore a tank top (that criss crossed) on Friday and a gal I work with saw a bit of cleavage showing and asked me which one was fake!  I took that as a compliment!   I start Tamaxofin on Wed, so I'll let everyone know if I have any SE. Kim40:   I'm a SUPER positive (bubbly) person, so most people wouldn't think I would think about it, but I am worried to death about the cancer coming back!   I've heard if it comes back, it's WORSE the 2nd time.   I saw info on the Today show this week about cancer and it showed people who had cancer and the dates they had it.   It seems like a bunch of people had TWO dates.  That was horrible.   Tell me what your Oncologist tells you as far as being checked.  Mine said scans aren't that effective  because you have to have so many cells \"bunched together' before they show up on a scan.  She said the best way is for me to \"know\" my body.   If I get headaches, it could have gone to brain, if I get nausea it means it could have gone to liver or kidney (I forget which)....etc.     Great....so I get to be paranoid about every headache I get?  UGH! Questions for all: Looks like hardly anyone had the same chemo I had.  I had ACT -- sounds like most of you had the \"T\" seperate?    Why?    Did you all get the Neulasta shot?  If not, why not?  I loved it.   OC didn't give it to me final chemo (#4) and I think it slowed me down from getting over SE. Think that's it for today.   I think my taste is FINALLY starting to get better.   Not 100% yet, but better.   I read on one web site that some people NEVER get their taste back normal!  UGH!

I was really pretty depressed the week after my last chemo -- so worried about it coming back.   My onc also said no scans.  Freaked me out.  She said by time it shows up on a scan it's kind of big....that I would have a better chance of catching it earlier by just knowing my body.   UGH.  Not what I wanted to hear.   I've bounced back (mostly) now.  I'm not focusing on it coming back. Lady at church shaved her head for cancer  - it FINALLY looks like a really short cute hairstyle.  I asked her how long since she shaved her head....she said 3 months.  UGH.  THREE MONTHS!  I'm ready NOW for hair!  I hate \"drawing on\" my eyebrows.   I didn't lose lashes, but I was going to get fake ones if I did. (I'm vain!) Plastic Surgeon set my appt. for surgery for Aug. 6th.   Lift and slightly reduce real boob, do a slight reshaping (more cone-like and less round) of the fake boob. Congrats to Marlene, Dawn, Ricki and NYDeb on finishing chemo!  I hope it all goes well for you! My last chemo took me like 10 days to not be tired, nauseous etc.   (Usually it was only about 3-4 days).   Not sure if it's cuz it was my last one (accumulative effect) or if it's cuz they didn't give me neulasta last time.   I loved neulasta....my first one I had a bit of achey shoulders but after that no SE. My taste is probably 90% back to normal.  Some things still smell funny -- and a few things taste funny, but not too bad.   I'll be really glad to have taste and smells back to normal! I'm afraid to take anything for the baldness......are either of those the same as rogaine?   Someone once told me that once you start rogaine, you have to use it forever?? Guess that's it for now.  I'll hopefully get on here a little more often! Hugs Karen",
