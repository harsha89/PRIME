I still have very low energy and tire easily. My surgery was on a Monday. Came home on Wedsesday and was told I could shower on Thursday. I still had four drains. I have heard people say they wrap saran wrap around their chest to shower. I do not understand why some doctors say you can shower and others say no. Mine told me I could take tubs baths also, which I did today. Regarding my appetite, I have not had one since my surgery. I make my self eat two meals everyday. Happy Sunday to everyone!",

I am very discouraged.  I feel like the cancer is growing daily.  If I have the drain tube put in then I will have to wait on that incision to heal before I can start treatment.  Has any one else had this problem?

If there is cancer in the tissue they took out, then they will go back in and remove the lymph nodes. I have four drains. I feel great! Came home yesterday. Got a shower today.
