(Don't tell my husband. lol) These days they are my constant companions (along with the kitties), and they are being wonderfully attentive. The cattle dog loves lap sitting (at 30 lbs) and the kelpie mix is now wanting to sit in my lap too. 50 lbs in a lap that has recently undergone surgery - but worth it. I only hope that I have the strength to do the right thing if that day ever comes.  I truly dread losing them. janice",
