I am hoping that I am in the 80 percent... My doc said a biopsy is very likely. She also said she hopes she is wrong. It does feel good to be around people who know how I feel. I am trying not to freak out or worry because I haven't told anyone but my husband and my pastor and his wife - and two very close, praying friends. I am not saying anything yet because I don't want to deal with everyone else's emotions. I know that sounds selfish, but I just don't feel like reassuring or comforting someone else right now.",

My world changed on July 22, 2015. My shoulder had been aching, not constant, but just every now and then - enough to be a nuisance. I am a writer so at first I chalked it up to some funky way I was holding my laptop or a weird way I was sitting while typing. Then I started feeling around and there it was, in my left breast, a lump. It is probably grape sized, maybe smaller. I can't really tell. What I can tell is that it doesn't seem to move - if it does, it isn't much. I also have pain under my shoulder blade directly behind where the lump is. I didn't do anything right away. I wanted to see if it would go away. Several days later nothing had changed so I talked to my husband. We don't have insurance so we burned several days looking for a doctor I could go to and pay out of pocket without having to mortgage my home. I called the American Cancer Society for information - numerous times as nothing panned out. Finally I got in with a clinic who set me an appointment but I would have to wait for four weeks. The woman setting up my appointment told me that with the symptoms I was describing I should try to get seen earlier. So I kept trying. Finally I got in with a women's clinic and was seen the next day (July 30). At the office visit the doctor noted a mass in my left breast and swollen lymph nodes. I asked if I should be concerned and she said yes. She wanted me to get a mammogram ASAP. She gave me the order and the next morning I called. My diagnostic mammogram is scheduled for Monday, August 3 at 3 pm. It will be a mammogram and sonogram from what I understand. Honestly, I don't know what to think. I still hurt. My underarm feels swollen, not much but enough to be a little uncomfortable. Most of the time I don't even notice it though - well, except for the nagging, mocking word that keeps clanging around in my brain and surfaces when I least expect it - cancer. No cancer in my family but I guess that doesn't really mean anything. I am 48 years old, had a complete hysterectomy in 2007. I am no idiot; I know this doesn't look good. I just wish I knew. Pretty much anything would be better than this waiting, this not knowing. I want to know that everything will be OK. I want to know that I will hold my grandchildren and attend my daughter's wedding. I want to know that I will grow old with my husband. But right now I know nothing. Log in to post a reply",

We wound up paying out of pocket because my husband did not want me to wait a month (the one appointment I could get). I had to wait one day to see the doctor and four days for the mammogram. Considering what I was looking at, things are moving fairly rapidly. Still, these few days have just about driven me crazy. I ping pong back and forth between complete peace and insane worry. One minute I am sure it is nothing and the next I am convinced it's worse case scenario. I can't imagine waiting months to get the necessary tests and exams, yet based on my experience, that is the world of at least a segment of women in our society. I find that troubling.",

The tech couldn't find it; I had to show her the general area where it is. It is much smaller and, like I said, the shape and feel has changed. I can now feel that is it uniform and smooth. I have been doing some serious praying and warring in the spirit the last few days. This has raised awareness for me, though. How many other women go through this and don't have the resources to even get seen in a timely manner? I would have had to wait a month if my husband hadn't shifted bill money around to pay for me to be seen. I wrote about it on my blog. Thank you all for your words of support and encouragement. You helped me get through a very difficult time.",
