      "Content": "CRW1993 wrote: I had an ultrasound guided core biopsy 11/19/2012 for a 19 mm nodule in left breast. Received pathology report. I am 38 years old. History in 2011 had a lump removed in left breast that was a fibroadenoma. Pathology Report: Permanent sections confirm the impression given on the basis of touch imprints and show features of a fibroadenoma including the presence of multiple segments of loose and hypocellular stroma with the presence of slit-like ductal spaces. In the adjacent breast tissue, there is a focus of what appears as sclerosing adenosis including proliferation of clusters of epithelial cells compressed by the surrounding stroma. There is however some cellular atypia of the lining epithelial cells in that particular focus including enlargement of nuclei with a few scattered hyperchromatic nuclei but without abnormal chromatin distribution. No mitoses are present after scanning the entire area of adenosis. Diagnosis Stereotactic Core biopsies, left breast mass: A)      Segments of a fibroadenoma B)      Adjacent breast tissue showing a focus of sclerosing adenosis, see comment. In the area of adenosis, there are atypical features which may be part of the process of sclerosing adenosis. I will perform baseline immunohistochemistry stains for further assessment and a final report will follow. This report is a preliminary report. ***Surgeon stated he wanted to go in and do excisional biospy and remove the fibroadenoma tumor and some of the area around it.**** Please help me understand this report.
