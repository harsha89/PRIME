Is that something I'll find out at the oncologist appt ?  Puffin, it looks like your diagnosis is similar to mine. thank you for the advice, and recording the Dr. visits is a great idea. My mother and sister also plan to go with me to the oncologist.  Momtoirishquads, you mentioned whether or not it has spread to my nodes.. should that result be shown on my diagnosis where it says: 'Lymphovascular invasion: Not Noted' and if so, then why does it Say \"Not Noted\" on my lab results? that kinda worries me... lyzzysmom, thank you for sharing your experience. It does make me feel some relief when I hear radiation isn't as bad as most people think. I've already changed my diet, I'm staying away from alcohol and cigarettes and exercising more. And Thank you msphil for your inspiration and prayers. Although I keep trying to ignore this and act like it's just a bad nightmare I'll wake up from... I appreciate this site and msg board.",

I don't know how all of you made it through this. people say I'm a strong person but this situation is so foreign to me. Xanax is helping me a little, but I don't want to start relying on it and getting addicted. Kris, you said you were diagnosed within the week and you already know your treatment plan... that is fast . you must have some good doctors where you are. I have to wait to see an oncologist on thursday. I just want this to be over. I wish all of you the best. ",

Ridley, I have been on Zoloft for my depression since my brother died in 2008. I've been to a grief counselor two times, but talking about the experience brings back the memories so much I can't handle it and all I do is cry and want to go home. Thank you to everyone for being so helpful and supportive.  Darla",
