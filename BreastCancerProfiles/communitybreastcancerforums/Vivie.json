As for radiation..I want to avoid it if I can , as I'm worried about it , but I will decide tomorrow at my appointment.  How was your mastectomy surgery ? If you want , PM me , I understand.I'm doing the unilateral mastectomy most probably ( I prefer it over having a lx and radiation ) but it will be firmed up tomorrow.  Thank you for your support! ",

As for the trip..it's cheaper to go abroad , rather than travel in my own country...yes , that is true.I can all see you staring and going WTF at  that , but it's true..a trip to my friend's island is at the same price of going into London! I still havent decided where I'd want to go ,  but my dream destination would be the States for a 2nd visit, but that's something I can't afford...*sigh* michelle have fun visiting the new baby and knowing her! I miss my nephew too much ( 1yr old ) but he's been sick so we're keeping our distance - even when I was in tip top shape colds wiped me out , so I dread to see what'll happen now.

I know abt the feeling of being gypped out , I also always flew to Athens in October/November to welcome friends that did a brief stint/layover in the ATH airport and I'd be there to show them around and greet them , but this year , a friend is coming from NZ , and I still haven't booked anything..I feel good , but I'm afraid of my energy levels..as for the emotions thing...its something that I have to deal on my own and try to figure out..We have to hang in there and make the best of it , and next year , hopefully , we'll laugh about it..  It's October , and that means we're closer to the end than ever! I finish out Jan 10th ( hopefully) , so I'm trying to hang on that date.Along with a lot of chocolate.  as for side effects , this might not be considered a side effect , but my right arm is really sore ..especially the hand part ( where they found a vein ) and have some bruises. Worried about that bc they'realmost black , but since last night , begun to fade.Hoping to heal , but starting to think that maybe I should've asked for a port.On top of that , the really expensive wig has a tear on the inside , and I have to get that fixed.too much tugging and probably some of the rice pelting from the wedding made it tear.Ugh, and my mother mentioned that if we leave it , it might make a bigger rip ( anyone has had that experience ? ) so better to get that looked at.  Things in Greece are starting to look worse and worse , as I have to pay for a property tax that I don't have the money for , and another tax revenue for which I don't have money either - everything went on the surgery /wig/paraphernalia/books to keep my sanity intact.Oof.Not much money for Christmas either, and my mood isn't helped by the fact that some of the packages I had in the mail went missing. BTW , I know this is not the foob forum , but i've had some burning sensation from my TE.feels weird and I worry - appt with the PS is on the 25th  , and it's not too bad , but I worry.",

So I'm being put on a big decision...  One doctor suggested I do a Mx...and chemo if the lymph nodes are found positive too..( reconstruction permissible on the negative on the same surgery )  Other doctor suggested a lumpectomy and rads....( but I don't want to take the slightest risk in having my implant fail..it's so dear to me )  I'm just so confused and feel lost..I should start screaming and say , why me..but then I reply..why not?I'm not the first , and I certainly will not be the last....  Thank you for hearing me out..

As soon as I ditched it , I felt so much like MYSELF.   I told my mother an hour ago to put a scarf/hat in with the jackets/stuff we're taking for the after the wedding meal - there's dancing involved - so that I can don something for when I ditch my wig - THERES NO WAY I can last all afternoon with it!!! and..I got into a fight.  So depressed.They mean well..but it's feeling like being bullied.and I should know , since I was bullied through school for me being deaf and my speech impairment and my hearing equipment.   Wedding's tomorrow and I'm not in the mood for it.I want to stay home and hide.I'll probably put an appearance at the wedding & then go home , and let the rest of my family go to the sit down meal.Too bad , bc I was looking forward to it.  Breast Cancer takes from us so many things.Our hair , our confidence , our health , and most of all , changes every relationship on earth we have.My mother and I always have been close , but now it's claustrophobic.She's pressuring me to change.Change my eating habits , change myself , change who knows what.",

I was glad to see I wasn't the only one bc my BS basically said I'm nut crazy....It's a month and a half since my sx , and I start my chemo on the 14th.Can you fit a 28 yr old Greek among your Aug group?  I didn't get a port or anything , going to have tx every 3 weeks , don't even know what my meds will be , I will find out on the chemo day I guess.What's a Neulasta shot ?  I've been trying to hold up , and the hair loss thing doesn't bother me - yet - as I've been trying to make it through everything , but it really bothers my mother and her two sisters , and been on my case to get a wig.Umm, NO.Insurance will reimburse me 200$ , but they're up to 600$ here.As I'm a college student , I don't have this kind of money , and went private for my sx , as the long wait lines in publichospitals are AWFUL.Wanted it off myself ASAP The weird thing is that I can sleep on my stomach - side with the left TE put in - I see that most of you can't :( what really bothers me is the TE port when I sleep on my left side , it really bothers me , lol.  I don't know about SE's...I already have a minor reflux and am deaf already , which was what my onco warned me about , plus being tired , and hair loss , oh , and balance.I never  had great balance anyway..way too many hello floor moments! I do have a Cochlear Implant to hear , and now I have an Boob Implant.both are on left side....  I'm anxious/worried/scared abt the 14th , and I just want to run away! Guess I'll have to suck it up , try to be positive..",

Woo hoo!  Ellen and Robyn..good luck with your last treatment! I'm on the last treatment w A/C too on the 18th , can't wait , then I switch to Taxotere..scared w/that but it means one more step closer to get the all done! My VERY last tx is on the 10th Jan , which is right after the holidays..( Christmas Holidays don't stop until after the 8th in Greece.) I will not do RADS bc a) I did a mx and my SNB was in the clear , and b) I absolutely refused to do rads.Rads scare me more than chemo.  I don't have a lot of S/E so far except the constant fatigue and some loss of apetite, but this round the Neulasta really kicked my behind.Oof.Not willing to do that shot again.  Also , one last thing : at the blood draw on the 27th ( eve of tx ) the flebotomist couldn't find a vein at the crook of my elbow..she'd pull and it was just air..That made me VERY scared.Since then I couldn't extend my arm fully and it hurts a LOT.I googled it up and it sounds like she hit a nerve and now my arm's not very useful w the pain..I still can do things but I relied on it more since the surgery since I can't extend the other too much either since the SNB...Argh , it's so frustrating.From what I read , it'll take 6-9 months for the nerve to regenerate/heal. FYI she did a blood draw from the back of my hand w a butterfly stick , the kid kind one , and did draw blood in the end .. I'm not willing to go to her again since she managed to destroy my arm ...:(  it's not like it needs a painkiller ( and I feel overmedicated ) but my pinkie hurts constantly as is my arm. This made me feel so blue that I said to my mother that I can't do it anymore , that I want to stop  going to the hospital and just be DONE.   It's frustrating being shut up and in bed so much of the time , and feeling so unproductive..Fortunately , a close friend is in a similar situation ( for different reasons , she's pregnant and in danger of losing the baby so she has to be in bed constantly till she gives birth ) so we talk a lot and try to while the time..And my dad comes home w a lot of treats  , to cheer me up, bless him..",
