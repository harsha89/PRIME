      "Content": "Mar 31, 2016 06:46PM MaineRottweilers wrote: It does help! Thank you for the info. The news is kind of mixed but overall quite good. Good news is that there is still no visceral involvement, very good news indeed! The so-so news is that CT keeps picking up new skeletal lesions but they are not confirmed as active, i.e. they don't pick up dye on the bone scan and last time didn't show activity on PET. The beast is slumbering but is not dead nor gone. It's the best I can hope for and really is good news too but troublesome for me to wrap my brain around that change is still occurring but not confirmed as actual progression. I really want to hear NED, no evidence of disease or even remission or stability but those are not words uttered or written, yet. That said, I am going off chemo for a while. It's not doing anything miraculous and it's making me feel really sick so why take it? By going off it, we can evaluate if it is having any impact on slowing down progression. I'm going to continue to get targeted therapies, via infusion, every three weeks, Herceptin & Perjeta. I am also going to start taking daily Arimidex, we don't know that it will be useful given my weird, ER negative, PR+ (50%) pathology but it's worth trying. If I don't like the side effects, I will discontinue it but I will give it at least 12 weeks to see if it is beneficial. So continues life of a stage IV patient, metster, lifer, whatever you want to call it. Taking life in 12 week increments and re-evaluating. I hope I have lots of time to get used to it.",

I have real pain medications for bone mets but haven't really needed them. Do you just use NSAIDs? What are the papaya tablets for?",
