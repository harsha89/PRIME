Don\u2019t have a date for biopsy scheduled yet, but she thinks it could be a sebaceous cist. djmammo also thinks it could be that, since it has gotten bigger and painful at times, then shrinks. Will keep posting..",

      "Content": "Hesalujois wrote: hello, I am a 34 year old mother of 4. I stopped breastfeeding my youngest at the beginning of this year. In June, I started feeling some pain in my nipple. I also felt a lump and also noticed that it waspulled in (retracted, inverted) and wouldn\u2019t come out. I went to the dr to have it checked out but he said it was probably just dried up milk from breastfeeding (i had stopped a few months back). I continued with my life and last week felt some pain again and the lump was bigger. Nipple still inverted and can't push it out much at all. Went again to the dr and he ordered an ultrasound. These last days it's been a bit more painful and itchy. I don't see any changes in my skin besides the nipple retraction. Anyone have a similar experience? I am a little bit scared but not too much. No Breast cancer in my family that I know of. Thanks! Log in to post a reply",
