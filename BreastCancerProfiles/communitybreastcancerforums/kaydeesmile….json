I had four positive nodes, but even one is too many. I certainly have a lot more questions for my onc. I take some comfort in knowing that I demanded a bi-lat. mastectomy instead of going with the recommended lumpectomy. Lobular is tricky and sneaky hence my concerns. It did not show up on mammogram or ultrasound. And the MRI only picked up one tumor of about a centimeter and a half. It showed no node involvement which still astounds me. So far a PET scan (which the onc did not order but I went to another doctor to get) and a brain MRI have been clear. I'm pushing for a bone scan next once I get through chemo and switch oncs. Hope4, I am highly hormone + as well- so tamoxifen research is high on my list. I am expecting to start it after radiation. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.",

Also, my surgeon suggested a lumpectomy since the MRI only showed a 1.5 tumor and no node involvement. Final path showed that was all wrong. I had ILC all over the place in my right breast. I agreed to the lumpectomy at first. But I changed at the last minute. My gut told me to push for a double mx instead. Reading about lobular before the surgery just made be think there could be more there - and there was. No regrets about my decision.",

I just wanted to get started.mImhad a very goodn surgeon and went to the oncologist that she referred me to. I have not been happy with him or his office at all and am changing docs now that I'm through chemo. I'm not sure I would have opted for adriamycin in the end even if offered. My family has a long history of heart disease and I have some very early stages of it. The benefits of that drug may not have outweighed the risks of possible additional long term heart damage. But if there were a compelling case for using it anyway, I wish the onc had steered me in that direction. I have talked to more docs now that chemo is finished. They seem to be stressing the importance of the Tamoxifen part of treatment since my ILC is super hormone positive.",

Feel free to express yourself as long and as often as you want. Getting it out helps. A lot of us have had the shock of thinking our situation was one thing - then we found out it's much more serious. We can totally relate. Chemo terrified me too but I made it through. If that's the course you decided to take just know you will make it too. Hang in there.",
