I am going back into surgery on Friday to have a lymph node dissection. I have received some test results and since I am a worse case scenario kind of girl, I am trying to play out all options. I am 42 yeras old. My oncotype score is 25. I had a 1 cm tumor removed with clean margins, grade 3. I was ER and PR+, but HER2 -. Here is the kicker, I am getting married for the first time in October. I really don't want to get Chemo if the benefits are not significant. The side effects scare the crap out of me. Any advice on this would be appreciated. Log in to post a reply",
