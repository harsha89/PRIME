I was told last week that the team is drawing permanent marker lines on my left breast to mark where the lasers line up, and that I cannot bathe that breast for duration of treatment. I can only take sit baths and a shower with saran wrap covering for 6.5 weeks, apparently. Is it crazy that I keep wondering about exercise? I really enjoy exercising, and quite frankly, it's the only thing that helps me to forget about breast cancer for awhile.....
