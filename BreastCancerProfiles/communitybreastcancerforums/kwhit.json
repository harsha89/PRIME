I have googled and even had second opinion from a specialist who said not to worry, but what I read makes me worry. My recent mammo/ultrasound in same breast, same area I now have a cyst. Everything I have read about FEA makes me worry, especially when the surgeon in 2012 said \"pretty sure we got the right spot\", WTH??? Now 2016 and I have a benign cyst in same area. I cant help but worry there is more going on, is there something lurking in my dense breast tissue that is being missed. Why when I google FEA does it say precursor to cancer or something lurking nearby and drs say everything is fine dont worry? What is FEA????? I guess I just feel after reading so much on here and google, that I cant trust anyone, because one thing is for sure, there is something going on in my right breast, hence 2012 biopsy with FEA and now a cyst, same area.

I think I can have it, I would have to pay the difference, which at this point I dont mind doing if it will decrease the risk of call backs because we all know how stressful that is!

I did the same especially when the dr. who performed the lumpectomy said \"we're pretty sure we got the right thing, your tissue is very glandular\". In the end I had to trust and pray that anything else would show on future mammos. That was 2012 and i was called back in 2016 for cyst and now again in 2017 for a new nodule, all in same breast. Report says this new nodule is likely benign, go for ultrasound tomorrow, so we will see. Prayers for peace of mind for you!",
