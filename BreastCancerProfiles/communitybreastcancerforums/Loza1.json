I guess this journey so far taught me to leave the control to God and let him manage my life. At first I was so devastated, crying non stop, waking up in the middle of the night freaking out. I was trying to wake up from this nightmare. I thought that I can change things but turned to be that I can't. I am not the super women I thought I am. After the initial shock, I started praying, going to church with a different attitude. I found my peace when I realized that I can't change what I have but I need to deal with it. I knew that God is with me holding my hands during this journey. I did my surgery and will start radiation next week but I am accepting what is happening now and cheerful. I do have my sad moments but it is more of normal. Hang in there and let God control what happens next. He knows best.",
