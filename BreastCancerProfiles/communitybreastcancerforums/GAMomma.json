I think your situation can be very unique. I didn't even know you could have a sentinel without a mastectomy. The burning pain is exactly what the sentinel die feels like. I did not have any burning pain in my breast after,because I didn't have a breast...so.... I see this was sometime ago,so hope you are doing well.",

I have had multiple surgeries,all cold turkey. So this was on the lower scale of pain. Yes it hurt,it burned and stung and was not pleasant in any way. I'm on the fence about knowledge about it. I think if I knew pain was involved I would be super anxious,more then I was, when they performed it. I did ask why no pain meds were involved. It was explained to me that when numbing meds were given,injected, that is changed the composition of the dye and made it less effective,not as accurate. I know mine was an hour prior to surgery so the dye could be ready for my surgeon. But I may not be 100 % correct.",

But in all the surgeries,child birth, this was in the bottom scale of pain,thankfully!",

I had gastric bypass and lost 150 pounds and a ton of fat,everywhere,but my breasts definitely retook the brunt. Then breast feeding 5 kids created and unhappy situation. I had a lot of excess skin,so maybe that's why it was not as painfully as others? I don't diminish someone else's discomfort,everyone's pain level and experience is very different.",

I have had breast pain on that side for 3 years. I had a Mammo right before I turned 40,negative for problems. They followed up with an ultrasound and a surgeon opinion. Nothing was found and was told it was fatty tissue or fibrous tissue? I don't remember 100. The one area I had the most discomfort was right at the nipple,this is where my largest mass was found.

So I will go with had..DCIS grade 3,3 masses,the largest being over 4cm. I chose a double mastectomy. A few reasons. The fAct that it was larger and high grade a mastectomy of the right breast was recommended. My oncologist then told me if my sentinel lobe biopsy was clear then I would be on Tamoxifen for prophylactic of the left breast. I had such mixed feelings of one breast. I could not do immediate reconstruction. First there are no doctors in my area that have all the accreditation that is recommended in another forum. So I thought 1 breast? For how long? It would be weird. I've had 5 kids,breast Fed them all plus had a large weight loss over 10 years ago. Let's face it,these girls have seen better days. I thought I will have 1 very nice boob and the other just sad,saggy,needing help. Yes I could have surgery to help \"match\" but I knew it was not for me. I was immediately pulled towards a double. I had not ever second guessed myself. Here I still boobless and fine. Yes I will get reconstruction sometime,but I have to heal first,that's my goal. Since so had a double,Tamoxifen would not be necessary since I removed all threat of cancer. Ok maybe that's being a bit broad,but the right here,right now cancer was removed. I got clear margins from the mastectomy and sentinel lobe biopsy. After you have anything removed it's normal to have everything sent for pathology. I found out after that my left breast had cancer also. Never seen on a Mammo..no lump,nothing. It was very very small. Chances are in 6-12 months I would have needed more surgery. I felt relieved in a way about my decision to remove a healthy breast. It really was not healthy,just hiding. Take some time,look at pictures,read others story. A lumpectomy may need reconstruction of some sort. Check that out. Not saying to have a mastectomy. That is a decision only you can make,but of course talk to your medical team. Read up on post op, 5 yrs from now,if possible. I had limited options due to the size of my cancer,even though it was it DCIS,my entire duct was nearly full. I'm sure there is a medical term that is used,but this is my language. Sometimes the terminology itself is exhausting. I hope your genetics come back fine,mine did ðŸ˜Š I am now 6 weeks post op and going back to work part time on Monday..my recovery has had a few bumps,but for the most part pretty good. ",

I have had remove via needle and then an additional drain replaced. After two weeks of little draining it was removed. It was ok until this past Wednesday. I actually began having neck pain. At first I thought it was due to sleeping odd. But Friday into Saturday I laid on my problem side (right) . I woke up very very uncomfortable. Almost like laying on something hard. This is the weird thing,it is not my incisions,never has been. It is behind my back,right where you lower bra strap lays,behind my arm pit and up to my arm pit. It is now puffy but not red,not hot.. I went back to wrapping up with a ace bandage,this increased my neck pain.I removed it and slept without it. This morning I got up feeling like I cannot look to the right,looking up is very very painful at my neck. I will call/see the doc tomorrow. In the meanwhile,is this something that I should very worried about. I do not have a temp or anything. Let me add a secondary issue. In my healing I had internal hemorrhoids from roughly 16 yrs ago. They became external and thrombost. I had them drained..then the next day again..drained. it was hell.. a few days(2 I think) I could not deal with the same pain. I was literally thinking of killing myself,it hurt that bad. Turns out I have several rectal tears. I'm get NG all that fixed on 4-13. My regular doc is out of town til then. Anyway that's all of it.. I don't think my bottom issue is contributing to this neck pain but it's getting worse not better.
