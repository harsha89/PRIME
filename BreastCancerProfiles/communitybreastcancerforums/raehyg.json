I was told by the radiologist but sort of figured it out when the sono tech was focusing on a lymph node. I had a fine needle biopsy the week prior and decided to call the surgeon to see if the results were in. Well yes they were and they told me that it came back positive for malignant cells....so yes it was definitive I had breast cancer. The radiologist also urged me to take off from work the next day and do the core biopsies. You never can tell until the biopsy results are in so maybe its benign. This is a wonderful site with wonderful women with a wealth of information. It is a big blow and waiting is the worse part of it all. I hope and pray you will have good news. Good luck to you!",

I am trying to figure out what is worse the chemo or the neulasta....I crashed the first week eventhough I was working. Had the chemo Mon and had to leave work on Fri. I am hoping this Monday's chemo/neulasta goes better as far as crashing. This Mon I felt so much better until today when I had a stabbing pain in my spine and radiating agony down my legs etc. I could not lie down sit or walk this morning. I was told it can still be from the neulasta. I also have RA so I think it adds to it. I think this was a great idea! I have found so much information....improving with my navigating skills",

Many times they do not understand because cancer is just a word to them and they are just clueless. I hope you can find the support here to get you through this. The lymph nodes make the diagnosis worse because it has spread and can spread more quickly to other areas in the body. I hope this helps. Rachel",

I went for the core biopsies yesterday so I know its premature. I most likely have lymph node involvement(axillary) and I believe I am at least stage 2 based on facts that I know. I have no idea what type as of yet and will find out next week. My question is how do you decide when to do reconstruction if going for a mastectomy? I truly believe the one side I am removing there are 3 different areas and the node. The other side has what they believe may only be a fibroadenoma but I am large breasted....do not want to go through this again and don't want to be totally lopsided( I know it sounds stupid but I am trying to prepare myself before speaking with the surgeon. At least I cannot be as shocked as I already am). Thought the one area was residual scar tissue from a puncture wound from a dog bite. Also, anyone here have rheumatoid arthritis and if so were you able to take your RA meds or did you have to stop cold turkey?

My Rheumatologist told me if there is corticosteroids in chemo that will help but of course mine do not. I will be given a low dose of decadron which is as routine with the chemo. From the reading that I did and found many people say thet the RA wasn't bad until after treatment stopped and then they got a bad flare after the fact. I was worried about it but I just figure the chemo will be like bad RA because of the side effects. This way I am prepared for the worst and I have already suffered from failing meds from the RA...how bad can it be, lol. The RA meds will compromise you further. I stopped the meds once I found out. My Rheumatologist agreed.  If worse comes to worse I will go on prednisone......but I really want to try to avoid it. Good luck to you and I am sorry you are here also. I am triple negative.",
