      "Content": "TectonicShift wrote: Or maybe I should have titled this \"Too Few Enrollees, No Cure Anytime Soon.\" Every drug that is currently available has undergone rigorous testing on clinical-trial volunteers. If cancer patients don't volunteer to participate in trials, there will likely not be a cure for any of the many types of cancer anytime soon. But according to the National Breast Cancer Coalition, less than 3% of the population of active cancer patients do enroll. http://www.breastcancerdeadline2020.org/breast-can... It is important for everyone to understand - especially \"newbies\" - that your oncologist will not necessarily recommend a clinical trial for you. Many oncologists just administer standard-of-care treatment, which is pretty much the same across the country (surgery, AC+T chemo, radiation), and that's it. Sure, if there is some trial going on at the clinic or hospital where you are being treated, then he or she may suggest it for you. That's in house. But it's very unlikely you will be directed to a clinical trial at a cancer center across town or in another town or in another state. Cancer is a retail business. Your oncologist is probably not interested in sending you, the customer, elsewhere. Plus, sadly, many oncologists are 9 to 5 'ers. They don't really understand the science and don't really care to. They don't make sure to stay informed about the hundreds of breast cancer trials going on around the country. All they have to do is follow the ASCO guidelines for standard of care. And when treatments are no longer working, they say, \"Sorry, there's nothing more we can do.\" (Not all - some are great and really interested in the science of cancer and in scientific advancements. And some really do fight for the survival of all their patients rather than just writing them off when treatments stop working.) If you are interested in participating in a clinical trial, either to advance science or to try to give yourself a better chance of surviving, in addition to asking your oncologist if they know of any trials that would be good for you, you might also want to read up on available trials, find a trial that might be good for your situation, pick up the phone, and make the call to the trial contact yourself. It will not mean that you cannot still be under the care of your current oncologist. You just might want to inform him or her that you are doing a trial and and keep him updated. (Or not.) And you don't have to be a patient at a clinic to enroll in a trial that that clinic is offering. You can do standard of care with your oncologist and then go elsewhere to get on a trial that might help prevent recurrence. Or you can find a trial that includes standard-of-care treatment (plus more new therapies) from the get-go. Clinical trials are not for everyone. It's a personal decision. Not everyone has the time and resources I know. And trials are not always without risk, especially phase 1 trials, which are small trials that test new modalities and therapies for safety, side effects, and for dose escalation. However, in the U.S. in particular researchers and doctors take the \"do no harm\" mantra extremely seriously. It's one reason progress has been so slow. I personally wouldn't hesitate to enroll in a phase 1 trial if I found the right trial at the right time. (I've already participated in one vaccine trial. But I'm currently in treatment with my oncologist and I want to give what we're doing a shot so I can't do anything else right now. But I keep an eye on the trials all the time.) http://www.futureofpersonalhealth.com/education-an... http://www.clinicaltrials.gov Phase 1 trials are very small (under 20 people usually) and testing for safety, side effects, and dosages. Usually offered at only one location. Phase 2 trials are bigger (but still under around 50-75 people?) and are designed to test for response in humans with cancer to a therapy. They usually have a placebo arm. So half the people get the therapy and half don't. Still usually offered at only one location I think, or by one clinic with multiple locations (such as Mayo Clinic with its three locations). Phase 3 trials build on phase 2 trials. They seek to enroll hundreds or thousands of patients. Sometimes they tweak the therapy or the patient population to optimize results, based on what they learned in the phase 2 trial. Also usually or often has a placebo arm. Usually offered at many locations and clinics across the country. If you are a cancer patient and you can enroll in a trial and it's something you are interested in, I encourage it. You will be helping to advance science in a way that no one else can. And you might even be helping your own cancer case or even saving your own life! Think of the people who volunteered to test Herceptin many years ago. Mainly I want especially newly diagnosed patients to understand that you can't rely on your oncologist to get involved at this level. It came as a bit of a shock when I figured this out near the beginning of my journey. You have to be your own advocate. Edited to add: Several people mention out-of-pocket costs or insurance costs to the patients of clinical trials. My vaccine trial was totally free to me. No one asked me for any payment of any kind for any part of it. I admit I always assumed all or almost all trials are free to the patients because the trial leads typically have to gather funding in advance. Or many trials are initiated and funded by pharma companies. I guess if you inquire about a trial it's a good idea to ask if it's going to cost you anything or if your insurance will be billed for anything. I don't know what percentage of trials incur charges to the patients but I'd love to know. It's something you don't hear much about. But please don't assume it will cost you anything out of pocket. Edited to add: http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/304607.ph... An estimated one-fifth of cancer therapy trials fail to enroll enough patients and are halted as a result. Also, patients who are involved in clinical trials have better outcomes. Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "TectonicShift wrote: Sorry to report that I'm halfway to stage IV. (No distant mets on imaging yet but lots of circulating tumor cells in my blood, so my onc says it's just a matter of time.) I like my current onc very, very much. He is really cutting-edge aggressive. As a stage IIIC patient, with 11 positive nodes and LVI and nodes busting open and other bad things - he started treating me as if I was already stage IV in hopes of keeping me from going to stage IV. I made it to four years before these CTCs showed up, so I suppose we did pretty well. He's been giving me treatments beyond standard of care - after I finished standard of care AC+T, he put me on more chemo at stage IIIC based on my Caris Report. Also he used the Her2 equivocal status of my largest lymph node from a second path report on my lymph node to get me approved for Herceptin. (Primary breast tumor was Her2 negative.) He has a real interest in and understanding of the science - he's not just someone who likes the 9 to 5 of being an onc and just does what ASCO guidelines say to do. I really like that. But he's not very conveniently located for me and he's 75. And his clinic does not participate in any clinical trials. So I'm looking for backup names, just so that I can be prepared for the future. I can go anywhere in the world, but prefer to stay in the U.S. or Canada. Europe is very doable for me too. (I have dual U.S. / E.U. citizenship.) But really I'd consider anywhere. I'm looking for someone who thinks outside the box a bit. I like that my current onc does frequent scans, TMs every visit, genetic testing from Caris and Foundation One, CTCs, treatment beyond ASCO standard of care, and isn't afraid to get on the phone with the insurance company to get treatments paid for. I also feel like he's really fighting for me. He's positive, and encouraging, and even with a high CTC count he says he's determined to keep me alive for 10+ years, and by then maybe there will be new treatments that will keep me going even as long as 20 years. Maybe he's blowing smoke - I don't know - but I prefer it to the somber oncs who say get your affairs in order. I'd also welcome someone who is in a location that does clinical trials as it seems like that will be a part of my future. And of course I'd like to find someone who has a lot of patients who are long-term survivors of stage 3 and stage 4 BC ! I'm not asking people to post names publicly. Please p.m. me if you have an onc or know of an onc you can enthusiastically recommend. Name and location, and anything you'd like to tell me about him or her or them. I'd really appreciate it. I'm trying to be proactive and do my research before I get the official stage IV dx. Of course you can toot your onc's horn publicly or at least the cancer center you go to, if you want to.
