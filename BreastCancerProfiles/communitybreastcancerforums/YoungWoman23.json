    "Content": "YoungWoman23 wrote: I've had a small lump in one of my breasts for the last three years. I'm only 23 so I think the odds are good that it's still not cancer. My mom has had similar lumps and they've been nothing. I can't really tell if it has changed in size or anything but it still doesn't feel very large. I'm also very nervous to touch/push on it but it never hurts. My first gynecologist said it was nothing to worry about but to keep an eye on it. My new gynecologist wanted me to go to a breast surgeon and possibly get a ultrasound. I would really rather not go to the surgeon or get the ultrasound just becuase it seems like a waste of money. I have student health insurance but I would probably end up paying $200-$300 to do this referral. The fact that she seemed concerned, concerns me. But at my age (from what I've read online) it seems like they will just tell me again that it's nothing. I wanted to go on birth control for controlling my breakouts but the new gyno said that it could make the lump worse. I read that the fibrodenoma is caused by excess estrogen and that the birth control has a lot of estrogen. So, I'm scared that I could end up regretting this somehow.  I have a brother that had cancer and went through chemotherapy in highschool. I think that gave the new gyno some worries and I'm not sure if I should be or not. I'm trying to use reason and logic but I'm also very nervous, especially of the thought of birth control. It may just not be worth it. Do I really need to get checked out?  Log in to post a reply",
