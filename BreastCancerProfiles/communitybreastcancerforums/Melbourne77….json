She sent me for a ultrasound and mammogram Â and they found what they thought was a cyst. She then sent me for an mri which was negative. Nothing showed on the mri, not a cyst or fibroadema. The area that my doctor felt is still there and does not change with my cycle. The only thing the nurse said was on my report was that I have dense breasts. I will go back on six months. I am not concerned anymore after all those tests but gosh it was an exhausting process!! I agree with the sentiment I felt like it was overkill. I don't want to continue with six month follow ups so I hope the next one is my last for awhile!",
