    "Content": "Mommyandmore wrote: I went for a breast sonogram today (the physician's assistant who referred me said I was too young for a mammo at 33). The sono showed 3 masses in my right breast and two in my left. The doctor who reviewed the sono at the imaging center said they looked like fibroadinomas to her. She said I could wait, and just come back and have another sono in a few months to see if the masses changed, or do a biopsy. When I called a place that performs guided biopsies, they asked what kind of biopsy I would need. After googling, I saw there is more than one type. I obviously need a follow up appointment with a real doctor, but the only one I can get is with the PA again. Could I please have advice about what to do? When I called my parents to let them know, my mother told me that she had had a benign tumor removed from her breast at age 19. I wish she would have told me about her having a tumor before today! She doesn't like to talk about this type of thing. When I called my dad, he said that my mom had actually had many tumors removed, over the course of many years (all of them benign). My dad said, \"Of course you will have these out too!\" but that was not even presented as an option to me by the PA during my initial manual breast exam (before the sono a couple weeks ago) or by the doctor who reviewed the sono today. I'm glad to finally know about a family history, but I'm still not sure what to do. Log in to post a reply",
