      "Content": "Jun 26, 2009 02:48AM - edited Jun 26, 2009 02:51AM by Meggy My dear sister, I have very strong opinions on this.  Maybe I can't sleep tonight just so you'd read this.  If you are grade 3 that means you have rapidly reproducing cells.  What is so good about that is that chemo really works well in killing cancer the higher your grade.  I strongly recommend doing the more aggressive treatment.  AC plus taxol...dose dense (every 2 weeks).  I did my chemo before surgery so I can tell you that the AC combo is amazing.  Just 2 rounds flatened my tumor like a pancake.  You can do it.  I also get an upset stomach really easily...can't stand codein and all that.  Here's what can get you though it.  There are many meds that will make it much easier.  They might not give you enough unless you are persistent so persist.  Zofren (sp?) taken every 8 hours (maybe its allowed every 6 hours) around the clock will really help the upset stomach.  Also Ativan is a wonder drug while on chemo.  I think you can take it every 6 hours.  It stops nausea and also relaxes you and helps you sleep.  Also, be sure they give you a stool softner...its like being pregnant..if you get backed up, your stomach will be upset.Take these meds BEFORE you feel sick.  Stay ahead of it so it won't get out of control.  I never threw up.  Never needed to because of these wonderful meds. The really nice thing about the dose dense (every 2 week) schedule is that not only can it really kick some cancer butt...and save your life....it also goes by really quickly.   Figure out what sounds good to eat and eat heartily. You'll have a few days of feeling sick after each AC but it's not continuous....you'll have more a week of the two weeks where you feel good.  Eat well.  I do not recommend eating in the chemo room however...you won't like that food later.   Also they should give you nuelasta the day after each chemo round.  NEVER miss that.  Even if you ache from it...NEVER miss it.  It should keep your white count doing well.  If you miss a Neulasta shot and can't take your chemo on time, you are not killing cancer as aggresively as you could.  Be aggressive sister.  I love the word survivor but always felt it wasn't quite strong enough.  We really are more like warriors.   Be aggressive and have no regrets.  Chemo is amazing.  Its like a majic potion sent strait from heaven.  We are so lucky to have it.  I was also grade 3. Chemo is not like what we used to see in the movies...its so do-able.  Zophren and Ativan around the clock after an infusion for about 5 days then after that you'll probably find you don't need it till the next round.  You can do it.   By the way, Taxol does not make you naucaus (sp)...it causes aching.  So those 4 ACs will go by before you know it.  You'll look back on it later and think it went by like a flash. -Meg",

My rather stellar Lymphedema doctor takes notes about my lymphedema but I don't think they are enough to help my other doctors understand and give me the treatment for other problems without worsening my lymphedema.  I've got it in both arms, my back and chest and clavicle area.   My Lympheme doctor told me verbally that the swelling I've had over time, led to proteins in my arms that caused my own tissue to overgrow inside my arms as a response.  The note in my file just says, however, \"tissue changes.\"  I asked him to clarify that note in more undstandable terms and have been refused. So...when I tried to see a pain clinic about crazy tightened muscles in my chest they told me they'd mash on chest making me hurt much worse at first but better later.  When I explained that that would  worsen my chest Lymphedema, the pain specialist MD said, \"I understand you have this belief system called Lymphedema.\"  I never went back. When I tried to get reconstruction, each time they didn't do what I asked and then said, \"We can do revisions,\"  I swell with surgery so I can't do repeated surgeries as I told them in advance.  I've gone 5 years since the last sucky reconstruction with no boob because they don't take my lynphedema seriously. My own oncologist who is lovely once said, \"ya but the swelling resolves.\"  OK...if it resolved each time, I would not have lymphedema.   The head of BREAST oncology told me that there is no such thing as back lymphedema and prescribed diruretics which is a very bad thing to take. Sisters, can you add your feeling that doctors need better instructions about our lymphedema.   I'm only asking that my Lymphedema doctor clarify the notes about \"tissue changes\" because other doctors will have no idea what that phrase means.  Am I asking too much of a Lymphedema doctor?  I've have never cried so much over Lymphedema.  If I can't get a Lymphedema doctor to understand this issue of no understanding amongst the medical professionals who want to treat  me.....I'm so screwed.  What the heck?!
