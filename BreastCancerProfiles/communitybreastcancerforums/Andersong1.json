      "Content": "Andersong1 wrote: hi all. I am wondering if anyone is experiencing the same kind of pain as me? I was diagnosed with BC June 2015 due to oestrogen. I had surgery to remove and 3 lymph nodes. 2 wks later further surgery to remove all lymph nodes in left arm as cancer had spread. It then transpires I have the Brca 2 gene (breast and ovarian cancer) I was advised that I need hystorectomy and double mastectomy as the cancer will return. So I started chemo October worked all way through it until 4th treatment I was rushed to Beatson 12 days with sepsis. I then finished chemo December 15. Jan 16 to Feb 16 radiotherapy. I commenced treatment to shut ovaried down until April 16 full hystorectomy. I then commenced Letrozole (10 years) it causes me intense joint/bone aches. I also get severe flushing from menopause to the point im going to collapse then Sept 16 double mastectomy with latissimus dorsi flap and reconstruction with implants. My lungs collapsed in surgery and my skin broke away so they had to take more skin from my back and put spacers in. The pain was and still is unbelievably intense. From Oct to Dec I got injections to stretch skin. The whole time I struggled with walking due to pressure on my back and spasms on my front and side. April 18 they removed spacers and I got implants. I had haematoma and got rushed back to Surgery. I was then overdosed with meds which affected my liver so I was kept in for 10 days. I then took small infection but once cleared I went back to work 4 months later. I used holidays to work part time but i struggled every day sue to pain on bones and also severe front and back ache. I've had physio just keep doing exercises (don't help) pain clinic cant advise anything further. Acupuncture didnt help. I've now been diagnosed with fibromyalgia I also now need b12 injections 3 monthly and have muscoskeletal aches and neuropathic pain. I was sent to breast cancer place for massage I went for ist appt and after 15mins light massage my back and side had sever spasm my implant moved. It has now detached from muscle and is moving under my arm. I now need surgery to stitch under my good arm to stop it moving again and to reposition the implant. I have now put in for ill health retirement as I struggle on a daily basis with tiredness and pain. I bubble quite a bit for no reason (not about cancer as im not that bothered about that) it's because I'm not me. I was a worker done everything. Now I can't even pull myself off floor or chop carrots etc. I'm a shadow of what I was and I'm getting worse not better. I wish I never had ops but it wasn't an option. I've to go back to occ health Jan 19 to see if I qualify after getting new pain and anti depressant meds started oct. This is now dec and I'm still the same. I'm not bubbling every 2 mins though but still not same. Im 41 hand 8 year old and 12 year old. My mum has moved in with me as I struggle with everyday things. The occ health was initially dismissive as she said your too young to retire but it was my go that adv me. He sent report so I'll wait until Jan. I would really prefer if I wasn't in pain and forgetting everything at work (senior who gives advice) as I would never have pursued this but I'll wait and see.
