I've teied Googling this before (of course!) and my doctor (who's very busy as an obstetrician doesn't make gyn appointments a priority so she's postponed mine twice!). Basically, here's what I have: I had this spot on my breast that looked like a pimple that wouldn't pop, so, I tried to squeeze it out and the spot turned dark purple and half of the upper part of my breast turned red and bumpy. Nothing to worry about, probably just hurt it. It stayed like this for a few days and all, so, I looled it up and saw about inflammatory breast cancer. I KNOW it's very rare, I'm only 29 and no family history; probably not the case, so, I let it go. The red part eventually subsided but it still exists, and yesterday it looked full of pus (tmi, I know), so, I tried to pop it again and there was a lot of blood and pus and now it's purple and red again and I have a sore. I guess my question was more of an assurance: IBC doesn't behave like this, right? Popping and blood and pus? So, I don't need to ask for an emergency appointment? Because my appointment is technically on the 13th, but it had been schduled for MARCH 8th and it's been postponed this far. If I asked for an emergency appointment, I think she'd see me, but otherwise I might have to wait again. Am I good to wait? Sorry if this seems silly or a waste of time, Google didn't have the answers! Love, light and healing energies to everyone! Log in to post a reply",
