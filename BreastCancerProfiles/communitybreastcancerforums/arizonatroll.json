My mom just passed away on 09/2/09, only 2 weeks post diagnosis.  She went to the hospital with pneumonia, had CAT scans and was originally diagnosed with Lung cancer, she died two weeks later.  When we received her death certificate it said she died from Metasis of Breast Cancer.  Yes we were shocked because mom always had mamograms and no one even mentioned breast cancer.  I called the hospital to see if it was a mistake and was told they can't put \"lung cancer\" as a cause of death there is always an underlying cause and since they put breast cancer than my sisters and I should be careful.  There are 5 of us girls so naturally we are concerned.  I'm still not sure that breast cancer is correct, does this seem right?
