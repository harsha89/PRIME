PCP told me the same, and said he had intended to ask but that Dr M's partner was second best so I would still be in good hands.  I got Dr M and still have him.  I have since discovered that my PCP always chooses the best in the field for his referrals.",

Just send a private message to someone to talk to frequently, maybe feel a connection with and talk to them about the idea, see if they want to exchange information.   Chabba",

      "Content": "Jun 19, 2012 12:04PM - edited Jun 19, 2012 12:05PM by chabba I had three appointments with my first MO.  At the first DH and I were both still staggered by the Dx, it was just before the start of radiation.  He left us speechless and overwhelmed with information.  I didn't even realize until later that it was a set speech.  He had diagrams that he annotated with notes as he spoke and gave to us before we left.  I have been grateful for those notes and referred to them often.  The second was right after radiation at which he outlined what to expect from my ongoing treatment.  Of course because I'm long past menopause that was focused on the Al's, however, it minimized the SE's.  Now, I've had kidney stones multiple times, acute pancreatitis and a severe case of shingles, I know pain.  When I called because I was having some of the severest pain ever he just had the nurse call to tell me to stop taking it, he had sent a new Rx for Tamoxifen to my pharmacy.  When I asked for information his nurse told me he said to wait till my next scheduled appointment in two months.  I switched to a different MO (in the same clinic) and she is wonderful.  She answers all my questions, When I call with a concern she calls me back herself and best of all really seems to understand.  I think part of what makes her so understanding is that, while she hasn't specifical said so, certain things she has said have led me to believe she has been there, done that and is \"one of us\".",

Same for the different types of chemo.  If you are most comfortable talking to women in your own age group there ore topics for that.  Some hobby groups even have their own topics.  One of my favorites is \"What's For Dinner.\" We trade menus, recipes and talk about our families, diagnosis, treatments and problems.  We even have two husbands who are the family cooks with wives in treatment.  I hope you will find a home amoung us and many loving, supportive friends.",

Most stage 1   who's cancer does not progress seem to drop away after active treatment.  It is helpful to know someone who has been NED for 5+ years.   It was 4 yrs ago next week that I first thought I found a lump one day in the shower but it was gone that evening.  Wasn't too concerned. I was just 6 months from my last mamo, half the time I couldn't find it and as a tax preparer I was very busy. By May it was definitely there and I called my PCP.  Appt next day, mamo and ultrasound 2 days later, needle biopsy done immediately, then surgery and rads.  That summer was a real roller coaster.  I know TMI.  Guess I'm reliving it because I recently had a PET scan and they found a suspicious mass in my colon.  Colonoscopy scheduled for next month.  Wish it were next month. ",

First, we heal better when we are not unnecessarily worried.  Also, we know our own bodies in the normal state better than anyone else ever can and so are better prepared to notice abnormalities.  It is our job as patients to ask questions about anything that concerns us. We are all with you.  ((((hugs))))",
