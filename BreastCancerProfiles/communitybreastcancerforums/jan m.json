Tamoxifen is basically for pre-menopausal women to stop the production of estrogen from our ovaries..  post-menopausal women have to take an aromatase inhibitor because women still produce estrogen even after menopause (from our fat cells) the more fat you have the more estrogen you produce & also the adrenal gland produces estrogen. Either way I think we will still have to be on some kind of drug, long term.. maybe the aromatase inhibitors have less severe side effects? Hope that all made sense   I am looking forward to hearing what your onc says. Are we all pre-menopausal in here?",

I hope more research is done.  If hcg ends up being a breast cancer preventative I will be first in line to sign up :) It is sooooo tempting but for now though I will stick to my weight watchers and will definately get my oncologists opinion about it.. I'll get back here and let you all know what he says.",

      "Content": "jan-m wrote: My boss is doing it and she is losing a pound a day. Has anyone in here tried it?  Also wondering if anyone knows if it is safe (hormonially) for women that have/had breast cancer?  I am going to ask my oncologist about it at my next appointment Feb 17th but am hoping I may get some input here first. Here is what the HCG diet is...   It takes years of intense study of the human body to realize the balance of metabolism, fat cells and side effects that can result in weight loss while staying healthy. The HCG diet was discovered quite by accident by Doctor A.T.W. Simeons over 50 years ago as he worked to cure malnutrition in underdeveloped villages. HCG, or human chorionic gonadotropin is the hormone that Simeons discovered in pregnant women. While observing healthy women during their pregnancy, he noticed that as soon as the child was born, the health of the mother began to deteriorate. There had to be a reason and this is when HCG was discovered. This naturally occurring hormone is created by the body to nourish and protect the fetus by taking the stored fat reserves and changing to nutrition for the placenta. If this new discovery could actually drain fat cells and transform to positive natural energy, it might actually help people with obesity. What Is The HCG Diet & Why It's Good For You There are three different types of fat found in the body. Structural fat is found nestled between the skin and organs and is necessary as a protective layer. Normal reserve fat is the layer that supplies the body with energy when calorie intake is too low. The abnormal fat is what forms as extra fat in hips, waist, thighs and buttocks and is not used for anything. This is the only fat that is consumed by HCG. Many ask why a low calorie diet would not lead to the same results. The facts are simple. By starving your body of protein and vitamins, it will take whatever is needed from any type of fat, including structural and normal reserve fats. This is why once you stop a low calorie diet, not only are lean muscles destroyed but the weight comes back with a vengeance as abnormal fat. Nothing was really accomplished except for redistributing the fat.   The HCG fat release program consists of three different phases. The first phase consists of building up your fat reserves by eating as much as you like for two days while beginning the treatment of HCG drops. After this, phase two is started. For the next 23 to 40 days, a 500-calorie diet consisting of vegetables, fruits and two meals of 3.5 oz. of protein are followed while taking the HCG. Phase three is the maintenance part of the diet and a new way of living. Each as much as you want as long as starches and sugar are eliminated. The reason for Phase 1 is to get the HCG circulating in the body before the regiment begins. After two days, the brain will have had ample time to know that the release of fat is to start. Adding to the fat reserves during this period is crucial by signaling the HCG of what process needs addressed. As you enter into Phase 2 of the program, an average weight loss of 1-2 pounds per day will be seen. You continue for the amount of days that it takes to get to a desired weight. Going into Phase 3, continue on the 500-calorie diet for two days to allow the HCG to completely leave your system. No more treatments should then be needed.
