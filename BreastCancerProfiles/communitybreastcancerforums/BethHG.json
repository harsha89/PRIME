Just wondering if there is anything new out there. I have the dog ears, so the last mastectomy bra I had sort of dug into those. The past couple of years I have been using foam forms or knitted knockers in a Coobie bra. I just want somethingwith a bit more form, iykwim.

They were advertising kits to make these \"knockers\" with soft yarn and filled with Polyfil. They look comfy. I requested a couple,but I think I will start knitting them to donate as well. I really hope these work for me since silicone is heavy and hot, and foam is way too stiff. I just wanted to share.
