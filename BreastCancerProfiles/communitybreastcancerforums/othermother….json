It has difficulties, but nothing like chemo! The longer it went on, the more tired I got, and was exhausted most of the time by the time I was done. Watch out for thyroid damage, and maybe have some bloodwork done at the end. My thyroid took some permanent damage from the rads, and now I'll be on Synthroid for the rest of my life. No big deal, though. Just a little pill. Nobody told me about this, and it may just be me, but for me the worst part of rad was the smell. I  smelled \"burn\" all the time. I don't think anyone else could smell it, though. When you are on the table, it does not hurt at all, though it can be intimidating.  The machine makes a humming/buzzing sound. I would close my eyes and imagine being surrounded by hummingbirds, and then I wasn't scared anymore. I'm going to get a tatoo of a hummingbird on my rad area once my reconstruction is done. Also, I still don't sweat or get stinky with or without deodorant. I think it killed the sweat glands in there.  Good luck to all of you, and congratulations to all of you who have completed or are near completion of chemo. That's much harder than radiation.
