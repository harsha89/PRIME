I was also at work when I got the news. Fortunately, I get here earlier than most so I was able to leave before everyone saw me as an emotional wreck that day. My husband told his parents, as well. With my parents knowing and my husband's parents knowing, I feel like the spider-web of people being informed is in progress and beyond my control. I don't mind that people are telling other people. I told my sister-in-law today that I know that I'm not the only one affected by my diagnosis and even my support team needs support. My only concern is someone announcing my diagnosis on Facebook. That's the only social network I use and I don't really want my health issues aired out there, especially since Facebook can track your shares, likes, and posts and pawn them off to advertising companies. Also, quite a few of my Facebook friends are just that - Facebook friends.",

I had surgery first and then started chemo. My husband, fortunately, was here for my surgery and first type of chemo - Adriamycin/Cytoxan. That was a pretty rough dosage and I was glad to have his help. He went on deployment last month, so I'm left to take care of our girls on my own. I'm currently on 12 weekly Taxol/Carboplatin rounds that I'll finish this Thursday (Yay!). I must say that I'm pretty proud of myself. I am still working full-time, made all of my appointments, and still have managed to keep life pretty \"normal\" for my girls all with not too much outside help. I know I may be an exception but I've felt okay during chemo and life has just kept chugging along. I also have not been recommended to have any scans.",

The high points come from all the support that everyone is so ready and willing to give. NurseShark, I immediately asked for genetic testing. I do not have a family history, but I was told that being triple negative it's more likely for me the be BRCA+. I also have two young daughters - 4 years old and 16 months old. I've never been more concerned about someone's future boobs, lol, so I want to know for their sake as well. hummingbirdlover, I'm a little late replying to this post, but I hope your surgeon's appt went well and if you ever wanna talk (write), I'll be here as well as all of these other wonderful ladies.",

My girls are 4 years old and 16 months old. I am now terrified of the health of my daughters' future boobies, lol. I do have genetic testing scheduled after my surgery to see how worried I should be. I tend to be an introvert and have trouble asking for help. I know I'll find this discussion board very useful.",
