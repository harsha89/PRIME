She starts cycle 2 on Thursday. Very mild SE so far - mostly fatigue. But this weekend her hair started to thin. We made an appointment to pick out a wig, and that should be here this week. I'm glad to hear it's going well for you!",

      "Content": "sandpointer wrote: Hi all, My mom was recently diagnosed with stage IV TNBC with mets in liver and bone. I was happy to come across these forums as this is all very new to us. She had her first dose of eribulin/Halaven last week, along with Zometa for her bones. Does anyone have experience with eribulin being the first round of treatment? I understand it's generally used after other chemotherapies have failed. Also - wondering if anyone has tried fasting before/after chemo? Any/all thoughts appreciated.
