      "Content": "zombiecrush wrote: Hi everyone, I just created my account here and so far there is so much information. THANK YOU. I have gotten close to ZERO answers about my situation from people in the flesh. Long story short, I'm 32, have micro calcifications in my left breast (from what my GP told me, this is \"not normal\" for people my age, but ok). 2nd mammo came back \"indeterminate\", but no BIRADs rating-- at least not on the copies they gave me. The radiologist suggested a stereotactic biopsy. I'm honestly not worried at all, I'm actually more annoyed than anything at this point, and I'm wondering if anyone has some insight about the next steps? The hospital (Credit Valley) called to make the appointment with Dr. Niaz, who is a surgeon. We are having a consultation in TWO WEEKS. Why a \"general surgeon\"? His assistant/receptionist over the phone told me that it is to decide whether or not to even do a biopsy and that 80% of them don't actually happen. Why would a surgeon go against what the radiologist suggested?! I'm so confused about this. Isn't this kind of a waste of time going in to consult when they could tell from the mammo whether or not they're \"bad\" micro calcifications to begin with?! Any guidance is appreciated. It is the lack of information and the waiting is making me very anxious/annoyed. Log in to post a reply",

I was a little confused about that! I'm not looking forward to that shot of novocaine, hopefully they will give me a valium or something ;) molliefish-- Yes, that make so much more sense. thank you for that! I'm happy to know you had a good experience at CVH and to know that I am in good hands. Thank you all, again, and I hope you enjoyed your long weekend (if Tmh is in Ontario!)",
