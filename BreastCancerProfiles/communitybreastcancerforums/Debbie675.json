Kathleen1966 -- Just curious -- why were you not included in the decision process for your treatment?  You seem pretty knowledgable about this stuff.  Given what you know now, would you have chosen the AC-TH or the TCH?  I am still floundering, such a big decision!!",

It sounds like a double edge sword -- the ACTH combo is the most aggressive but can cause heart problems, where as the TCH is slightly less effective but does not have the cardiac issues. Some even say the two regimens are the same, so I still don't know what to do.  I am leaning toward the TCH regimen because it is safer on the heart.  Does anyone know how many years this regimen has been used? Have you  heard anything on the recurrence rate between the two regimens? Got some GREAT news today -- PET scan and sono of the heart were all good.  I can take a deep breath now.  Did any of you do a whole body bone scan?  One doctor wants me to do it and the other doctor says it is not necessary.  Doctor says the PET does not show good ananomy.  Any thoughts? I got my port put in yesterday and doing well.  Will start chemo next week so I need to decide my chemo regimen soon. kathleen1966 -- I'm sorry to hear you have lymhedema.  Any thoughts on how to avoid getting it? Thank you ALL for the positive feedback.  Stay strong and be good to yourself!! ",
