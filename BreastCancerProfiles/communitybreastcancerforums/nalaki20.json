My lump was quite large and I ended up having two surgeries to make sure it was all removed. I'm 27 so I was quite worried that something was really wrong. Everything turned out to be benign. The surgeries weren't too bad and I was pretty much pain free a week later. And no more discharge!  I know the waiting is scary - but be strong. Remember that the odds are in your favor. And no matter what, there are great people here to support you. Hoping you get great results! ",
