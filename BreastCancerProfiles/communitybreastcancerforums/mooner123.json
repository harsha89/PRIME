My breasts are lumpy so its hard to tell exactly which one hurts. My whole breast hurts when I touch it and gets worse around my cycle. It also hurts to some degree everyday. I'm 37 and have never had a mammogram. I was told a few years ago that painful lumps were rarely breast cancer. Now, I've been hearing otherwise and feel that 4 years is way too long to not have this checked out. How concerned should I be over this?   Log in to post a reply",
