I've finally gotten over all the anxieties and am just ready to proceed on the way to get this lump out of me, one way or another....I've been keeping super busy to get my mind off of it all :)Â  I have my ultrasound on Wednesday and I am wondering...my doctor said I can call and get an update on Friday or they will call me.... I see some people on here writing their findings from a report....will I get this report? should I ask for it? do I get it when I get my ultrasound? LOL, so many questions....Just want to make sure (since these are not the best doctors here....) that I am doing the right thing....thanks and hope all is well with you.... Log in to post a reply",
