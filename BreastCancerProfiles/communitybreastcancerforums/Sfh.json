I discussed with him and he checked both breast and armpits found nothing. Followed with my regular mammogram which was clear. I was so relieved I did not check my breast again until the end of may ( my bad). When I did the lump had returned same place however got smaller and then would get bigger again. ( i had my husband check to make sure I wasn't iwas loosing my mind finally decided enough was enough and went back to my doc last week. He felt the lump but noted it felt like a cis not to worry he did order another mamo sonagram and gave me a referral to a surgeon for a followup biopsy regardless of the findings of the Mamo. I was shocked when the nurse said there was something suspicious and when the radiologist told me if I were his wife he would skip the biopsy and have a lumpectomy. Went on to say it looks like we have caught this early but again noted I need to get this mass out and go from there. I have an appointment with a surgeon on Monday. I really don't have a question I read through a this topic and oddly I felt better. Sorry for the long post. Just wanted to vent I guess Log in to post a reply",

Husband and married daughter For them, I need to get a grip..  I hate to see the worry and tears in their eyes. Cancer has been in our extended family too often.  The radioligist and nurse have really scared me and as such I am ( hopefully) overreacting. Best case this will be a reminder to my friends, sister and sister in laws to do their monthly checks.  And get their annual check-ups.  I do have a beef.. the radiologist told me I have very dense breast and tumors are difficult to find.  I wish someone had told me before that 1) I have dense breast and 2) tumors are sometimes hard to see on a mamo.  Until now, what I would refer to as firm breast was a good thing.   I thought I was aging well.   Worst case, as you note, if its not good news it is not the end of the world.  .    ",
