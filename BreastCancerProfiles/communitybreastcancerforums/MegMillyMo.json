I don\u2019t seem to have a lump (I don\u2019t think) but my left breast looks incredible swollen compared to my right, it feels really hard and like there is a golf ball sized mass under my nipple. My right breast is just soft and normal, it may sound ridiculous but I\u2019m unaware of how my breast is meant to feel. I wasn\u2019t the one that noticed how hard my breast was s it was so my boyfriend, before then I thought nothing of the pain. I\u2019m on only 23 years old but my auntie has recently had breast cancer which has spread. My mum also had a lump removed at point but im unaware of what this was as I haven\u2019t told her about it the issues I\u2019m having Any help would be appreciated, I\u2019m yet to go to the doctor I\u2019d just like some input. Thank you Log in to post a reply",

My breast seems to have got bigger and is now noticeable whatever I wear, they did debate if it was my nipple piercings but because I\u2019ve had them for so long and going of my family history they think otherwise! I\u2019m just hoping my age is on my side, I\u2019m only 23 so surely it can\u2019t be anything to serious",
