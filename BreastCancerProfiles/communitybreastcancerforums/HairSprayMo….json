I have that constant recurrance anxiety too. Every cough or pain must be mets! Then I have to just tell myself to STOP IT!!!! My Aunt Sara had the best advice for me when I talked to her about recurrance and stats. She told me,\"If you are living your life by statistics, you are not living at all\". Of course this makes perfect sense and repeating it often works for me. On the days it doesn't I pop a good old Xanax and carry on. LOL Sorry Pure you being prego leaves you out of the Xany club for now. I am 2 yrs 4 mo post DX and I am starting to worry now. The next 2 yr is the main time frame for Trip Neg recurrance/mets and I have been freaking out about it. I had a PET scan done last April and all was NED! Also Pure you will find some great support at www.youngsurvival.org . This is a site specifically designed for young women diagnosed with breast cancer, it tends to be quite a bit more explicite than this site, which is sometimes good when you really need to say what you feel and not temper it a bit! You will also be able to connect with othe pregnant women facing the beast! Hope all of my random rambling helped!  ((HUGS)) Regina AKA HairSprayMom",

I was scared to death of my port the first time I used it, but after that first time it was a God send! It was outpatient surgery to get it placed and my Breast Surgeon removed it in his office so I did not have to pay the surgery deductible again. I kept my port, kinda gross I know LOL, but it was such a part of me that I put it up in my cancer box. My advice is get the port, this journey is hard enough without having to worry about blown veins!

Of course leaving was another story! LOL  I just explained as much as I could in a little kid way that mommy was sick and the doctor was gonna make me better. The biggest difficulty for me was when I came home with the drains. I make drain aprons for the jackson pratt drain bulbs to be held in. This keeps the tubes and bulbs out of the way and from being pulled. I make them for free, just send me your address and I will make you one. HairSprayMom@aol.com Of course if you littel one is really little you may want to talk to him about  the drains and show them to him so he does not grab you and accidentall pull the. It really hurts if they grab them because they are stitched into your skin.Hope this helps and all goes well for you! XOXO, Regina",

I still have twinges on that side sometimes, but it is nothing like the constant pain I always seemed to be in with the implant in, but I am litterally rib cage and skin over there, so I think some of my pain stems from that.

I was a year out before I even knew I was triple negative. Sometimes ignorance is bliss! or it was for me. Having the drains really sux, but the apron makes it so much better. The aprons are made of soft material that ties on with ribbons (all very non irritating). Then you just pop the drain bulbs and extra tubing in the pockets. I also include a shower ribbon...you thread the ribbon through the plastic loops on the bulbs, tie a quick bow, and just hang it around your neck so the drains are secured during shower or bath. My e-mail is HairSprayMom@aol.com just e-mail me with your full name and address and I will get you one shipped ASAP. Plus you get a bonus surprise in your package. YEA>>>surprises are always good! I will respond to your e-mail with payment info.  XOXO, Regina",

Please check out my web site for more info http://www.hairspraymomssurgicaldrainpouchkits.com/ . I sent out 3 this week to ladies who were home from surgery and just realized how bad they needed something to help with the care of their drains! Love and healing to you all! XO, Regina",

You don't want the shirt rubbing your skin, the nerves will be freaking out and it is rather painful if touched. 4) Prepare for managing your surgical drain bulbs and tubing I make and sell Surgical Drain Pouch Kits for $15.00 if this web site is referenced, they are aa much cheaper option than post surgical garments and do not come in contact with the surgical area. You can order by e-mailing HairSprayMom@aol.com and you can check out the product at http://www.hairspraymomssurgicaldrainpouchkits.com/ to see how they work.

It has been 7 months since my last surgery and I can honestly say I FEEL GOOD for the 1st time in years. I do have a good bit of scar tissue too, which is sometimes uncomfortable, but nothing compared with how I felt all the time before. After surgery this last time I went and got bras and prostetics, but I only wore them one time! I just go flat and I have found busy cloths and a gathered neck line really draw attention away from the fact that I am totally flat. It's just too hot in Alabama for sweaty prostetics. LOL After my surgery I healed up completely for the 1st time in 3 yrs, my chest feels great, I can sleep on my side, I can hold my daughter, life is good! So just know that for me this was the miracle surgery I was looking for...just to be deconstructed and healthy and happy with no open unhealed places on my body! Sending love love love to you all and I sure hope it makes your life better, just as it did mine. XO",

My PS took out all the stretched skin and tried to make a nice smooth flat surface. My cancer was in the chest wall muscle, so I am litterally skin and bones on that side, and I have a small indent at my new scar line on the left side, I feel like as I heal that will fill in. I am very very happy with my decision, I have had a bit of pain this weekend but I was trying to finish up shopping and all for the holidays...my fault! Ya know I wondered if I would have a profound feeling of loss like I did when I had my bilateral, but I did not! What I felt was a great sense of relief! No more healing problems, no more tightness in my chest, no more pushing on my ribs, no more not being able to sleep on my tummy because it just feels weired, no more freezing cold silicone in my body! I just feel like it is all looking up from here. It took me a long time to be happy in my own skin again...and for the 1st time in years I feel free of cancer and all of the crap that comes with it. This last surgery was the 15th for me and I look back thinking WTF? was I crazy? But I will not beat myself up, but look forward to all the great years I have coming with no surgery or anything else in my way! Look out world, here I come! XOXOXOXO",

My PS removed all of the stretched skin and made me a nice smooth chest. I had the exact same healing problems, incision either opening up or just never healing and expander and then implant showing through. I had the bad side removed and then gave myself 6 months to heal and then did the other side 2 weeks ago. My DH felt the same way, he just wanted me to feel better and be healthy. Heck I barely had nipples before all of this...LOL I got my 1st look at everything yesterday after my 1st drain free shower, and it doesn't look bad. Like I said before there was NO feeling of loss as there was with my MX, just astounding relief to know I am finally done! Since 2007 I have been either in active treatment or trying to get reconstructed, 2011 is gonna be a surgery free year dang it! If you have any other questions just let me and the other ladies know, I am sure between us all there is nothing we can't cover! XOXOXOXOXOXOXO",

I drove after 1 week...as soon as I was off pain meds. I found the flat look is good for me, I was just really uncomfortable in the bras and prostetics and I had already been uncomfortable enough. I was able to get fitted for and wear my pros and bras after about 2-3 weeks after surgery...or as quickly as you heal. You just ask as many questions as you like too...we are girls so it is all good! LOL Sending Love!!!",
