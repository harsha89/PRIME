I figured if it was still there after a month a would call my Dr. Earlier this week I noticed that it was bigger, I called and they saw me the same day. She examined it and said it felt to be 1 to 2 cm, and set me up for a mammo and us today. I just got home from that and all I know is the number on the screen said 4cm and they also did the us under my arm which I have never had done before. Maybe I am just being to emotional but that has put in panic mode. I have had dcis, and many us over the past 2 years, but have never had the arm pit done.Â  Any comments would be so welcome.

She is concerned about this, and I really don't know what to think at this point! I am waiting to hear back from her as to what she is planning to do now. Thank you again it is nice to have someone to talk to that understands!!!",
