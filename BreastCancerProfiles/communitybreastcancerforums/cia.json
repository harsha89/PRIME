So far i Have just been tired although the last couple months have been a little better as far as the fatigue goes. However, my biggest concern is the hair loss. I am fortunate to have a thick head of hair. However, I think I have lost about half of it. I can see it is very thin but still not noticable to others I am still losing hair. I am afraid the next step is back to wearing the wig if it gets too much worse. Has anyone experienced this and do the hair loss taper down or will I continue to lose hair? My MO says she doesn't have any patients wearing a wig from this drug.",
