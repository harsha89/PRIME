You are life\u2019s soldiers, and don\u2019t believe for a second that your journey hasn\u2019t inspired and touched all those who know and love you. My fatigue started a year ago in earnest. Even longer. Probably about the time the cancer left the duct and set out on a northern road. I haven\u2019t been able to get out of my own way for months and months and months. A full year or more before diagnosis! I don\u2019t know how such a little tumor could make me so exhausted, but it has. I also noticed a lot of aging in my face this last year. Granted I am 56, but it\u2019s been these last 12 months especially that there were days I literally said outloud that I felt 80. I went to a doctor in December and had her look into it, but we didn\u2019t come up with \u201ccancer\u201d as a possibility, and I marched home with a list of dietary changes. Looking back, unusual fatigue is one of the seven signs of cancer,and it did cross my mind, but only in a half-measured way. I\u2019ve done some research and apparently, this is a real thing with other woman with breast cancer, too. Lots of them. They feel weird, tired or unwell a year or more before diagnosis. I found a post on another website by a woman that literally took my breath away. I found her description of her pre-diagnosis symptoms to be exactly like mine and I didn\u2019t feel so alone! She said that a year or more before her cancer was discovered, she gained twenty pounds, her boobs suddenly got big and she was always exhausted. I feel as if I have chronic fatigue. Thankfully, I can stay home and do nothing as my husband is the main bread earner, and I have all but stopped my freelance writing from home. Each day, I can get up and do a few things but then I\u2019m right back on the couch. It seems strange even to me, but then I\u2019ve always had the weirdest reaction to everything my whole life. Wondering if anyone else dealt with something similar? Best to you all! Diagosed Feb. 4, 2019 IDC 8mm, PR+ ER+, Her-, Grade 2 Surgery April 22nd. Undecided. Log in to post a reply",

April 22 I had one breast removed with immediate reconstruction. I love still having one breast that is mine. I can feel it, and it\u2019s familiar and is kind of like an old friend. The breast that was removed has been a problem for 10 years! I was always called back for extra imaging. The other breast was never a problem\u2014ever, so I have high hopes she\u2019s going to be fine!  Much love",
