And Everything. _____________________ My name is Cindy. I'm 34, married and a mother of two teenagers. I have learned I have breast cancer in September 2009. I wrote the poem above after learning a 2nd area found on the original MRI was negative for cancer, making me a candidate for lumpectomy rather than a masectomy. I just wanted to share my thoughts leading to that moment with the people here on the board. Waiting for surgery is not nearly as painful as waiting for the final diagnosis! I know there are so many people going through the same thing. I felt selfish for my tears, but I know now that it's ok to cry if you feel like crying, its ok to be still if you feel like being still, its ok just to keep putting one foot in front of the other if that's all you can bear in that moment. I'm sure as surgery, chemo and radiation begin I'll be looking here for insight and connection from others who've been there. We are not in this alone.
