I understand that there aren't that many scary information on her MRI report but she is very high risk and that's my concern. I always think any single minor BREAST thing could turn in to a cancer. I only pray that the radiologist's comment is true and these nodules are really Fibroadenomas. I have a question from you ladies about Fibroadenoma. Does any of you know if fibroadenomas can develope in older women? My mom is 57 and monapause. I heard that fibroadenoma mostly developes in younger women due to hormonal thing. If that is true, then it is possible that these nodules aren't fibroadenoma. Oh gush, so what are they? Could they be cysts? Can MRI distinguish between a cyst and a solid nodule? Her MRI does't say anythign about cyst, it just says \"nodule\". My mind doesn't work anymore. I've read so many things on internet, some encourage and some scary. This waiting is killing me. I wish we could have at least got some news on Wednesday but most likely we won't find out anything on that day until few days later when the result comes out. But first they do an ultrasound, I hope they could give us at least some encouraging news when looking at these nodules on the U/S screen. I am still hopeful that some of these characteristics (well defined, well marginated, small size, bi-rad 3, fibroadenoma) do their magic and give us a B9 result but when I think about her risk (previous DCIS in the same breast, BRCA+) I freak out. If this is a recurrence, her choice is limited to Mastectomy and a very hard reconstruction due to radiation on her left breast. SO I just pray for a B9 result.",

I am also thinking may be I should ask for an U/S of her right breast, although the BI-RAD was 2 on this breast but she is very high risk, so since she is already going for an U/S and biopsy of the left one, I want to give it a try and ask the doctor tomorrow to see if she orders U/S on the right one as well. She may say she doesn't need it since radiologist rating is 2 but I want to ask. I heard if somebody is high risk with BRCA+, ANY finding, even BI-RAD 2 findings should be evaluated. So we'll see.....",

They didn't even do the biopsy. They said it is not necessary. First, they did an U/S and they said that they were pretty sure it was a lymph node but to be 100% sure, they needed to do a second U/S with a different technique. Well, they did the second U/S ( and of course I was going crazy during that time), and then they said it is 100% a lymph node and no biopsy is needed, go enjoy your day!! I am extremely thrilled and relieived. I can't still understand how MRI can't distinguish between a lymph node and other nodules. Isn't MRI the best tool available? So why couldn't it show the nodule as a lymph node in the first place and avoid all the stress? Aren't we better off doing U/S than MRI? The nurse told me that they don't like MRI AT ALL, because it is so dramatic but for somebody like my mom (even myself, I still don't know if I carry BRCA, haven't been tested yet), it is worth it to go through stress but end up with nothing than let it go and end up with something. Thank you everybody for all warm wishes and prayers. I enjoyed talking with all of you. I will still be in touch.",

      "Content": "Sahar wrote: Hello everybody. I am new to this forum and so glad I found it. I am actually here because of my mom. She was diagnosed with left breast DCIS last year and went through lumpectomy and 30 sessions of radiation. Also she was found to be BRCA1 positive as well. We have a huge family history of breast and ovarian cancer in her family. I am on a 6 month mammogram/ MRI/ vaginal ultrasound/ CA125 test as well, although hasn't been tested for BRCA yet and hasn't been diagnosed with cancer (NOT YET). Anyways, after my mom completed her radiation in October 2010, her oncologist put her on a 6 month mammo/MRI schedule. She had one mammogram in Feb 2011 which was clean and clear but she had one MRI last week which why I am here today. 2 days after her MRI, we got the call from the nurse saying that she needs to come in for biopsy on her left breast (the same radiated breast) because of a nodule that was seen on MRI. She continued that the radiologist recommendation is to have just an U/S and another 6 month follow up MRI but the oncologist doesn't want to wait 6 months due to her family history and her BRCA situation and she wants her to do the biopsy. So next week she is going for biopsy. I got a copy of the MRI report and here what it says: Right Breast: No abnormal contrast enhancement or suspicious mass lesion. 6 mm lobulated nodule at right mid eight o'clock, seen on 7/47. Nodule shows no contrast enhancement and appears bright on gradient echo images and dark on fast spin echo images, consistent with a fibroadenoma. There is a limited fat suppression of the medial and lateral inferior breast. BI-RAD: 2 Left Breast: 4 mm well defined well marginated contrast enhancing nodule at the left mid 3 o'clock, seen on 7/33. On fast spin echo images, the nodule appears signal void and on precontrast it appears isodense. Finding is consistent with a fibroadenoma. Second look ultrasound and six months follow up breast MRI are recommended. BI-RAD 3 Here are my questions: 1-The radiologist's comment for both breasts suggests that finding is \"consistent with fibroadenoma\". How come he is not concerned about the right breast but he is concerned about the left one? What made the left breast more suspicious than the right one? Why right breast has BIRAD 2 but left one has BI-RAD 3 and biopsy was ordered only on the left one?   2- Can somebody shed some light and tell me how the left breast nodule looks like? benign/malignant? Do these terms (well defined, well marginated, signal void, isodense) show anything? 3- Is it possible for a breast that was radiated 30 times, to develop another cancer after only 8 months from completion of radiation, given the fact that the first cancer wasn't even invasive (DCIS)? I was told by her oncologist that a radiated breast most likely won't have any recurrence for 5 years. I appreciate any information. It is so difficult to wait one week to get the biopsy done and few more days to get the result. Thank you all and God bless all of you. Log in to post a reply",

It is just handling the stress of the false positives. I am due for my MRI end of this year so until then, I try to relax. It is funny that I go through this stress 4 times a year. 2 times for myself and 2 times for my mom as both of us are on 6 months MRI/mammogram schedule. I still have the BRCA testing on my to-do list but not sure when I am going to be ready for the stress of it but eventually it HAS to be done one of these days..... lots of hugs to you..",

I don't know what the suspicious area is on your test and how it looks like as far as the shape, margin, size, bi-rad rating, etc but remember that most biopsies come back with benign results even in bi-rad 4s and 5s. If suspected area was identified on an MRI, know that MRI has a lot of false positives. So don't panic yet and if I were you I wouldn't tell my kids yet and wouldn't unnecessarily upset them. I pray for you and hope for a  b9 result.",
