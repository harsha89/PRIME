I have 2 suspicious masses in my right breast that were classified as BI-RADS 3 in February. My doctors (radiologist and breast surgeon) want me to have diagnostic mammograms and ultrasounds every 6 months for 2 years. If they see continued stability, they will feel comfortable forgoing a biopsy. If they see changes, I'll probably need a biopsy. There is no way I would wait a year between tests after my experience with the other breast. I had DCIS in 2 different quadrants of that breast. Because both areas of DCIS were small (well under 1 cm), I was able to have lumpectomies. If DCIS had grown larger, lumpectomy might not have been an option for me. Mastectomy might have been my only choice, and that would have meant a tougher surgery with a longer recovery time and hard choices about reconstruction. ",
