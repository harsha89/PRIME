I just had bilaterl mastectomy and I'm going through the phase 2 of the surgical reconstruction. It can be hard. Most of the days I'm upbeat and I go about my bussiness. My husband gives me a tremendal support. I don't think there is anything wrong with you. I don't know your details but sounds like a stronger support system would help. Have you thought of the group support or someone that could relate to your situation? Take care Irenaanna",
