Not knowing my dad, but knowing that side of the family had issues with breast cancer, I made my phone calls and found out that My grandmother and both of her sisters died of breast cancer,Â 1 of my aunts died, 1 surving aunt of breast cancer and 2 second cousins and one 1st cousin all survivers. All of them discovered breast cancer in their early 30's and the four that did not make it died between the ages of 34 and 38. I am getting ready to do the mamorgram and genetic testing but I feel like, due to my history and just turning 31, this is not likely to turn up negative. So far my breast feel swollen around the armpit side allong with some sore areas. I can feel the lumps easily. The worst part is the waiting to know anything. I dont know if this has anything to do with it, but I've also had some hair growth around my nipples. I very scared and I have no idea what to expect. I would appreciate if anyone could tell the symptoms that they felt in the begining and anyone that could offer encouragement. Thank you everyone! Log in to post a reply",
