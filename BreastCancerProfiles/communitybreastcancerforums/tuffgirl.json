When i was a teen (i<m my forties) my friend's mother had it. regrettably she ended up with you guessed it bone mets including to the scalp.  My friend mentions this to me on occasion still wondering if it in part stopped the chemo from effecting where it should. My cancer agency started with gloves though because they felt mets to the hands were low and that would possibly stop the neuropathy but no scalp things. and merry christmas!",

I immediately called my husband back in Canada( I was on a business trip) and he arranged for an appointment on my return immediately but the rest of the trip I was just kind of going through the motions. I continued with the snorkeling etc, in my time off but my mind was going wild. If you have trip insurance? or could you accept learning of it and using a great break to accept it? like conniemae spoke of, or maybe fingers crossed get great news? take care",

In Canada they only check you as follows 1. mamo or other screen MRI 2.core biopsy or other depending 3. after confirmation then blood work and liver U\\s 4.lung X-ray 5. nuclear bone scan assuming you are not in situ  no brain checking at all. Unless you have symptoms then no other checking AT ALL I'm so glad for your findings!",
