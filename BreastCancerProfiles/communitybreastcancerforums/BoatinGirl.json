I had a great tech, and an amazing doc.  I had the test first thing in the morning, and got called with results around 4pm - and other than the lump I know is cancerous, it was clean!!!  What peace of mind this test has the ability to provide.  Too bad it is so expensive.",

I found a little info looking at some blogs, but am wondering 1) how uncomfortable are they for six months 2) are they somewhat obvious when wearing things like tank tops  3) are there are restrictions with them, for activities that involve alot of jostling, like jet-skiing?
