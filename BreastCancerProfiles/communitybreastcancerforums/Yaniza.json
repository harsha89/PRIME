When the pathology report came back from the mastectomies my margins we're clear in both breasts but the breast that did not have a tumor was found to have a mass of precancerous cells . Because the margins were so good in that breast also I don't have any follow-up treatment... in other words, no radiation, no chemo and tamoxifen or something like it was my choice and I did the research and chose not to do it.",

There's no months of waiting. Check out any breast cancer groups in your area to see if you can get some current information on what's available. Unless you have health insurance in the US or Canada private therapists do charge a lot of money. I hope you can find free professional help in your area. I certainly took advantage of what was on offer and found it very helpful.",

When the pathology report came back there was a small mass, not yet a tumor, undetected by mammograms and biopsies... in my so called non-cancerous breast. Avoiding the radiation, by opting for a bilateral mastectomy, turned out to be the best way forward for me.",

As it turned out when the pathology report came back there was a small mass in that side. I went with reconstruction. And obviously that's easier when you're doing the same thing to both sides. All the best with these ridiculously hard decisions that we all have to make.",

I asked around and decided who I wanted as a surgical oncologist and that is who my family doctor referred me to. As far as my plastic surgeon, I was happy to go with the team that was put together after my first choice for surgical oncologist. I know in every situation there is luck/chance involved. It seems like you need emotional support and it also seems like you need an advocate to generally help you negotiate this journey. If you can't count on family or friends there are groups of women dealing with breast cancer everywhere. Besides the support you can get on line perhaps reaching out by phone and then perhaps in person will help. I remember disagreeing with aspects of my care ... but there are protocols to be followed. And I remember being incredibly angry by times. Looking back I know that the anger was fueled by terror. Were your biopsies done quickly? Mine were done very quickly but waiting for the pathology report was a complete agony. I hope today is a better one for you. ",
