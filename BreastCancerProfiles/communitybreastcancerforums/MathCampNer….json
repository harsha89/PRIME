You all helped me so much I cant even tell you. I saw my oncologist and he believes its only stage 2 but is doing a heart scan, bone scan, and CT scan to be sure. I start chemo next week for 3 rounds and then hopefully surgery and then another 3 rounds of chemo to be safe. He seems really hopeful and I am too. I'm so thankful I found this community because I'm definitely going to need the support. I just wanted to thank you all again so much.",
