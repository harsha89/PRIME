Last night, I was lotioning my chest after a shower and a chunck of my skin from my mastectomy scar pulled off.  It didn't fall off, instead when i rubbed the lotion, I noticed a tiny bit sticking out.  Thinking it was dead skin I tugged slightly and a chunk came out.  It didn't hurt at all as I am still numb in my chest area,  but it did not bleed. I measured it at 1 cm (the nurse on the nurse line had asked).  She just told me to call my PS in the morning (today).  What is worrying me is now, I have a hole in my insicion area. To give background, I had a skin sparing double mastectomy 10/24/13 and now waiting for my exchange in March.  I had troubles with seroma and pain but other than that, everything went normal. The chunck that fell off is in the area where the skin was going to be gathered for reconstructing my nipple.  Is my skin \"dying\"?  Anyone else heard of this?  Waiting for my PS to call back may take a day or two.

      "Content": "Jan 29, 2014 01:08PM - edited Jan 29, 2014 01:10PM by sunnyat12 Hi Luckymother, Here is my experience.  My situatation began in 2010 when I had a lump in my right breast.  Because of my age at that time (33) they believed it was only a cyst and I had a FNA procedure done and that was it.  Fast forward to 2012, the lump had reappeared.   I went back to my doc thinking that it was just another cyst that needed aspirating.  During her BE, she found multiple lumps in both breast. I had my first biopsy.  One spot was chosen in both breast and both areas came back with ADH. My mammograms showed that I had extremely dense breast and calcifications. My MRI was a level 3  I have a strong family history of BC and in the month of July, I had the genetic testing done.  At first it was listed as BRCA2 VUS.  My aunt who had BC when she was 22 finally took the test. My status was changed to BRCA2 positive. With the knowledge of my biopsies and lumpectomy results, family history and gene mutation, I went to my first breast suregon and he advised i have a double mastectomy.  I went for a 2nd and 3rd opinion and they all suggested the double mastectomy. I had it done and the results from the biopsy from the mastectomy was i had 22 areas of ADH and one area of ALH.  So to answer the question, yes it is possible to have ADH in both breast.  Good luck to you.",
