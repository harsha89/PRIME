I got a call from the cancer center yesterday asking if I wanted to participate in a new research study by using a new type of digital mammography to detect BC in women with dense breast tissue. It is supposed to help differentiate adipose (fat) tissue, lipids, and water in the breast, which in turn will show cyst vs mass, pick up smaller masses, give them better measurements of a mass with ill defined margins like mine, etc. Of course I agreed. Anything to help them find improved BC detection is fine with me. Well, almost anything. They are going to do the additional mammo right before my biopsy Monday. It should help them see if there are any other additional areas of concern that were hidden by high density on the regular digital mammo. I'm kind of excited about this. Plus, they are giving me $50 for doing it. Maybe I'll take my husband out to dinner after the biopsy is done. :o)",

I've been up since 4 o'clock this morning, tossing and turning for 45 minutes before I decided to just get up and have my morning cup of coffee. We are leaving at 9:30 to head up to the cancer center for three different appointments today, ending with the biopsy. I'm so nervous. I wish the biopsy was first so I could get that over with. I know it's not that big of a deal. I assist in all types of biopsies ( EXCEPT breast ironically) everyday and I know the patients don't feel any pain with the exception of how we have to have them lay on the table. We have a pathologist with their microscope and stains in the room who immediately look at the cells to see if it is malignant or not, but I don't think they do the same for breast biopsies at the place I am going. The next couple of days are going to be so hard waiting for those results. Does anyone have a time machine I can borrow?",

I don't really like it, and although my breast may have become attached to it, I sure haven't! One little thing I forgot to mention, when the Radiologist was pushing on my breast really hard to advance the introducer needle I told him \"This is the worst foreplay I have ever had, just so you know.\" The other Radiologist and the Ultrasound Tech thought it was really funny, but the Rad doing the biopsy was less than amused. Typical doc. Lol!",

He ended up having to use both hands to really push the needle into the mass itself. Ultrasound tech and other radiologist both said the mass was very hard, so I would be extremely sore and have a lot of bruising. They were not kidding. My whole breast feels like it is on fire. Bleh! I did meet with the breast surgeon before the biopsy. She was wonderful. Excellent bedside manner, answered all of our questions, etc. She said she feels like we likely caught it early, if it is indeed malignant, but she wants me to get an MRI done to see if we are missing anything on the mammo with my breasts being so dense. She also said that with the mass size, irregular borders, the spiculated appearance, etc. that we will be doing surgery to remove it even if the biopsy results come back negative. Not quite sure why, but I will ask her next time I see her. Should get my results Wednesday or Thursday. That's all for now. :o) Thanks again to everyone for all of your support.

It keeps my mind at ease, knowing there are so many other women that have gone though this process and made it out stronger, more beautiful women. Mama-Ski, I don't know really if it is considered tethering, puckering, or dimpling, or if those are all used interchangeably. When I tense my breast muscles part of my breast sucks in on it self, about the size of a half- dollar, with some lines running horizontally on each side that somewhat resemble stretch marks. I thought at first it was due to getting older, (I'm 37), but then when I raised my arm over my head I could still see it and I wasn't tightening my muscles at all. Did some research, freaked out big time, and found this site. I have an appointment at the womens cancer center Tuesday and should know if it is BC or something B9 causing this. Off topic.... Where is your hubby deploying to? Hopefully it is a 4 month assignment and not something longer. :o( Tonight we are going to an uninhabited island with a bunch of friends for a bonfire beach party. So excited for that! My husband is loading the firewood on our boat as I type this. Definately a wonderful distraction from all this.",

I'm actually really enjoying that part of this, and it's not in a sad, melancholy way either. It's a happy, sunny, appreciative attitude that I like. :o) The uninhabited island experience was wonderful, yet not new to me. We met some great new friends out there too. Bliss, thank you for the hugs and encouragement! Everyone here is so supportive, even though you all have your own struggles. This is such an amazing group. Science, don't worry, I'm sure I'll be here crying and screaming from time to time. I've just happened to only be online during my \"up\" moods so far. It's coming, just give me time. But thanks in advance for letting me know that it is okay to do should I need to. ;o)",

Today I am kinda freaking out a little bit now that it is starting to set in and the shock is wearing off. I do have a couple of questions. Is it possible to get a mastectomy and not do radiation or chemo? Also, is it possible to have reconstructive surgery the same day as the mastectomy if you stay the same cup size? I just want these ones gone. Scoop 'em out and fill them back up with sh*t that doesn't try to kill me. :)",

It honestly went by quicker than I imagined, but that's easy to say now that it's over.  4 months long, but it's done.  Having an MRI April 8th to see if the chemo did it's job.  Fingers crossed!  My surgery date is April 16th.  I can't believe it's a 12 hour surgery with a 5 day hospital stay.  That part scares me a bit.  Hope you all had a good weekend.  It was beautiful here.",
