I do have a surgery date set for August 27th, for a bilateral mastectomy with expanders put in place for future implantation. My stomach gets upset even typing about it. But, I feel better knowing that I will be having surgery 24 days after finding out that I have the Cancer. I am nervous about the recovery. Hell, I am nervous and anxious about having C, but I cannot control any of it BUT I do have the choice to remove it from my body. I am thankful for that. ",

Currently working FT as middleschool teacher which takes the vast majority of my time and energy. Sorry to my poor family. I think of you all often though and hope for the best for all of you. Those pictures are terrific Sensitive! You have to have fun and laugh during this time. I know I do or I'll lose it! VLH, I had great luck finding glutamine on a bogo sale at super supplements and cheaper than GNC. DaraB- chemo body sounds about right for me too! Seq24, good luck with your tooth. It sure sucks to have anything more to deal with at this time.  My 4th round of AC was my worst. Worst for aches, mouth sores inside and out, nausea, just generally felt crummy. Even my port decided to join the party and got so angry looking my doc put my on antibiotics. I also got hand foot syndrome which is not fun. One fingertip split like an overripe plum. Yowch! Had my first round of Taxol on Friday. Had a slight reaction during the first 15 minute testing of it (just got hot and flushed) but they gave me more Benedryl and a 20 minute rest then slowed my drip and the remaining infusion went without incident. So far, I'm just a bit more tired after the taxol, appetite has been zapped and the hand foot seems worse. We'll see how it goes. 11 more to go! Good luck to everyone this week no matter the treatment stage you're on. I hope it's a good week.",

I had my 3rd AC infusion today and after an unintend nap in my recliner- thanks steroids! -I've been since 5:30. Sad others are dealing with the steroids but comforted to hear I'm not alone. I have to say, that dang Cytoxin starts giving me the worst so use headache within 5 minutes of the drip starting. They have slowed the drip each time to see if it helps. Today's was two hours with a pause to administer Benedryl and fluids because the headache came in like a bull AND they had given me Tylenol beforehand. The headache bothers me for the rest of the day and I have to take more Tylenol when the initial dose wears off. I thought I saw someone else write about cytoxin causing sinus headaches but my nurses said they've never seen it and are flummoxed as to why it's happening. Do any of you Cytoxin gals get headaches too? Oh! I've been taking our ginger capsules every morning and have had very little nausea and have only had to use rx nausea meds a few times. Re: our crazy BM's. I drink a prune juice cocktail (8oz over lots of ice and topped with flavored seltzer water) every morning and take docusate in the eve. The cocktail is actually decent until the sore mouth days come. Then, the seltzer seems to sting a bit. Anyway, it seems to do the trick unless I have se's that call for narcotics. Then I snack on a handful of prunes and add a Senna for a morning or two. Hope everyone has a great Saturday! I'll try not to overdue it on the steroid crazy until my crash tomorrow",

I appreciate your candor, humor and support of everyone here. Sensitive- my hair has started coming back (I feel like I have a fuzzy baby's head but it's not as soft as a baby's!) I have 3 more taxol infusions so hopefully it will stick around. Chemist- taxol has been harder for me for sure but was assured it was going to be easier than AC. My doc was so wrong. I've been lucky to be able to teach FT this whole time but usually have to take Wed or Thurs off as those are my worst days. I strongly suggest icing your fingers during taxol treatments. I stupidly didn't even though it had been recommended and my fingertips and nails have been awful. The neuropathy, finger tip pain and nails pulling away from the nail bed have been pretty bad for me. My oncologist reduced my dose by 30% 2 treatments ago to attempt to reduce the neuropathy and some other of my se's. So far, I can't tell any difference. I have 3 infusions to go though! The last one is scheduled for December 23. I cannot wait to be done and get on to radiation. I'm hoping they don't make me wait too long before I can start rads because it would be incredible to do my exchange surgery this summer. If they push me out too far with rads I won't have a good time to do the surgery until summer 2018. No no no! My MO is gone this week so I won't have answers until Monday or Tuesday. Fingers crossed they think I'm healthy enough to starts rads asap! Ladies who are in their rads treatment any thoughts or advice?",

I just had my 2nd to last taxol infusion today. Last one is next Friday the 23rd. Today was a little hard since I had originally anticipated today as my last treatment but found out the week before thanksgiving that I had to skip thanksgiving week due to my clinic running on a skeleton crew. Oh well. I am still so thankful that the end is in sight for the chemo phase. My hair is growing more too!! Looks a bit like male pattern baldness but it's getting longer and darker on the sides. I had thick wavy/curly hair before and am anxious to see how it comes in. I'm massaging my head morning and night to stimulate my scalp. Grow hair grow! Hope you all have restful and happy plans for the holidays. Try not to over do things. I'm telling myself that as much as I am to you all! I've been pushing too much and pay for it. It's so hard for me to balance the energy output and not take on too much. As my doctor just advised me, make sure to take time to kick back and put your feet up as much as possible! We need and deserve it! Here's me on thanksgiving and then Dec 10th. Big change in hair!  ",

I also have PASH and ALH and from what I understand, they don't really know exactly what my risks are of getting BC in the future. I also have anxiety and have dealt with depression in the past so I understand how hard this can all be! There are a few things that have helped me find more peace in the situation. 1. Exercise. I find myself having less anxiety and depression and just feel better in general when I take my Pilates and Spin classes. I used to run and weight train 5-6 days a week until I found out I have a herniated disc so that's out for now. 2. Realizing that beyond being healthy (exercise, eating well, taking care of my body) I don't really have any control about what's going to happen to my boobs! This has been hard and I still struggle with this sometimes. In fact the past couple weeks it's been on my mind a lot as I can't tell if I have something weird happening with my nipple and of course my mind wanders to BC. 3. Trying to stay involved in my daily life. If I have a lot of free time, it leads me to worry more. If I focus on being present with my kids, and seeing my friends, and having meaningful conversations with my husband it really helps me. 4. Lastly, one of the biggest things that's helped me has been talking to other people who are in the same or similar boat. I had people in my extended family tell me I was overreacting because everyone has pre-cancer. They don't understand our situation and I choose to not discuss anything with them because it just frustrates me. I hope any or all these things are helpful to you as well. Know that you are not alone!! We are all in this together!! Best, Christiana aka Wonderwoman",

That means about 80% of the time it's only ADH but the only way they will no for sure is if they remove it to find out. Basically the cancerous cells could be adjacent to the ADH and the needle biopsy missed them. I know it's hard to find statistics as I'm 38 (36 when mine was found and they also FEA and ALH in addition to ADH when I had mine removed surgically). I searched far and wide but didn't really find much online. If you have specific questions john hopkins has a website called ask the expert and the woman who answers is very kind and informative. But she will refer you to your specific dr to assess your own personal risk of developing BC in the future. SAAdvocate- I also had bloody discharge from my nipple after my surgery. If it continues feel free to ask your dr about it. I'm glad you had good news!",

Seems like your Drs are pretty quick about getting results to you so that's good! I'm only a year into my ADH diagnosis so I'm sure there are others who have more info but this is what I know. ADH increases the risk of developing Breast Cancer in the future. Drs seem to disagree on the statistics on exactly how much it increases the risk. Some say at our age (I'm 37) it's 10x than others, some say it's 1.5x higher. So it seems to me that they really just don't know. What I think you can expect is quite possibly the Breast Surgeon to request an excisional biopsy which just means they will go in and do surgery to remove the area where your ADH is. Again numbers vary, but most will say there's a 20% chance there's some form of cancer surrounding the ADH. Mine showed other forms of atypia but no cancer. How your Dr chooses to follow up again varies, but if you are determined to be very high risk, they may suggest you take Tamoxifen. And they will follow up with imaging (mammos, mir, ultrasound) every 6-12 months and will probably want to do an exam every 6-12 months as well. Yes, it seems like a potentially never ending saga, but we all just do the best we can. Please keep us posted and ask any other questions you can think of. =) Christiana",

I have clotting issues and don't want to take any chances. Following up every 6 months sounds good. I'm unsure of if I like my current drs or if I want to find a new one.

For me the hardest part was not eating anything from midnight on and having an afternoon surgery. Please keep us posted on when the surgery will be etc. Mystic- Great news that nothing further was found! I have my yearly diagnostic mammo tomorrow and I'm feeling positive about them not finding anything. Will keep you all posted. =) ",

I know it's good news and I am happy about it but there's a teeny little voice in the back of my mind that is still worried. I told my husband that I know it sounds absolutely crazy, especially considering I may never get cancer but I still have a bit of anxiety about it all. It's much less than a year ago so I'm hoping with more time it will just go away completely. What's your follow up plan?",

Fortunately at this point I've only needed to have 1 lumpectomy. Just know whatever you choose to do you have many women here that support you and your decision!! Sending you love!!",

I had a non palpable lump found via mammogram and a core needle biopsy done with 18 gauge (he was convinced it was a fibroadenoma) and they found ADH so I have excisional biopsy (although report said excisional lumpectomy) which found ADH, ALH and FEA. Since you've been through it once, hopefully this time around will be a little easier for you. Even if it's only because you know what to expect. From what I know it's standard care to remove the ADH surgically. Try not to worry too much! I hope you can get it scheduled quickly. And don't be afraid to ask for anxiety meds if you need them. They helped me tremendously. Please keep in touch",

After an incidental mass was found during a diagnostic mammo ordered for \"lumpy, bumpy breasts\", I ended up having US, then Core needle biopsy and finally an excisional biopsy and was diagnosed with ADH, ALH w/cautery artifacts, FEA, PASH, Columnar cell lesion, stream sclerosis...the list goes on. Considering my age (I'm 37), the Breast Surgeon recommended just following up with imaging once a year. She said I could me with MO to discuss Tamoxifen, but I have pretty much decided not to take it. I'm already quite healthy other than drinking alcohol but am considering adopting a mostly vegetarian diet depending on my research. I'm also planning to send out for a second opinion from Dr. Lagios just to be certain of my diagnosis. Anyway, I would love to connect with others with this diagnosis. I have general anxiety disorder and have it pretty much under control (exercise helps tremendously), but I have a hard time with anticipation...and waiting.",

Is there any way you can take a mental health day maybe tomorrow? Or sometime this week? You can use it to try to destress. Hot bath, massage, binge watching Netflix... and maybe journaling or coming up with a plan to help make you feel more in control of the situation? Or at least make a plan of how you can do something positive for your health each day? I find that cardio 20-30 mins 5-6 days a week really helps with my mental health. If you're able to fit that in, it might help you feel like you can manage stress a little easier. All that to say what you're going through is difficult. Just one of those is plenty to handle. Give yourself time to deal with all of it. And know that we're here for you! Please keep in touch and let us support you in any way that we can.",

I searched the internet also looking because I have ADH, ALH and FEA and I wanted to know exactly what my risk is of developing BC. I also couldn't really find anything except 1 thing that said it could be 8-10x more likely than the average woman. So basically, it seems like they don't really know everything about our situation, and that even those that do have conflicting opinions. I realize that doesn't help much. When I was going through my wait for surgery and results I was a ball of anxiety. Fortunately I had to keep it together because I have little kids and my husband was hardly home due to crazy work schedule. I know I need to get checked again in the next couple months, but in the meantime I've been trying to just focus on my life and let the worries of ADH and BC go. It doesn't serve me to worry, and I know it's impossible not to. I'm just trying to focus on the things I DO have control of. I hope this helps...even if just to know that you're not alone in this.",

My boobs are so small to begin with I cannot imagine sparing any of the tissue that is left. I also am leaning towards the double mastectomy to avoid the yearly pain and annoyance of having a mammogram. Last year, the tech lifted me up with the machine and it looked like I had been beat up by a few people. I always have to go back for more images. In my head, I tell myself to remove the bad tissue and I do not want to have one breast. So, I am thinking the double mastectomy. Of course I am scared, but I am more scared of the other breast joining the left one on the dark side. Plus, I won't be doing any nude dancing. :) Thanks for taking the time to share your story.
