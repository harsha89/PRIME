      "Content": "Scared7755 wrote: ladies I was just diagnosed with breast cancer. It's too early to have all the info but Drs are thinking Stage 1a (hopefully). They don't feel any swollen lymph nodes but aren't 100% sure till they do more tests. It's invasive ductal carcinoma. I am being treated at a local breast surgeon in Marietta Ga but was wondering if anyone had oncologist recommendations. Should I try cancer center treatment of America? Md Anderson? My head is flooded with horrible thoughts of leaving my 7 month old. I can survive and beat this right? I am 36 and terrified. Dx 6/14/2016, DCIS/IDC, Right, 1cm, Stage IA, Grade 2, 0/16 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
