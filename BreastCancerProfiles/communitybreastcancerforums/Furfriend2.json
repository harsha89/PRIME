My hope for you gals is to feel good for Christmas &every holiday you celebrate. My 2nd Taxol is Monday and I once again am overly anxious. Did not get my results from my CBC this week so I don't know how it is? Nervous because I had a cold this week/ mucus, cough, running nose the whole bit and I am afraid they are going to say \" No\" to treatment Monday. I have mixed emotions. Hell haven't even gotten to the cancer center and already thinking the worst... I still did not get a call back from the nurse at the cancer center from 2 weeks ago!!! I had a reaction to one of the premeds this time and they never called me back to check or tell me if they are going to adjust my premeds. The nurse doing my infusion told me it is exactly the same premeds as I was getting with AC? I thought they gave something different for premeds & Taxol? Does any one know for sure? I am confused. I also have itchy rash-ecema/dermatitis? All over my hands/fingers. It started 3-4 days after my infusion of taxol. My hands are cracked/bleeding blisters & peeling. I have been taking a little lit of Benedryl before bed to help with the itchy. Also have been noticing swelling at my ankles for a month now. This only happens if I have been walking or standing for more than an hour. I am thinking Lymphadema is possible? Is anyone else experiencing this as well? It is snowing out and oh so pretty so just the reason I need NOT to go out and do my laundry or shop for food ;D Best to each of you & thanks for being my support group.",

Ask alot of questions of your MO and nurses, take a look at the board for suggestions on what to eat to stay healthy. Carbs, cereal, breads, puddings , apple juice & water were my choice eats. I had some nausea for the most part, still do but it is now getting more manageable on my tx of Taxol. What chemo drugs will you be on and are you having surgery post chemo? I am not sure I understand your diagnosis. We are here for you & will help in anyway we can. You are strong lady and will get through this along with the rest of us warriors. One of my suggestions is if you have nausea take your meds to stay on top of it. I was a little slow on taking mine and it makes it worse. All the best!",

I wound up being longer. Apparently my Taxl bag was huge OMG! So from 9am-3pm. I saw my MO today-she is the best gave me the same run down on the Taxol should be a little easier maybe more fatique because of the cummulative effect. I had a reaction to the Benadryl we believe today. Super dizzy& stomach was queazy. Had to be walked to the bathroom. This passed after 30 minutes. I don't recall getting Benadryl during AC but the nurse said I did??? Going to call my cancer center tomorrow to check. This is the 1st time I stayed home after treatment. I feel guilty as my immediate supervisor is out all week and the work is tremendous. Tinglling & bone pain seems to be the most common se's per MO. I took a Tylenol already to stay on top of bone pain Will be taing another in 2 hours then nighty night. I hope I can do this. BTW MO has decided I am to do Taxol every 2 weeks. She feels more comfortable with this. love to each.",

I put on 3-4 lbs in the past 7 days.  Been eating much better. Meceded/Warrior -Joint pain sucks and I have it also with Taxol.  Hair is not growing back in fact more of my eyelashes have fallen out in the last two weeks My face looks so broken out- very rashy looking and a bit itchy. Maria/Headeast how it is going? I had started a Cancer journal but haven't been diligent with my writing, anyone else doing this?   I recently have been reading up on breast cancer and eating better for the future which has touched base with me.  My overall health/wellness needs to improve. I am VERY concerned about weight gain with the ongoing therapy drugs. Anyone else share in my concern? Excited about going to my company holiday party this weekend even if I do feel ugly!
