I had a double mastectomy in May 2015 and have had terrible pain in my arm/shoulder for 7 months! I have been doing PT for 3 months and not helping. I just had an EMG yesterday and no nerve damage, thank goodness. Dr thinks all my pain is stemming from my shoulder. I had MRI and diagnosis was tendinitis, capsulitis & bracitis in shoulder. Dr wants to do cortisone shot in shoulder but I'mnervous about getting Lymphedema. However, can't live with this pain anymore! Has anyone had a similar experience? Log in to post a reply",
