Went to local clinic here and doc did breast exam. There was a lump. He scheduled a biopsy surgery and removed tumor. Path report is mixed cancer stage one. I have since gone to a hospital in larger city and have met two great oncology docs, one a surgeon. Says margins are positve and need to go take out one more centimeter and if not in lymph nodes then radiation. I have no appetite, I am assuming this is nerves as I am scared shitless but I know it could be worse and am lucky to have found it so early but its hard to be grateful at the moment and this is only the beginning. I just went in yesterday for an ultrasound. They wanted to do mammogram but I was like are you kidding me I just had this operated on...the ultrasound showed no more tumors in either breast thank god but I am losing weight even now from no appetite...anybody experience this? Probably just nerves and sheer terror I guess. I was thinking about asking for some xanex for anxiety? Thanks for listening and will be back on this board alot I am sure... Dx 5/28/2015, Right, <1cm, Stage IA, Grade 1, 0/1 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- (IHC) Surgery Lumpectomy: Right; Lymph node removal: Sentinel Radiation Therapy Whole-breast: Breast, Lymph nodes Log in to post a reply",
