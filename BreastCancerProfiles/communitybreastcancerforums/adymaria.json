      "Content": "adymaria wrote: Hi all, Today I received a letter from CVS caremark informing me that my Dr's request for Ibrance was denied since I'm not \"postmenopausal\". The exact words were \"Standard Ibrance Policy does not allow coverage of Ibrance when it is taken with an aromatase inhibitor for breast cancer if the patient is not postmenopausal\". However, my doctor's plan was to force me into menopause by taking a monthly Zoladex shot. My first shot was this Tuesday. My first thought was, well maybe CVS caremark isn't aware that I'm taking a zoladex shot for ovarian suppression. But then I realized they had approved the zoladex the day before the ibrance denial, so maybe they did know about the zoladex and still denied me for Ibrance since I'm technically not of postmenopausal age. Is there anyone in my situation (who wasn't technically \"postmenopausal\" but was forced into menopause) and who has been approved for Ibrance? I won't be able to talk to my doctor about this until Monday. Would be nice to know if someone in my situation had the Ibrance/Femara combo approved by insurance, so I'm not thinking about it all weekend.

Are you doing treatment before surgery like myself, to decrease the size of the tumor before surgery? If so, how is the ibrance/femara combo working for you? Can you tell if it's shrinking the tumor? My doctor said it would be obvious.",
