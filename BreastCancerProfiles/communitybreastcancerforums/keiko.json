      "Content": "keiko wrote: New here, and am confused! I had excisional biopsy for microcalcs and was told results are benign. However, they found atypical lobular hyperplasia. So, that's benign, right? I went for post-op appointment with surgeon and she said I should consult with oncologist to discuss going on tamoxifen. But this is benign finding, right? She said I'm at higher risk for breast cancer. 4% more than average in 5 years time and 25% more than average in lifetime. What do these percentages mean? What is the average percent chance to get breast cancer? I'm going to have a diagnostic mammo of the affected breast and and MRI of both in 6 months. Why can't I just wait for that and skip the oncologist? I'm 48, on Loestrin24FE birth control pills for endometriosis (was not told to go off it). I've gone through 8 in-vitro cycles (have 2 kids, first one at age 34), no family history. So, is ALH something significant or can I just put it out of my head since it's benign? I just don't understand. Appreciate your help and guidance!! Keiko Log in to post a reply",

I did have an excisional biopsy -- i went straight for the excisional rather than start with stereotactic core needle -- I didn't want to go through 2 biopsies. My decision turned out to be the right one.  I spoke with my GYN and he said I should stop the bcp now. I'll have to endure the pain of endometriosis again (horrible!). I didn't ask him if I decide NOT to take the tamoxifen, could I stay on the bcp. It's Loestrin24, which has very low dose of estrogen. But I suspect estrogen is the bad guy now.  I made the appointment with the onc and I guess I could ask her. Anything else an ALH person should ask in particular? Thanks so much for your help -- what a great website and forum!",
