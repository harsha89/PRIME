I have my mammogram scheduled for April so we'll wait and see what that shows, if anything. I see the doc in March again. I do have limited arm reach as many other women have. I didn't know if other women had pain lasting this long and if so, what caused it? I have pretty much come to the conclusion that that's the way it's going to be. I did have some lung problems after radiation; an MRI or CT (can never remember which is which) showed it got part of the lung along with the breast. I have been on Advair and rescue inhalers ever since. I had asthma as a child but have not been bothered most of my adult life until radiation. Now I have COPD and asthma. Thanks!",

I was on arimidex for some time but decided to stop it. I figured if it would keep me clear of cancer for 5 years, that's when supposedly you're cured, then you stop taking it, it could come back anyway. With the family history, the odds are against me there. My question is, and I don't know if there's an answer, why does it still hurt, after all this time? I hurt every day. I wear sport bras because a regular bra hurts. I have pain under my arm and also in the breast itself. I think it may be the clips in there (10) but I'm not sure. It seems I would get used to it but I don't. I don't know if others have pain this long after surgery. I have not found the answer yet. I have lost the strength in that arm, too, but I figure that's pretty normal since they cut in the muscle.",

He hadn't realized it had been 25 years since I used my inhaler. I just kept bringing it up each time I saw him and my primary doctor. My primary had the pulmonary function test ordered and diagnosed me with bronchitis so the oncologist thought it was being handled. I kept telling them it started during radiation treatment. I was telling my oncologist once again, and it was like a light went on. He ordered the CT scan. My primary sent me to the allergist. I had blood tests for allergies but haven't seen her yet for the results. We'll see. I really find it strange that I have not had a problem all those years and all of a sudden it pops up. All I want is to know if this if this is how my life is going to be. I do not like taking all this medicine. I've never been one to take anything if I didn't have to. Besides, one or all of them is making me gain weight like crazy. I'll bet I've put on 40 lbs. since March. I have read that radiation scarring can lead to fibrosis. I definitely do not want that; so anything I can do now to get the correct diagnosis and treatment is worth searching for. Having a CT scan is the only real way to see if there is scarring that I know of. You have to weigh the pro's and con's and decide for yourself to have one. Good luck to you! Please stay in touch. It is good to have \"sisters\" that know what you're going through. ",

During radiation treatment, my asthma started acting up and I used my inhaler very frequently for the first time in 25 years. I was put on Arimidex following surgery which, can make you cough. I just thought my cough was a side effect to the meds. Finally in March 2010 I was diagnosed with bronchitis and took prednisone in varying doses until August. I have had pulmonary function tests showing moderate broncitis/asthma, a CT scan showing some lung scarring from radiation that the Dr. said would not cause my breathing problem. I am also seeing an allergist and another dose of prednisone. The doctors have put me on Advair, Spiriva, Albuterol inhaler. My question is: Does anyone else have breathing problems following radiation? If so, what are you doing for it? Am I the only one with this problem?
