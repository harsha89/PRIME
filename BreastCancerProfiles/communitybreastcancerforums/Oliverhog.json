      "Content": "Dec 29, 2012 10:25AM - edited Dec 29, 2012 10:54AM by Oliverhog Jebra, I was just diagnosed in October 2012.  Because I had Hodgkin's in '85, treated with radiation to the chest, and a recurrence in '87, treated with 8 months chemo, my lungs are badly scarred.  I have 33% of predicted normal lung capacity.  After various appointments with an internist, surgeon, plastic surgeon, pulmonary physician, cardiologist, psychologist, and anesthesiologist, I finally had my modified radical mastectomy on 11/30/12.  I have the same urge to blurt out to everyone, people on the phone, friends, strangers.  I have no idea why I do that either.  I cry almost constantly.  I was taking Xanax one or two very low dose pills just at night to help me sleep because the doctors had me convinced that I was anxious (probably about the lung disease that I've been living with for 25 years or so) about a year and a half ago.  The internal medicine doc put me on a low dose of Klonipin (Clonazepam) that I pretty much only take at night to sleep.  I feel like I need them to help me sleep, but at the same time, when I am faced with anxiety causing events during the day, I almost now feel that I have to have a pill, though I don't take them.  I have the urge to take them.  Never had the urge to take medicine to reduce anxiety with a pill prior to being put on those pills. It seems these dang things create the need for themselves.  I thought I coped well with anxiety prior to being put on them.  Now, that's the first place my mind goes when something causes me anxiety. I think, oh, go get a clonazepam.  When I had the Hodgkin's no one offered any antidepressants, no anxielytics either time I was diagnosed or treated.  I made it through that.  I have no idea why I feel like I can't make it through this time.  It sort of sucks.",

      "Content": "Apr 18, 2013 03:59AM Oliverhog wrote: Hello, April 2013 group.  Someone asked a question in our January 2013 group about what to expect during chemo.  I responded with the info below and a few of the women in the January group suggested that I re-post this in some of the groups that just started.  You might find some of the info helpful: There's a lot of material in this forum (the January 2013 chemo group) to read through to find out what the rest of us in the January group went through.  It seems like a huge issue was that of constipation.  Take whatever your MO recommends and be diligent about it.  Some even took the anti-constipation meds before they got their infusions.  If you're getting taxotere or a taxol, you might want to wear dark polish and possiby consider icing your hands during the infusion.  A few of us have had problems with very painful fingertips, the nails start turning blue at the base and gradually get more and more bruised looking.   Fluid intake has also been an issue.  I figured out a fairly easy way to stay hydrated after I finished chemo.  I drink water from a bottle that holds almost 17 ounces.  I sip, swallow and count to five, sip, swallow and count to five until I've finished the bottle.  It takes less than 3 minutes to drink the whole bottle.  Spread your water drinking out throughout the day and if you drink it that way it takes you less than 12 minutes.  I think what makes it tolerable is the fact that I was focused on the action rather than on the water or the taste of the water itself.   Protein intake is really important to help your body's cells heal from the chemo, because, as I'm sure you know, chemo is not selective.  It works on cancer cells because many of them have high metabolisms, meaning cancer cells will ingest or take up more of the chemo than the rest of your body.  The cells that have a higher turn over rate metabolize more of the chemo than those with a slower rate.  Therefore, you'll find that anything with epithelial cells, like your mouth, your skin (hair follicles), your GI tract, the cells that produce white and red blood cells, will be affected by the chemo.  Costo sells a chocolate or vanilla 11 ounce drink called premier protein that contains 30 grams of protein.  Fage yogurts have 10 grams.  Nature Valley peanut butter dark chocolate bars have 10 grams.  Most of the women seem to be able to eat peanut butter and taste it through the havoc chemo wreaks on taste buds. Use Biotene toothpaste and mouthwash because they're gentle, but keep your mouth moist and seem to help keep you from getting sores in your mouth.  They may also help with the taste issue.  One of the Bellas mentioned something about chewing Biotene gum during the infusions and she thought that worked.  If not, some recommend baking soda and salt in water to rinse and gargle with a few times a day. Most of us expected to lose our hair and did except for the few who used the ice caps.  We pretty much cut our hair short, then buzz cut it before losing it.  The ones who lost their eyelashes and eyebrows started to lose them a few weeks after the chemo ended.  If you're going to lose your hair, expect it to happen between days 12 and 20 or so after your first chemo.  Make sure you take the steroids as prescribed because they minimize allergic responses to taxol based chemos.   Also, many Bellas had problems with heart burn.  Many of us take probiotics for the gut issues and swear by them.  I had very minor problems with constipation and I attribute that to the probiotics because I rarely took anything else even while I took percocet for pain.   If you get Neulasta to boost your white counts, taking Claritin before and daily for several days after the injection seemed to help a lot of the Bellas stave off the bone pain.  If you get to your next treatment and your white counts are higher than the upper limits of normal, the Neulast may have been too high of a dose.  Having really high white counts when you don't have an infection can make you feel pretty yucky.  Ask to have the dose of Neulasta reduced if your white counts are high and you feel crappy. There's been a bit of a debate about taking anti-oxidants while going through chemo.  Some did and some didn't.  Chemo can affect your liver enzymes (particularly the ALT and AST levels) and some MOs do not recommend taking single amino acids like glutamine during chemo.  Many sources say that glutamine should not be taken in the presence of elevated ALT and AST levels.   Chemo seemed to cause a great deal of fatigue for most of us, although several still managed to exercise including hiking and going to the gym.  I don't know how they did it, but they did.  One of the Bellas turned us on to a head covering called a Buff.  You can get them online or in stores.  REI sells them.  It's like a tube top for your head that can be worn like 12 different ways.  Also Voguewigs.com seems to be a popular site for wigs ranging in price from $30 to over $1000 with several in between that range.  Everyone seems happy with their wigs and half wigs. Many of us also experienced our worst side effects with treatment number 3 and by treatment number 4 many of us were constantly in tears.  It's O.K. to cry.  It's O.K. to rant and rave on this board.  No matter what you post, someone will always respond.  Many of us feel like we might not have been able to make it through this without our group and we all feel very close and very fortunate to have each other.  The board offers something we don't get anywhere else.   You might want to try the March 2013 chemo group because some of them have probably already had their second treatment and the complaints, worries, info on that group is probably more relevant and timely for you.  Plus, as of today there were only 12 pages of posts to get through to get yourself caught up.   Best of luck to you.",

      "Content": "Apr 18, 2013 06:32AM - edited Apr 18, 2013 06:36AM by Oliverhog Kobrien, I was pretty frightened at the prospect of chemo, too.  I shouldn't have been because I've been there, done that when I was 26.  I had radiation to the chest for Hodgkin's in '85 and 2 1/2 years later, had a recurrence that had to be treated with chemo.  Turns out the thought of it is actually worse than the actual event itself.  Most of us have been constipated at one time or another.  Most of us have been sick to our stomachs at one time or another.  Most of us have felt various pains at one time or another and most of us have been really tired probably on more than one occasion.  It will suck.  You'll probably have problems with your taste buds.  But, I think the biggest issue for most really is the hydration issue.  If you stay well-hydrated, most of the other symptoms are more tolerable.  If you're otherwise healthy, it should't affect you too horribly bad.  Pay attention to your body.  Know that your team is always available to you if something crops up and you need medical help.  And, if you have good support at home, you'll be fine.  One more thing.  That treatment for the Hodgkin's caused a great deal of scar tissue to develop in my lungs.  It left me with 33% of predicted normal lung capacity.  I had been in the hospital after being diagnosed with mycoplasma pneumonia when I was diagnosed with the BC.  I went from eight days of being confined to a hospital room (isolation) straight to all the crazy tests and surgery and then chemo.  I had gotten myself to the point that I was able to walk a half mile inside my house.  I was terrified of the effects the chemo would have on me because I knew it would knock me down really low and it did.  But, I'm feeling much better now.  So, I can do it, you can do it.",
