After having a PET or CT scan, this may become part of the conversation. Perhaps you can read up on some of the threads here - especially on herceptin and Perjeta given prior to double mastectomy. I'm hoping you can have an informative discussion with a medical oncologist that you trust prior to making all of these surgery decisions. I have 3 young children and am sending you a hug. I'm so sorry to hear of your new overwhelming diagnosis.",

Anyone here have to communicate how to step back from a close friend fitness group? I am now running by myself a lot which I really like, but also hard to do. And I get a sense that they feel guilty if they don't include me, which is totally silly I know. I was diagnosed January - so all new to me and know I have much more time to figure it all out.

While I wasn't pregnant, I can somewhat relate to the pain of still having a newborn during treatment and surgery. Happy to connect more on this specifically if it would help. After 6 rounds of TCHP my 2 liver mets were no longer detected on scans. My onc said that it was my window of time to make the decision - either say no to surgery and just get to NED by scans and do maininence herceptin for as long as we could, or go the aggressive route - BMX with nodes taken, more chemo, and probably rads and whatever else was down that rabbit hole. I read up on these boards and academic journals with fervor and took much of the advice already given to you. Lauriesh actually was one whose story I gravitated to as so encouraging! Thank you lauriesh!!! I decided to go with the aggressive route and had BMX in June and am finishing up a bit more chemo before deciding on rads. I had a complete response to the TCHP so one RO suggested rads and one said none needed. Agh! Makes me bonkers! So point being - every step moving forward feels murky and we have to just make the best decision we can based on the knowledge and advice we have with no solid guarantee. I do feel my onc is looking at my individual case and is treating me as one of those her2+ stage IV curative cases. I know others who have been on these boards for longer can speak more about how important that relationship with your onc is - as many decisions feel like you are weighing the benefits to the quality of life risks. Hoping you are able to feel confident in whatever decision you come to so that you can get on with those peaceful baby snuggles.",

Because I have 3 very young children (my youngest was 5 months at diagnosis) I did not want to be down for long. I defer to those more experienced, but one thing that helped me was cannibas oil tincture - either under my tongue or putting one drop onto a skittle? I am a religious and pretty straight laced person - so I didn't consider it at first, until educating myself on these boards. Now am glad I did this - improved sleep and was high functioning with my kids through the day and pain improved significantly. I am always thinking of Dani and others here. You are an amazing support for her and all of us! Thanks to all ",
