He's got breast cancer for crying out loud! People nowadays can be so sexist. Breast Cancer is a serious issue indeed. I've met people with such condition and it's really hard for them to cope. The important thing is that we should be aware of this, and we should help each other in any way possible. We should all be willing to help, each of us should fight for a cause, men and women alike.",
