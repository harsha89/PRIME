I know i can take them to the cancer society office in town but they are kinda rude in a way that they say once you are done you better bring them back..so i thought if i could give them away directly to some lady then that would be better. I just know that they are expensive bras and prothesis. Not does everyone's insurance covers it. I see you are er+/Pr+ and her2+..is that uncommon?Â  my mom's cancer was er+/Pr+",

Her cancer was er/pr+. She was tested for brca 1&2 and came back negative. Over the past year i have been having issues with breast pain and cysts. I have done mammograms since i was 27. Last year was my first time of having a ultrasound and breast mri. Which they came back normal except for having very dense breast and cysts. Yesterday i had my f/u mammogram and it showed a spot/change. So they redid pics and ultrasound. didn't get a clear enough pic so they did more pics turning my left breast this way and that way. and another ultrasound. the ultrasound found a cyst or what the radiologist said to me was \"i think its a cyst\". I went to see my breast health dr right after and she confirmed it was a cyst. but she was positive that it was fine and i didn't have cancer. Now i have had breast pain a lot. I can tell you where the pain is and there sure enough is a cyst. I can't get my dr to do a biopsy or to remove them. she said it wouldn't do any good. She has tried me on tamoxifen and other alternative meds to help with the pain and it hasn't helped. There is times the pain is so intense i grab myself. or it has affected the use of my arm(s). Last november she advised me to have a mastectomy w/reconstructive surgery 1) family history of cancer 2) the pain. I have been tossing this idea around for some time now. Even did a second opinion...talked with my mom's oncologist..other women and they all say i should have this done. I'm scared and i'm tired of the pain. Ladies, would you insist on having the cysts removed? and/or have the mastectomy? should i insist on having the brca1&2 testing done? please i'm confused, scared and tired. I lost my mom 3 weeks ago. I need to talk to her she was my best friend. So ladies, please tell me what you think PMX with Tram Flap 11/28/2011. diagnosed with ALH and ADH.
