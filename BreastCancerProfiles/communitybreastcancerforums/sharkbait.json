      "Content": "sharkbait wrote: Hi everyone, My breast specialist has recommended that I be followed every six months rotating between mammograms and MRIs. I went to see her because I wanted a second opinion on the radiologist's mammogram report that showed a couple of possible complex cysts that they recommended I have a repeat mammogram in six months to check.  When I went for the appointment, the breast specialist went ahead the same day and did a stereotactic biopsy.  Thankfully, the results were benign and they were complex cysts as the radiologist had suspected. My mother had breast cancer when she was 55 and her pathology report showed adenocarcinoma and it had metasticized.  She had a bilateral mastectomy, chemo, and radiation and is doing well 23 years later!   To my knowledge, there are no other first-degree relatives that have had breast cancer.  I'm 51 and had my first baby at 25.  I took birth control pills on and off for 8 years when I was in my 20s.  I was a late starter with my period (age 15). Never smoked, don't drink. So, other than my mother having had it, I have no other risk factors and am not real sure why she thinks I need the screenings so often. While part of me is thinking that if I have the screenings done every six months it will be a good thing because anything that shows up would be caught early - part of me is upset that I will have to go through all the worry and dread that goes along with having the tests done and the waiting for results every six months of my life. So, any advice on whether to accept her recommendation of the every six months screenings? Log in to post a reply",

When I go for my followup mammogram in May I am going to ask a lot more questions before I agree to the every six months deal. i have not been tested for the BRCA gene and other than fibrocystic breast disease and my mother's history I have no other risk factors. i should have asked more questions when i went to have my biopsy site checked but i was so surprised by the recommendation that it caught me off guard. Deanna, my mothers pathology report from 1989 says \"infiltrating duct adenocarcinoma\" and it says ERA binding sites positive and PRA binding sites positive. Any idea what that means as far as the tyoe of cancer she had and whether or not it is highly heridetary? Thanks again!",
