The other are fancier camisoles. These were given to me by LaLa1. I want to pay it forward and send the box to any one of you. I did not use them as my TE was expanded To 300cc right away.

For those of you getting taxotere, ice your fingers and toes during that portion of infusion. Get a good wig check out LollysLocks and I used Brian Joseph lash and Brow conditioning gel. I did not lose my eyebrows or eyelashes. The drains are manageable. I ordered a zip up sweatshirt with 4 drain pockets on each side on Cure Diva.

I had more hair on top too it was slower growing on the back of my head. . It became very uncomfortable and started to cause headaches the longer my hair grew. I have never had short hair so it's hard to get used to. The good thing is it's Winter!! Wear a hat and by next Summer you will have a full head of hair!! :)))) I am hoping that my hair will start growing faster now that Herceptin was completed last Monday!! What a journey. I am happy. I survived a year of 4 surgeries, chemo and a bald head. I am not the same person. I wake up each day and thank the lord I am alive. Plus my grandkids make me smile and I feel blessed.  PMR53",

I applied and was an accepted recipient. It was a real human hair wig and was exactly the cut and color of my own hair. They said it was a $ 2000.00 wig. You can apply online. If you decide to buy one the price seems right. They are much more comfortable and can be worn for hours. I wore mine for almost 8 months. The real hair wigs are beautiful and I really loved mine. You can wash, color and style them just like your own hair. Google Shevys wigs or LollysLocks to get more information. Good luck and Godbless all of you losing your hair. It's hard but it grows back. I have a full head of thick hair and last year at this time nearly bald. 🙏 Hugs PMR53",

My hair was 3/4 brown and 1/4 gray so I am not ready to go all gray yet. I bought a color 2 shades lighter than my hair. Covered gray well. It may come out dark if you go with same color as your hair. The good thing is this color washes out after 20 or so washes.  Good luck and Happy Hair Growing. I might add.
