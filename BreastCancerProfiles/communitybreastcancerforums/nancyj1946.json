When I had my breast surgery(my breast was very heavy and they tied back part of the skin on both sides.  My cancer was in the left breast, and I don't know if this makes much scense, but on the side where they took the lymph nodes out, under neath my arm is filled with the same fluid that is in my lymphedemia arm.  It swells up all of the time.  I recently had a bout with the flu, and I ran a low grade fever. After my temperature went down, I have been having a lot of bad pain in my side and it is going into my back. When I got up this morning that place underneath my arm is so painful that I took a pain pill. IThe medicine keeps the pain down some, but when it wears off. I start hurting again.  Can some one out there tell me what is going on. I am grateful for any input anyone has and if I am making any scense at all Nancyj1946",
