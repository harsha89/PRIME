      "Content": "Jun 4, 2015 12:16AM - edited Jun 4, 2015 12:17AM by arunbala I started off my chemotherapy (AC + T) late February. After 4 cycles of AC, my tumor reduced from 8cm to 2cm (95% reduction in volume). After three more weekly Taxol, I think it has reduced further and I think it would be around 1cm in diameter. I can't feel the any depth now and it is very soft. I have been doing the following along with Chemotherapy and it seems that these measures seem to be working synergistically with the Chemotherapy 1. 4 tsp of turmeric with small amount of milk in 4 divided doses 2. 8g of curcumin 95% as per (www.curcuminresearch.org) - Website maintained by Dr Bharat Aggarwal from MD Anderson Cancer Reseearch Insitute. I also emailed Dr Bharat to find out more about curcumin and cancer research, and it seems to be very exciting as curcumin seems to protect normal cells and chemosensitize cancer cells http://www3.mdanderson.org/depts/moleoncology/b_ag... 3. Lots of cruciferous vegetables every day (smoothies, juices and soups) - Cabbage, Broccoli, brussel sprouts, kal, cauliflower, bok choy etc 4. Lots of ginger, garlic, onions, leeks and spring onions every day and mushrooms ofcourse!! preferabley shittake and maittake 5. No sugar, dairy products or animal products 6. Two Bitter melon juice - helps keep my sugar in control 7. Quercetin and Bromelain supplements 8. Ubiquinol 200mg 9. Vitamin D3 - 5000 IU 10 Vitamin C - 500mg 11. Astragalus herb granules - equivalent to 20g of herb 12. Ban Li Zhian herb granules - equivalent to 10g of herb 13. Maitaake mushroom capsules and Turkey Tail mushroom capsules For AC treatment, I stopped taking all the supplements 3 days before treatment and did not take anything till 96 hours after treatment. With Taxol, I stop everything two days before except for curcumin and turmeric and continue 24 hours after treatment. Most of the stuff I take has anti cancer effect, even though not proven by way of clinical trials",

I just got my ultrasound done after 4 doses of taxol and the volume of the tumor has gone down from 4.2cc to 3cc. Curcumin has been shown to work in synergy with taxol and am currently taking 8g of curcumin (not turmeric as turmeric only has 5% curcumin) in 4 divided doses mixed with little warm milk and black pepper. How is your blood count doing",
