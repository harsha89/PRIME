      "Content": "busywithfive wrote: Honestly, I'm done worrying! I just want some answers and an explanation to my symptoms. Any thoughts, opinions, similar stories would be great! Here's my timeline so far: First week in Jan: Felt breast pain (unrelated to my cycle), it was radiating from my left nipple, tried to ignore it. January 8: Pain was bad enough to look into it. Found that about 1/3 of my breast was hard and very tender, no discharge. January 10: Went to PCP, was told it was just a breast infection (although I was not convinced). I am 38 yrs old, no other health problems. I finished breastfeeding my youngest 6 years ago.Â I have had mastitis once before while nursing, this seemed much different. I had no fever, did not feel sick in any way. January 10: Had a mammogram & US (sent over to ease my worry of IBC). No masses were seen, a lot of inflammation was present. Radiologist agreed it was an infection. Although he also agreed my symptoms and images were consistent with IBC. But he stated that I was \"too young\" and IBC was very rare. I agreed to a 10 day course of antibiotics and a follow-up MAM & US in a month. I told him I'd be back sooner if it didn't get better. January 17: One week into my antibiotics, I began having nipple discharge (from one duct, not spontaneous; but it discharged readily). I assumed it was related to the infection, however it did not seem puss like. It was a clear yellow color, followed by a sticky milky yellow. January 25: Returned to PCP. She did a breast exam and said the tissue in my left breast felt thickened. She sent me for blood work to check my prolactin levels (which were normal) and tested the discharge (no bacteria was found). January 29: Returned for follow-up MAM & US. Radiologist found debris in my ducts, but still felt that it was residual infection. I questioned him about the possibility of a papilloma. He said it was possible and would be the second most likely cause of the debris and discharge. He referred me to a BS for a ductogram, and commented that this is why it is best to wait a full month before returning (whatever). February 4: Pain (which never went away completely) began getting severe again in left breast. Discharge (clear yellow) began coming from 2 ducts. Two hard masses (which never completely went away) began getting larger (3:00 and 6:00). I'm going to see the breast surgeon next Saturday. She reviewed my images. The plan is to do another US. Then, most likely a ductogram and possibly a surgical biopsy. I have received calls from 2 nurses. One stated that she didn't think this sounded like a papilloma, the other said it sounded just like one! Now what???? I'm a month in to this, I've read everything on the internet 3 times (including text books) and I don't feel like I know any more than when I started! Log in to post a reply",
