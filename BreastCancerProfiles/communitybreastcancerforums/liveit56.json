Things have been normal since 2004 and now this.   I guess I am just in shock still that they saw a change.. I feel no lump or see any difference.   They want me to have a core biopsy with marker...they said it will take about an hour and a half and I will have to lay on my stomach and my breast will go through these holes in this special table,they will numb my breast and do the biopsy and place the marker and do scan to see if marker in in correct place...this scares me to death. I feel like I can't breathe sometimes...my family knows what is going on and are very supportive but just wish this was all over....I go on the 28th wanted to wait till after Christmas. I will keep all of you in my prayers and any advice about the biopsy would very much appreciated. Merry Christmas and bless you all!  Log in to post a reply",
