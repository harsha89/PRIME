I did some research online - and their is some very mixed information - some proponents for, and some that it interferes with radiation effectiveness. So, I would suggest getting your RO's buy-in prior to use.",

I still have cording and discomfort in my arm from surgery, back in March. During the mapping I lost feeling in my arm etc. However, today, they had me in position quickly and the radiation was fairly quick. I didn't have any bright lights - just a machine that circled around me. There were no loud noises (certainly nothing like an MRI). They put on Pandora. The oncology nurse I spoke to today at dana farber recommended My Girls Cream (has calendula). My skin does feel slightly irritated like a mild sunburn. I know that will get worse each day.",

They want me to go back for more PT. You should definitely raise to your RO. I know they told me that broken ribs could be a rare but potential SE of radiation. The study was mentioned to me, during my 2nd opinion for chemo. I am curious whether it will be raised during my follow up Onco meeting. We haven't discussed the drug therapy in detail yet. Do you have to be post menopausal?",

It appears they have an issue with the anti-oxidants in the green tea. The concern being that the anti-oxidants can potentially protect the cancer cells as well as the healthy cells - hence diminishing the effectiveness of the radiation. They wanted me to cease until treatment is over. I have been googling today, and it appears that use of anti-oxidants during cancer therapy is just a very controversial topic in general.",

      "Content": "Aug 20, 2017 07:25PM - edited Aug 20, 2017 07:33PM by StaceyB Hi All - I am just catching up on pages of this thread. I have now completed 15, so I am at my halfway point. The last 8 are boosts. I had my simulation for the boost and I did not need any additional tattoos :) My radiation time has decreased significantly as well. Apparently, they were taking xrays each day after set up and prior to radiation to make sure my alignment was correct. Now that the therapists are confident with the set up, they only take the pictures once per week. That could be a possible explanation for decreased times mentioned earlier. Also, I asked why I was not a candidate for the hyper-fractionated therapy (I was not given a choice) and I was told it was related to my positive lymph node and the nodes that are being treated, and that my hospital may be slow to adopt. I try to compare myself to other peoples descriptions to see if we are getting the same recommendations but sometimes it is hard to tell! I was told 10 years of hormonal therapy. I was told I would start on tamoxifen and move to an AI after menopause. I am having horrible hot flashes, on and off - all day and night. I am so uncomfortable. My husband and I are battling over the thermostat. It is the first time in our marriage were I am turning down and he is turning up. I am not sure if they are from the chemo or the chemo is putting me into menopause (not a bad thing).",

I think after getting through chemo, the thought of starting a new phase for 6 weeks just through me over the edge mentally. I actually requested some sessions with the social worker (which I didn't feel I needed during chemo). They were helpful, but I think that some time to adjust to the new phase of treatment also helped too, and I found myself feeling better. I am feeling a lot of fatigue. I was a little tired in the beginning, then felt very energetic. I just finished day 20 and the past few days I have been exhausted again.",
