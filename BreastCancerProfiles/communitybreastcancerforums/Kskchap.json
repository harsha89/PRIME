I had tissue expanders placed and I can't bring myself to look at them so showereing has been interesting! Anybody else feel this way? I am not brave when it comes to wounds, blood, pain, etc. Some of you have been asking about the sentinel node biopsy. I had mine during surgery, with the injections ( 4) before surgery when I was awake and not medicated. I pushed for and was given EMLA ( numbing) cream at the site of the injections about 45 minutes prior. It helped. I did not feel the needle sticks, but it did s sting a bit as the dye entered. You'll have to arrange for this days before surgery as it's not standard procedure- at my hospital anyway. Original diagnosis was a large DCIS but pathology after surgery revealed microinvasions of ILC. Other \u201cgood\" breast removed was found to have ALH, a precancerous condition but now I'm glad I went through with it. I was having doubts on the second breast as surgery approached. I have a strong family history of BC. I joined a DCIS support group on Facebook but I feel kind of abandoned as I've moved into the \u201c invasive cancer\" category. Reading that kind of outcome before my surgery scared the daylights our of me too. I hope that I've found support here. It's so helpful to me to read everyone's stories. Best wishes!",
