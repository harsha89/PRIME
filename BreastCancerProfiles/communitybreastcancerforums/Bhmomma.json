But when this was added to significant family history, my surgeon referred me to a high risk clinic. I am now followed with twice yearly scans:alternating MRI with mammo, clinical breast exams and have been taking tamoxifen. I go to Memorial Sloan Kettering RISE program. Perhaps you can make an appt to a similar program perhaps at Penn or Fox Chase. Best wishes",

I am in Fairfield County and chose to go to MSK once my mammo/US showed changes they wanted to biopsy. I saw Dr Andrea Barrio for surgery and loved her. She sees patients in their Westchester County facility (which made sense for me as I work directly across the highway), but does surgery in NYC. Also I read you have concerns about the wire localization, but MSK (and perhaps Dana F) perform radio active seed placement and localization instead of wire localization. It seems much better tolerated by most.",
