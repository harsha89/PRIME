I\u2019ll definitely ask the doctor(s) about that. EastCoastTS - That\u2019s good to know that the scars can be in the fold below the breast with nipple and skin-sparing. That would be nice, especially since scars on my skin don\u2019t seem to fade well. Thanks for the heads up about nipple location. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re past the TE phase, your strength is good and the pain is not too bad. MTwoman, I didn\u2019t realize LE could happen with any surgery in the chest area, and that the risk continues over the years. I\u2019ll definitely ask about an LE specialist referral. What type of provider is that, maybe a physical therapist? I\u2019m glad the TE\u2019s were not painful for you and that you got feeling back with time. Meshell5324, Thanks for sharing your experience. It does sound good to have it all done with one surgery with quicker, less complicated recovery. So great that your strength, range of motion and skin sensitivity are good. Thanks everyone for being here for support!",

      "Content": "LL99LL wrote: (cross-posting from Breast Reconstruction forum) Hi everyone, I'm new here and I'd love to learn from you all about some things I'm trying to sort out. I'm strongly considering bilateral prophylactic mastectomy (w/ either DIEP, implants or no reconstruction). This is due to family history, a recent LCIS dx, increased risk due to genetic issue/possible neurofibromatosis type 1, and wanting to be around & healthy for my toddler son. Can you share your thoughts about the following? I think I'd be a candidate for nipple and skin sparing since no cancer has been identified at this point. But I've heard it also has to do w/ breast size? Any other factors to consider? I've heard tissue expanders can be really painful. Are they only used for implants? Ever used for DIEP? Have you asked DIEP surgeons what their failure rate is? (I think this means how often the blood vessel connections fail and some tissue dies?) What range of failure rate are you comfortable with? With BPM (no cancer yet identified), is there risk of lymphedema? Are lymph nodes ever removed? What are the potential long term problems resulting from BPM apart from appearance and lack of skin sensitivity? I've heard some women mention continuing pain even several years later, or long term loss in muscle strength even when abdominal muscle is not used w/ DIEP or implants\u2026 Can anyone with Kaiser in the SF Bay Area let me know what facility/doctors you had for mastectomy and/or reconstruction, and how you felt about them? (We can private message if you prefer.) Thanks so much for your help! LCIS diagnosed 10/24/17; ALH and sclerosing adenosis diagnosed 1/23/18 Log in to post a reply",

I\u2019m wondering since your mastectomy was prophylactic and you didn\u2019t have any cancer present, did they do a sentinel node biopsy or remove any lymph nodes? Did they let you know whether you\u2019re at risk for lymphedema? I\u2019ll talk to the surgeon about that but just trying to gather more info in the meantime. I\u2019m glad your surgery is all done and I\u2019m sending good wishes for a smooth recovery.",
