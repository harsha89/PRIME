Everyone, I'm sure, is aware of Memorial Sloane Kettering here in NYC, however, I need to know who the best surgeons are so I can help her plan a course of action. She has already spoken to a surgeon, but I need a second and maybe third opinion and the best hospital for treatment. I don't know if I'm asking the right questions but I do need help... my head is about to explode. We've been married for 33 years and we've both been as healthy as can be. Thanks!
