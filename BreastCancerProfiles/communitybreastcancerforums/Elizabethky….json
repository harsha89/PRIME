      "Content": "Elizabethky wrote: My best friend was diagnosed with breast cancer one year ago. She had a lumpectomy, chemo and radiation. The radiation was completed in Feb 2012. She is from one state but was in her home stAte 12 hours away when she was diagnosed and had her surgery and chemo there. She went back to her home state for radiation. She just came back home for a follow up visit with get oncologist. He said that her surgeon would like to see her in 6 months She says that the surgeon hasn't seen her since the surgery and she can't understand why he would need to see her a year and a half later. It will be a 12 hour drive. I have encouraged her to keep the appointment or at least call back to find out more about why he needs to see her. After all she's been through, I don't want her to miss anything she needs to do to stay well. Can anyone tell mr what the surgeon might be looking for so I can encourage her to go? Her main question is he hasnt seen her after a year so why come back in six months? Thank you! Log in to post a reply",
