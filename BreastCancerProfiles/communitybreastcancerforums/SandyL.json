Binney, I'm also glad you mentioned the itching could possibly indicate cellulitis.  I wondered if that's what it could be, but was hesitant to say since I wasn't sure.   Kritzy, I think my radiation oncologist and the technicians should have considered canceling my last three or four treatments. I wish I'd spoken up, because I think at that point my skin became damaged beyond repair.  My neck even has some permanent damage.  I can't wear necklaces any more; the chains chafe the skin and really bother me.  Some collars are the same way.  In my previous post I mentioned seeing my radiation oncologist when I started having pain about a year after having radiation.  I actually saw a different oncologist as mine had left the practice.  He was horrified when he saw how much damage I had.  I wonder if he would have done things differently or at least stopped the treatments sooner.  Oh well, what's done is done. Again, good luck! Sandy  ",

In your case, I wonder if your edema is actually lymphedema of your breast?  I have lymphedema in my left arm, hand, and fingers.  I'm not as familiar with lymphedema of the breast, but I know there are several women who have it who post on the lymphedema forum.  You may want to consider doing some research on it and post there as well.  Lymphedema is a nuisance, but it's better than a recurrence of your cancer.  Glad your rads onc was able to put your mind at ease.  Good luck!

First, what was on the mammogram that suggests possible IBC?  Second, if the surgeon you saw said you didn't have a lump or mass, why did he change his mind and decide to do a biopsy? I would ask him exactly what he plans to biopsy.  I would surely think he would want you to have a mammogram on your other breast before proceeding.  I would also think he would have an ultrasound done first, although I should add that I don't know much about IBC.  I do know it's usually very aggressive and harder to diagnose, but you should still have time to get some straight answers and feel more comfortable that you're proceeding in the right direction.  I would schedule another appointment and get more information and also ask if you should have another round of antibiotics to rule out mastitis first.  If the surgeon isn't willing to answer your questions, but insists on proceeding even though you're uncertain, then I suggest you find a different surgeon who will explain everything to your satisfaction.  Even though we tend to look up to doctors and surgeons, remember they are working for you and either you or your insurance company is paying them.  You shouldn't be forced to make important decisions like this when you're scared and still have questions. By the way, my first biopsy was in 1986 and I had regular anesthetic, but the second was in 2002 and I had twilight sleep anesthetic, which meant I wasn't put under as deep.  I could hear the music in the operating room and also hear part of the conversation, although I couldn't feel anything.  It was much easier to deal with and recover from.    My condolences on the loss of your husband.  I don't know how helpful I've been, but I wish you good luck as you deal with this and I hope it turns out just to be mastitis and not IBC. Good luck!  Sandy ",

My SIL has had several biopsies; they all turned out to be benign.  But they always check; they don't want to miss breast cancer just because all her previous tumors were okay.  I hope yours is simply scar tissue or benign and you don't have to join our ranks.   Regarding your kids, honestly I think I'd be as honest as possible with them.  Since they already suspect something is wrong, they're going to worry no matter what you say.  Perhaps you can tell them you have a lump in your breast that has to be checked, that it's probably nothing but the doctors want to double-check to be sure, and you'll be home a few hours after the surgery.  If you can stay upbeat with them it will help alleviate their concern.  Try not to worry too much (yeah, right!) and try to get some sleep tonight.   Good luck!
