I have had this horrible pain for some time. I just had surgery to weeks ago. The drilled out the bone marrow from my leg and put in a rod. To the Dr surprise I had  a broken hip. This was not shown on the MRI, nor was it shown on the x-ray. Now it usually does show on the x-ray. So I think I would  ask for an x-ray to see if you have broken something. I have had such relief from the pain. I would recommend a  2nd opinion like the ladies have said. Especially since you have good Dr's. At least it sounds like it. Dr's are not very tactful in the way they    tell us things. But you have the right to fire your Dr. and move onto another one. I was married to an alcoholic for 17 years. I am glad I got a divorce  it was the hardest and best decision I made. I am not saying divorce your husband I am just letting you know that I can relate. My 1st husband got sober for 3 years what a big difference that is. I am sorry you are having to face this along with your cancer. Hang in there you will make it. Fight hard and Blessings to you.

Dr. Seidel (surgeon) says I need to have surgery for my hip/leg on the left side. He will burrow out the bone marrow and some of the bone that the cancer has been eating away. Then they will place a rod in my hip and one down my whole leg close to my knee attached to two screws. I am lucky cause I have not fractured my leg or hip which is better cause I will not have to do a replacement. Surgery is an hour long, hospital stay is 1 - 2 days will be walking right away and out of pain. Is that amazing or what! I am not looking forward to another surgery yet I am looking forward to being out of pain and off pain meds. Thank you for your support and prayers",

I am more of a depressive. I  take cymbalta which is really great for depression, aches, worries, generalized anxiety disorder, fibromyalgia, and diabetic nerve pain. Amazing drug.I take tradozone to sleep, cause I can be up for 3 weeks with no sleep and then finally crash for 2 days. I take risperdal, and lamictal these are mood stabilizers. Chemo put me into menopause so the stabilizers have really helped. My famiy was really concerned being dx with IBC that I would get very depressed, cause of my past. My medications make such a difference it is the first time in a long time that I have felt whatever normal is. I wish you the best with your decision and hope that you find a medication that really works well for you. It truly can make a big difference. I do take alot of medication for my disorder. But I do recommend the cymbalta plus it is not in high doses. Which is really nice. It takes time for these kinds of medications to take effect. At least 3 weeks. I found cymbalta did not take as long which was another benefit. Blessings;Elizabeth ",

Having test is the hardest thing. The part of worrying. I worry about the cancer in my body spreading. It is common in IBC. I hope that things turn out for the best. Unique; When I was in surgery they found cancer when they removed the tumor and in my lymph nodes. I was surprised when I heard the tumor was so big. My onc told me it was about an 8cm. We had hoped the chemo would shrink it. It did not. It did cause the tumor to make a shell and harden. So the activity was contained just in the tumor. With IBC is comes in sheets and nest. My new found cancer was under the tumor close to my chest wall. Thanks for the positive words. Sorry to hear that you are feeling icky. That is never any fun. I hope you feel  better.

Just the government insurance would not approve it. I just did not understand it. I  told my husband I wanted to ask my onc to prescribe me another prescription of Emend just so I could give it to this man that has been suffering. I do remember I took my Emends as prescribed and became sick once I finished it. So the onc prescribed another prescription of a different kind of anti-nausea  and anti- diarrhea medicine to help me out. And it did. Thank God. I hope your next time is much better.

They give you warm blankets and pillows. They have snacks and drinks. They have lots of reading material and games too. I bring my own book though. I am not reading much though cause benadryl puts me to sleep. It took 3 1/2 hours. My husband was with me. Now lets see how I feel and what my SE's are going to be. That was the easy part.  I had rads done today also for the first time. They lined the machine up and off it went. I feel a little tender on my chest area. 29 more rads to go. Everyday at 10:00am. So far each time I have gone there for an appt or for the rad appt today they have gotten me right in. So I do hope this is the case.

Boy and do I love that feeling. Will not lie. love it! It is not easy to sit back and let others take care of you though it is something we learn while being on chemo and getting well. It all becomes so overwhelming we really do not know what to do with it all. I recommend you do your best to quiet your mind. Find some peace. Do something you enjoy like maybe read a book if you can't sleep. Watch a movie with the children, spend time on the computer. Ask the doctor for some meds to sleep and slow down your mind. Let your onc know what is happening with you while you are experiencing this hyper mode. If you do not it is going to kick you in the butt! You will finally crash and you will wonder what truly happened. Been there done that! I am glad that your husband is being helpful. It may not be in the mode or the way you would like it to be, but it is better than nothing. I appreciate everything my husband does for me. It may not be perfect and the way I do it is probably not either. The fact he is helping is a blessing. People care about you and you can come and rant and rave all you want. We are here for you.

So I need to watch for a rash and when my body experiences any pain to alert them. She does have 5 year survivors with IBC. She has treated 40 patients with IBC in 2008. So I am doing my best to take all this in.  My blood counts are all low and I have to go to the hospital tomorrow to get 2 units of blood. I know that is going to make me feel better. I had one in September and it made such a difference. I will be going in every week for my nuelasta shot until my wbc are better. I will be going in every 2 weeks for Arimist for my rbc.  Will be doing this until I am in a good place. No wonder I have been so tired. I have to go at 7 in the morning. That is so early for me.

I was dx the 1st time with IBC (inflammatory breast cancer) My tumor was 12.5 cm, I am also a TN. I did Taxotere/Cisplatin, Adrimycin/Cytoxan, Taxol/Carboplatin radiation for 33 weeks for one year. Then I was NED for a year and a half. Got dx the 2nd time with bone mets to the spine, left femur, left hip, left area of the pelvis. Did Abraxane/Avasting for 4 months and radiation for 10 days. I did Abraxane/Avastin every wednesday for 3 weeks and 1 week off. I have been on Zometa ever since. Which helped with the pain I was experiencing at the time. Then after 4 months I started to experience pain in my left femur/hip. So I had MRI, x-rays, CT's, another PET Scan. They said that my spine mets was gone and the lesions everywhere else was shrinking. So I was very please with the process. So after all the tests I did they found out that the cancer was eating away the bone marrow in my femur/hip. So I had to stop chemo cause I could not have surgery while being on it. They replaced my femur/hip. I was on morphine and percocet and during those  4 months I just experienced pain even on the meds.  They found out when they went into my hip that my hip was fractured. I am now on a cane instead of a walker doing physcial therapy 3 times a week. I went in for another PET scan on July 6th cause I had been off chemo it has spread to my lower back vertebra, pelvis on the right, right femur, right humerous, multi lesions on my liver to many to count and in my glands and nodes. I am now on Taxotere/Carboplatin. I do every  Wednesday for 3 weeks and 1 week off. I love my one week off.  I thought you are not allowed to repeat chemo's.  They are now doing Target Tumor Profiling. Which if the receptors are the same as 1st dx then you can repeat a chemo that worked for you. So this chemo worked last time and praying it works this time. Has  your wife considered a Advanced Breast Cancer Support Group or counseling? My Dr. has also put me on meds cause of depression. This my be something  your wife my want to consider if she seems to be going down that road. I have started to do both since my 3rd dx. It has been a much more emotional roller coaster for me this time. It is hard to even believe I am losing my hair for the 3rd time.  Remember that Stage 4 does not mean it is a death sentence. Though I know it is hard not to think about. I have done many things to prepare my family just in case. I hate even going there. My purpose in life is my family and friends. I am really sorry to hear that  your wife is having to face this. You sound like  a wonderful caregiver what a blessing that is for your wife. My husband is too. That is amazing that your wife is still working. I give her a lot of credit. I worked with children and my Dr. said I could not work because children are a germ factory and my blood counts have not been the best. I have heard wonderful things about M.D. Anderson. I believe you are in good hands. Do you have any children? If so how are they handling this? Do you have a support group for yourself? Are you and your wife able to talk about other things than cancer? Also for nausea and stomach upset ginger capsules are wonderful. You can take up to 3 / 3 times a day. If you take to many they can cause acne. My naturopath recommended them too. I would also ask your Dr. about Metformin. It is a diabetic drug and is working on women who are TN and shrinking the tumors. I know a lady from my support group that had a tumor in her brain a size of a baseball and it was inoperative. They put her on metformin and it shrinked it down to a pencil size. So please ask! This is about the Target Tumor Profiling.  This is probably not for your wife at this time but you never know if you might need it. http://www.carislifesciences.com/caris-target-now-patient-stories http://foodforbreastcancer.com/news/metformin-suppresses-metastasis-of-triple-negative-breast-cancer-cells Many Blessings to you and your wife, Elizabeth",

I miss my libido for we are a very intimate couple. It has not been easy, yet my husband has been very understanding and has stayed by my side no matter what we face with cancer. Cancer does consume your life and others around you. Be touchy feely, ask her if she needs her space. It takes awhile before the libido goes. I do not know how many rounds of chemo she has. I had 8 and right towards the end I lost it. I had surgery now I am going to have to do more chemo. I do not know how soon your libido cames back. I wish I knew. Read I lost my mojo. It is one of the threads here and the ladies have several ideas to help you out and what to ask your onc. I wish you the best. Be strong know this will not last long and you will be back to yourself real soon. Blessings, Elizabeth ",

Many relationships end poorly cause one cannot handle the cancer or disease that one has. I have been grateful for my husband as will. I had IBC and my tumor was 12.5 cm and they had to make sure it shrunk before they did surgery. It did not shrink it stabilized and did not get any bigger. They did remove it and I had a very concaved chest. I was not able to have reconstruction but found out that I could have a DIEP once I was NED and had been out one year from radiation. Now the cancer has returned to my neck, lower back vertebra, right femur, right humorous, right pelvis, cap of my right hip in my bones, and to many lesions in my liver to count along with my nodes and glands. I cannot do preventive care cause I am a TN and I have now started Taxotere/Carboplatin  like I did when I was being treated for IBC and it worked. Have Kimberly no she is not in this fight alone. She can beat it and anything is possible. Things can get done. Take it one day at a time and make the best of each day.  Fill it with some kind of joy even if it is for 5 seconds.

I hope that you find comfort coming here. I know that we will answer your  questions to the best of our knowledge and experience. Chemo now a days is so much better than what it use to be. My mother had colon cancer when she was 35 and is in remission now and she is 64. She is a remarkable woman and her prognosis was poor. They informed her to get her things in order. I had a chance to experience that and face things that my mother did. It was very humbling. Cancer does change us but we do see our lives more valuable. Life each day to the fullest. Enjoy what you are blessed with. I thank God each day for a new day and for giving me this day. You can make this! Hang in there lemongrove. We are here for you. I am glad that you found us.

There are 7 of the ladies in my bc group here from AZ going as will. I have always wanted to go to Napa Valley and taste all the wines and check out all the cellars. It just looks so breathtaking especially in the fall. We are going in September for our 9 year anniversary. In April in 2012 we will be going to Wisconsin to see the lighthouses and wineries along the Pensula. We have a balloon ride planned as will. Try all the wonderful cheeses. My husband gets a yearly bonus every February. We usually have to pay all kinds of debt off, For a change we are saving money and spending more wisely. We are going to be paying for an Alaskan Cruise taking my daughter Seleania and my son in law Joey. It will be our 10 year Anniversary. We will be renewing our vows. This will be in September of 2012. I will also in October be spending time in Connicet for my best friend's son Jason is getting married. I love the fall and get to see how beautiful it is. Arizona is pretty plain. Up north is a lot ncie and cooler. We are planning to move up there once my husband is close to retirement. That is in about 8 years. I hope to still be living and enjoying the life with my husband and family, and friends. I have one granddaughter and she is my cure. So very special and I do not want to miss out in her life. Who knows I may plan so other trips. Cookie always wanted to go to Tuscany looks so beautiful so you never know I could take you up on that trip. Make it a reality. Why not we only live once.",

If they caught it early then that is a really good sign. I am glad to hear that you have a great relationship with  your mom and she has the support she needs. Let her know of BCO it is a wonderful place to come too. Your mom will have to do the MRI so they can get a better deeper look at her breast. They will decide on what the best plan is to do. She may need a lumpectomy or a mastectomy, she may need chemo or maybe she will not. She may need radiation or she may not. There are so many and it really depends on the staging of her breast. I am glad that someone will be going to her appts with her that is important cause it is hard to remember everything that is being said all at once. May sure each day counts and make time for your mom she will need your support more than anything. I hope she only has miminal to do. That would be such a blessing. Remember that whatever your mom's age is then you need to get your done 10 years earler  your mammograms that is. Or you are to begin when you are 40. Take care of yourself as will.  Have a positive attitude and be strong for your mom and yourself. Remember it is okay to cry and break down it is not easy to hear the word cancer. You can always come on here if you need to chat or put something up on the discussion board. Wish     you all the best in this journey.",

They are free, have many things to offer and have professional counselors leading the group. I think it is wonderful to hear others in what you are going through. The online support group is good but I feel it is not as personal as seeing the person. I started a support group in 2008 here in AZ. I coordinate activities to do each month so that we are able to have fun. We go to coffee shops, lunch, musuems, tea parties, ornament exchange at Christmas, the spa, etc. It is wonderul to be with other women. I hope that you find one that is good for you.

I am sure it would be nice to have more income but you do need to take care of you. Make sure you are taking vitamins. If you need to sit down and things at home are not done in the timely fashion. Do not worry about it. Do one thing at a time. Just divide it up into small portions. So do the laundry, fold and put away the next day. Cook some meals and have some meals that are easy to do. Like crockpot  meals. Already done when you get home and left overs. As far as walking the dog. Limit the time you take her. It may be 10 min but that is better than nothing. Get the rest you need on the weekends. If that means sleeping half a day then do it. As far as work with the co workers. I think I would say something like.
