I am 35 now, dx in july, had complete double masectomy in August, stage 1-2 IDC. I checked into storing eggs first but at the price of $10,000 give or take, that is definitely not an option. My oncologists suggested I start taking injections of Zoladex each month to keep my ovaries shut down to minimalize damage from chemo. The only info I have found on Zoladex is that it is only for women that are ER negative. I am ER+/PR+ HER 2 negative. My oncologists say getting pregnant is extremely dangerous because estrogen increases and that's what my cancer loves. Has anyone experienced being ER+ and getting pregnant naturally and staying cancer free for many years? Has anyone taken Zoladex with chemo while being ER+? What was it like? Thank you so much for any advice!!! Sarah SD Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Saron1 wrote: Hello! First my shotened story. Diagnosed in July with IDC after feeling walnut-like lump on breast. Double masectomy Aug. 17 with 3 nodes removed and tissue expanders placed . 4 hours after surgery chest starting swelling at an alarming rate and they quickly took me back to surgery open me up and fix the vein or artery or whatever had that have been punctured causing a hematoma the next day I was sent home. 2 Days Later I realize that as each day went by I felt worse rather than better and my chest hurt more than anything I've ever experienced. It felt like my chest bone had been cracked open . I went to the doctor for post surgery follow up and they said that I was fine and it was normal to be in pain. Two days later I was admitted into the hospital with a severe infection and sepsis. The infection had spread to both sides of my chest and was so bad that they had to take out my expanders. They kept me in the hospital for six days on IV antibiotics and then sent me home with instructions on caring for my now nasty looking inscisions and some new wounds. There was a burn like circle of raw flesh on my left chest above the incision probably about 2.5 inches tall and wide. On the right side were scabs and a place with a lot of black and yellow on the incision. I was given care instructions that i followed to a T but my incision opened up, eventually into a three inch-long gash across my chest. It was really a hole and you could literally see my chest muscles in the back I was told to do wet to dry bandaging and tape guaze over it. I began to drain a thick yellow, sometimes green, sometimes brown discharge. It smelled too. The plastic surgeon, who is now in charge of this whole thing, said my wounds look fine and the discharge was just a little psuedonomas that will clear up with a little vinegar added to the wet to dry bandaging. The big Burn also started to Slough off yellow green brown gunk. Again the surgeon said it was totally normal I would be fine and I should be healed in 2 weeks. That was September 2nd. 2 weeks later and everything looked exactly the same if not worse. She said it was healing slowly but I should be totally healed in 2 weeks. Two weeks after that she said the same thing. And again. All the while I've been feeling like I'm just on the brink of coming down with the flu. Like my body hurts, my chest hurts, I get the chills but I don't have a fever, and I'm so extremely tired. Every time she told me it was just because my body has gone through a lot and I'd be better in 2 weeks. I finally talked to my oncologist who said that I only had a 12 week window where chemo would still be considered effective from the time of my very first surgery. He said I cant start until i am completely healed. I am at 10 weeks out right now and my burn has healed considerably but I still have a gaping hole in my chest now about an inch long, still draining thick green gunk. The plastic surgeon says she says she thinks I'm pretty much all healed and can start chemo. My onco says it's risky. I don't know what to do!!! I don't want to miss the window where chemo is effective but I also don't want to be in the hospital with a terrible infection again. I also don't understand so much about this whole thing. Like, where did this burn come from? No one seems to know the answer to this. Also, why is plastic surgery not concerned every two weeks when they see me and see that I haven't healed but assure me that I will be healed in two more weeks. Why does my body hurt and I feel like I'm about to catch the flu? Why won't this hole on my chest close up? How is it possible that my wounds look healthy when they're draining thick green stuff? At this point 2 months later, I'm posting hoping there might be somebody out there who could maybe give me some answers, advice, tell me where to look, or share a similar experience. I would really really appreciate any feedback! Thank you so much!!!! SD Log in to post a reply",
