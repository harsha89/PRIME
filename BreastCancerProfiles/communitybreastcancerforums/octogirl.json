After the biopsy (the same radiologist did the biopsy a few days later and called me with the bad news from that) I was immediately referred to bs, who scheduled me for a MRI before our first apt. That helped guide my decisions on surgery options.",

It was easily felt, but then it had probably been there a while, and I did have issues with nipple inversion (though not discharge) for a while before I felt the lump. I should have gone to a doc about it sooner than I did, so good for you for wanting answers. You deserve those answers, and the not knowing is worse than figuring it out! With your family history you should stay on top of it. Keep pushing for a consultation with a surgeon, or at the least a biopsy. The imaging center that did the ultrasound may be able to do a biopsy also; I'd follow up with the OB/GYN and ask for either or both (if and when you do confer with a surgeon, they would probably need to do a biopsy to have a definite answer to your questions and concerns, so if the imaging center can do it, that would be a good intermediate step, it seems to me.). I had the biopsy and a confirmed diagnosis before I saw a surgeon. Good luck to you and please keep us posted. Octogirl",

OTOH, if you really want to cold cap and your doc says it defeats the purpose, it might be worth getting a second opinion. My MO wasn't enthusiastic about cold capping because he didn't think it worked all that well, but I went with him anyway because the closest MO who did support cold capping was quite a drive away (I live in a rural area) and otherwise he's been a good choice for me. To be honest, I tend to be a minimalist about taking care of myself and I did worry I'd find the icing and cold capping to be too much trouble in any case..... for tanyam, I agree that discussing your concerns is a good idea. Your MO may suggest alternatives, but at the least they should hear and address your concerns. Losing one's hair is no small thing. For me, it was the worst part of chemo. My hair is back now (a lot curlier, and in my case, somewhat thinner), but it was still tough. The hardest part was the waiting AFTER chemo for it to grow back: that seemed to take forever!! I do regret not buying a wig. I thought I would hate wearing one, and maybe I would have. However, not wearing one (I used hats and scarves) meant that all my co-workers figured out what was going on, and I would have preferred to keep it more private from some of them. The best advice I ever got during chemo was actually from my MO, who told me he wanted me to live as normal a life as possible including exercising. I walked a lot and was in better shape than I am right now, and it helped a lot. Also, there are threads on this board about exercise during chemo, which helped me, and threads for those going through chemo. I recommend joining one or both for support, it does help! Sending hugs.

I even took two business trips during chemo! For me, losing my hair was the worst part, and it did seem to take FOREVER to come back, but come back it has, and it looks good now.

The beginning really is the worst for many of us. It will get better once you have a complete plan. As for the co-workers, my advice is to tell them as little as necessary (I didn't even tell most of them that I had cancer, much less that I needed chemo. I let them draw their own conclusions from the hats and scarves, but most never asked me about it)...anyway, it may be too late if they've already been told, but just start smiling and saying 'everything is fine' when they ask. Over and over again if necessary. It may help fend off the inappropriate questions. Other than HR if you will be taking time off work, and perhaps your supervisor, no one needs to know at work. I'd make exceptions ONLY for co-workers you are close to and/or those you believe will be supportive (but you should know that some people react in unpredictable ways to someone else's cancer diagnosis, so you may find that some folks are either more or less supportive than you would have expected). For similar reasons, I'd be careful about which family members you tell: talk with those who you think will be supportive or feel close to. You can decide who to share the news with, and when. Avoid google, at least until you have more information and a treatment plan. Much of the information you will find there is outdated. These boards are a better source of information. Find some threads that apply to you (folks having surgery around the same time as you, for example) and join in. Also, tell your doc about your anxiety and lack of appetite. S/he can prescribe Ativan or something similar for you to take when the anxiety is too much. And, the best thing I did: keep moving and exercising. It helps, even if you just walk around the block. There is a thread where we post daily exercise; you'd be most welcome there. Please keep us posted once you have a treatment plan. We care. Hugs! Octogirl",

While it is certainly true that the odds are more in your favor if you are younger, the fact that you are young, IMO, should be irrelevant in reporting U/S reports: the results are either clear or they aren't (if the U/S doesn't rule out bc, next step would likely be a biopsy), and if/when someone refers to your age when interpreting results, that (to me) is a possible red flag that they either haven't really looked at the results themselves, or aren't sure what they are looking at (and thus mention your age as a likely factor in the still not-fully-read results). I'd get the written results to your OB ASAP, and then follow his advice not to worry until/unless he worries... Gentle hugs and best wishes!",

Do you really care enough that you would risk increasing the lack of symmetry in order to assure that insurance will cover it? What if your doc is wrong about shrinkage from rads (which was the main issue I read in your original post, for the good breast). I also would be hesitant about lifting and reduction on the bad breast in the same surgery as the lx, because, (as is also pointed out here and was pointed out in the other post), until you have the pathology post surgery, they can't be sure they won't need to do more surgery to get clean margins. One question you haven't addressed that I saw, however, that I think might make a difference in your decision: where on the breast is the tumor? A golf ball size area is going to show up a lot more in some locations than in others. As I believe I said on the other post, I am large chested (40DD bra size), and my tumor was twice the size of yours, and they also had to remove the nipple. Obviously you can tell that the nipple is gone (the oncoplasty made it look better but it still isn't a nipple), but even without clothes I can't see much if any difference because most of what they took out is on the bottom below the saggy part (the scar is underneath the curve of the breast for the most part.) And no, I don't give a damn if my breasts sag. I'd rather have sag than any more surgery than necessary any day of the week. Now, if lx had no been an option (and I was originally told that it might not be an option because of the nipple issue, until my bs made the oncoplasty suggestion) I would have taken mx with no reconstruction. I went for lx not for looks but because it was less invasive surgery and my surgeon, who I had confidence in, was confident about doing it (and it all turned out great). Could a plastic surgeon who knew what they were looking for tell the difference? Probably, but I frankly don't care. And it sounds like you don't care either. So, my advice, FWIW, stands: If you are confused you should get a second opinion. If you don't want a second opinion I think at the least you should ask your surgeon: \"I really don't care about higher or lifted breasts. Does that change your opinion as to what I need?\" \"Why or why not?\" I think you need to keep asking questions until you aren't confused, whether you ask them of this doc or another via a second opinion (or perhaps both). And frankly, I personally would be reluctant to put my surgical care in the hands of any doc who thinks they know what I'd like want cosmetically unless they first asked you what you would hope for and then explained the options. Just my two cents and continued best wishes! Octogirl",

I did have one co-worker say, \"I like your hair style...is it intentional?\" which I found a little bit intrusive not to mention odd, since she works on the same floor as I do and certainly has seen me in hats and scarves for several months (though we don't work together closely). Maybe she was just feeling nervous, because when I answered, 'unfortunately, no' she said something about how she was about to undergo something similar...I have always liked the woman, so going to reach out to her (the moment in which she said all this didn't feel like the right time to talk, since there were lots of other people around at the time). Sort of long story to follow: For some reason, though, I STILL have an aversion to going into my favorite grocery store hatless....the aversion was so bad during active chemo that I had hubby do all the grocery shopping even though I really like to grocery shop. Mostly, I worried that I couldn't avoid my favorite checker, and I didn't want to tell her I had bc or for her to realize it: she is the sort who would make a fuss and look at me with pity and tears in her eyes. It just seemed like an effort to have to deal with that. So, I started doing the shopping (in my hat) again about a month ago, but I would actually go into the store and figure out if she was working before starting my shopping. (I fully admit that this is weird). Anyway, last week I did the shopping, didn't see her, but sure enough she started checking just as I went up to check out. However, it was pouring rain out, so wearing a rain hat was perfectly natural. She commented that she hadn't seen me in a while; told her I'd been busy...had a nice chat. Come back this week in same hat, but the rain isn't coming until tomorrow and it felt a bit weird to wear it. I wore it anyway. So, at the door, there are two women talking, one clearly had lost her hair to chemo: I'd say she was probably no more than 4 or 5 weeks PFC,and going hatless and seemed perfectly comfortable. I didn't say anything, but did think to myself that she was a lot braver than me! Anyway, I do the shopping, ready to check out, sure enough, favorite checker is the only one without a line. She starts checking me out, we are having a pleasant chat (as we often do/did before chemo, and by the way, one of the things that makes her a favorite is that she can check faster than anyone else there while still carrying on a happy conversation in which she remembers details about stuff we talked about months ago!). But then, she asks me if I know XX, a woman who works for my employer..and then starts talking about how she saw XX earlier in the day and she is 'fighting breast cancer' (I hate those words, btw. It isn't a fair fight!) and was wearing a wig, and hadn't been in the store in a while and she knew something must have been wrong when she didn't see her and.. etc etc... Was she trying to tell me she knew what was up with me while being polite? Or just completely clueless? and frankly, did the Universe really have to put a damper on what had been a lovely day up until that point, by reminding me that bc is all around us: not once, but twice in one shopping trip? Sigh. Either way, I am happy that I am leaving town Saturday of next week for various work and fun trips and hubby will have to do his own shopping for a while. Perhaps by the time I get back my hair 'cut' really will look intentional. Octogirl",

I knew losing my hair would be hard, but I would never have guessed just how hard. Starting to feel like myself again, and that is SO nice! Octogirl",

Can't answer the color question, as I've never colored my hair.... Ran into a long time work colleague at a conference I am attending, who I hadn't seen in several years. Although we live on opposite coasts he does know me pretty well because he is good friends with a woman who is a close friend of mine, and we've hung out together at many other meetings, but still, he didn't recognize me with the short curly hair!!! Such a weird feeling to see the awkwardness when I said 'hi sweetie' and went to give him a hug and he didn't know who the hell I was...then to have him ask when I cut my hair....sigh...his wife has had bc and went through chemo, so you'd think he would get it, but he didn't (I did tell him), which perhaps I should take as a good sign that my hair is past the 'cancer girl' stage!

I honestly can't remember steri-strips after my biopsy, even though it did bleed more than usual afterwards, so there must have been something on it. Whatever it was, it didn't last more than a day or two. You probably don't need to be concerned or worried, unless it starts bleeding a lot or becomes red or inflamed. I just had steri-strips on my knee after staples were removed following a total knee replacement, which is a much bigger scar than a biopsy. I asked doc when to take them off or what to do if they fell off, and he shrugged and said, 'they will fall off when ready, and if they don't, you can just pull them off in few days'. So, I wouldn't worry too much. Deep breaths, and you can check with your doc on Monday. Hugs! Octogirl",

This is new growth. but even if these hairs grew out to be ten or twelve inches long, I'd have bare scalp, that is how far apart they are...it certainly doesn't look like the pics you all post, in any way. I know, I can hear some of you say, ' wait a minute: you have new hair? Then why so impatient?' The problem is, I've not heard anyone describe it coming in the way mine is, and it scares the hell out of me that this is all that will come in: hairs here and there, but not a head of hair, if that makes sense. I am afraid to buzz the only hair I have, but I am worried it is preventing more from coming in, though I don't see how it could be. I have some hairs that are as long as 1.5 or even 2 inches, but there are still lots of smooth, shiny bald spots, where hair is not growing at all. Thanks for your encouragement. Octogirl",

I will admit to a bit of false pride about it)...so it is all relative. It does look like its old color in back, but I am still convinced the front will grow in grey. But, even if it does, PARTY TIME!!! I have hair!!! Woohoo! :-) Duzy, I am still wearing hats and scarves (mostly hats). I never did get a wig, which I sort of regret. Didn't realize how sick I'd be of hats and how wearing them all the time, even in winter, makes me feel like 'cancer girl'. However, my plan is to go hatless as of March 1...not long now! Octogirl",

Rain, consulting a salon person might help you get more used to the idea of shorter hair....I am thinking it is time for me to go back to the woman who cut my hair, even though it was already short...maybe a trim will make it look more like something I did on purpose...

How awful! Sending lots of hugs!! I know exactly how you feel about the conference: I am going to one in two weeks, and while a few of the folks who will be there have seen me in the hats, they haven't seen me hatless or scarf-less. To add to my anxiety about it, I am giving two presentations. Ackkk!! I am not normally nervous about public speaking (I probably do more than my share of conference presentations) but I am starting to get really nervous about standing up in front of 100 or so people with such short hair! Fortunately, one of best friends in my profession is co-presenting with me, and she has been wonderfully supportive, and she does hate public speaking...so we can support each other and get through the presentation...My advice is to hold your beautiful head high and ignore anyone who acts like a jerk. I will try to take my own advice as well. It is hard, I know. I remember when MO and I were first discussing chemo: I told him I had a big scuba vacation to Cozumel planned in May, and asked if I'd be well enough by then to travel and dive...he told me he saw no reason why I could not keep my plans (Yay, Mexico here I come, in less than two months!) and then he said, 'and by then, you should even have your hair back, to help you enjoy your vacation'. At the time (back in early September) I thought, 'really? It can't possibly take that long. He must be exaggerating how long it takes..' Well, he was right, of course. It is a very slow process. I feel so much better now that I can finally see it for myself. I hope none of us ever have to go through this again! xoxox to all Octogirl",

It is hard to get used to the new me, even when others tell me I am looking good. So, two weird and uncomfortable hair related events for me today, that didn't help: First one: a woman who works on my floor who I have never met, came to my office today to introduce herself. Ok, at first I thought she was just being friendly, but then she said, \"I wanted to introduce myself because I love your hair. It is so cute. I've been following your progress as a cancer survivor, and you seem to be doing so well,\". and of course, this was said from the doorway in a loud voice, so anyone in the vicinity could hear her... First of all, thanks a lot for the suggestion that maybe I still look like 'cancer girl' and not like a woman with a cute pixie cut. Second, I really think it is rude to assume that the hair loss was due to cancer and to state that out loud. None of her business, and she shouldn't make that assumption. Indeed, there is another woman on my floor who had to shave all of her hair last year before brain surgery for a neurological disorder that had NOTHING to do with cancer (I only know this because that woman is a friend of mine...I certainly heard no gossip about it around the office, even though she wore a hat for several months while it was growing back)....And then there was the saying it so loudly. Like I wanted to discuss my health with this total stranger and everyone in a cube near me. GRRR...I thought it was very rude and it made me feel self conscious. Second, the wife of a co-worker stopped by the office and said, \"Oh your hair is so short...are you going to keep it that way or grow it back again?' This woman is a sensible person and I even wondered if she had no clue as to why my hair was so short....which would be a little weird since her husband knows what is going on...I just shrugged and said I hadn't decided what length I wanted it and then changed the subject...but it was very uncomfortable. What makes people think that commenting in this way is ok? (In this instance, I suspect her husband, who was present at the time, may have had a conversation with her later: I know him much better than I know her but she and I do sometimes socialize together....so I'd hate to think he didn't clue her in. But who knows...) It all sort of reminds me a bit of being pregnant: that time when people think you are public property of some type and it is ok to touch your belly and ask you personal questions. Only worse. People really are rude and a bit strange. I am glad to have this forum to vent. Hugs, Octogirl",

Objectively, I know they are cute, but they are different, and I think maybe all of us may feel sometimes that we want what we had before back again. At least I do. I did have wavy, thick hair before, but never curls like this. Well, actually, I did: when I was three to five years old. I think of my current hair as 'baby hair' (It is a LOT thinner and finer than it was before, which my hairdresser also commented on). This is why my gut tells me it will eventually revert and that the curls might go away: I just have to get through the baby hair first. I will say, on a positive note, that it was never grey, and it started to come in with touches of grey (see the 4.5 month pic) but as it gets longer, the grey is also going way, or is less noticeable. At sixty two years old, I will take it. Actually, I will take the curls too. Just grateful to have them! Hugs to all; Octogirl",

Mine was not nearly that thick at 15 weeks PFC (I do have pics back a ways on this thread). Hang in there all. I just came across a pic of me taken just before I lost my hair, and it is so very different now: it had wave and thickness before, it isn't as thick now but is so much curlier. The curls are a bit out of control: I really need a trim, just so busy that I've let it go a little too long. As soon as Thanksgiving is over, heading in for what will be only my second cut post chemo.... I get a lot of compliments on the curls. Saw a relative I hadn't told about the bc, and hadn't seen in several years, she said she loved my new perm and hair do. Didn't feel like getting into it, so I just smiled and said thanks. The truth is, at first I hated the curls, for no reason other than that they were a symbol of chemo. However, over time, I've realized that they actually are nice, and that a lot of women pay a lot of money to get this type of result (from a perm). They may eventually flatten out, but for now, I am starting to embrace them...... Octogirl",

As I think I've mentioned, my skin problems didn't really start till last day or two of treatment. Definitely got worse. I now have two raw patches. One is on the bottom of the breast which is tough since I am large chested, and it rubs against the chest constantly. I am folding up a cool cloth and inserting it under my breast to avoid skin on skin. that helps, and of course since I am large chested the cloth stays in place. The area around the snb incision is also very dark and raw in one spot. looks about the same as yesterday though I've been told it could continue to get worse for another week. The good news is that it hardly hurts at all, not even enough to need OTC pain medication. I use aloe and Aquaphor. Have been debating whether to call RO, but since I am not in pain and it doesn't look inflamed, I don't think I will unless it doesn't seem any better by Tuesday. Honestly, I just want a quiet three day weekend, starting early, without any docs! (my attitude that it isn't worth calling about may be an indication that it is getting better?) I have cabbage in the fridge and going to try that tonight! Certainly couldn't hurt. I have heard from a few other women that the skin issues can be quite painful so am glad I don't have bad pain, at least. I am still hitting a wall in the evening. Hubby cooked dinner last night and the night before. He isn't much of a cook but last night he made chili using my recipe, and it was very good. The only difference between his and mine is that it showed up about 8 pm, instead of 6:30 or 7 as I prefer (he gets home from work later than I do, and is slower in the kitchen.) So I napped, woke up and ate, and then fell asleep. But I am NOT complaining. Yay for the small things! Thr_y: feel free to PM me if you ever need a virtual hug or more suggestions. Wishing you good luck and easy sailing! Re: supplements: I am taking Biotin in the hopes that it helps with hair re-growth (and either it is working or it is all in the timing, as the hair is starting to come back. Slowly, FINALLY.) It is also supposed to help with nails which chemo messes up. I am also taking rx strength Vitamin D, prescribed by MO. That's it for me. Hugs to all! Octogirl ",

I am just weird that way). I have had to be fairly insistent to convince the (mostly male) techs that I actually prefer to be naked from the waist up. (on both sides). But they get it now. Besides, if they are going to see the 'bad' one, they might as well see the 'good' one, right? Anyway, I imagine they'd bring you a blanket if you let them know how cold you are. The other thing I've done is wear my favorite and very warm knit hat all through treatment. It is totally outside of range, and no one has told me to take it off, and remember that you lose a lot of heat through your head (especially those of us without hair :-( ). I think the hat makes a big difference, maybe you should ask if that is ok for you. The only time I had issues with numbness in my hands or fingers was during sim, perhaps because of the longer time frame, but I do have issues with my shoulder hurting and even feeling slightly frozen and difficult to move after treatment. It happens to be on the treatment side, but fairly sure that is just coincidence: it is the remnant of an old rotator cuff injury and just doesn't like being in that above-the-head position even for a short time. I've been doing stretching, which doesn't seem to help too much but yesterday I took an OTC NSAID an hour or so before treatment and that did help...or perhaps my muscles are getting in shape. Indeed, one of the techs commented how quickly and easily I sat up after treatment: she said I must have strong ab muscles. Hah!! That's a joke and I told her she probably says that to all the girls :-) : but maybe they will be a bit stronger before this is over. One can only hope, right? Hugs, Octogirl ",

Getting you into just the right position takes at least as long as the radiation itself. I am working full time during rads. However, because of the type of work I do, the workplace is shut down for ten days at the end of December for the holidays. This is great timing as the hardest part for me has been carving out time when I am at work to drive the 40 mins to rads, have the treatment and drive back: now that I am off work and enjoying the holiday until after the New Year I feel much more relaxed. However, if I lived or worked closer to the rads center, that wouldn't be an issue for me. We are all different, so you will have to see, but my experience thus far has been that only the distance I have to travel to treatment and the varying treatment schedules, with last minute changes, have been an issue with work (not the actual treatment).",

Basically, a wet suit works by holding the water next to your skin until it warms up, and that keeps you warm. In theory and in already warmish water: the water in the California Pacific can be as cold as 45 degrees (brr...) and when it is that cold, most divers, especially older, wimpy diver like me, go to drysuits: which work by keeping all of the water OUT...and then have a mechanism for pumping air in as insulation (along with thermal underwear worn under the drysuit...). So, unless my drysuit leaks a bit, I will technically be following doc's orders to stay out of the 'pool' (as we divers sometimes like to refer to the ocean :-)) Octogirl",

My skin got worse for almost two weeks before it got better; I had peeling and some oozing, especially on the underside of my breast. But now it is fine (three months out). The area under my arm looks to be permanently tanned, and I noticed yesterday that it does look a bit odd in a bathing suit since that area shows a bit. However, since I am not much into sun bathing at all and usually put on some sort of beach coverup when I am not actually in the water, I doubt if anyone will notice. In any case, I am heading on vacation in three weeks, and bathing suits will be in order. I have at least four (as a scuba diver, bathing suits are an essential piece of clothing :-)) So, once I land in Mexico, a trip to the market to find a new cute coverup for those times in the hammock will be on the itinerary! :-) Sending good thoughts and gentle hugs to all. Edwsmom: I wanted to mention that I didn't not find rads as emotionally difficult as chemo, but I can tell you that now that I am several months out from either, I am starting to feel much more whole. Hang in there. Octogirl",

This is the third (or is it fourth? I've lost track) time I've been rescheduled on short notice. At least this time they gave a reason: they said they had some 'special case' that was going to take a while they had to do in the afternoon, and they wanted to get me in and out before that as they were afraid otherwise I'd have been there quite late. And fortunately, I have the next two weeks off of work so after tomorrow I have much more flexibility with scheduling. They did give me apt times through NYE Day... (4 per week since they are closed for Christmas and NYD); we will see how those times hold up in their schedule book..... and then, they came looking for me to give me: 100% aloe, a personal robe, AND written instructions on what to expect, what to do and not to do, what I could wear and not wear, etc. !!! The staff member who gave them to me said she looked for me yesterday to give it to me 'so you could have it before you started' but just missed me... (? Ok, but I am thinking to myself... yesterday was treatment number two! ). I am with you, Linda: I don't get why it is a big secret until the day before...why not give it to me at the sim? oh well, I do like and trust the RO...and the staff seem to know what they are doing on the technical side. They could use a good office manager though. Still, so far no SEs, so I can't complain too much! linda, hope you get more info from the surgeon, and good luck to all! Hugs Octogirl",

My consultations with him were as follows: met with him for an initial consultation where we discussed the treatment plan. Then, during sim, he came in, said hello, looked at what they were doing, asked if I had any questions, and confirmed the number of treatments I'd be having and that he'd see me weekly during treatments. Then, on Monday (the day I saw him each week), they took me into an exam room, took vitals and updated my medical history, and then he came in, looked at the breast/treatment area, told me about my weekly X-rays, reminded me to keep putting aloe on it, and asked if I had questions. Honestly, everything went well and there wasn't much to ask him, but he did say hello, goodbye, made sure I had no questions, and even said 'Happy New Year' on New Year's eve.. :-) I will see him one more time, in a little over a week, for a one month follow up. Honestly, though there were occasional scheduling hassles, the techs were so nice and helpful and rads so uneventful for me that it probably wouldn't have bothered me if he hadn't been approachable, but he was (I did have some fairly significant skin issues/burning and peeling, but they didn't start till after Rads were done....I never bothered to call RO's office about the issues however, since I am healing quickly.

I had specifically requested the Canadian protocol (wanted fewer visits, wanted to be done sooner!), and when my MO referred me to the RO, he said I should go with RO's recommendation but that he wasn't sure I was a candidate because of potential skin issues and the size of my breasts (apparently, it is more indicated with small chested women because overall area dosed would be less, thus reducing skin risk). Neither MO nor RO said anything about chemo as a factor but RO also said that he was worried about increased skin issues with shortened version due to the higher doses. So, RO did a sim based on 16 treatments and than ran it by the full Stanford radiation board before starting, which ok'd it (He is Stanford faculty/affiliated). Given the Stanford rads board expertise, I am confident that it was appropriate to my circumstances. As it turned out, I did have some skin problems, but I'd still have chosen it over longer version, especially given the distance I live from the rads facility in a semi-rural area. (The skin issues were manageable, and once I started healing, I have healed quickly). Duzy, I did use the cooling towel before I had symptoms, particularly to prevent skin-on-skin contact on the underside of my breast. I didn't use it religiously, however, and that is where I had the worst skin issues. Probably should have rolled up the cooling towel and worn it there every day. (As I said, I am large chested).

I am an octo(pus) girl, water is where I live! :-) Alas, BS, MO and RO all agreed: no pools or hot tubs during chemo or rads. I am going to cheat just a bit this weekend (shhh....don't tell). In honor of the New Year's I am going to jump into the Pacific with some dive friends. However, as a concession to both bc and the water temps, I will be wearing a drysuit. A drysuit does just what it sounds like: keeps you dry. The only part of me that will get wet is my head and face (will have a hood, but it doesn't keep the head dry). So, not too much of a cheat. Can't wait! (won't be diving; just swimming around with a mask or snorkel to get the feel of the water...) I did want to mention one strange thing that happened yesterday: I started to feel a high level of anxiety right in the middle of the tx. My heart started pounding, and it took every bit of my self control not to jump off the table. For some reason, I didn't feel 'right' in terms of placement. Haven't had that problem at all before, hope it isn't an issue today. Going to try visualization also. Hugs to all; Octogirl",

I have no idea which is actually the case (if either) but I can tell you all that I have relatively dark skin (for a white girl :-)) that doesn't easily burn, and before rads started my RO was very concerned about SEs, and told me I was at high risk. He didn't really fully explain why, but I did have healing issues after the Lx surgery which was a factor. and so far, so good. RO said my skin looked 'wonderful' when he did his exam on Monday.... My guess is that it could be like everything else we experience: very individual. Tiffany, good luck! Just remember how nervous you were before chemo, and how that turned out relatively well.

      "Content": "Dec 7, 2015 12:49AM - edited Dec 7, 2015 12:51AM by octogirl Hi all...good to see some of my chemo sisters joining this group! Sandy, I was actually told something somewhat different about the three vs six week: My RO said that it was overall (large: I am also DD) breast size that was the concern, not tumor size, because more radiation would be needed to cover a larger area (though I suppose that could also refer to tumor location and area since my tumor was located just below the nipple at six o clock and was just over 2cm...I wonder if I missed part of what he said or misunderstood?) and his concern was primarily with increased change of infection/skin irritation with the larger dose of the shorter protocol. He also mentioned the fact that I had skin problems post surgery as a concern, and noted that he might put me on a prophylactic antibiotic partway through rads. However, after measurements and sim (now scheduled for Monday) he will run it by the Stanford rads board since he is on the faculty and affiliated and will give me the overall board's opinion, since I had told him I really hoped for the shorter option......I am comfortable following their recommendation as a board, especially given that Stanford (and this RO) are big proponents of the Canadian protocol when appropriate. Either way, I am glad to be FINALLY starting (with Sim) Monday! I will be working full time. However, my work pretty much shuts down between mid December and the first of January, so will have about ten days off in the middle of it. January will be busy, however, so hope I am able to continue full time. I pretty much worked full time during chemo except for fusion day and the day I crashed from steroids each round (day after chemo was always a great work day thanks to steroids :-)) As I have mentioned, I think, it is 45 mins drive each way, no public transportation available, but no snow either. Rain and fog can be an issue here, though rain hasn't been a big issue the past few Decembers thanks to our on-going drought; we'd all be thrilled to have that problem, fingers crossed for rain, actually. And I will be doing the drive in a brand new car I decided I deserved and bought with rads as an excuse... :-) Right now, I just want to get started. I am much more anxious about my hair (when WILL it come back?...) than rads. I hope it goes well for all of us! Octogirl",

However, you seem to have been informed as to the *reasons* for schedule changes and delays... I have had two even just during the sim and initial starting phases, and in both cases they either wouldn't or couldn't tell me why: even though in one instance they called me at 5:15 pm to cancel an appointment scheduled at 8:30 the next morning! Under those circumstances, it would have been nice to at least gotten an apology for the inconvenience, if not a reason, but all I got was \"we need to change the appointment\"...not even an \" we are sorry\" . In the most recent instance, they did call on Thursday to change a Monday appointment, but no reason was given other than 'Doctor asked us to change it' (talk about crazy making, and I think it is fairly obvious that, while no one told me why I was being changed, it wasn't a machine breaking down if they were calling me on Thursday for a Monday change). Again, not even an acknowledgement of inconvenience when I pointed out that, given that it is a minimum of 40 minutes drive each way to my appointment, that changing an appointment from 4:45 pm on Monday to noon on Tuesday makes a huge difference in terms of whether I can work during rads. If they had just cancelled and kept my expected appointment at 4:45 pm Tuesday it wouldn't have been any big deal, but they told me that 'wasn't possible' without explaining why (I had been previously told that while my schedule would be finalized for the next few weeks at the Monday apt. that I could expect the appointments to all be late afternoon since that was my preference and the late afternoon time frame was their least popular....). I only missed a few days of work all during chemo, and already it appears that I am more likely to miss work during rads than during chemo, even though it is supposed to be easier physically. Thanks for letting me rant about this. Frankly, when I mentioned it to the person who called me about the changes, she just didn't seem to understand. Seemed downright confused about the concept that it is hard to work FT and have last minute changes to a schedule..How could I possibly be the first person who has to work for a living during rads in this practice? If it happened again, I'd be tempted to switch ROs...but that is the other problem: they have you over a barrel in terms of service: once started, switching really isn't an option, especially meaning how much of a delay there would be to find another RO in my area where they are rare, get consultation apt, sim done, and all the rest, even assuming insurance would pay for another sim at this point. Stuff happens. I totally get that. But the response to 'stuff' happening is what makes all the difference in terms of one's patience and one's confidence in the provider. Edited to add: when I read this it sounds harsh. Maybe I am being a bit harsh. But damn it, no one ever even said they were sorry for the inconvenience, much less gave a reason for the changes. Sigh.

I still didn't get much info about what to do and what not to do (no one has said ANYTHING about gels, or aloe or any such, so I figure I will just listen to what others recommend on this board unless i have problems...the techs did show me a board that they project my information on for each rad, and there is a place there where I am supposed to rate my pain level each day...ok...but what if I have itching?..) But I am NOT complaining, because the RO gave me the great news that the Stanford radiation Board reviewed my sim stuff and models, and recommended that he go with the 16 day version, so he is! So happy! He did point out that if I do have problems he can always scale back, but I am hoping all will go well, in which case, 1 of 16 done! Woohoo! They did give me my appointments for the next three days, and they are late in the day as I prefer. Easier to blend with my work schedule. Of course starting next week I am on vacation for two weeks.

It isn't visible when I am standing or sitting, though it is presumably visible when I am lying on the table. I slept with a cool cloth tucked under the breast, and will show it to techs today. RO saw me yesterday, but I didn't mention it because I didn't know about it: I didn't notice it till last night, because of the location, and because of the fact that it doesn't hurt or itch, just looks like skin is breaking down there. RO didn't notice either, but he didn't do a very complete exam. This is probably partially my fault for telling him that all was great and that I've been having no pain, no itching and no skin problems. Lesson learned for others: check the hidden areas (for large chested women), and be sure to put plenty of the cream there too.....and the cool cloth is something helpful to buy (for Lindy and others wondering about preparation: I didn't find I needed it after each treatment, but I find it helpful to prevent skin on skin contact now.... Still no pain or itching though, so I am cautiously optimistic that I will be done with minimal SEs... Octogirl",

At the time, i was really worried about my hair coming back, but eventually it did come back, and with more curl than before. It looks good, though it did take me a while to admit that to myself....chemo itself was no fun, but it was definitely doable. I worked all through the process. And the best advice I got was to keep exercising during chemo: it helped tremendously even though some days I didn't feel like doing more than walking around the block! I've had more permanent side effects from the AIs than I did from chemo for sure. AIs probably hastened the inevitable knee replacements I've had due to osteoarthritis (have had both knees replaced). I had a full cardio workup before my knee surgery and know that my heart is fine, which I worried about... As others have said, you might want an oncotype or mammaprint test before making a final decision, given your profile. Also, I noticed you are supposed to start rads right away: just fyi, most MOs want to do the chemo before the rads, I believe. Best wishes to you. Octogirl",

The only other thing I had was a machine they put on your legs after surgery to massage and stimulate them to avoid DVT (which is a significant risk after TKR). Sorry, can't remember what it is called. I can tell you that I asked to have it removed early because it was annoying and noisy and kept me awake (which they did do per my request). One tip I can give you since you are discussing IVs etc with your doc: I urge you to consider an epidural for your anesthesia. I had it with both surgeries and it was GREAT! I believe it is lower risk than a general (they also sedated me heavily and I was not conscious during the surgery) but most importantly: when surgery is done and you come out of sedation, you are still numb, and the numbness lasts for about a day. That made recovery SOOOO much less painful, especially in those first few hours. Best of luck.

For this reason, I wanted the Canadian shorter protocol, as I planned to (and did) work through radiation, and doing all of that driving back and forth especially in winter (heavy, dangerous fog is an issue around here in winter) just did not appeal..I just don't drive that much (my work commute is 4 miles, I could even walk it if I were ambitious). When I asked my MO and RO about it they expressed doubt as to whether I would be an appropriate candidate. However, my RO, while still in a small town, had an affiliation with a large center (Stanford) and said he would run it by the entire Stanford Rads Board after doing the sim, getting x-rays, sharing my charts with them. End result: the board gave their ok to the shorter protocol and we did it. I did reasonably well, but I did have rather bad skin peeling and burning. I was amazed at how quickly it healed once rads stopped, however. And, even with only three weeks of awful driving, I decided that it was as good an excuse as any to treat myself to a new car...:) So, I agree with those that recommend you seek a second opinion at a NCI Center if at all possible. Knowing that the experts at Stanford were on board with the decision gave me peace of mind. Octogirl",

I generally took Wednesday as a sick day and worked from home Thursday of infusion week, back in the office on Friday, and while I didn't take any calls I will admit that yes, I answered work email during infusion....I didn't worry about catching 'bugs' (though I washed my hands frequently and had nuepogen shots, and my counts stayed in normal range), but then, my chemo was really before cold and flu season (it was in the fall). I even traveled for work twice during chemo; once was just a short day trip; when I had an important three day conference three hours drive away that would have been hard to miss, the day after an infusion, I went, but had hubby drive me and come along just in case, after making sure that the conference hotel had a fridge for my nuepogen shots (taken for five days after each infusion; that is the other reason I brought hubby along: he did a great job of giving me the shots, I couldn't have done it myself. It wasn't hardship duty for him, the conference was at a lovely locale by the ocean). I did fine at the meeting, including making several presentations, just got tired at night and skipped the networking around the bar. When I started chemo, my MO told me he wanted me to live 'as normally as possible', and encouraged me to keep working if I felt up to it. He also encouraged me to exercise through chemo; best advice I got. Staying active really helped. A note about the steroids: yeah, they gave me energy, but for me at least I found that while I thought I got a lot accomplished while on them, when I checked my work the following week I usually redid it. Also, co-workers told me I talked a whole lot :-) So, in truth, I wasn't very productive on them. I had a real love/hate relationship with those steroids. (Never got nauseated except one time when I ate a large serving of very, very spicy dan dan noodles after an infusion. probably a mistake though they tasted good going down.)",

Are you feeling them as lumps but doc sees something else (and apparently something not concerning to doc?). And I can't imagine not checking out new lumps (at least and unless there is some explanation as to an underlining condition causing them). For what it is worth, my opinion is that since doc doesn't want to see you but your questions haven't been answered, it is time to get a new doctor! I can't imagine staying with one who 'didn't want to see you' and didn't answer your questions. A second medical opinion is definitely warranted. If it turns out to be nothing, you will have peace of mind, and if it is something, you don't want to wait. Listen to your body. Since you have no family history, you might ask about genetic counseling as well. Good luck to you! Octogirl",

      "Content": "Jul 23, 2015 11:26AM - edited Jul 23, 2015 11:26AM by octogirl based on what I had read on these boards, the part of the Lx that I was dreading the most was the wire insertion, dye insertion, etc. My worry wasn't lessened by the fact that while the tumor biopsy went ok in terms of pain, I bled from it A LOT and bruised quite a bit. My tumor was right under my nipple (which was removed during the Lx) so it was in a particularly sensitive area. I mentioned my concern to bs at pre-op and was assured that lots of lidocaine would be used. I mentioned again in the radiology room before radiologist started the procedure for wire insertion. He again assured me that he'd use lots of lidocaine and said bleeding from this procedure tended to be much less than from biopsy, but that he appreciated that additional information. And, as it turned out, they were right and I wondered why I had worried so much. The mammogram guided wire insertion went just fine. No pain or discomfort at all other than the initial prick when they shot me full of lidocaine. In fact, the radiologist kept saying 'you might feel some tugging or pressure now'...but honestly, I didn't even feel that. All I could feel was the nurse holding my hand :-) The worst part was that the same nurse who held my hand was the chatty type, bless her, and I just wanted to tell her to shut up so I could just breathe (but I didn't, she was sweet and meant really well, and her chatting was quite annoying but didn't hurt, and pain was my fear!_ As for the dye, the bs did that herself after I was out on the operating table, so that wasn't an issue either. I still don't know what EMLA is, but whatever it is, I didn't need it. Honestly, my advice would be to TALK to your Treatment providers and tell them what you need to be comfortable! Once I was told that there would be lots of lidocaine, I had no intention of letting them do ANYTHING before that lidocaine took effect, and that worked for me. It could save you a lot of anxiety and worry to talk with them and ask directly what to expect and what they will do about pain.",

In any case, my recommendation based on my own very limited experience, regardless of whether EMLA or a shot is used is to let the provider know the concern up front and be sure it is addressed. Dont get me wrong: I feel strongly that we should be actively involved in our own treatment, but I don't think we should have to always take the lead either. I suspect we are all on different parts of that spectrum. Gentle hugs to all!",

The best support I got was from these boards. I encourage you to join a thread of women going through chemo in the same time frame as you...or even start one yourself! All the best, and keep us posted. Gentle hugs! Octogirl",

Now, two years later it is slightly thinner than before, but still thicker than many if not most women my age...and quite curly rather than just wavy. just a few strands of grey, otherwise basically same dark brown as before tx. It looks and feels soft and healthy. Objectively, I have come to realize that it actually is probably the most flattering hair I've ever had (I get a lot of compliments) but it has taken me a long time to come to terms with the fact that it is different. Now that I am finally happy about it, I am starting to see some indications that the curls may be loosening and going back to my former waves....",

Personally, while I had moments of forgetfulness, I found tiredness, anxiety and sadness/depression to be much bigger factors in not feeling like myself than the typical 'chemo brain' complaints. I did work all through chemo, only missed about four days of work, in an intellectually challenging job. Some of my most productive days were the three or four days after each treatment, thanks of the steroids... But speaking of steroids, my doc tells me that the steroids are actually what causes most post-chemo vision problems, such as cataracts, rather than the chemo itself. Chemo can provide temporary vision issues (blurriness etc) that resolves after chemo. I did and still do use artificial tears frequently, which helps. Good luck in your decision; Octogirl",
