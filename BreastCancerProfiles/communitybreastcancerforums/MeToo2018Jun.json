Well mine started after the second cycle and had since been back to the ER for signs of infection. Chemo was postponed after my hospitalization and switched to a different regimen(Taxol +herceptin). Well, I had days of fever, chills and body pains after the first infusion so once again having a holiday from chemo. My scar wound is healing but a new wound is starting. All tests results while in hospital shows I am having an infection but they were not able to find out the cause. I was given an antibiotic. Wondering what would be my next regimen, and if anyone else hadsimilar experience. I am also contemplating on getting a second opinion. Appreciate what you can share. Log in to post a reply",
