I did my simulation with it as well as lung and heart scans. It wasn't horribly uncomfortable but I'm asthmatic and a bit claustrophobic so the mask (sort of like a snorkeling mask) didn't thrill me. As it turned out, I ended up in the 50% that will NOT receive IMRT but the traditional method. I'm okay with that as I am doing my best \"Let go and Let God\". Ace, I'm coughing too and am also asthmatic as mentioned earlier. It is a dry cough and it scares me because they did see some spots on my lungs during my diagnostic process. I will discuss with my rad onc tomorrow, let me know what yours says. So, I'm 3 down and 27 to go - YIKES! Oh well, so far, so good.

It fell out dark brown and coming back salt & pepper but I actually get a lot of compliments on it. It's long enough that it needs to be combed after a shower or it sticks out by my ears! My brows are growing back. I think my lashes still need some time. Nancy D: That's horrible news about work. Makes me appreciate the fact that I have not gone back. I feel guilty about it but I worked way too hard during chemo. I'm not recuperated enough from surgery. I hope your boss will have a change of heart and get you some help. Finally, I found a wonderful book that you all might enjoy. It touches on so many things we talk about, work, emotions, etc. It is titled \"After Breast Cancer - A Common-Sense Guide to Life After Treatment\". It's written by Hester Hill Schnipper, LLCSW, a oncology social worker who battled and won two rounds with breast cancer. Her husband is a medical oncolgist. Her words justified some of my feelings. I think the book will be even a better resource once the treatments are over. Have a great week. Praying for you all and counting on you to not run away at the end of the month when I start my rads and have zillions of questions. You will probably be thinking \"Jane, we have already answered that question\" and I will blaim my chemo brain. I'm going to milk chemo brain as long as I can. Jane",

Met w/a plastics guy today. NancyD, you were right, I have a lot more options than I realized. He is also willing to do the surgery as soon as mid-January if I am up to it. I cannot decide which option to go with but I have time. Sharon: 7-10 days for my prosthesis. Best of luck to everyone this week. Love and prayers, Jane",

Anxious to return to a life that doesn't revolve around cancer treatment. I will still have Herceptin in my port for 7 more months but no more chemo or radiation. I pray that we all heal.

Still receiving Herceptin. My onc seems to concur with many of yours, no sans, no tests. He is relying on my primary care physician to be cognitive of aches, pains, illnesses that might signal a spread. Well, that's not working out. She and more particularly her staff, don't seem to realize they are dealing with a stage III cancer patient. I'm switching to the large university where my cancer was treated. At least there, my primary care physician will have all my records at her fingertip. Deb, the treatment your received from your infusion nurse is horrible. Mine have been so very kind and since I have been visiting them for nearly a year now, I'm getting to know many of there fairly well. Someone told me when I started treating to bring them donuts. I do try to bring them some sort of treat each time I go, cookies, cakes, donuts, etc. Not sure if it helps and of course, we should not have to do that but they treat me like a queen. I told my friends I couldn't complain about infusion, they bring me food, things to read, cover me with warm blankets and turn on my TV. I don't get treated that well at home! They even had a Christmas stocking for me this year. Hope I was not intrusive jumping on your board. I'm searching for post-treatment or close to post-treatment support. I'm struggling emotionally with getting back to a normal life and needed to find like souls. Love and Prayers, Jane",

I was a bit surprised that they were so timely. I was home and resting comfortably (thanks to drugs) by 4:00 pm. Best of luck. Do you plan to have reconstruction later? I hope to. I have to get through 6 weeks of radiation. I had my chemo prior to surgery due to the size of the tumor. Prayers for all of on this journey. Jane",

I mourned the loss of my breass but primarily because I fed my beautiful children with them.   Not a great weekend. I have an infection in my incision site. I think it started in the drain site but spread to the actual matectomy incisons. Very painful. High temperature off and on. Anyone else experience this? I can't find anything in my books or on line about it. I went to an urgent care pursuant to the surgical resident on duty Saturday. Thankfully, I see my own physician tomorrow.

I should not be such a complainer because I truly have been blessed but here I can let my hair down (well, if I had any I could). Drains out-yipee. Unfortunately, I thought it would immediately make my life so much easier. I still have to sleep on my back. Infection from the incision sites is getting better but Keflex is playing havic with my body. I thought I could stop taking pain medication - it's been over 2 weeks since my bi-lat. I can't. I'm still in pain. I'm going crazy being at home away from a job I love. Hubby is back at work (teacher). Washing my hair is not an issure for me either thanks to chemo. I have some thick stubble but my hair fell out black at age 49 and is coming in salt and pepper at age 50. Yep, I celebrated the big one right in the middle of chemo treatment. Oh well, I guess I can dye it. Maybe I'll go blonde! Friends and family are doing a great job taking care of me but I don't like being taken care of. Today my sister-in-law is cleaning my house. Amazing how many little things we do around the house without even thinking. Love and prayers for all, Jane",
