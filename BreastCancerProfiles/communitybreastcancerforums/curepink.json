My mom had breast cancer in her left side in 1993 when i was 2 years old and she had a surgery to remove her left breast back home(developing country) but they didnt do any chemotheraphy or radiation after the surgery. They didnt even put her on any medication. Then we came to Canada in 2001. In 2008 she was having pain in her left arm and later we found out she has lymphedema because of cancer in her left chest wall area which was blocking one of the lymp nodes and her left hand became so big. She seen a oncologist and he put her on to tamoxfen. For year and a half she was doing fine  with no side effects but she was having pain because of lyphedema and the cancer didnt spread anywhere. In 2010 she had another tumor in her armpit and the doctor changed the medication to letrozole. After she started this medication she was having alots of pain in her lymphedema hand so we went to the emergency and they told us she is having blood clot in her hand and they put her on innohep syringes. She takes them everyday. The tumor under her armpit opened up and she was having discharged and because of this a nurse would come and do dressings for the wound. Then we did do a bone test, chest test and a x ray to check if they spread to anywhere else and they all came normal. And the oncologist suggested we wait 3 months and see how the (letrozole)medication is doing and if it dosent seems working we would have to do chemotheraphy. Two weeks ago she was having another lump in the middle of her chest so we went to the emergency and they said it could be cancer in one of the lympnodes. So now the oncologist told us she would have to start on chemotheraphy next week and he told us he would put her on DOXORUBICIN and CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE I.V. I am so worried about her. If someone out there that had same problem or used the same medication please help me out i need some experienced person's advise. Or if anyone that used these medication please let me know how did they work for you, any side effects, etc.. ANY INFORMATION WOULD BE HELPFUL. i would be waiting for your responses.
