I work in a school and started telling my coworkers who helped spread the word. That kept me from having to personally tell everyone which was hard emotionally. The way I look at it, maybe someone will get a mammogram after hearing about my dx (I found out the day before I turned 41). I also have lots of offers of help and support which I will need as I face a dmx next Friday. This is a personal issue. I didn't feel it was something to keep secret, although others feel it is personal and don't tell. I wanted/needed support to get me through so I told. Do what's best for you. Good luck!",

I had a previous problem from another surgery and told them how sick i was. They gave me a patch to wear behind my ear, a block which numbed the breast area and other meds through my iv. I had no nausea after this surgery. There is pain afterwards but if you stay on top if your meds it's very tolerable. The waiting was worse than how i feel now. You'll get through this. Good luck.",
