I think your onco might meant no surgery. that I can understand. we had similar tumor, 0/4 nodes, gr3, er+pr+ her2-. My tumor was 1.9cm. Now I have cancer in lymph node. I had 4xTC, if I still have treatment, why u can't? I think u need find another MO too, at least get second opinion. Try to stay positive, I know it's hard. I'm in the same boat. But worry can't help anything. Only make me panic... Is your cough getting better? Thinking about u.",
