I waited a week...yep, still there. Made appt with gyn. Yes, she feels it also and makes appointment with breast specialist. She said it almost felt like a ridge. I didn't even know what that was. I had my mammo that day. It came back inconclusive. Nurse calls and gyn wants me to have another mammo and us before appt with breast specialist. I have them done. Today I have appt with breast specialist which I now know is breast surgeon....so glad I didn't realize that sooner. She does her own ultrasound. She can feel and see the lump. She says she also sees a dilated duct. I have stayed off Dr. Google so I don't know any questions to ask. I am scheduled for a biopsy the next morning. This afternoon nurse from gyn calls and tells me 2nd mammo and us are normal. By then, I had been on Dr. Google and knew to ask for BIRADS. She says 2. I tell her that I am having biopsy. So now I don't know what to think. I'm praying B9 since BIRAD 2. But, have bc in family history and lump is palpable to everyone. Gyn also did genetic testing but not back yet. Thanks for letting me vent since I can't sleep.  ",

There is definitely a lump and almost in the exact same place as last year. Last year I found a group that was all waiting together..... anything like that this year? Log in to post a reply",
