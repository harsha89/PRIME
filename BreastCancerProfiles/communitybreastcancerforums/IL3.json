My mother by the blessing of god, strength and great doctors when i was small (age 2) was diagnosed with thyroid cancer which two years later due to poor treatment at that time (the 70s era) progressed to bone cancer. Luckily enough she was placed in the hands of some great doctors (RIP they have passed on) they saved my mothers life and 34 years later she is still here with me. So I do understand the miracles of medicine, cause now thinking back on what my life could or may have been and turned out like without her I am glad God spared her for me if for no one or nothing else. I believe because of her rare case at the time she made it into the medical books for the prognosis and treatment of that cancer. Well, life has brought adversity to our door once again. After some years of misdiagnosis by some doctors she saw when the symptoms of her current cancer started, and a lack of insurance due to a stupid choice made by my father to remove her off of his insurance to gain more money out of his pension I finally got my mother insurance and she has been going to the doctors now. She has been diagnosed with Paget's disease of the nipple and they have found a lump in the breast which has been diagnosed as cancerous. Stage 4 to be exact. They are saying it has spread with spots showing in the liver, and there hasn't been a ruling out of the lymph nodes yet. They are planning to start chemotherapy and possible radiation to follow after or before surgery (mastectomy). I am sooooo worried because unlike when i was little she was young and stronger to put up the good fight, I worry about what her chances are and just how long she will have if the treatment is successful to kill the cancer within. I am reading information here and also have a concern about some of the medicines she may have to take that could conflict with her heart and thyroid medications. She is all i have and I'm not giving up but I just can't lose her. I haven't given her a grandchild or had the opportunity to share the things in life I figured i had more than enough time to do. The reality is too harsh, crying as I write this now. Please I know you all in the forum can't create a miracle but in prayer it can make that miracle that much stronger and real. I'm so mad at my father for not keeping her medical security in place because if it was there when it was earlier on in the symptoms maybe it could have been cured and not at the stage it is in now. Help, advise, support from anyone here just might help me to see this situation with a positive outlook that i can then extend to my mother. Log in to post a reply",

It gives me a sense of peace knowing that I have a community to share my thoughts fears & feelings with. It really means a lot. I won't as I have in the past not direct any anger towards my father out of respect that he is my father, but I must say I am grateful & proud my mother modeled me into the man i am today and not him. I could never have made such a decision being in his shoes in regards to my spouse considering her long term condition. i know he may have his reasons, but to me it just isn't valid enough to stand on its own. But that is not the problem that faces us now, just the past that helped create it. So, I will be there for her the whole way and see us through this in every way I can. It's funny because when i went to the doctor as always with her today, and the nurse was changing her bandage I was trying to assist her since i do it at home for her and the nurse was telling me to stop trying to take her job and was asking me if i approved of her work LOL. God Bless all of you brave and courageous women who have went through and are going through their own battles with this nasty disease. I pray not only for you and myself but with you. I pray that one day Cancer in all of it's forms and the causes that bring it into existence internally will be conquered. Thank you again.... IL",
