Scares me too, but I've had to kind of set my mind in that place that it is coming out sometime soon, no matter when- and there is absolutely nothing I can do about it. It is what it is no matter how much I hate the thought of it. So best to just get myself prepared and attempt to prepare my close friends and loved ones around for what to expect. Let them know how much it bothers you so hopefully they will be super supportive and sensitive to your feelings. ‚ù§Ô∏è Ware- what a lucky girl! So sweet of your man! Leydi- I'm planning on getting a wig for sure, but definitely want to get some hats/scarves to wear also when not at work. I also hate the ears in/ears out thing. Looks weird either way on me- plus I have glasses that need to go behind my ears! Let us know if you find any good options. I'm still searching! Good luck to everyone receiving their treatment today and peace to those dealing with SEs. ~‚ù§Ô∏è",

Drank lots of water the day before,chemo day and today. Hoping that will help with SE.'s. Also drinking ginger/green tea with lemon to keep tummy calm. And started the tongue scraping, mouth rinsing routine. Salt & bk soda , switching up with a Mellaluca alcholfree mouth rinse for the minty freshness! ;) Was very tired after yesterday but still haven't gotten a good nights sleep in days. My Neulasta patch went off at 7 pm tonight with out a hitch or a leak! Was so worried I was gonna bang that sucker off on a doorway or something. I'm clumsy like that. Phew! Btw, my chemo nurse recommended Aleeve for Bone pain. Anyone have good response with that? (I'm already doing Clairitin Still feeling ok tonight(day2). Hope to get a better nights sleep, but had to take the last of the steroids today, so who knows! Been so stressed about the days ahead and what SE's are going to get me. Really don't want to miss work , but I realize I probably will at some point. :( Thanks to everyone sharing thier brave hair photos! You all look strong & beautiful! Nottheboss -- I say the same thing about the moustache & chin hairs! Lol Nayda-- I read that tea tree oil mixed with some coconut oil is used for that nail SE. Please check dilution rate and how often though. Angelaks--- how scary ! It was my first chemo today and they gave me benedryl, 2 nausea bags , Pepcid, and steroid before the Perjeta and HTC. Now I'm not sure if I will always get all that or just first time. Hmmmm Have a great rest of your weekend everyone! I think we may see the sun here in Jersey. Yay!~‚òÄÔ∏è",

Something else I'm doing (on my own/not told by dr) is oil pulling. You can google if unfamiliar. Swish/pull coconut oil through your teeth for about 15 mins then spit out and rinse with warm water. Supposed to pull out toxins, bacteria while also moisturizing. I figure this can't hurt! They also said to buy some cheap soft toothbrushes and replace your tooth brush every day so you don't keep reinfecting yourself. My chemo nurse said that they tend to see that the people that get thrush, likely get it every time they have treatment. üò© Also for neuropathy ( haven't had this yet) , my dr recommended 10gr of Glutemine powder 3 x day for 4 days after treatment. Add the power to cold things like drinks, pudding or smoothies, never to hot food or drink. I also take a super B complex vitamin. I would also love some hydrating ideas. I ended up going in for IV fluids 2 days this week. Nothing tastes good with this thrush. I did try some all natural fruit Popsicle's--they were great. I tried adding fruit to my water, every tea I usually like tastes like BLEH right now. And coffee gives me more diarrheal. I really miss my coffee!! I did a blend of lime seltzer water mixed with coconut water yesterday . That was ok for something different. Beebs-- thanks for the Accupuncture update.

      "Content": "Oct 19, 2016 04:10AM - edited Oct 19, 2016 04:21AM by HopefulYogi Hi everyone. Sorry to hear about the port problems , scheduling problems, cdiff issues, vision complications , 3 periods (!) and all these other thing that you guys should NOT have to be dealing with right now. So frustrating - like the cancer is not enough? Sending hugs to all. ‚ù§Ô∏è I took the plunge on Saturday ( my day 15) and had my hair buzzed (#5). I was scared to do it, but more scared to watch it come out slowly (or not fast enough) over the next week. Some one at my center recommended a fabulous salon and stylist that takes care of women and children with cancer - completely for free! I had a consult 2 weeks ago with Marino Cartier ( you may have seen him on HSN). My daughter went with me and we talked with him about the color and style I would want. He said it would be in in 3-4 days and I could schedule the buzz and wig styling at my convenience. He did recommend doing it sooner rather than wait til it starts looking and feeling bad. So on Friday night , I went to a big family wedding in my still intact very own hair, so I looked like myself and felt comfortable and had a great time. The next morning , my daughter was home from college , so she and my mom went with me to the appt. wasn't sure what to expect, tears emotion , regret???? Actually I felt very empowered , like I was taking control of something for a change in this shitty cancer deal. So since my daughter has a dry , but funny sense of humor (she's 22) we actually ended up smiling and laughing and having a very positive experience instead of a traumatic one. Even my 82 yr old mom who is usually a bunch of nerves and emotions... Was smiling and laughing along with us. Not trying to insinuate in any way that this ordeal is easy, simple , minor or nothing to stress about because it is! I just wanted shareeexperience for those that are dreading this phase, that there are many ways to do it. Martino Cartier has two salons in Jersey http://martinocartier.com/about.html If you know anyone in the Jersey areA - I would highly recommend him. He made us feel very special. He gave his time,products, special hairbrush for the wig, revitalash and his skills for free. I of course gave to the charity \"Friends are by your side\" that helps women and children with wigs for cancer. Felt truly blessed with that experience‚ù£http://friendsarebyyourside.com Martino recommended gently washing with gentle shampoo and massaging the scalp when it's sore, because that means the hair is trying to push out. Also what I have been doing is massaging my scalp with either avocado oil or jojoba oil for dryness at bedtime, Here's a couple of pics of the big buzz... My daughter requested the Mohawk look for fun...he obliged ! Having a really good week ! That will end Friday with chemo# 2. WIsh I could be more certain what to expect! So I know if which days I will need to take off ahead . Oh BTW, I am scheduled to do the LookGood Feel Good seminar on Nov 16, the closest one available. I'll be needing ALL tips and tricks. Hoping I even still have lashes and brows by then! I'm Wearing the wig to work with the kiddies, but ready to yank it off when I get home . I wear classes and it gets tight around my ears. Trying out a few bandannas, hats and scrves too. Gonna mix it up. I scared the day lights outta myself when I used the bathroom in the middle of that first night!üò¨üò≥ Good luck to every one dealing with treatment, decisions , s/e's and everything else, stay strong!!!!!!!",

Seq24 , the guy I got my wig from trimmed it up a little for me - bangs and around the face. He said I could use a curling iron or a straight iron (up to 335 degrees, I think) if I want to. He said a blow dryer will give it a lil more uuumph if it needs it. He told me to call or come back if I need anything. He gave me a certain brush with it ( Wet Brush Original Detangler) And said the most important care tip is to brush it at least 6 times a day! He said he would be able to take one quick look at me an be able to tell if I've been brushing it enough or not. ?? We'll see! My regular stylist also told me she would help me out with styling if I need it. Maybe your regular stylist could help you out. Good luck! It's very similar to my normal way of wearing it but just a little longer and a lot fuller. My normal hair is real thin and fine. It's also more the original color of my hair. It's been going gray for years and I color it, but since I'm so gray it always fades out much lighter. I love this color \"sable bronze\". It's a Raquel Welch wig. How sexy, huh? ( for those of you old enough to know who she is! Lol) I've got to call ACS again, I called once and spoke to someone, and they were supposed to have some one locally call me back about a wig but never did. Good to have another option.

My first round of chemo, I lost my voice. I thought it was a coincidence with allergy since I'm prone to laryngitis in allergy season. I also had thrush with first chemo. Finally got my voice back after 2 weeks. Had second treatment on Friday and by Monday My voice was gone again. No thrush or mouth sores. Went in for hydration today. Been rinsing mouth / gargling with warm water & bk soda along with Biotene. Try to drink tea with honey & lemon as much as I can. Normally love that, but chemo makes me hate it now. My chemo pre meds are Emend, Aloxi , benedryl, Pepcid. Anyone have any thoughts on the chemo laryngitis? It's definitely better than the other SE's that could be dogging me right now, but it does make life difficult when you work in a classroom of 20 kindergarteners with out a voice! Thanks.",

Once every 3 wks - 6 doses total. I scheduled it on a Friday thinking I'd have the weekend to recover, but from what I've read on here, sounds like I may be feeling it even worse on Monday & Tuesday! Reading the side effects on here and how quickly they come on and how severe is really freaking me out! Getting my port put in on 9/22. Probably getting my hair cut shorter that night too. Freaking out about the hair loss tooüòß. I've always hated myself in any kind of a hat/scarf. I work with 5 year olds so I'm thinking I should definitely be proactive about the wig and be ready. Don't want to scare the youngins. I'm actually going to an appt out of town tomorrow that happens to have a wig shop nearby, so I plan to do some try-ons. A lil hesitant to buy one online. I've been learning about and experimenting with essential oils this past year. If anyone has tried any oil concoctions for your side effects, I would love to hear about it. I will share any of mine as I go along as well. Just read about the tea tree oil for nails . Do you Start that at same time as chemo or only if you notice changes in your nails?? Thanks Also curious if anyone goes to treatment alone - drives themselves?? I have been turning everyone down that has offered to go with me because I didn't want anyone to have to take off work and sit there with me for 5 hours. One friend would absolutely NOT listen to me and has already put in for the day off.( feeling loved üòä). But just wondering if it is realistic to drive myself??? Thanks for reading. Big love to all of you that are currently suffering from these dreadful side effects. May you soon start feeling some relief. ~‚ù§Ô∏è",

You have so much to deal with everything else going on- so not fair to have something like that go wrong.üòü I've always been a healthy person, until now, and never had to deal with Drs much. I am amazed at how much direct phone contact I have with my Drs. They call me personally in the evenings to give me test results and such. Is this how it is for everyone? My husband had esophageal cancer 15 years ago and I handled all the \"business\" end of things : call Drs , making appts. I don't remember ever speaking on the phone to any of them personally. And everything seemed to take so long...to get appts, test results. I'm just amazed at how swiftly and efficiently everything is happening for me and how in touch the Drs have been. Thankful for th little things, among the big scary things. Bet wishes to everyone having treatment and fight s/e's. Stay strong! ~‚ù§Ô∏è  ",

I may be exaggerating a little , but it's the best description I can come up with. I haven't really heard or read any one else describing it that way. It's more than just a bad metallic taste, it's almost like certain flavors, esp salt just kind of \"pings\" off my tongue. Weird. It lasts anywhere from 4-10days.

Just got the call that all 18 nodes removed were NEGATIVE! So relieved! Can't wait to get this agrivating drain out, but feeling even better about dealing with that after hearing that news! I have my follow up appt with the surgeon next week. I started taking Femara about a month ago. Already feeling some pain in my knee when going up steps, but is not constant. I got heavily into yoga a couple of years ago and it really helped with arthritic and degenerative pain In my knee , hip and lower back. Not looking forward to having all that come back again! Hopefully, yoga will continue to help against the Femara. Have had some anxiety and insomnia issues also since I started taking it. But I was also dealing with nerves from the surgery I had ahead of me, so not sure how much was caused by that or the Femara, or some of both. I am sleeping a little bit better since surgery. I have radiation ahead of me for 6 wks after I am healed from surgery. One day at a time... sending healing thoughts to all!",

I follow seq24 closely because we are the same time frame. Looking great, seq24! I love seeing everyone's waves and curls! I'm 6mo PFC but still have about 3 more Herceptin infusions and I am taking Aromisin, which are probably slowing my growth. I'm posting some pics because 1. I'm fristrated with how much scalp is still showing thru . 2. How straight and baby fine it is 3. I don't know what do do with it so I wear a hat all the time in public. Gave up the wig when school got out in June. Too hot and humid in NJ summers for a wig! I am using Jamaican black castor oil w/peppermint massaged in my scalp over night and take biotin and numerous other vitamins. Does anyone have a good hair styling product to suggest for trying to do something with this awkward hairdo? Gel, mousse? Brands? How-tos?

My hair is starting to grow in (8wks PFC) but I still plan to wear my wig for a while because it's got a long way to go. My natural hair line is lower than the wig. So particularly on the sides of my face I can already see the silver glittering out from the brunette wig. And also next to my ears. I assume I will also have this problem at the top of my forehead when that starts filling in. I guess I could try a different wig but I'm not really feeling like going out and buying a new wig now that I'm hopefully growing my own hair back. It's not really long enough yet to color I don't think. Any ideas? Thanks",

She said when I was ready to try that type of thing out- I could purchase a variety of them, try them all at homeand return any that I didn't like. I was getting ready to leave on a beach vacation where I'd be wearing a hat all week so I told her I'd be back to take her up on that offer at the end of the month. Just wanted to share that in case anyone wanted to check with their local shop and see if they could get them to offer that. I'll let you know how I make out and which one I like best. ",
