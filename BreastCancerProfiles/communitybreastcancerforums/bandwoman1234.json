The bad part was I only had four treatments left. Anyone else have this happen? The first day off felt like a gift and then day after day of postponed treatmentsÂ felt very disappointing. Hopefully it will be up and working next week. Has anyone had this happen to you for so many days? Hopefully it won't make a difference in my outcome.
