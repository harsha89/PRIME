My PS said the implants had attached to the ribs and had to be scraped off, I am 9 weeks post surgery and like you my chest feels tighter and tighter. I hate the way I look, and the way I feel, but I have reached a point where I just don't now what to do. I see these pictures of women that have done the diep flap and I just don't know what to think.",

I had four treatments of what they call the red devil and Cytoxan, then 12 treatments of taxol. I did take the Neulasta shots with the first four treatments, they recommended that I take Claratin so that I didn't get the muscle aches but I could not tolerate it so I took Benadryl and it worked just as good. I also used a clear polish called Nail Replinish that I got at Sally's and it worked great. The best advise I can give is drink lots and lots of water, I drank at least eight glasses a day, it really makes a difference. I used the Aquafor, but like you I really didn't care for it. Aveno works well. Best of luck.",

I do not know why my PS decided to go bigger because I was adamant about staying the same size and I could never understand why I was going through so much stretching if I did not want to go bigger. I even asked what size and shape was he going to use and he said he preferred the round smooth and something in the 400's. Three weeks after I was given a card saying I had 500cc put in. After doing some research I find that this is really big for a small person like myself. I am barely five foot and weigh about 125. I have complained about the pain which is only getting worse and he just ignores me, he is only interested in doing the nipple reconstruction and that is all he talks about. I finally told him that as long as I felt like this I was not going to do nipples when I am considering taking these out. He just doesn't get it and I am done with him. On a scale from 1-10 my pain level is about an 8, some nights a 10. I think as these boobs drop I feel the skin pulling and stretching and yes they feel like they have spread out under the arms.

I am trying very hard to hang on because truthfully I don't want to get a PS in this area. They are all pretty much with the same hospital and circle of doctors. I personally feel that most doctors tend to stick together. I want someone that wants what is best for me and will tell me the truth. Call me crazy but you know your own body better than anyone and my gut feeling is that something is just not right. I feel like something is rubbing around the edges, with a burning, chaffing feeling. Like when you have a bra that rubs you, only this is not my bra this is on the inside. The day that I had my exchange my PS was running very late, he rushed me through the marking and then into surgery. He also took my port out while I was there and when I got home I was amazed at how awful the incision looked where he took out the port. When I brought this up he just blew me off and said it was no big deal. The surgeon that put it in never left a mark, you could not even tell where it was and she was not even a plastic surgeon. Then he gives me a card that says I have 500cc implant, Wow was I surprised. Hopefully you can understand why I do not trust him.",

After being diagnosed with breast cancer, chemo, mastectomy followed by reconstruction surgery my oncologist felt I should have a gyn and I agree. I really liked her and we went over the problems that I am having with my implants, the iron bra feeling and the muscle contractures. The first thing she said was that she thought my implants were too big for the pocket they were in. I couldn't believe it because this is what I have been saying all along and no one would listen to me. I was already scheduled for PT and she told me that this was a good idea, and that I should give it at least six months to a year, but if I am still having these problems then I should consider having the implants removed and replaced with smaller ones. While I am happy to hear this I am also concerned with the cost. I asked her if my insurance would cover this and she said that could be a problem. Has anyone else been through this and what did you do. At this point I am so miserable most of the time I am ready to do most anything to get relief. However I must be realistic and consider all things.",

She asked me to give it al least 6 months so at the end of November if I am not doing any better then I am going to find another PS and get a second opinion on how to proceed. Perhaps I am just dreaming but I feel that if a PS is going to take on breast cancer patients he or she should have some type of protocol that addresses all these issues, instead of treating us all like we all fit into one box.

I did not feel any better after the implants were put in and I politely told him that if this was how it was going to be he could just take them right back out. He finally decided to give me some muscle relaxers and this did help, so I stopped taking them, only to have the pain come back. When I went back for my follow up I told him this and asked that he refill the muscle relaxers to give me a little more time to heal. He informed me that no he could not do this because he wasn't into just handing out drugs and that this was really all in my head because I could not accept that these were not real breasts. Keep in mind he only gave me one prescription and let me suffer for two months with no drugs while dealing with the tissue expanders. I know this is not all in my head, I am not that type of person.
