The one is still bothering me but yesterday and today, it's kinda hard to explain. It feels \"full\" kinda of. You know when you when you breast feed and your milk comes in, how hard they get. Yesterday it felt like that, just a very weird feeling, my nipple itself started to feel sore...... Im probably worrying about the worst, but it is becoming all to common. 1 in 5 women will have it.......Im on hormones so that is my main concern. How is your treatment going and what's next for you?",

This one I have been putting off since last year. ( I know I shouldn't have)......the results of the others show a beign area but it warrented these follow ups to make sure nothing has changed. With that being said, since this summer, I have had some breast pain. I had my regular annual visit to the gyn in Sept of this year and he didn't find any lumps. But, I have found one lump that is becoming bothersome to me. It hurts almost all the time. I had a complete hysterectomy about 4 years ago and have been on hormone replacements since May of 2010. Breast Cancer doesn't run in my family but neither did the female issues I had that lead to the hysterectomy, so I am concerned about this lump. It is like it just throbs all the time and it is sore. Did any or has anyone experience this before? Log in to post a reply",

Marie5890, I only have had one U/S done and that was back in July of 2011 when they first found the spot. I haven't had another since then. I am really wanting to have one done this time around to make sure everything is fine. My breasts are very dense bc they are so small...I only weigh round 93 pounds and am 5'0, I can feel and see changes in my breasts. This has been bothering me lately with the pain. Its really weird like throbbing sometimes. Scaredat45: thank you......all the posts I have saw that hormone replacement makes your chances higher and in the back of my mind, I have to consider that. I am on progesterone and estradiol. I had a lymph node biopsy done in 2011 for my the one in my neck (tested me for lymphoma bc I got really sick) and it came back as bengin hyperplasia........... this has been going on for about a year now this breast lump off and on with the pain. My underarm hurts sometimes....did your underarm ever hurt? A friend of mine is pushing me into my mamagram done........I have pushed it off long enough I guess.........what do they do with a bioposy?",

I was told by my gyn to use ice and motrin every 6 hours. I was using a heating pad but that did nothing for me. The motrin is helping some but not a lot. It feels like heat radiating down under my arm in the armpit. Should I wait another 6 months for this other mamagram?",
