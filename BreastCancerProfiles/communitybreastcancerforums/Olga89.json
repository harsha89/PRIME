I just came back from my annual checkup and the doctor found 2 small cysts.  Nothing to worry about he says and I am due for a mammogram anyway.  He also ordered a sonogram for the cysts.  I am not a worrier, but I did want to find what percentage of cysts turn out to be benign.  Found this forum, great place for great info.  I am not googling any further until I find out the results of the mammogram/sonogram.   Thank you! ",
