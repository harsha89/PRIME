If you can't get any clarification, try to remain as calm as you can - easier said than done.  If you have any hobbies or activities that you can do and that absorb your attention, do that.  Maybe try some relaxation exercises, deep breathing, something like that.  Do you like to listen to music?  Music usually makes me feel at least a little better.",
