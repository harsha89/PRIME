Could be 30%, but 40% is high.  The good news is that the rest is very reassuring: Her2 negative, ER highly positive. I know women who have had much higher KI-67 reading and are fine, after many years. You will be too. Here's something from the section on pathology on this site: These two tests (referring to KI-67 and S-phase) of how fast the cancer is growing have limited usefulness when it comes to understanding the nature of the cancer and figuring out the best treatment plan. The tests are good, but they tend to be unreliable, so you can't depend on them too much. There are other ways of figuring out if the tumor is aggressive and fast growing. The tumor grade largely reflects this issue.",

Also, there's a New York State program called Healthy New York which has a relatively inexpensive insurance plan for self employed New Yorkers if income is  below a certain amount.  You really need to see a doctor, but call the Insurance Department to inquire about pre-existing clauses in New York, maybe tomorrow.  I'll also check on internet to see what I can find.  If I have any luck, I'll post again.",

      "Content": "Feb 26, 2008 05:31PM anneshirley wrote: Just found this, after entering \"New York pre-existing conditions health insurance.\" Attorney General Spitzer today announced that two health plans have agreed to re-examine their decisions to deny coverage to thousands of New Yorkers. Under the terms of the settlement, two divisions of Excellus Blue Cross Blue Shield in Central New York and Utica-Watertown, will review 16,621 claims, and Mutual of Omaha will review 156 claims, that were denied since 1997 primarily due to alleged pre-existing medical conditions. \"State and federal law require that a pre-existing condition be covered unless diagnosis or treatment of the condition was actually recommended or received six months prior to enrollment in a plan,\" Spitzer said. \"This agreement will help ensure coverage for pre-existing conditions for those who are entitled to it.\" The plans\u2019 review of their denials is necessary because their contracts and/or denial notices contained incorrect or incomplete pre-existing condition definitions, and omitted or incorrectly stated the members\u2019 right to be credited with covered days under previous health insurance. Spitzer\u2019s Health Care Bureau began an investigation of Excellus and Mutual of Omaha after receiving complaints that the plans wrongly denied coverage due to alleged pre-existing conditions. In one instance, the widow of a Mutual of Omaha member called the Health Care Bureau\u2019s hotline after the plan billed her over $200,000 for medical services provided to her late husband. Her husband had twisted his knee several weeks before he joined Mutual of Omaha. Diagnostic tests conducted after his enrollment, however, revealed that, in addition to the sprain, a malignant tumor in his knee had spread throughout his body. The plan refused to cover her husband\u2019s care, arguing that his cancer existed before his enrollment. A review of the plan\u2019s contract revealed that it had incorrectly defined pre-existing condition as that \"which manifests itself in symptoms which would cause an ordinarily prudent person to seek medical advice, diagnosis, care or treatment.\" After the Attorney General\u2019s office contacted the plan, it reversed its decision and paid for the care. In addition, the Attorney General\u2019s office found that both plans\u2019 member contracts and/or denial notices omitted or failed to accurately state the members\u2019 right to be credited with prior health insurance coverage. Generally, a consumer has \"creditable coverage\" if he or she was previously covered under another health plan and had a break in coverage of 63 consecutive days or less between leaving the prior plan and starting with the current plan. \"This action by Attorney General Spitzer sends a clear message that health care consumers will be afforded the protection guaranteed by federal and state law,\" said Mark Scherzer, Counsel to New Yorkers for Accessible Health Coverage. \"New York\u2019s mandated pre-existing condition definition prevents insurance companies from denying coverage for conditions that consumers did not perhaps even know they had before they got their insurance. That\u2019s only fair.\" Please call New York Insurance Department, as I'm sure it can help with your decision about finding a doctor now. ",

      "Content": "Feb 28, 2008 06:19PM - edited Feb 28, 2008 06:21PM by anneshirley Hi--I think the point of doing a SNB is to avoid doing a full axilla dissection.  If they remove sentinel nodes (1, 2, or 3), and the nodes are clean, they don't have to remove all the nodes.  The more nodes they remove, the greater the chance in time of lymphedemia.  I have read that it's best to have a surgeon who has had lots of practice doing sentinel nodes, and as Iodine says, the first surgeon may not have the experience.  I had to wait nearly a month after my initial diagnosis for surgery.  Supposedly, a month's wait is not crucial but it still would be good to have the surgery sooner.   The waiting is very painful. Triple negative cancers respond well to chemotherapy which is perhaps why the first doctor says she will recommend further treatment after surgery. I was told that the pathologist would look at the sentinel nodes during my surgery; if during surgery they found cancer in the nodes they would proceed to a full node dissection.  In that way it would not be necessary to return for surgery again.  The pathologist does a more thorough review after surgery and occasionally finds evidence of cancer missed during surgery.  In that case your mother might have to go for further surgery.  There may be other reasons why the first doctor is not doing a SNB that we are not aware of, so you should speak to her at length so you understand her thinking.  I'm just  talking from general knowledge; the doctor knows your mother and her pathology. ",

My PCP couldn't feel it, even after it was diagnosed.  It didn't show up on the mammogram or on the sonogram, but I could point to the spot so had a biopsy, which was positive.  After that, my breast surgeon sent me for a MRI of both breasts and the MRI could see the problem--not apparent in the other tests. Now, this is not to worry you, at all.  With so many people looking at it (and particularly if you're small breasted) it is probably nothing.  But rather than live in fear that something is happening, an MRI would finally give you some peace of mind--hugely important. ",

Right now it's still red and scaly around the outside and white within, and hard and lumpy underneath the skin, but not I think infected.

And Rebecca is absolutely right:  even if it's in the node, it's not the end of anything. I can't even begin to remember all the women I've known personally or read about on BC sites who have had many positive nodes and are alive and well many years later.  Your doctor is also right about removing your healthy breast not reducing the chances of recurrence by very much.  For some reason, I never worry about the other breast, probably because it never had dense tissue.  But that's your decision to make.  It's very difficult not to panic and I wasn't very successful at it, but I'm so sure you'll do fine.  ",
