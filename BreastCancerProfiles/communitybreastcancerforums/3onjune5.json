Micro calcifications were detected - in a pattern.  Radiologist scheduled an MRI - then a biopsy if needed.  She was told to stop taking her birth control pills at once.  I am confused why an MRI is scheduled before a biopsy.  When my mammogram indicated calcifications in a pattern, I had a biopsy, then MRI.   I was dx with Stage 1 invasive ductual carcinoma following the biopsy and MRI one year ago. Worried for my sister. Log in to post a reply",
