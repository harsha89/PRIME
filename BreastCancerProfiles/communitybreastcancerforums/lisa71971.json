      "Content": "lisa71971 wrote: On the report it says FINDINGS:\"There is a cluster of microcalcifications seen in the posterior third of the right breast prjoecting in the lateral quadratns not identified on the MLO vview. Otherwise there are no suspicious mass lesions or areas of achetechtural distortion. IMPRESSION: Cluster of microcalcifications seen in the right breast are only identified on CC projection and may represent superimposed calcifications from different parts of the breast. Would recommend further evaluation.  I also have heterogeneously dense breasts. The BI-RADS Category was 0 and then said incomplete assessment so maybe they need to do the other mammogram to rate it?? I looked online and they say the clusters are suspicious if they are clustered a certain way or shape. It doesn't say how they are clustered on this report or do they? I am so confused I am confused because it says not suspicious, but wouldn't the microcalcifications be suspicious? This breast hurts as well. :( I am 40, I have a 20 year old daughter and a 4 year old daughter. If I didn't have my girls I probably wouldn't be so worried. Anyone else have anything similar? Thank you!!   ~Lisa Log in to post a reply",

I can't stop thinking about this. My breast hurt a lot last night and is sore today. I feel it and it sort of feels the same (no lumps) but it kind of feels lumpy I don't know. I don't know how I am going to make it to the 27th of this month for my other mammogram. I hate feeling worried and scared. It makes me distracted and not want to do anything but look stuff up on the internet. I have to take care of my 4 year old and all I want to do is cry right now..UGH this is horrible....I am so scared right now. ",

If the pain werent there in the ONE breast that they saw the possible cluster in I would probably not be as upset either. The other breast has no pain. Also I guess if this is something, based on information I have been reading about these clusters, it would be in the beginning stages or very small so the odds would be good that it is caught early and the earlier the better right?  Oh and the BIRADS score they gave me based on information found at this website is: Additional imaging needed before a category can be assigned.   Thank you for your reply. It really did help ",

She initially told me about the report but did not mention the cluster of microcalcifications. I went to the radiology place and got the report. I work full time so when the doctor calls me back I most likely will be working and I work with the public and I won't be able to take the call. Maybe I will call again on Monday..I am trying to stay positive but my breast hurts too so it makes me worry you know?  ",

He said the only way to know for sure is to have a biopsy done. I (being the worry wart that I am) am going to have another radiologist look at them and I might even have a biopsy to make sure.
