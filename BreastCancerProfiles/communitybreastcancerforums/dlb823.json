Dr. Google can be great for getting more information after you have an actual diagnosis on any health matter.  Until then, it's useless and unnecessarily frightening to try to self diagnosis. The vast majority of breast \"spots\" (something like 85% of spots they actually decide should be biopsied) turn out to be something other than breast cancer, so try not to worry too much at this point.  Hopefully, there's a totally B9 explanation for your pain and the spot they see.   (((Hugs)))  Deanna",

As far as I know, the only way to diagnosis or rule out IBC is via a skin biopsy, sometimes referred to as a punch test.   But there are occasionally other forms of bc that do not show up on a mammogram either, such as some lobular bc, and especially if your breasts are dense, which is now considered a risk factor in itself.  So since your pain has not gone away in 8 mos., I would agree with you that further testing would be appropriate, maybe starting with an ultrasound. Try not to overly worry about the possibility of IBC, which is extremely rare.  But do request another appointment with a breast specialist to voice your concern about the ongoing pain and possibility that something may have been missed, and see if they can do some additional testing.    Deanna ",

As far as a prognosis, no one can really venture a guess about that, nor should they, as it will depend entirely on how well she responds to her chemo. I can tell you that it's not unusual to have metastasis in several or even many different areas, and have an almost miraculous turnaround. It all depends on how well she tolerates her chemo and how effective it turns out to be on her mets. As far as letting other things go, as you put it, the lung mets are probably the most life threatening if not treated. For the most part, the other areas affected are all bone, perhaps with the exception of brain, which could also be bone if it's actually her skull vs. her brain. I don't know for certain, but it sounds like the plan is to get the lung mets under control, then re-evaluate what's next.

Emory sounds like the place to be.  It's an NCI-designated Cancer Center, which means they see far more breast cancer than any local general surgeon, and will be extremely detail-minded evaluating her situation and the possible need for an axillary node dissection at this point.  NCI-designated status also means they are totally up on the latest research (these are the institutions doing the research) and state-of-the art treatment protocols.  http://cancercenters.cancer.gov/cancer_centers/map-cancer-centers.html Any reputable doctor will not mind a patient wanting a second opinion; in fact, the good ones encourage it because when it comes to breast cancer, no one doctor knows it all, and it's in their best interest as well.  A doctor who scoffs at a second opinion would raise a huge red flag in my mind, so don't be afraid to ask for a referral.  Your Mom is employing these people, and she has every right to have doctors she trusts and to ask for second opinions when things are not clear. I actually went through something similar to your Mom -- started with a highly-esteemed local surgeon with impeccable credentials.  However, for whatever reason, there were inconsistencies in my pathology, so I went to an NCI-designated cancer center (UCLA) to figure it out.  My bio page tells more, but it was absolutely the best thing I could have done. I hope you'll stay with us and keep us updated on her situation.  Good luck!    Deanna",

In the mean time, let me answer your questions.  First, you're absolutely right about an MRI being a pretty standard test done after a bc dx to rule out anything else going on in either breast. Perhaps she just didn't mention it to you.  A CT scan is more optional and may not be recommended unless there is reason to believe her bc has been there awhile, or she's having any symptoms that raise a concern. The gene test is most likely a test for the BRCA1 and BRCA 2 mutations.  When there is a genetic factor, more aggressive tx is recommended. And not knowing one's stage (which is based on the actual size of the lesion and any possible lymph node involvement) until after surgery is the way it works.  They can tell her an initial grade (1, 2 or 3, which corresponds to aggressivness) for the area that was biopsied, but until they remove the entire lesion, that might change if other areas of it are different from the biopsy. Hope this helps, and good luck to your Mom!  And be sure to tell her about BCO.  There's a whole world of suppport here for you both!    Deanna ",

As far as what to ask, just make a list of the things that are on your mind.  I think they will be thorough and guide you through what needs to be covered, but some questions that would be on my mind are  (1) Could the original biopsy have missed something?  (2) Are there any additional tests I should have?  (3)  How can anyone be positive it's not a malignancy, and if it absolutely isn't, what the heck is it, and does it still need to come out?  Basically the same things you're asking...   Please let us know how the app't goes....  Deanna",

I think sometimes the issue with not wanting tx can be a misconception about what it actually involves -- for example, fearing doctors will \"cut off your breasts,\" when a lumpectomy might be just as do-able. Or if a mastectomy, if necessary, explaining that it's removing diseased breast tissue -- not cutting off anything. Same for chemo. So many people think of someone they knew who went through horrible chemo txs years ago, before there were meds to combat nausea, etc., and maybe a much harsher chemo that was done for a different type of cancer entirely. Or if something like losing her hair is a secret fear, she needs to know there are cold caps available now. Can you at least encourage her to see a top notch medical team (preferably at an NCI-designated cancer center) who can assure her that her bc is treatable and will also paint a realistic picture of what they recommend, so that she truly understands what it is she thinks she wants to reject? Hopefully, you can get her past what is probably still some shock and denial. Unless she has pre-existing health issues, 60 today is considered young in terms of being able to fight early stage bc, including breast reconstruction, if wanted. Assuming you're in the US, here's a list of NCI cancer centers: http://www.cancer.gov/research/nci-role/cancer-cen... Good luck to you both! She's fortunate to have you helping her, and maybe just a bit more time to digest her situation and options will soften her current stance on no tx. ((Hugs))) Deanna",

I'm not sure if all of them, but many or most them have high risk programs that will evaluate you and, if necessary, screen you more often and more carefully than women who are not at higher risk, so can get by with annual mammograms.  It wasn't until I was dx'd and ended up at UCLA that I even found out about these programs.  Like you, there is some bc and other cancer in my family, but those who have been tested had no known genetic variation.  However, given what I know now, I think I might have been considered high risk based on my family history, so might have been monitored a bit more closely due to dense breasts, and probably would have been encouraged to get off the HRT I was on.  Not that anything will totally prevent us from developing bc, but closer monitoring might have found it sooner, or given me peace of mind that I was doing enough to monitor my situation.     Deanna",

Maybe that's still coming??? As an aside, it also reaffirmed my very strong belief and commitment in getting chemicals (one of 3 proven causes of some cancers) out of our lives.

My personal opinion, based on my own experience (detailed on my bio page) and being on BCO since 2008 is that you need to see a breast surgeon, preferable at an NCI-designated cancer center.  No doubt there are many other fine surgeons, including general surgeons, who would do an excellent job.  The problem is, sometimes they don't know what they don't know, and as a newly dx'd patient, we are not knowledgeable enough to discriminate.  IMO, you are better off with a surgeon who specializes in breast surgery, and if you need a plastic surgeon, there will be experienced breast reconstruction surgeons under the same roof who daily work in tandum with those breast surgeons. Another thing you can do is to repost your question giving your location in the title and asking for specific breast surgeon referrals in your area.  So sorry you're dealing with this.  Let us know if you need help understanding your path report.  (((Hugs)))   Deanna",

Other than that, I'm wondering if the radiologists' overly serious attitude prior to an MRI or biopsy might have been because of your age, and the desire to impress upon you the need for follow through?  Otherwise, no matter what your age, her approach sounds a bit unusual, since no one can tell for sure what you're dealing with prior to a biopsy.   Good luck... sorry you're going through this... and please keep us posted.   Deanna",

Also, as far as the MRI goes, I think you'll find this current active thread very interesting: http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/47/topic/727995?page=2#idx_49   It seems as though not covering MRIs or at least initially declining to pay for them is par for many insurance companies, which is outrageous.  But savvy and determined women are figuring out how to fight back and get them covered.  I've just learned that often it can be just a matter of semantics when the request for pre-approval or coverage is made.",

I'm sure it's especially difficult for you being away from home right now. As far as researching, this site (BCO) is about the best there is.  If you go to the bar at the very top of the page, you'll see things like Symptoms & Diagnosis and Treatment & Side Effects, where you can find lots of answers to any questions you might have. Regarding what you should be asking her doctor, are you planning to go to appointments with her?  Otherwise, doctors don't normally share medical information with family members, so you probably won't be able to get any information that way.  The best thing to do is to let your Mom know that you want to support her in whatever she needs, whether that's doing on-line research or accompanying her to her appointments (if that's possible), or just listening to her, and let her set the parameters for what she's comfortable sharing with you and what she needs. And be sure to tell your Mom about BCO.  There's fabulous support here for each step of her treatment, like individual threads by month for those going through chemo.  (Click on Forum Index above for a complete overview.)

But what this whole question makes me wonder ... if there is a connection, then isn't getting a bc dx and going through tx (a pretty major stress, if you ask me!) itself a psychological event that would impact our future health?        Deanna",

Since you have mouth sores, any type of fruit or fruit drink will probably irritate them.  Milkshakes and soft, bland foods would be more tolerable.

I'll try to find that thread I mentioned for you, but remember, knowledge is power, and you've come to a great place to get information that can help you understand and manage your risk.  (((Hugs)))  Deanna PS ~ Here's a link to that thread I had in mind:  community.breastcancer.org/top...  If the link doesn't work, use the Search box (to left).  The thread's title is Breast Cancer Symptoms, a Comprehensive List.",

I don't think any of us or our oncs knows exactly how we'll react to any chemo.  My previous drug reactions were not as bad as yours, but I rarely took any drugs because I absolutely hated the way they made me feel.  Or, at worst, I'd get a rash.  I considered myself overly sensitive to drugs, and, for the most part, used homeopathic stuff when I needed something.  And I did pretty well with TC.  My worst problem turned out to be some latent muscle weakness that seemed pretty bad for several weeks after chemo ended (which I hadn't anticipated), but no problems during my infusions, and nothing within the next few days beyond the typical fatigue and occasional nausea, etc. Best of luck with your treatment.  And be sure to check out both the monthly chemo threads here (e.g. Starting chemo August 2010 or September 2010) and also the TC thread (Anyone on just Taxotere & Cytoxan?).  They'll both be wonderful support for you!    Deanna",

What concerns me is that it can be missed if the biopsies aren't done correctly, and I'm not sure yours have.  Also, your symptoms keep getting worse, with no explanation from the doctors you're seeing.  I don't know what you have to do to get to a full-fledged breast surgeon/specialist, but that's really who you need to see to rule out IBC and figure out what's going on.  Your little ones need you, and on the chance this is undiagnosed IBC, you need to find out ASAP and get treatment for it because the longer you wait, the harder it becomes to treat. I don't mean to alarm you, but you obviously have something concerning going on.  It's not that I believe you have IBC, but I haven't read anything in your post to rule it out.

Just remember that 80% of breast biopsies turn out to be B9 -- and you're not even to the point of having a biopsy recommended.  So the odds are very much in your favor that the lump isn't breast cancer.  OTOH, if more tests are advised, be sure that they send you to a breast surgeon/expert. It's great that your gyn was on top of things to find your lump, but if things look any more concerning after your mammo & u/s (which I hope & pray they won't!), I'd suggest asking for a referral to a breast surgeon/expert, who is the kind of doctor who deals in these things all the time, so is the most experienced.   Good luck tomorrow!   Deanna ",

One solution can be Abraxane, which is basically Taxotere without added ingredients.  It's considerably more expensive than Taxotere (like 3x as expensive), so insurance companies normally only okay it in cases like yours (severe allergy to Taxotere, etc.). The other thing I want to ask is if your onc is truly an expert in TNBC?  I know there's plenty of information available to oncs, but if I was in your situation, I think I would want someone who is really on the front lines -- like someone who is either doing TNBC research, or at least affiliated with a medical institution that is.  I just personally feel that there's both a lag time in getting the newest info' disseminated to oncs, as well as a lack of expertise if an onc doesn't deal with TNBC on a regular basis.  And since you've run into such a serious issue and question about what to do, I would want to be sure you're dealing with a top TNBC expert who has run into this before and is drawing on firsthand experience and knowledge.  If that's who you're with, great!  If not, I think a 2nd or 3rd opinion is in order -- just to be sure you're going down the right path and not wasting time or risking continuing allergic reactions.     (((Hugs)))   Deanna ",

However, very recent research concluded that there is a difference in outcome based on subsets. In other words, the more advanced your dx is, the more important it is to start chemo as soon as possible. Since there was some doubt about whether or not you even needed chemo, it sounds like you may fall into the less advanced subset. If I can find a link to that research for you, I'll stop back and give you a link.

Some women do not like the larger teaching universities and prefer to get treatment locally, especially if there is a breast center at their local hospital.  That was my preference in the beginning, too.  However, I found I got more thorough screening and also had better reconstruction options at the larger facility than I'd had locally.

It's good to gather information, but try not to overthink or overworry about chemo.  Most of us get through it just fine.  I'm know I've seen some good threads here about what to tell young children about chemo and hair loss.  Maybe try using the search feature (to upper left).  Many women buzz their heads a few days prior to predicted hair loss, to avoid seeing it actually fall out.  And wig shopping is best done in person. You really need to try on colors and styles.  The one I got was by Raquel Welch, and I liked the color better than my own salon color.  Unfortunately, it does sound like you may still be in chemo for your sister's wedding.  If it's going to be nearby, it shouldn't be a problem -- but all the more reason to find a great wig.  Travelling to a destination wedding might be a bit more difficult.  But maybe you can schedule when you start chemo so that her wedding date falls in the 3rd week after your infusion, when you should be feeling your best. Hopefully others with young children will be along to weigh in on your concerns.  (((Hugs)))  Deanna",

I live near Palm Springs, and I chose UCLA for most of my care after a rocky start with local docs who have excellent reputations in general. So, personally, I would choose the NCI-designated facility, City of Hope. Also, I have known two local women through BCO who used City of Hope, and both were thrilled with their care, including reconstruction. Other than that, I just personally believe that NCI-designated hospitals are uniquely thorough when it comes to treating bc -- partly because they see more of it than even larger regional hospitals, and partly because they're the docs who are involved in research, so are truly up on the leading edge treatment options. As far as scans, unless her medical team suspects a problem, a scan will only expose her to unnecessary radiation. And I'm going to venture an educated guess that pain in the calf and/or knees is probably arthritis, as it's not a usual site for bc to show up. Perhaps a simple x-ray would show typical age-related deterioration and allay her fears and yours. Let us know how else we can help you and your Mom. (((Hugs))) to you both! Deanna",

The symptoms you're describing can also be associated with a rare but aggressive form of breast cancer called Inflammatory Breast Cancer (IBC).  I'm almost reluctant to tell you this because I don't want you to Google it and start panicking, because it is pretty rare and not easy to self-diagnosis.  However, because it's rare, some primary doctors and OB/GYNs have been known not to recognize its earliest symptoms, which delays diagnosis.  So what I would suggest you do is make an appointment with a Breast Surgeon/Expert (someone who deals only in matters of the breast) and ask specifically about IBC, which can be ruled out with a skin biopsy. If you need to know where to find a qualified breast surgeon, an NCI-designated cancer center is always a wise choice if there's one near you.  Here's a list: http://cancercenters.cancer.gov/cancer_centers/map-cancer-centers.html Hope this helps!  Good luck, and be sure to let us know what you find out.    Deanna",

And I'm very glad I did.  I feel I had a couple of oddities about my path that just made it the prudent thing to do, and I don't regret my decision for one moment.  But I think it's a decision we each have to make based on those individual path issues, and not be persuaded too much by what anyone else with similar stats may have done, although it's good to hear why they made their decision.     Deanna      ",

And what I and many others have done is to use all sorts of complementary protocols to support our bodies during chemo and help them rebuild following it. As far as chemo causing secondary cancers, for the most part, that risk pertains to Adriamycin, which you're not getting, and which is something like a 1-2% risk.  It also pertains to Tamoxifen, but, as far as I know, not to the chemo regimen you're on. Yes, chemo is potent and there can be unpleasant side effects.  But a recurrence of bc, especially a distant recurrence in an organ, is far more concerning to most of us. Dr. Bryznski's approx. 25% success rate seems to be with patients for whom traditional treatment offered no hope.  Unfortunately (and I may be wrong here), I don't believe there are stats re. his treatment for early stage breast cancer, although his treatment certainly sounds viable.  And I don't believe it would be covered by any medical insurance, so cost would be a big concern for most of us.  Two things that helped me come around to doing chemo (which I was very against at first) were the number of healthy, happy survivors who came forward to tell me they'd gone through bc, often 10 or more years ago, and had chemo (which, by the way, is much improved since then); and also the question... How would I feel if it ever came back and I hadn't done chemo? I agree there's a huge, self-perpetuating cancer industry out there, and no doubt some people are probably over treated.  That's one reason it's extremely important to find doctors you trust who will let you be involved in decisions about your treatment.  But the bottom line is, early stage bc is largely \"cureable\" (or possible to put into NED, hopefully forever) with appropriate conventional medicine, and the data for doing strictly alternatives just isn't as strong, IMO.  Hope these random thoughts are some help to you ~  Deanna   ",

For what it's worth, my UCLA onc recently told me that in spite of somewhat higher TMs (and like you, mine have always been spot on), she would not look at changing my current tx unless they doubled because, according to her, some fluctuation is normal. Without that input, I'm pretty sure my local onc may have wanted to change my current tx. If I was in your situation, I would proceed with caution. Take your time gathering as much input as you can. See at least one more onc -- maybe more. Get opinions from two rad oncs if you possibly can, because the more information you glean from talking to each of them, the more you will be able to make an informed choice. Personally, I would keep rads available for a situation where your future mobility could be impacted and/or you have pain that isn't well-managed with meds. And I'm not sure I'd switch meds just yet either based on a minimal rise in TMs and pain you describe as minimal to none. But that's my way of looking at it, and may not be right for you. That's why I think talking to more than one onc may help you figure out the best course of tx for you.",

I can add that the first bottle of Emu Oil I bought, which was the least expensive one on the shelf at my natural foods market, actually felt a bit gritty, which I didn't like.  So I bought a more expensive brand at an organic farmer's market that was \"ultra refined,\" and it was much nicer.

Sucking on ice chips will help protect the lining of your mouth from mouth sores.  Another really good product to have on-hand is Biotene Mouthwash, which you can get at most drugstores, Target, etc.  While you're picking that up, if you're going to be getting Neulasta to keep up your white blood cell count, many of us used Claritin (the allergy med) to alleviate some bone pain the Neulasta can cause.  If you search Claritin (box to upper right), you'll find threads about it. The other thing I would highly recommend is icing your nails to prevent nail damage from Taxotere.  Some infusion centers actually have ice mitts made by Taxotere's manufacturer, so be sure to ask if yours does.  If it doesn't, ask if they can provide ice.  If not, just bring your own or even a bag of well frozen veggies (like peas), which is what I did.  (They don't liquify and run all over like ice does.)  Holding this on your nails (both fingers & toes) to keep them cold during your infusion will really help prevent nail damage.  I haven't kept up with it, but there's a thread here on Penguin Cold Caps, which some women use to prevent hair loss.  They weren't as popular when I did TC in 2008, but something you might want to check into. One other thing I did that helped me overcome a lot of my fear of chemo was a guided imagery CD (download) by BellaRuth Naperstek.  You can find out about it here:  www.healthjourneys.com Hope this helps, and feel free to PM me if you have other questions.   (((Hugs)))  Deanna",

Yes, definitely consult another doctor who will check it out more thoroughly.  The obgyn you saw could be 100% right.  But if he is, it's a lucky guess, probably based on the incorrect assumption that you're too young to have bc -- although the odds are certainly in your favor that it's not bc at your age.  But there are many young women on these boards, including a 26-year old in our August 08 chemo group.  So, age alone is not a reason to rule out a more in-depth look.  It concerns me that the doc you saw didn't feel what you feel yet still dismissed you.  I would see your PCP and ask for a referral to a breast center for a mammogram.  There is absolutely no reason to be alarmed.  Most lumps are not bc.  Many can be ruled out via mammogram and/or ultrasound, and of those that look suspicious enough to  biopsy, 80% turn out to be benign.  But for your own peace of mind, do follow up on what you know is there. And please let us know how you do.   Deanna    ",

As far as waiting, 2 weeks shouldn't make a difference.  However, what's important is your peace of mind.  It sounds like an appointment now would greatly ease the stress you're going through, and if your insurance will cover it, why wait?  It's totally normal for women to find lumps and get them checked out.   What you're doing is perfectly within reason, and there's no sense in waiting or going through your PCP if you don't have to.      Deanna",

Not only is it probably best for your emotional health, but just going back to him, no matter whether it's for convenience or to confront him, kind of takes away from any future complaint you plan to make about his incompetence.  In other words, you went back to him (as he'll no doubt inform everyone), how bad could he have been? I know it's probably hard to think straight after all you've been through, but maybe you could call your health insurance provider, tell them you've had a serious disappointment with this doctor, and ask what your options are re. switching.  Another thing you may find is that another surgeon may not want to take you because the money making part of the procedure is already done, and at this point they'd just be doing the followup.  So maybe make a few calls and see what you find out before deciding either way.     Deanna",

I've had shingles twice. First time I was 43 then again at 46. Got the shot on my 60th birthday as insurance would not pay til then. I could still get it again,but it should be milder.So having it does not give you immunity sadly. I hope I never get it again! So I want to clarify... all stories of personal experiences with shingles are welcome on this thread. It's in the Stage IV forum because the decision on whether or not to get the vaccine probably is different if you are Stage IV due to immunity challenges, and I wanted to be sure to get a Stage IV perspective. But if you are unlucky enough to have ever had shingles, or have medical knowledge that can add to this discussion, please feel welcome.",

Like you, I always ate healthy, went to the gym, etc. -- even more so after my first dx -- and I still had a metastatic recurrence.  Plus I have a sister and two cousins who are bc survivors, one with mets.  So I totally get why genetics at times seems to be the overriding factor for us, and perhaps it is.  I guess I just still want to believe that -- if we could only pinpoint environmental factors that possibly exacerbate our genetic predisposition, perhaps it could make a difference for some of us.  And since there are so many variations of bc, I guess I have a hard time wrapping my head around a one size fits all vaccine or cure, although there have been some phenomenal research breakthroughs this year that hopefully will lead to far more effective treatments and hopefully someday the eradication of this disease.       Deanna",

It just takes awhile for the reality to overtake the fear. And the reality is -- while it still remains life threatening -- many oncs now treat mbc as a chronic condition and expect to keep us alive for many years, in which time we all hope and pray there will be more advancements and better txs. And if you go to the Research Forum here, I think you will feel more hopeful when you see how many discoveries (mostly in the areas of genomics and immunotherapy) that have been termed \"possible game changers\" have been made in recent months. All very hopeful stuff! As others have probably said above, be sure you have an optimistic oncologist who is in the chronic condition camp, and be sure you have been thoroughly evaluated, and that any pain issues have been addressed, because it's impossible to feel optimistic or even think clearly when you are in pain. And not all pain meds work the same for each of us. It can be a very individual trial & error process. I limped around in increasing pain with a fractured femur and fractured pelvis that went undetected for almost 3 mos, and absolutely believed my life was over and I was going downhill fast. But what a difference repairing those made! Don't let something like that happen to you. Other than that, hopefully whatever med(s) you're now on will start to work within the next few weeks, you'll be feeling better, and you'll feel much less pessimistic. (((Hugs))), and hang in there! The first few months can be overwhelming, but I would be very surprised if you don't feel significantly more even-keeled soon. And also remember -- the mind-body connection is a very powerful thing! Focusing on our situations, in my experience, absolutely makes us feel much worse. Deanna ",

You might also want to take a look at a website called www.lifemath.net.   There's a section in it for breast cancer, where you can put in various treatment combinations to see what difference in outcome they might make. The last time I looked at it, Taxotere + Cytoxan was not specifically listed because it's rather new, but you can put in \"Third Generation Chemo Regimen\" (which it what it is) to get a general idea.

This is so wrong, because it only aids in the lack of seriousness about our numbers and the need for research. Sorry if this is off tangent, but felt it needed to be mentioned.

Not all workups are the same, not all radiologists are equally as skilled at reading scans, and not all docs think alike. And once you have a bc dx, radiologists are sometimes IMO quick to jump to a mets conclusion. Tumor markers for breast cancer are normally checked with a blood test called the CA27-29. Unfortunately, it is not always accurate for everyone, but also hard to tell if it's elevated if it's your very first one, as there's nothing to compare it to. (i.e. if normal for you is 10 and this one was 30, that's within the normal range, but could be elevated for you.) Are you going to the Mayo? Normally when you go to a comprehensive cancer center such as the Mayo for a second opinion, you have the option of being treated there, or taking the information they give you back to a local medical team. Sometimes they can even recommend top docs in your area, such af those who were former residents at the Mayo, etc. The 2 hr. trip will be well worth it to have a second medical team evaluate your situation. Praying that you're not dealing with mets, but know that whatever it is, you will get through it! Glad you've found BCO. (((Hugs))) Deanna  ",

So in some ways, I can relate to what you're going through, although our son is much older than yours, so I wasn't dealing with that huge concern. I'm relaying the story because my hubby's problem turned out to be nothing in spite of a very concerning blood test that made him believe he was in danger of an imminent heart attack, and I'm hoping things will turn out the same for you, and that whatever is causing the low counts is nothing serious and things will get back on an even keel very soon!

IMO should not be scheduled within a few days of a dx to fit into a doctor's vacation plans.  Most of us need a couple of weeks to think through what we really want to do -- partly b'cuz we're literally in so much shock that we may not be thinking half as clearly as we think we are, and we will very possibly change our minds several times before coming to a decision we know is right for us. Has this doctor said anything to you about reconstruction?  Sometimes (depending on your individual situation) doing that at the same time as a mast. is the best choice.  So traveling to a larger comprehensive cancer center in Seattle might give you that option, which I suspect you don't have in Juneau. The first thing I would do tomorrow is get a copy of your pathology report and let us know any additional details.  Have you had an MRI?  That's something most of us have to ensure there's nothing else going on in either breast beyond what they already know about.  If there isn't anything else of concern, a lumpectomy could remove the 2 cm bc and you could think about doing a mast. later.  But I would be really hesitant to go forward without an MRI.

The other thing I might throw out to you that many of us don't realize initially, is that the relationship with your onc will be on-going for up to 5 years after your actual treatment ends, and he/she will probably want to see you at least twice a year to start.  So you may want to keep that in mind. Hopefully, someone from the Atlanta area will weigh in and be able to give you some firsthand input to help tip your decision.  And best of luck with whomever you choose!    Deanna  PS ~ Hi, Meg!  Looks like we were posting at the same time!",

Many of us have a PetScan early in our diagnosis, to see if things have gone any further.  The fact that it may not be in her lymph nodes is great news.  If it isn't in multiple nodes, she would only be at Stage II, which is considered an early diagnosis and very treatable. The prognosis for Stage IV varies a lot, but yes, you are correct that it cannot be totally cured,  But many women who are Stage IV become NED (no evidence of disease) and many maintain that status for a very long time.

As far as your insurance expiring, are you planning to do COBRA or get other insurance after the first of the year?  If you are planning to get new insurance, you may want to think about waiting until January for those tests.  Whatever you do, you do not want to find something (and of course we hope & pray you won't) -- but you don't want to find something that would be considered pre-existing and prevent you from getting other coverage.  Just maybe something to consider.... and good luck whatever you do.    Deanna",

If your MIL wants to investigate the possibility of a quicker biopsy, and if she's close enough to get to any of the NCI-designated facilities on this list, any of them would be a wonderful place to get a thorough evaluation, possibly sooner than July 30. http://cancercenters.cancer.gov/cancer_centers/map-cancer-centers.html I'm glad you've found BCO, and hope you'll stay in touch and let us know the outcome of her situation.  By the way, 80% of breast biopsies turn out to be B9, so, at the moment, the odds are still in her favor.    Deanna   ",

And that's something that should also be addressed, if it hasn't already -- the possible need for genetic counseling, to see if you carry a BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 mutation, since your Mother must have been quite young when she was dx'd. I also want to add -- if your doctor isn't receptive to doing a PET or CT Scan for any reason, I would consider at least getting a second opinion. For now, I don't see any red flags, so to speak, about your tx plan. But I would certainly ask for a PET or CT Scan, if only for the peace of mind it will give you going forward. So sorry about your dx. Sending you hugs & prayers for good results from your upcoming MRI and with chemo! Please keep us posted on what you find out. Deanna",

I don't think it's as much \"smoke & mirrors\" as it is just a fluid, changing situation -- like finding something on an MRI or in bloodwork that changes their assumed course. This is also a difficult week to get things scheduled due to the holidays and many docs taking off. But, that said, I personally think when things start to get the least bit confusing or complicated, that's the time to head to an NCI-designated cancer center, where they will have all the necessary breast cancer specialists under one roof (or on one campus), and the most experience. Here's a list of them should you decide to look beyond your local docs, which is what it sounds like you may be dealing with right now. http://cancercenters.cancer.gov/cancer_centers/map... Hope this helps. And keep in mind, what you're going through is one of the worst times. It gets much easier once you have a complete dx and a treatment plan in place. (((Hugs))) Deanna ",

There's absolutely no way you can feel the least bit optimistic, no less think straight, when you are in pain. I wouldn't give it more than a couple of days before asking for something different. And I don't think it's necessarily strength that's a factor. Some pain meds just work better for some of us than others. Ask for a different regimen if you are not getting your pain down to a manageable level. Patches + something for breakthrough pain may not be adequate, especially when we're advised not to let the pain get ahead of us so that we're chasing it. I'm just thinking you might need something more systemic than patches that you take on a regular schedule as your base pain med.

Of course you're a mess worrying about her and concerned that you might not be getting adequate attention on your own breast health concerns. Since there is quite a bit of cancer in your family, including breast cancer, can you possibly get a referral to a breast surgeon/specialist, who will not only listen to you, but will probably take your concerns much more seriously than your gyn did. A breast specialist can also refer you to a genetics counselor, if they feel it's appropriate, as well as give you practical lifestyle advice (especially IF it turns out that you have a higher risk than some for bc) that might be helpful in avoiding a future dx. (And I say that knowing there are no assurances, but certainly factors that have been shown to impact our risk.) That's what I would suggest -- an appointment with a breast specialist (surgeon) who will order whatever testing is truly necessary and hopefully be able to put your mind at ease going forward.

And since we and our bc's all totally unique, no one can give you or her a prognosis.  A lot will depend on how she responds to treatment, but many women with mets do well for a very long time.   (((Hugs))) to you both ~   Deanna",

Until I read that part of your post, I was going to say that you needed to pursue this until you not only ruled out bc (as it appears has been done), but have also found the explanation for your pain. Hopefully the excisional biopsy will accomplish that. Had your BS not suggested the excisional biopsy, I was going to suggest perhaps asking for an MRI -- on the slim possibility there could be something small hiding behind that area that's been biopsied -- something tiny but painful. Also, just so you know, Birads ratings are somewhat subjective, and even a Birads 4, as you may know, leaves things pretty wide open re. the possibility of it being benign. So I wouldn't worry too much about that rating, if that was part of your question. Good luck on Monday! (((Hugs))) Deanna",

After I finished my tx, I met with an integrative specialist to talk about diet & supplements going forward, and that was one of the foods I asked her about.  She advised avoiding grapefruit juice, but didn't see a problem with an occasional piece of grapefruit.  So I still eat it (like once or twice a month) and don't feel like it's a problem, especially in view of the recent research re. the anti-cancer benefit of citrus fruit pectins.

Between January and now, I had also been limping around with what I called \"mobility issues,\" as I waited for MRI's scheduled @ UCLA (my ins. co. has 2x denied a PETScan) to pin down the extent of my bone mets.  Long story short, after several weeks of increasing leg pain that I and my docs thought might be coming from a disc, I ended up in the ER on 3/23 with truly excruciating leg pain, and was shocked to find out I had a fractured femur and a fracture in my pelvis that necessitated pinning my leg and a total hip replacement on 3/25.  Still waiting on the pathology report, but the MRI I had in the ER suggests significant bone mets in my pelvis -- which never really hurt that much. I'm sharing all of this b'cuz I think it illustrates what Roses-Toses wrote above -- that bone mets can feel like a lot of other issues, and may not even hurt where you're having the actual problem.   I also had a great DexaScan a few months ago that showed a significant increase in bone mass, which I find so hard to reconcile with this new dx. I hope and pray that neither you nor Roses-Toses nor Kathec nor anyone else is dealing with a recurrence, but thought my very recent experience might shed some light.  The bottom line is,  if you are experiencing persistent pain over several weeks, don't worry if it doesn't sound like someone else's pain or experience.  We're all different, and we know better than anyone else when something isn't right with our bodies.      (((Hugs)))  Deanna",

I'm also hoping that by \"advanced,\" your radiologist meant simply that it has gone into one lymph node, which is merely more advanced than if it had not.  While it would be better if it wasn't in a node, many women with bc in 1 or more nodes get treatment and are absolutely fine.  So, if that's the case, it very well may not be \"advanced\" in the dreadful way you're thinking.  It just means that you will probably need to have chemo, as I did and many of us here have.  \"Advanced\" is a very odd and unnecessarily scary choice of words when you haven't had surgery yet.  There is also a newer approach were women do chemo before surgery (neoadjuvant chemo), and in many cases this will totally eliminate any bc in your nodes.  So you have every reason to be hopeful at this point.   I'm so sorry that you're going through this, but I'm glad you found this website.  We're here for you ~  Deanna ",

Another good thing about going to the type of facility you are is that they will probably have a genetics counselor on staff to talk to you about your family history, and decide if BRCA testing might be appropriate for you.  If they consider you high risk for any reason, they will set up more frequent monitoring, as well as teach you lifestyle modifications that can reduce your future risk.

So if a radiologist isn't going to do your biopsy, then you might want to ask your primary doc if he/she can refer you to a breast surgeon, rather than a general surgeon.  Of course many women have fine experiences with general surgeons.  But I would personally always opt for the most experienced doctor in any situation, and for a breast concern, that's obviously a breast surgeon.  Good luck!   Deanna",

Have you contacted a true ALS specialist? I'm under the impression there is no definitive test for ALS, but I would think a specialist who deals with the symptoms all the time might be able to weigh in with a more compelling opinion than docs who probably don't see it as often, and may be deferring to it for lack of any research pointing to the chemo drugs. There's an on-line FDA form for reporting suspected drug reactions. Your Mom's post chemo SEs may not be unique, in which case the SEs need to be reported. http://www.fda.gov/safety/medwatch/howtoreport/ucm053074.htm I'm also under the impression that The Army Of Women has started a self-reported SE database that will hopefully fill in some major gaps in pharmaceutical company reporting.

Hope this helps!  But absolutely don't accept pain and immobility as par for our new status.  In many cases, tweeking your meds and being sure nothing else is going on (like a fracture) can yield huge improvements in your QOL!   It has for me!  Oh, and don't overlook second opinions if your first onc isn't being proactive enough to get you feeling better.     (((Hugs)))  Deanna",

When I was personally trying to decide whether or not to do rads (after a mx), I talked to 2 rad oncs, then bugged one of them get a 3rd opinion from another highly esteemed rad onc at his institution.  And when I wasn't happy that they were all recommending rads because of a close margin and a node with extracapsular extension, I asked my onc what she thought, and she wisely offered to refer me to another rad onc outside of her institution -- which made me realize that no matter how many rad oncs I asked, it was unlikely I was going to find one who would advise me to skip them, because the bottom line was, I had factors about my dx that made doing them the smart choice no matter who told me so.  I guess we just have different viewpoints based on our own life experiences, but in thinking about it, my preference would be to seek out the very best specialist you can find for any problem because not only will they have the most experience to draw on, but chances are they'll be much too busy to take on patients or recommend procedures that aren't really needed.  And pil, I just meant I hoped you will make a decision based on factual information -- not because a doctor scares you into doing rads, or because you have concerns that may not have any real basis in fact.  The left side issue, for example, is something you can ask a rad onc about.  \"Will any of the radiation you would plan for me actually touch my lung or my heart?\"  My bc was also left side, but the rad onc I eventually chose was able to answer all of my questions, so that I was left with a much better understanding of real vs. imagined risks.  And if you haven't in the past, it's an excellent idea to take someone with you to your app'ts.  The stress we're under makes it almost impossible to hear and remember everything we're told, and having someone to listen and fill you in later helps a lot.       Deanna",

But I just read it tonight and can't help but think how much natural honey roasted peanut butter I ate in the years between my first dx and re-dx -- sometimes daily on celery or apples as a snack or lunch. And what's maybe a bit strange is that ever since my re-dx, I have absolutely no desire to eat it, even though I still have a concern about protein intake on a plant-based diet, so logically should still enjoy it. I don't think peanuts or peanut butter caused my metastatic recurrence, but the research does make me wonder if eating it almost daily helped set me up to be more vulnerable to a recurrence when we went through an extremely stressful house flood in 2014.

On the other hand, early in my dx, facing a mx after an unsuccessful lumpectomy, I looked into some alternative healing stuff, and even though I have always gone the natural route for lesser health conditions, those practictioners totally turned me off because, without even knowing the pathology of my bc, they were promising they could cure me because they had cured everyone else who had come to them with cancer.  So, a totally ridiculous use of the word cure, and one that is completely misleading.          Deanna",

Anyone who tells you you're too young to have breast cancer sounds like they may have inaccurate preconceived ideas that could be influencing their interest in looking any further. Since you're in San Diego, I'd suggest making an appointment with a breast surgeon/specialist at the UCSD Moores Cancer Center, which is NCI-Designated (meaning it's one of the best facilities in the US). Chances are you don't have breast cancer, but you need all of your questions answered and your mind put at ease, which is well worth a second opinion. A small percentage of breast cancer (usually lobular bc) can elude mammo and u/s, which is why you need a breast surgeon/specialist to evaluate you and give you a rationale explanation for your pain and possible enlarged lymph nodes. Good luck, and please let us know what you find out. (((Hugs))) Deanna",

No wonder I'm slowly putting on weight in spite of a mostly vegetarian diet. Back in the 2009-10 timeframe, some of us here had a \"Motivation\" thread with a 10 minute rule -- which is, no matter how sluggish or uninspired you feel, you make yourself get out there for 10 minutes, which, of course, almost always turns into a much longer exercise session. But for some reason, I'm having trouble even doing that these days. I really need a serious kick in the butt and I'm hoping this thread will help.

I'm on a very low dose because I'm small, and I've been discouraged at how painful HFS is, especially because of the concern you have -- not just b'cuz it's painful walking, but because too much walking seems to exacerbate the problem. The first thing you may want to do is be sure you have some shoes with really cushy insoles. That can make a huge difference. I also slather on a very rich, healing skin salve with socks at night, but someone told me today that Preparation H (hemorrhoid cream) works really well for HFS, so I may try that. It kind of makes sense because it reduces inflammation. Epsom salt baths also help. I just looked it up, and it looks like 60% of patients on X get some degree of HFS. So 40% don't, and maybe you will be lucky enough to be in that group. I certainly hope you are! Oh -- one more tip -- Vitamin E can help. I believe the recommended amount is 400 IUs, but since I normally take that, I've gone up to 1200/day. Here's the research: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC30763... ",

So I switched to that and had no problems other than a bit of \"sunburn\" in a very small area that didn't happen until the last couple of days. A probably equally good choice, IMO, is any natural cream with a high amount of calendula in it. I used Emu Oil immediately after my early a.m. session, around dinner time, and at bedtime. I used Trader Joe's natural deoderant, which I suspect is probably made by Tom's. Hope this helps. Deanna",

So I happily started eliminating most animal protein from my diet -- something that seemed very natural and easy for me -- and I was stable on Anastrazole for almost a year and a half. In recent weeks though, my TMs and pain level have been increasing, and although I don't yet have the results of 7/31 bone & CT scans, my onc felt it was time to switch meds, which I've just done. So what I'm wondering now is... Did the plant-based diet help keep me stable and pretty much pain-free all those months? Or did it help initially, but then my bc cells found a way around the lack of methionine? Or has it even been a factor? I am very content eating little or no animal products for both humane and overall health reasons, but my most recent labs showed slightly low rbc's, so I'm wrestling with what to do. Has anyone been in this situation, and, if so, what did you decide about the value of staying plant based, vegetarian or vegan?

My re-dx came after a very stressful few months (home literally destroyed by a flood), but it's hard to know if those mbc cells were growing for months or years prior to that very stressful time, or if the severe stress actually caused the relapse, or if it influenced its progression. And that's what I would wonder about your situation. Did the recurrence actually develop in those 9 months (related to the change in diet), or was it there and brewing much longer and just not evident? In either case, I'm quite surprised to hear that you were dx'd shortly after you went Vegan.",

I was never a big fan of kale anyway, so it's not a huge loss, but it's no longer a food I think I should be eating more of. And thanks, Boo, for the tip on cooking & freezing chick peas. I had to look up \"pulses,\" but see it's an alternative word for legumes. For those who mentioned eating some seafood, what about shrimp? If I'm not mistaken, they're mentioned in the Old Testament, along with pork, as being forbidden and unclean. Do you think modern day processing makes them different/healthier?

I can honestly say within 3 months you would never ever have guessed I'd had that kind of surgery, and today I have no limitations and don't even think about it. I also think it helped to get a lot of what my ortho surgeon called \"funky\" bone marrow out of there, so turned out to be an advantage in fighting mbc.

I guess we all have known someone very health conscious who was suddenly dx'd with late stage cancer, and it just seems to make no sense. But I like your take on not being compulsive, and I try to be the same -- especially if I'm a guest at someone's home or out with a group of friends. But I was getting a little obsessive about it when I was feeling really good and truly believing the way I was eating was a big part of keeping me stable. Dawny, thanks for sharing your experience. It can be so frustrating to really care about your health -- whether that's reflected in how we eat or other aspects of our lifestyle, such as staying fit, not smoking or drinking... and then we're the ones who end up dx'd with bc, while plenty of people don't seem to give a darn about what they eat or staying fit appear to get away with their unhealthy choices. My DH says they probably have something wrong but just don't know it. But it makes you wonder!",

To answer your current question, I don't believe your BS will want to wait for 5 or 6 weeks of RT + several months of healing time to do your initial surgery if one side is not prophylactic. I just went through a similar situation with Diep & rads, but it was for the Stage 2 surgery -- not the initial one, which I'd had in May.  In my case, my rad onc wanted me to do the Stage 2 surgery before rads, but my PS said, no, I needed to do the rads first, and he called the rad onc to assure her that was the way he wanted it done.  His rationale was if the RT changed my breast (I had a uni, and sometimes RT will lift or change the radiated breast), he would have to put me under again to adjust for asymmetry, and he was very against having to do that.  And when I asked another rad onc about the usual order, he said it all depends on the PS and if they're comfortable working on radiated skin.  Some are, and some are not -- but even those who are prefer to wait several months (or as long as a year I've heard) for the skin to regain as much elasticity as possible. By the way, I had no problems with RT and my Diep, but I strongly advise you to be sure you have a very experienced PS who is aware of your total treatment plan and will work with your other docs to ensure the best outcome.  It's probably good that you're thinking ahead in this instance, even though trying to figure out more than one step at a time can be overwhelming.  Again, a Diep experienced PS who regularly works in tandem with an equally experienced BS will probably be your best guides through this.   Hope this helps.  Good luck ~ Deanna",

I, too, find it ridiculous that drug companies come up with these \"ailments\" -- and restless leg syndrome is just one --  that in many cases are common symptoms of nutritional deficiences.  In the case of RLS, many times calcium/magnesium and B-complex deficiencies are at the heart of the problem, which resolves when those nutrients are taken in sufficient amounts for that particular person's needs.  (Which I'm mentioning here on the chance your family has never heard this and the long shot that it might possibly help them.) I'm sorry about your family's problem with RLS.  I have been dealing with some residual pain in my leg after chemo, so I would never make fun of or try to minimize what they are dealing with. I just wanted to comment on the broader problem, which I think is drug companies advertising to encourage people to self-diagnose to increase sales, and which I'm thinking may have been Suzanne's point.   On the other hand, while I have always been very natural-minded re. healing, I seriously wonder about the wisdom of the treatment she has chosen for her bc.  And I hope her celebrity won't influence other women who may not even have the same dx, to rely on herbs when they really needed chemo. Just my two cents worth... and sorry to continue in this OT direction...  Deanna ",

If I lived closer to you, I would love to drive you to chemo and sit with you while you get your infusion.  Yes, everyone's busy, but wouldn't you want to help if it was someone you knew in your situation?   If it's awkward to ask someone directly, maybe send out a group email, letting those who have asked if they could help know that your DH can't be with you on Thursday morning, and seeing if they would want to go with you, at least to the first one.  It's great to be independent, but honestly, this is one time in your life when you need to let go and let others help you.  If you don't, you're really depriving friends of the opportunity to support you by giving something of themselves.  JMHO...  (((Hugs)))  Deanna PS ~ Just FYI, the American Cancer Society also has a volunteer program that provides rides to medical appointments.   ",

I know when I first joined BCO, I came across another really bad experience recounted here, and it was very hard for me to shake that image from my mind, even though I later realized it was a very rare circumstance.  Which reminds me... for anyone who is really fearful about chemo, as I was, there's a great guided imagery CD called \"Chemotherapy\" by BellaRuth Naperstek that's available at www.healthjourneys.com.   You can listen to a snippet to see what it's like, and it's available as a download for Pam or anyone else starting chemo this week. Sherry, if you go to ACTIVE TOPICS, then scroll down to the CHEMOTHERAPY section, you'll see some threads that are pinned to the top of that area.  In one of those, there should be some additional tips for helping with the yucky mouth taste.  One thing that I did was chew on crystallized ginger, which also helped with occasional mild queasiness.     Deanna   ",

The other question I have is, at what type of facility is the breast specialist you mentioned?  If an NCI-designated cancer center with a high risk program, then I would be more inclined to think this is the right approach, perhaps due to other factors you haven't mentioned.  If a local breast center, although I'm not a doctor, I'd need more convincing that the additional screening is worth the extra radiation risk and that annual MRIs are really necessary.  JMHO based on what you've shared above...    Deanna",

A good rule of thumb and pro-active plan is, if you have an unexplained pain that lasts for more than 3 weeks, that's the time to check in with your onc.  Most normal aches and pains seem to disappear within that three week window.      (((Hugs)))  Deanna",

Unfortunately, x-rays may not show everything that's going on, which is not meant to alarm you, but certainly seems to merit looking further, especially given your earlier diagnosis, which is a lot like mine with the extracapsular extension. Besides, you clearly do not have peace of mind about what you've been told, and that's worth a scan just to be on the safe side; and at the very least, you may need some pain meds to see you thru the holidays. Hoping all is clear and what you have is a pinched nerve or something like that. But absolutely best to get it checked out a bit more, depending on when your onc suggests. Keep us posted!

Perhaps having that information will lead them to ask him questions that they might not otherwise, which could in turn lead to calling in a pain specialist (if it's a major medical center), or referring him to one if it isn't? If they can solicit some of those details directly from him (based on what you've told them in private), then perhaps they can bring up re-evaluating his pain med regimen???

That's how my onc realized something was amiss -- my high Alk Phos and then my CA27-29 came back at 155 (normally in the 10 to 12 range for me). Those numbers triggered a CTScan, which divulged bone mets. And, yes I had been having some rib and back pain, and I had lost weight.

I'm certainly not an expert (although I do have truncal LE myself, which oddly has improved since I was re-dx'd with bone mets) -- but what you're describing sounds more like something that's attacking your joints, such as arthritis or maybe some other autoimmune thing.

It seems like several years ago, when I was first dx'd, I had read somewhere that metastasis to the chest nodes (which I don't have) was considered Stage IV. However, more recently, someone asked the same question you are (although I can't find that post now), and was told by at least one other woman with a similar dx that she was considered Stage IIIC. I did a quick search both of BCO content and other articles, and just could not find anything definitive, although while calling it \"metastatic,\" they also seemed to lean towards it being Stage IIIC. So it looks like you are skating the line, as you said. I know that must be frustrating, not to have a definitive stage attached to your dx. But the important thing is that you get on a tx that will nip it where it is and keep it from going anywhere else for a very, very long time -- by which time, we all hope and pray there will be more and better tx options for all of us.

I doubt it's bc-related, but I would think it should be your biggest concern at the moment, whether it's blood pressure or blood sugar or an irregular heart rhythm or something else. As far as your TMs, I would think you and your onc would just want to keep an eye on them. Some fluctuation is totally normal, and, as you said, 20 is in the normal range, so I doubt there's anything to worry about. It's just if they were to continue in an upward trend it might merit further investigation. I know it's hard not to think every little twinge or pain or unexplained symptom is mets-related, but most of the time, they're not. A good rule of thumb is to give any new symptom 3 weeks to improve or go away, because most \"normal\" aches and pains from a slight injury, etc. do resolve within 3 weeks. If it doesn't, that's the time to talk to your onc and get it checked out with a scan, for example, for your own peace of mind. Good luck, and please keep us posted!

But that said, I can tell you in retrospect the one I feel I missed and have heard of others missing was severe, aching lower back pain. I personally chalked mine off to changing from wearing flip flops all summer to wearing boots with heels, plus hauling around some very heavy flooring samples, as we were in the process of remodelling our home. That was in October, but it improved when I stopped doing those things, so never occurred to me that it could be mets and I never followed up on it. Fast forward to December, and I came down with one of the worst cases of something diagnosed multiple times at an Urgent Care as bronchitis, pleurisy and/or costochontritus (due to excruciating rib pain when I coughed), that I just could not shake. I finally made an appointment w/my local onc because I had never been that sick, and he even initially told me he doubted very much it was anything more than severe bronchitis. But my lab work showed a concerning spike in my CA27-29, as well as high liver counts, and that led to a CT scan that showed extensive bone mets. I also totally agree w/Bad at User Names about referred pain. Around the time I was dx'd w/mets, I started having a horrible pain shooting up my right shin that got progressively worse until I needed a cane to walk. My local onc had simply shaken his head, like it was par for the course with mets. My UCLA onc at least questioned if it might be from a disk and ordered an MRI. But, long story short, just before the MRI was scheduled, I ended up in the ER with pathological fractures in my femur and pelvis -- neither of which had been where my pain was. I think all you can do is pay attention to any new pain that can't be explained, especially if it doesn't go away in 3 weeks time. There is also a very new test for circulating tumor cells, which might help to put your mind at ease, if it's something you can get yet in Australia. Also be aware that the generally quoted recurrence rate of 30% is for all stages and types of bc, with a Stage 1A ER+ PR+ Her2- bc probably being more like 5 of 10% vs. a more aggressive and/or higher stage bc.

The other reason could be that he truly thinks there's a structural explanation, which an MRI w/out contrast should show. Depending on how early your scan is on Monday -- if you or the facility can get ahold of your PCP before you have it -- I think you have a valid concern about the lack of contrast ordered.

Anyway, just my initial thought upon reading your post. Astrid, how long have you had the rib pain? Many times, waiting 3 weeks before reporting a new pain makes sense, because random pains often have nothing to do with bc and heal or go away in that time if they're muscular, etc. But if you are in enough pain that you even suspect you could have a fractured rib, I wouldn't wait to mention this pain to your onc, and let him or her decide if it requires follow up.",

Any pain that lasts for at least 3 weeks needs to be investigated and bc ruled out -- not brushed off with the types of comments you shared above. And while your onc is correct that TMs are not always reliable, they are one more tool that can provide a clue IF they happen to be elevated, which I certainly hope they're not. But brushing them off as unreliable seems like she's sticking her head in the sand. Questions: How long have you had each of the \"chronic\" pains you described?

Mindy Cohn, from what I can gather, may be NED or NEAD at the moment -- the most accurate term for \"in remission\" -- which means cancer is not detectable at the moment on imaging. This is not uncommon, especially if it was in a very limited area. However, once someone has had mbc, with the exception of perhaps 1 to 2% of us (as counted by conventional research; there may be more cases not counted), no one is ever truly cancer free -- as in totally over it. Sadly there are most likely still mbc cells in her body, most likely hibernating or sleeping or hiding out until something sparks their proliferation again. Hope this makes sense. And your question is an excellent one, much discussed on FB today. Hugs, Deanna",

And yes, mets pain can feel like aching and burning, and if in the hips and back, usually worsens with activity and standing. MRIs are not always the best way to pick up mets, nor have I ever heard of torn muscles lighting up a PET scan, although perhaps something has been lost in the communication there. A bone scan is exactly what I would suggest. Also, depending on what they tell you after you have that, I would strongly consider taking your medical records and going for a complete evaluation at your closest NCI-designated cancer center. The fact that you've had as many fractures as you have had -- whether or not mets is involved, which we hope and pray is not the situation -- is also concerning and needs better answers than it seems like you've gotten so far and perhaps a bone building med, such as Xgeva (Prolia). Good luck on the bone scan, and please come back and let us know the results. Rosabella, your onc will hopefully bring up any concerning changes in that lung nodule, but if he/she doesn't, you absolutely should. There are many reasons why a nodule may appear larger than it did the last time, including being scanned on different equipment, and/or just the angle and the way a radiologist sees it. In other words, imaging is not always as black & white as we may think it is, and tiny lung nodules are fairly common. Also, while there's no reason to suspect mets at this point, the fact that it's on your non-cancer side doesn't make a difference. Is your onc following your TMs? They're not always accurate for everyone, but it might be one more little assurance if they're in normal range. Katie, I would strongly encourage your Mom to report her cough to her onc. It may be something as simple as bronchitis or a touch of pneumonia, but those both require tx and should not be ignored! So sorry each of you is dealing with a worry during the holidays. Hopefully, all is well, but please follow up and keep us posted! Hugs, Deanna",

First, I was a bit taken aback at your onc's comment re. \"too early for mets,\" as I don't believe there's a timeline or chart to predict a recurrence. But, that said, I don't necessarily think that's what you're dealing with, since the tests you've had have been clear, and a bone scan would have shown something as painful as you're reporting. My first thought is maybe a hairline rib fracture that isn't showing up on x-ray. Do you recall any injury or stress to your ribs around the time the pain started? Is the rib pain only on one side? The fact that the pain radiates into your jaw is also concerning. Without knowing your age or full medical hx, I think checking out your heart would be prudent. Otherwise, I'm thinking something going on under your ribs, or perhaps referred pain that's actually coming from something out of place in your spine. If I was in your situation, with pain as bad as you're describing, I would push for a PET scan, which should show more than either an x-ray or u/s will. Absolutely let us know what you find out. The pain you're experiencing needs an explanation. Don't be afraid to advocate for yourself. Hugs, Deanna ",

Of course severe or unrelenting pain needs immediate attention, but most things that cause anxiety re. mets seem to resolve on their on own. As far as identifying mets early having an impact on outcome -- probably not in the bigger scheme of things. There probably are exceptions, especially if someone was to let a dx go far too long. But the flip side of the issue is over screening which isn't good for any of us either, both in terms of too much radiation and anxiety, not to mention a possible recommendation for a biopsy for things that have nothing to do with bc, but based on our hx's aren't excluded as easily as they might be for someone else. But when someone is re-dx'd probably won't change their tx plan. Hope this helps! ",

But once you hit mbc, from my experience, things get a bit more subjective. For example, the last time I had to change meds due to the one I was on not working as well as it had initially, I was given 3 options (UCLA), including a trial, but the decision was left to me. Not sure which scenario you were asking about -- early stage or mbc -- but I'm glad Laura gave you the input she did in case you were asking about early stage. The one exception with early stage tx would be if someone is post menopause and going to start an A/I after active tx. In that case, of the 3 aromatase inhibitors available, I don't believe there is a standard of care, but that it's pretty much up to the oncologist's discretion which one he or she chooses.",

I don't think you have your head in the sand, and chances are whatever has you feeling so dreadful isn't related to bc, but it certainly can worsen everything when you start thinking that way. What I would suggest is maybe a complete workup by your PCP (or whatever you call your primary doc in NZ), to see if anything else is amiss -- thyroid, blood sugar issues, adrenal fatigue, etc. If he/she can't find anything to fix, then maybe check in with your oncologist -- if only for complete peace of mind. But from the little bit you've shared here, I don't get a sense that you're dealing with an undx'd metastatic recurrence, but possibly something else out of whack, and possibly a touch of depression or PTSD, both of which are very common after bc tx. So I'd definitely start with (1) Making sure you don't have something else physically going on and fixing anything you do; and then (2) Looking at lifestyle changes to get your mind out of the bc rut, like spending more time doing things you love doing, maybe taking up a new hobby, planning some getaways to change the scene and ge around people who don't know and relate to you as someone with a bc history, spending more time in nature, etc. Just my take on what you've shared, but don't continue to suffer.

First, is the surgeon recommending the lumpectomy a general surgeon or a breast surgeon?  I'm asking because, personally, I would trust the opinion of the latter a bit more in this situation, as breast surgeons who work within comprehensive breast centers see far more bc than general surgeons, so are often better experienced at deciding which women are safe with lumpectomy vs. mx. Also, you don't indicate the grade or hormone status of your wife's bc, which might play into the picture.  In some situations, more aggressive bc could justify more aggressive treatment.  As far as recovery time, many major hospitals now do straight mx as an outpatient surgery, with a fairly quick recovery.  In most cases, it's the type of reconstruction that determines recovery time more than the mx itself.  I had a Diep flap reconstuction (7.5 hrs. of surgery), which includes a tummy incision, a 4-night hospital stay, two weeks of very limited activity, another couple of weeks until I was cleared to drive and resume some of my normal activities, and a total of 10 weeks before I was healed enough to be cleared to start chemo.  Other types of recon. can heal much faster. A rule of thumb I've heard is to allow a month of recovery time for every hour of surgery, to get your energy level back to pre-surgery levels. One more suggestion I wanted to pass along to your wife is to look at photos of reconstructed breasts. I recall how devastated I was to learn that I had to have a mx, but seeing photos of reconstruction gave me a more realistic image of what a mx could look like when done by an experienced plastic surgeon working in tandum with a breast surgeon.  I guess the last thing I want to add is that this is not a decision to be made quickly.  It takes time for the information she's gathering to sink in, and time for her to decide what is right for her.

Regarding your breast and other pain, it doesn't sound like you've had much in the way of imaging -- possibly just an ultra sound? Have you had a mammogram and/or an MRI? And when you say you saw a breast expert, was that at a major university teaching hospital, or someone more local? I'm asking that because any medical facility can have a \"breast center,\" but the key to their expertise is how many cases of breast cancer they actually dx and tx per year, and some local facilities probably don't do enough to make them true experts, IMO, especially when a situation is the least bit complex or difficult to dx. So my first thought (if you haven't already) would be to get yet another opinion from a breast surgeon/expert -- preferably at one of the major medical facilities such as the ones listed here: http://cancercenters.cancer.gov/cancer_centers/map... Don't stop searching until you find an explanation for your pain. Hopefully, it won't have anything to do with bc, but so far no one's been able to explain what's going on, and I think you need that for the peace of mind. Good luck, and please keep us posted!

The most important thing you said is that you're Mom's a fighter.  Also, the fact that she's a teacher, so is no doubt use to doing her homework and to planning.  Those will all serve her well now!  The next very good thing is the way you described her doctor -- admitting that he's human, and wanting to rely on testing rather than guessing what's happening.  And, hopefully, she is having a fantastic response to the chemo, which it certainly sounds like she is. Logging on here and getting involved is one of the best things you could have done!  All of the women here are so knowledgeable and giving.  At some point you may also want to tell your Mom about BCO, because the support of other women going through what she is will be one more source of strength for her.  I'm adding you both to my prayer list.  And to answer one of your implied questions, with today's chemo drugs + Herceptin, there is every reason to believe your Mom will get through this.  And as far as not being able to eat, many of us revert to childhood favorites like grilled cheese or French Toast -- really bland foods that don't upset the tummy as much.  Also ginger and ginger snaps helped me with nausea, although if hers is really bad, she should let her oncologist know because they may be able to change her anti nausea med to something that works better than whatever she's on now.  Take care ~ both of you  ~   Deanna",

One thing I would suggest is that you try to find a medical team that is very experienced at treating women with pre-existing MS.  Also, some of the larger medical centers that would logically have this kind of experience (vs. a smaller hospital that doesn't see as many bc patients), might also offer integrative treatment, such as accupunture, etc. -- which might be helpful to total well-being.

Yes, sadly, most of what's labeled as and passes for \"natural\" in stores contains only a percentage of natural ingredients, along with plenty of toxic ones. Miche, you brought up a couple of great points. Clearly, if you look at things like Thalidomide, or even alcohol, it's obvious our lifelong health can be influenced in utero. And yes, we certainly have bigger fish to fry than worrying about past food choices or occasional lapses from an otherwise healthy diet. Oh, and Debiann had mentioned her vegan doctor-friend who was dx'd with prostate cancer. And it's funny, but as I read that I thought, yeah, but that's a hormone-driven cancer... and then I realized -- DUH -- so is ours. So I think that is probably the biggest factor -- hormones (which we can get an excess of from some animal products) & genetics, which may not be influenced in the slightest by what we eat.",

So I happily started eliminating most animal protein from my diet -- something that seemed very natural and easy for me -- and I was stable on Anastrazole for almost a year and a half. In recent weeks though, my TMs and pain level have been increasing, and although I don't yet have the results of 7/31 bone & CT scans, my onc felt it was time to switch meds, which I've just done. So what I'm wondering now is... Did the plant-based diet help keep me stable and pretty much pain-free all those months? Or did it help initially, but then my bc cells found a way around the lack of methionine? Or has it even been a factor? I am very content eating little or no animal products for both humane and overall health reasons, but my most recent labs showed slightly low rbc's, so I'm wrestling with what to do. Has anyone been in this situation, and, if so, what did you decide about the value of staying plant based, vegetarian or vegan?

Your Mom will have to make her own decision about what she wants to do, but a 31% chance of recurrence is fairly poor odds, especially when a recurrence often means a metastatic recurrence.    A couple of practical things she might do is question if Abraxane might be substituted for the Taxotere.  It's the same drug, with less harsh, SE-causing extra ingredients.  It's more expensive, but perhaps whichever onc she ends up using can get it authorized for her.  There's also a chemo known as CMF, which some say is a bit \"lighter\" than TC.  I'm not a doctor and absolutely not suggesting she do either of these -- just sharing some info' I've gleaned here in the past 4 years that might be worth looking into. Also, if she decides to do it, be sure she joins a monthly chemo group here.  (Check the Chemotherapy Forum in All Topics.)  Going through it with the support of others going through it makes all the difference in the world.   (((Hugs))), and so glad you've found BCO!    Deanna",

Maybe three years ago I had a very painful spot on my hip. At the time I was going to the gym a lot, and the one-time coupon deal massage therapist I went to for the pain (in a chiro's office -- so I assumed she was good) felt strongly that it was related to my gym routine, so she worked extremely hard on that one spot, and I ended up in much worse pain for several weeks afterwards. Fast forward a couple of years, and I was dx'd w/bone mets in that hip. Of course there's no way of telling if the pain I had earlier was even related, and after the additional pain from the massage went way, it didn't bother me and had nothing to do with how my bone mets eventually manifested. But your experience with the electric massage chair made me think of it and want to suggest to you that it's better to get it properly checked out if it continues to bother you. NOT that I think it's mets, but just that any pain that lingers as long as yours has needs an answer so that you can get the correct therapy for whatever it is and relief from the pain.

I would say, if you are going to continue to worry that something may have been missed, ask your onc if he would consider ordering a baseline PET or CT scan -- just for the peace of mind it would give you. I suppose you could also say you're having ongoing back or rib pain or something like that, if he can't get it approved without a symptom. Or, as an alternative, perhaps he could at least add a CA27-29 (tumor markers) to your next follow up. If it's totally within normal range, then I think you can rest easy that everything is okay. Good luck! It's horrible to continue to worry, so I hope if you can be honest with your onc about your fears, he will find some way to reassure you. (((Hugs))) Deanna",

Hopefully, whatever is in your lung is something other than mets, which is not an uncommon situation. You already know about valley fever, and any illness involving your lungs (i.e. pneumonia, severe bronchitis, etc.) can leave scars that sometimes are too quickly assumed to be mets. So unless and until proven otherwise, let's hope it's not mbc. As far as how you go on, I can share a few thoughts with you... First, even with lung mets, many women do very well for a very long time. There are a plethora of txs out there, and you just have to hope and pray that if you have mets, you will respond well to those txs. There are also new things coming along all the time -- meds that make the current stats pretty outdated. And there are more in the pipeline that make me very hopeful. My best advice if it turns out you are dealing with the worse case scenario (which I hope and pray you're not!), is -- if you're not already at one of the major university comprehensive cancer centers, at least go to one for a second opinion. As excellent as many, many local oncs are, most of them are general oncologists and this is a case where you really need to be sure you're getting a treatment recommendation from someone who specializes in breast cancer, so is truly up on the very latest txs and trials, as well as treats enough mbc patients to have a lot of experience with patients very similar to you. You can always take the information they give you back to a local onc (that's what I do) for monthly follow up, if you aren't close to one of the larger facilities. Those are a few thoughts off the top of my head. Of course, the fact that you have 4 children has got to be the best motivation there is for hope. And if you haven't come across it yet, be sure to check out a very positive thread here entitled, Life Doesn't End With A Stage IV Diagnosis (Really!).

Have you had a DEXA scan recently, to see if you're dealing with osteopenia or anything like that? And have you thought about lifestyle stuff, like sitting too much and/or maybe not getting enough exercise and losing core strength? Since you had the pain prior to starting Tamox, it doesn't sound like it's totally that. And if you had it when you had a PET Scan in the past (was that prior to starting chemo?) and nothing was seen then, I doubt anything's changed significantly since you were on chemo. And I would think if it was mets, it would have gotten worse by now. So sorry you're dealing with this -- and yes, it's very hard not to let your mind go to the worse case scenario. But if it doesn't resolve and you can't think of any other logical reason for it, another scan would at least put your mind at ease. Elaine, I don't have lung mets, but what you're describing makes me think more of some sort of heart irregularity, rather than lung mets. Has your onc kept an eye on your heart since you were on Herceptin and Perjeta? I'm not a doctor, but I know from reading that sometimes heart issues can appear months or years after tx. I think the lack of estrogen from any A/I can also cause heart fluctuations. It's great that you're swimming, and if you're swimming hard, I suppose you could have injured something. Hopefully it's not anything serious, but I would absolutely let your onc know what you're experiencing. (((Hugs))) to you both, and please let us know what you find out. Deanna",

As far as your question, I think you're just going to have to wait until you can talk to your onc, and until she possibly talks to the radiologist. It would be fruitless to try to theorize what might have happened. The important thing is that nothing concerning showed up on the most recent scan. But you are wise to question the possibly discrepancy between the current and earlier imaging. Too many times these overlooked details come back to bite people, not to mention the unresolved fear when you don't have definitive answers. Maggs, comparing different imaging modalities is difficult at best, and rarely accurate. You really need to compare a CT to a CT, etc., But that said, could you at least get ahold of the previous CT images for them to review next to your current images? I agree with you, if something was going on in your liver, I think something would be out of whack with your liver numbers, as well as your CA27-29. How long will your onc be away? Isn't anyone covering for him in his absence? I doubt very much that this would interfere with your scheduled exchange surgery, but if your onc has any concerns about what was seen on the u/s, then you need the peace of mind of having additional imaging, such as another CT, just to be sure. As with homeschool4us' situation, sometimes oncs are so busy these things can slip by them, so it's good that you are on top of it. But try not to worry until you can get his input, which hopefully will be reassuring. Hugs to you both, and please keep us posted here on your what you find out. Deanna",

I think most of us have had mets found by CT first, and if and when it's at least somewhat extensive, a bone scan is done to ascertain the degree of activity or uptake in those areas. So I'm a bit in the dark about not only using a bone scan as an initial diagnostic tool, but then repeating it for one spot that sounds like it was found (?) somehow between those bone scans (?). That said, if both a CT and bone scan revealed an area of concern, a biopsy normally is the next step, and usually much quicker and simpler than they may sound. But looking at your tx hx, it does seem unlikely you would have a bone met, especially if you are on an anti-hormonal -- which is probably why your onc isn't convinced you have a met. Has any of your blood work indicated a concern? Artista, if you had a clear scan approx. 6 mos. ago, it's highly unlikely something would be there now and significant enough to be causing pain. Assuming you're on Tamox or an A/I, that is far more likely the cause of your hip pain. The tibia pain is something I also had post-TC chemo. It was horrible, especially at night, and lasted maybe 6 mos., during which time I found it helpful to put a pillow under that leg to help me sleep. As far as whether the pain from bone mets can come and go, yes it can. But I think many of us find that it's worse after overdoing things that probably create inflammation to those areas -- not so much just suddenly coming and going without explanation. But as said to indenial above, mets are most often ascertained via a PET (which can be hard to get authorized these days) or a CT, so that might be something to ask for if you need the peace of mind. I hope and pray that neither one of you is truly experiencing a recurrence, but please keep us posted on what you each find out! (((Hugs))) Deanna  ",

They're just oddities from previous illnesses, such as pneumonia, and other benign things. In addition, different radiologists note and call out different things that sometimes are never mentioned again. Often these are termed indistinguishable vs. given a more definitive description, but that, too, can be very subjective. In other words, radiology is not black & white, and what is seen/noted depends a lot on the particular radiologist doing the report. Of course it's very disconcerting, but the number of times I've seen concerns like yours turn into nothing far outweigh the few times something more ominous actually turns up. By all means ask your onc about it, and if necessary take your imaging elsewhere for a second opinion. But try not to assume the worst from a few possibly poorly chosen words on a report.

It that one is high, it can possibly be due to bone or liver mets. The ones you shared do not normally have anything to do with breast cancer, nor are they even high enough on my layman's opinion to be concerning for other serious issues, although some (like the calcium) probably should be watched, as it may relate to her decreased heart function. Also, if she is on any meds, they can often play a role. Hope this helps. Try not to worry.",

And I'm not even sure radiologists read DexaScans (???), since they're rather inexpensive tests. I have a feeling they're read by techs who probably aren't trained to look for anything beyond mineral density. I'm curious why your MO ordered a bone density test. Have you been on an A/I for an extended time? My personal experience has been that tests that come back with concerns usually get the first calls, and those that show nothing out of the ordinary tend to get shuffled to the bottom of the stack.

So for what it's worth, here's my take on your situation. The fact that you have had Lyme disease in addition to bc, I believe makes your situation one that really requires input from and communication between more than one specialist -- ideally doctors who have dealt with patients with similar histories, which would probably mean a major medical center, where they can thoughtfully unravel your current symptoms and will be sure not to miss anything. As far as tests to rule out a metastatic recurrence, I would think a concerned onc would do complete blood work, including a CA27-29 (tumor marker test; not always 100% reliable, but certainly could be an indicator if anything is going on) and also liver function tests -- another potential early indicator if something is going on in your bones, although I don't know (and this is why I think you need specialists who can work together) how Lyme might affect the latter or any other blood work. A PET is the scan most commonly used to dx mbc. If your insurance company will authorize a PET/CT, all the better -- and one more reason for coordination, so that you get any necessary tests for all possible concerns covered at the same time. A few other miscellaneous thoughts... (1) Back pain -- including both aching and severe, shooting pain -- after gardening is very common, especially if you're not used to bending and squatting; (2) It sounds like your scanning was area specific. I would not be the least bit shy about asking for a full PET Scan now, if only for the peace of mind it sounds like you need. (3) Stop Googling. And I mean this in a very kind way. Google is wonderful when we have a diagnosis to then educate ourselves, but it's absolutely horrible when it comes to self diagnosis. Hope this helps. Please keep us posted. Hugs, Deanna ",

For many of us, the pain is often very strong aching or burning, made worse by activity or overdoing. But any pain that awakens you at night needs to be investigated. Where I may differ a bit with Chrissy on your MRI, is that if a radiologist reading your MRI is not trained to recognize bone mets and is not looking for them specifically, I think something small could possibly be missed. You said your MRI was done for an entirely different reason, and this is why I might ask your onc to have your MRI re-read by whomever he uses specifically where you are experiencing pain now -- just to be sure. Also the \"gold standard\" for diagnosing bone mets is a PET scan. So if your pain doesn't improve with things like heat and OTC meds, I would probably ask for a PET scan if only for peace of mind going forward. Also two months is a significant window if you're in serious pain. In the US, the traditional rule of thumb is 3 weeks. Good luck, and please keep us posted. Deanna",

Women remember the original DCIS dx, but because of being in shock or disbelief or because of poor communication from their BS or onc, they never fully understand that there were also some IDC cells found. Another possible explanation would be a lousy pathology job -- which is probably extremely rare, but can happen. In other words, the specimen isn't sliced or broken down sufficiently to detect tiny IDC cells somewhere in the lesion. But as cive said, worrying about it is futile. Just do the things we know lowers risk like maintaining a normal weight and getting sufficient exercise, and try not to dwell on what are probably extremely rare cases.",

Maybe start with your PCP and some simple blood work. That could lead you in the right direction. Are you dealing with a lot of stress? I'm asking because that, too, can cause severe fatigue, and also needs to be addressed before it puts your health in jeopardy. So I would certainly consider severe fatigue as something that needs follow up, before it opens the gateway to something more serious. Hugs, Deanna",

The only suggestion I have, assuming you're in the US, if you aren't already at a major NCI-designated cancer center, is that you consider seeking a second opinion at one of them. The reason I'm suggesting this is that they are extremely thorough, plus all the various specialists you need will be under one roof or on one campus. These specialists are used to working together and will all have access to your records quickly, which should speed things up for you. Here's a link to them: https://www.cancer.gov/research/nci-role/cancer-ce... You mentioned 3 CTs. Were those simply different areas, such as chest, abdomen and pelvis?

Also, the fact that you mention pain in your knees led me to think it's something other than mets, as mets very rarely turns up in knees. Are you on thyroid meds now, or are they waiting to see if you recover naturally from whatever is going on with your thyroid function? That might explain the skin sensitivity. If I was in your situation, I would probably give it more time following R/T before worrying just yet. But if the pain becomes worse or truly is impacting your QOL, then you may want some additional blood work, etc., to figure out if something else is going on -- not mets necessarily, but something else that's gotten out of whack.

My first thought is that I agree with the new GP -- mets pain probably would be increasing and not remain intermittent. And as sorry as I am it's happened to you, her choice of the word \"drifted\" is stellar and a bit amusing because it seems to put the blame on you, rather than them \"dropping the ball\" or letting you \"slip through the cracks,\" more commonly used euphemisms here in the US. So if the blood work you had is clear, I do not get where the \"possible mets to chest wall\" is coming from, or why IF that is a possible concern, you are being referred back to a GP. Something isn't adding up. I'm not a doctor, but the intermittent pain sounds like something possibly to do with your spine, which an MRI will divulge if they include the spine. And your onc sending you back to a GP for a complete physical doesn't sound like he is overly concerned about mets, so it just doesn't quite make sense to me. At any rate, you are so right about needing to be our own advocates! I'm glad the new GP can see you quickly, and I hope you get an answer to your pain that has nothing to do with mets!

Lindahood, I'm going to offer another explanation for your friend's absence, which is simply that she might have something major aside from mbc going on in her life that's taking up her time and energy at the moment and putting seeing friends on the back burner. In other words, nothing at all to do with you personally, but she just has other demands (an illness besides her own in her family, for example) that needs the often limited amount of energy we have. The other explanation might be a sudden turn in her own health, in which case she might be totally focused on trying to get things back on a better track. I would probably just try to give it some time, but continue to communicate that she's on your mind and you look forward to getting together when she's up to it. genny, great news on your MRI!

Hopefully your friend has some better times ahead, and perhaps you can continue to stay in touch with her, especially if you have wonderful past stories to relive with her. Also, since she can't drive -- and assuming you're in the same area -- is there anywhere she might like to go that you could take her -- the beach, the mountains, the town she grew up in -- or anywhere she may be reluctant to come right out and ask someone to drive her?

In most cases, MJHJAN is correct. However, my only thought is that there is a threshold below which even PET will not pick up certain size lesions or lymph nodes. I doubt very much something would have changed significantly between December and April, but it would probably be worth telling your onc what you've observed and asking them to recheck both your lymph node and the PET imaging-- if only for your peace of mind, especially since it sounds from your description like it was extremely small and may have grown. But also keep in mind that any infection in that general region can cause a lymph node to swell, so probably, as MJHJAN suggests, no reason to worry. Hugs. Jeremy, I'm so sorry about your wife's bc dx and the concern that it may have even moved outside the breast. Hopefully, that won't be the situation, but even if it is, just know that newer meds are giving us many years, during which time we have to trust that there will be even more breakthroughs. The only advice I can give you is, be sure your wife is in the hands of docs who specialize in bc. That can make a big difference in everything, from the course of tx, to other available support services (such as having a physcologist on staff), to outcome. Plus, knowing her docs are bc specialists will help you both not second guess their recommendations and trust their advice and care. Also, where you are at the moment, not having a complete dx and waiting for the proverbial other shoe to drop, is an especially rough place to be. Once all the test results are in and your wife begins tx, things usually get a bit less stressful. And you've come to a great place for support. Stay with us here, but also look at this thread for even more support from those in similar caregiver roles. https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/16/topics... Please be sure to keep us updated!

The other thing that's confusing is that 10%, for example, does not necessarily mean 1 out of every group of 10.  You could be in a group of 100 where either no one has a recurrence or more than 10% have a recurrence, because it doesn't apply neatly to each group of 100.  So, it's almost mind-boggling to try to understand how statistics apply in real life!

I totally understand your fear of permanent hair loss.  I'm glad I didn't know about that going into TC, or that decision would have been even harder for me.  But you're using the Penguin Cold Caps, so have hopefully negated that potential.  And, to tell you the truth -- from my vantage point (3 yrs. out and all hair back and growing just fine) -- if I had lost my eyelashes, and if I had a choice, I would much rather be dealing with false lashes than metastatic bc.  So maybe you could add some icing to your lashes & brows (totally my idea, and not from any oncologist!) during your infusions, to ease that fear.  Also, unless you have some sort of pre-existing condition, I think a drop in RBCs low enough to require hospitalization and an infusion is very rare for a first time chemo. Assuming you handled the your first TC infusion well, based on what you've shared here, I would probably finish them, doing everything possible to minimize SEs, and then be able move on knowing I'd done the most aggressive tx possible.  Just my 2cents worth....    (((Hugs)))  Deanna ",

Cal) until your post.  I just took a quick peek at their website and found this claim: Effectiveness of the cancer treatment with hyperthermia offered at Bicher Cancer Institute for breast, head and neck, and prostate cancer was outlined in the summary of the paper published in the German Journal of Oncology: Complete response rates were 82% for breast patients, 88% for head and neck and 93% for prostate patients.  I don't know, but it seems to me that if they could promise these results, we'd all know about it and everyone would be flocking to them.  So while I wouldn't rule them out, I would definitely do some more due diligence in checking them out.

Lymphedema most often manifests in the arm, but there's also truncal LE, which can cause intermittent discomfort in the underarm, rib area and back due to fluid buildup that can come and go. You can search \"truncal lymphedema\" here for more information. Truncal LE tends to be exaccerbated by heat, so prolonged hot baths or using a hot tub can cause it to flare up. As far as pain from bone mets, I think it varies from person to person, especially depending on severity and location. For me, I would describe it as either a burning pain (ribs) or an aching pain (more in my back), and it tends to be worse for me in the late afternoon or early evening, depending on what I've done physically during the day. Hope this helps. Sending good thoughts that your scan will be totally clear, which I think you're wise to have for the peace of mind, as well as a baseline going forward. (((Hugs))) Deanna",

I think you will find a wide range of responses describing pain from bone mets because the pain can vary depending on which bone or nerves are involved. Plus everyone perceives pain a bit differently. In my case, the first pain I had was severe lower back pain that I chalked off to wearing boots after a summer of wearing nothing but flipflops. Then, after I learned I had extensive bone mets and before the Anastrozole I'm now on kicked in, the pain in my upper back and ribs was best described as aching and sometimes burning pain that begged for a heating pad and pressure (sitting with my back pressed against a chair) to relief the ache. Also... shortly after I was dx'd w/mets, I started having a stabbing pain shoot up my right shin. It got progressively worse over 3 mos. until it finally reached a crisis point and I had no choice but to go to the ER where I found out I had fractures in my femur and pelvis -- neither of which had ever really hurt until that crisis point when I guess the fractures significantly worsened to the point I literally couldn't move without excruciating pain. But that wasn't mets pain, per se. It was fractured bones, which occasionally is the way mets presents -- with a fracture that may or may not be painful at first, and maybe gets chalked off to a work-out injury or other type of overexertion. I hope and pray neither of you is dealing with mets, but a PET, CT or MRI (not an x-ray) might be a wise idea if your pain doesn't improve -- if only for the peace of mind of finding out it's hopefully not mets.

You're absolutely right that knee pain rarely, if ever, is a symptom of mets, and the more likely culprit is the Aromasin. But since an MRI didn't show anything, I'd personally want further imaging, just to be sure you don't have a hairline fracture that was somehow missed in the x-rays and MRI, or that the knee pain isn't referred pain from somewhere else, which can also happen, although it doesn't really sound like it in your case.

Assuming the pain in your thigh has lasted for three or more weeks, I think it's entirely reasonable to ask for a PET or CT. As far as how mets present, I think you'll find a wide range of experiences -- from deathly ill, as I was -- unable to fight off a wicked case of bronchitis or pleurisy (the only things urgent care docs found) that was causing horrible chest pain -- which led to a CT ordered by my onc, who I finally went to see to figure out if something more ominous might be going on. Sometimes it can be a specific pain, such as in a hip, that doesn't go away, and other times people have no symptoms at all and their mets are found incidentally while looking for something entirely different. There's really no one scenario. Are you on a bisphosphonate by any chance? Though rare, femur fractures can be a SE of those. http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1403799 As an aside, I struggled with horrible IBS for many years -- until I finally figured out (intuitively, and then via the IgG Food Intolerance Test) that I am highly wheat intolerant. I cut out wheat, and voila -- no more IBS. So if you haven't been tested for allergies, I highly recommend that. In my case, a naturopathic doctor ordered the test that clearly confirmed the problem. But I would definitely ask for a PET or CT if you haven't had one recently -- if only to ease your mind. (((Hugs))) Deanna",

But I have to compliment you on your very thorough grasp of the situation, and your great questions! I think in this situation, I would maybe slow up a bit on having a specific timeframe in mind for your umx and recon. I'm not suggesting that only b'cuz of the question about the lung lesion, but a month out from TCx6 seems like it might be a bit soon to be sure you'll feel strong enough to go through a Diep recon surgery. Plus you said \"hoping for Diep recon,\" which makes me wonder if there are more questions about it that need to be vetted prior to a final decision -- although perhaps it's just this new question mark about the lung lesion. At any rate, assuming you don't have a wedding or trip of other big thing you're trying to be finished in time for, if you take the one month post-chemo deadline out of the equation, it seems like that would slow things down a bit and take away the pressure of feeling you need to figure everything out so quickly, so you would be more comfortable with your onc's recommendations, which sound very sensible to me. One step at a time basically, in which there is much wisdom. As far as IF you'll need the umx IF the lung lesion is found to be metastatic... In the past and today to some degree, many oncs and medical teams would say no -- once your bc has metastasized, having an mx is not going to make a difference and could delay needed tx. But IF it is mbc, and IF you were to have a complete response to the chemo, and IF the surgery and healing wouldn't delay whatever is recommended next, then I think some medical teams might be open to proceeding with surgery. As far as knowing the receptor status of the lung lesion, I think that's an excellent question for your onc. I'm guessing doing a lung biopsy while you're on chemo if he doesn't have to is the preferred choice in a less than perfect situation. Hope this helps some! Please keep us posted on any updates. In the meantime, I'm going to hope & pray this is NOT mbc, and that you will be able to follow through in good time with your umx & Diep! (((Hugs))) Deanna ",

X-rays don't always show everything that's going on. Hopefully the ortho doc you're yet to see will order an MRI which will show things like arthritic changes. Could you possibly have a hairline fracture? That could be very hard to see on an x-ray, but would also account for increasing pain, and could have been caused by anything from a sports injury to osteoporosis. What bone mets feels like can be a very individual thing depending on where it is, the severity, whether it's affecting nerves, etc. For me, it's a burning or aching (more than sharp) pain. When I had a sharp shooting pain in my leg, it turned out to be a fractured femur -- and even then, the pain initially was not where the fracture was. Worrying about it is the worst and every little twinge adds to the worry. I hope you get swift approval for the bone scan to ease your mind. When is your appt. w/the ortho doc? Are you taking anything for the pain, such as Ibuprofen? Does it help? Deanna",

When you feel like it, come join us on the Bone Mets thread, where you'll find a very supportive group, most of whom have been exactly where you are now. You may also need a different pain med or meds. Not everything works for everyone. It's a very individual thing. More may not be nearly as effective as just something different, and sometimes a pain or palliative care doc is your best bet for finding something that works better than what you're doing now. Also, as you may know, it's very important to take any pain meds on schedule and not wait until the pain comes back so that you end of chasing it and never getting ahead of it. Just some thoughts that might be helpful... (((Hugs))) Deanna",

But mets to adrenal gland or node or diaphragm would be extremely uncommon. And that's interesting that nodes from your ALND had more bc than sentinel node(s) did. It sounds like they were really doing their job and catching those traveling bc cells, probably preventing them from going any further. Also the fact that your CA27-29 and CEA are within normal range is excellent news. And the low point is also pretty normal -- kind of a letdown of emotions after being so strong from Feb. 3 until now. But I honestly am not reading anything especially concerning into what was seen on your chest CT, and it doesn't sound like your onc is either. Hugs, and hang in there. And let us know how the CT of the pelvis goes. Deanna PS ~ I'm surprised they didn't do both CTs at the same time, since they're both very quick.",

Did the CT scan that was done rule out any problem in her bowel area? Is she still having the problems that sent her for a scan? Was that dx'd as something specific, or was she at least referred to a gastro doc? As far as the lung nodule -- it's not uncommon to have something like that show up on a scan. Often it's what's termed an \"artifact\" -- leftover damage from maybe having had pneumonia, for example. Do you know if your Mom has ever had pneumonia? I do think a wait and watch approach is logical. I'm just a bit surprised that they would wait 10 mos. for a follow. Perhaps there's a good reason for that (maybe the size is just so small that it would be hard to see a difference sooner?), but often 6 mos. is more common. Short of a possibly difficult and/or unnecessary biopsy, watching for any change is pretty standard. Depending on why they recommended waiting 10 mos., if you or your Mom aren't comfortable with the recommendation, you can ask about doing it sooner, or she can consider getting a second opinion, ideally with an onc who specializes in TNBC. These are more common at the larger NCI-designated medical centers. Hope this helps, and please keep us posted. Hugs, Deanna",

Pain from something going on with that is frequently centered, as you described, but can also be \"referred\" to other areas. I would maybe ask for an u/s to see of it's possibly inflamed for some reason, perhaps from chemo. The fact that your pain moves around, combined with your dx stats and, as Chrissy pointed out, that you're still doing chemo, makes me think it's something other than bone mets. I also second Chrissy's suggestion to be sure you're drinking enough water. Chemo, as you probably know by now, can be very constipating, and surprisingly, even pain from that can happen up quite high. I've had it myself when things were stopped up.

I would hope that one of your docs would check those as well. I'm not familiar with thickening of the colon wall, but agree with Chrissy that nausea can be an early sign of a liver issue. I also had a friend who recently had gallbladder surgery, only to discover that the severe nausea that surgery didn't help was due to an infection they'd missed in the duct attached to the gallbladder -- not the gallbladder itself. In his case, very yellow skin was another sign that something wasn't right.

As far as radiation creams, I also liked Aquafor, and also Emu Oil, which I used towards the end of my treatments.  The Emu Oil is especially good for fair skin, which I don't have, but which had been recommended for and by one of the gals having rads at the same time I was, so I tried it and loved it.  Your Mom's radiation oncologist may also have a preference for what she uses, so be sure to ask.  Also ask her rad onc about diet, but I would think being diabetic would trump any other concerns, but her rad onc may have some suggestions based on experience with patients similar to your Mom in age and health.  Let us know how she does!   And you may want to check the other threads here for the one that is for women starting radiation in the month your Mom starts, whether that's Oct or Nov.  There'll  be a thread for each, and it's great to share with other women who are all having the same treatment at the same time -- makes it not so lonely, and you pick up all kinds of tips and good info that way.    Deanna ",

Good luck with your decisions, and please keep us posted ~  Deanna P.S. Did you have an MRI?  That's another very important diagnostic tool, to be sure nothing else is going on in either breast.",

At least, that's how I'm looking at it. Although they no longer add up the mms to suggest total tumor burden, I just feel like the fact that you had 12 separate malignant areas might be more of a risk than your possibly exaggerated fear of lung damage or a secondary malignancy. I also dreaded the idea of RT, suggested in my case because of a sentinel node with extracapsular extension, as well as an unspecified margin. I also got multiple opinions (trying to get out of it), but what pursuaded me was the tone of the most \"pro RT\" one, a highly respected professor of RT, who said I needed it without question -- even though others had said it was my choice. And in the end, it was no big deal -- in fact, I would call it a piece of cake compared to surgery and chemo. Just my opinion, although I'm sure others may see it differently...",

Here's a list of the NCI-designated cancer centers:  http://cancercenters.cancer.gov/cancer_centers/map-cancer-centers.html Perhaps your health insurance doesn't even require a referral, in which case you could just make an appointment directly for a second opinion on your current tests and let them take it from there. The problem with not having a definitive explanation for the lump and underarm swelling is that our minds are extremely powerful, and if your current doctor(s) can't put your fears to rest, I'm afraid you could actually create illness by worrying about it.   You need a solid explanation for the symptoms, not just a \"no problem\" diagnosis.     (((Hugs)))   Deanna",

Lastly (and I know this is hard), try not to stress, especially if you are thinking about trying to get pregnant.  Maybe try to focus on relaxing and eating especially well, just to get your body as healthy as possible, in the hopes that a pregnancy will be in your very near future.

The other thought I wanted to add to what Claire has said is that today's statistics are based on yesterday's treatment protocols, and in many cases, those have changed, becoming much more targeted, within the past 4 or 5 years.  So better (3rd generation) chemo drugs and more advanced RT equipment should improve those very general stats 5, 10 & 15 years from now. And, like Claire, I had a horrendous fall about 10 days ago.  I had a deep gash in my chin that nicked an artery and took 8 stitches to close.  I had a concussion and broke my jaw in 2 places. Had I not been close to an ER, I, too, might have been an early Stage II statistic!! IMO, one of the most important things you can do for your Mom is be sure that she's getting top notch medical care.  BC treatment is not black & white, and different doctors may approach the same case with different recommendations.  Be sure she has positive doctors she trusts who are very positive about her prognosis.  If for any reason you don't sense that from them, encourage her to get a second opinion.  I personally think NCI-designated cancer centers offer superior expertise.  Next to early detection, where we are treated can make a big difference.   Take care & I'm glad you're there for your Mom!     Deanna",

Let me give you a couple of suggestions.  First, there's an entire section here for Stage III women.  Click on Forum Index above and look for it.   These days, Stage IIIB is very treatable, but it's also very important that you get aggressive treatment.  Not all doctors will recommend the exact same treatment, and sometimes you will have choices.  So second opinions can be extremely valuable to be sure you know all of your options, have doctors whom you really like and trust, and feel confidant that you are on the best course of treatment. The other thing I wanted to tell you is that many women work through their treatment.  Personally, I was not able to, but it depends a lot on your job and how you react to chemo. As far as telling people, sometimes it's a good idea to wait until you have your initial treatment lined up -- especially when it comes to telling people who will worry the most about you or who may be affected by any absences. Giving them specifics can quell a lot of speculation and unfounded concerns.  Hope this helps!  I'm glad you've found BCO!    Deanna",

The other thing that will probably be included in that sort of program, but which you can certainly look into on your own, are dietary and lifestyle changes to support breast health.  For example, Vitamin D is now strongly implicated in breast health and cancer prevention, as is exercise. And many of us who have had bc have figured out that there might be some sort of low thyroid connection, so now take Iodoral or other iodine supplement, as well as cutting back on hormone laden foods, such as meat and dairy.  A book I highly recommend is Anti-Cancer, A New Way Of Life, by David Servan-Schreiber, M.D., Ph.D.  He's a 2x cancer survivor, and his book is full of well documented things we can all to do decrease our risk.   Good luck, and let us know what you find out!   By the way, both my sister (2x) and 2 first cousins (also sisters) had bc before I was dx'd, and yet we have no known genetic link.  So what seems like a possible familial predisposition is often still a mystery.    Deanna",

There are actually a couple of factors that influence long range survival after an mbc dx. The first is how a patient responds to meds, but as you suspect, location of mets is also a factor. Newer stats show that many with bone only mets are surviving considerably longer than previously quoted averages. 10+ years is not uncommon. And if the mets is in one or just a few locations (ogliometastatic disease), the goal can be \"cure\" (although we realize that is a fluid situation) vs. control. This Consumer Reports link re. increased survival with mbc is based on a 2017 NCI study. https://www.consumerreports.org/breast-cancer/wome... And the following probability statistics were recently compiled from information in the SEER database. ",

As you pointed out, trials for mbc usually use an existing standard of care drug or drug combo, plus an additional drug. So until trial results are in, there's no way of telling if the added drug is doing anything above and beyond what the standard of care regimen would have accomplished. Do you know and can you tell us what the standard of care meds are in this trial? Has your wife had a Foundation One or similar genomic test done? They can be very helpful, but they're not infallible because meds that come up as viable options for a patient in vitro may not work exactly the same in our complex bodies. But the Foundation One or Caris are both easy (blood) tests to have done, and you would have those results in a couple of weeks. Do you know which genetic markers the trial drug targets? Some markers are fairly common; others are not. My other thought is... There are a good number of often very successful regimens for mbc aside from trials, but virtually all mbc meds have some SEs, so even if your wife was to go only with the standard of care she's now on, or another regimen, unfortunately, none are without SEs. But she would be able to drop the constant hospital visits for monitoring. I know I haven't given you an answer or even a strong opinion, but just tried to throw out some thoughts that might help you and your wife figure this out. Glad your wife is responding well to her tx! Best to you both! Deanna",

We all react so differently to this sort of situation, but I would suggest giving your Mother the benefit of the doubt, as well as your continued love and support.  Do you not talk with her regularly?   And have you asked her about her diagnosis and the recommended treatment?  Just as an aside, my husband's aunt, who is an energenic, youthful 70-ish, was dx'd with bc earlier this year.  She had a lumpectomy before she told anyone, including her 7 grown kids, and we only heard about it after she was finished with radiation.  And we'd had dinner with her the week she'd found out.  She just wanted to get the treatment over with, and didn't want people fussing over her.  I know this isn't the same as a Mother-Daughter relationship, but it's just an example of how we all react differently to these situations.    Deanna P.S.  Lisa ~ Still thinking about your situation, and just wanted to comment that having someone on your \"family history\" and giving someone access to your medical records are 2 entirely different things.  You can be noted as a living daughter, for example, in someone's medical records, but that does not automatically give you access to someone's medical records, even when their diagnosis can impact your health.  I just wanted to add this thought because I'm still a bit confused about exactly what you were upset about. ",

If I were you, I'd seriously consider going there (if you aren't already), mostly b'cuz they see more breast cancer than other oncologists see, so will have the most experience with situations like yours to guide future tx recommendations.  They are also extremely meticulous about testing and will carefully review your tests and treatment to date, as well as order whatever additional tests are necessary to figure out what's going on.   noonrider, I don't think a lot of women who are dx'd with Stage 1 bc move onto metastatic bc.  However, our peace of mind is extremely important, and perhaps a PetScan would ease your worries, as long as your insurance company will cover it.   And PTSD -- including the constant fear of a recurrence -- is very common immediately post tx, and usually does get better as you get all of your treatment (including BMX & recon) behind you and start to regain a sense of normalcy.  But it sounds like a PetScan might greatly ease your mind, so I would absolutely ask your onc about having one, and your planned BMX seems like a logical reason to do one.   (((Hugs))) and good luck to you both!    Deanna",

I think it's extremely rare for bc to go to the stomach or anywhere that would give you the type of pain you described as the first indicator that anything is going on, and my guess is it's something like your gall bladder acting up or severe reflux, which I've read can cause pain beyond what one would normally think of as for that. But definitely report it to your PCP if it's keeping you awake and is that uncomfortable. It's good to remember that we all had and will continue to have pain unrelated to bc, even after a bc dx. And the fact that a recent PET and MRI were both clean is another reason not to think this has anything to do with your bc. (((Hugs))) and please let us know what you find out. Deanna",

As far as your specific question, what I was told at UCLA that made so much sense is... you give any new ache or pain 3 weeks, and if it doesn't resolve within that time, you get it checked out. That way, you have an actual game plan to deal with a new pain, and it really helps because most do seem to resolve within 2 to 3 weeks. It may also help to remember that you had aches & pains prior to your bc dx, and will continue to have things come up that are totally unrelated to bc. And changing the scene, even for a day or a weekend, always seems to help my mindset. Just having new experiences and being around folks who don't know I had or have bc totally puts it on the back burner for me.

It seems to me that it would be very important to get the dx correct for whatever this is. Is it absolutely something new they're seeing? And why do they say it's malignant? I'm asking that because it's not uncommon for things to show up on our lungs that may look suspicious, but that are actually damage or artifacts from previous illnesses, such as pneumonia. Suzanne Somers wrote about her experience being dx'd with lung mets that turned out to be valley fever, and a friend of mine here in CA just had a similar scare that turned out to be some sort of infection vs. lung cancer. From what you've told us so far, I would absolutely seek a second opinion before having any tx. Just my opinion... (((Hugs))) Deanna ",

(1) You mentioned they saw \"signs of degenerative disc disease?\" Did your PCP think those \"signs\" were significant enough to be causing your pain? Are they in the same area as your pain? If yes to both, it seems like that should ease your mind a lot. And (2) What, if anything, did they suggest to treat that condition, assuming your pain is from that? Did they suggest anything to build your bones, such as maybe Xgeva or Prolia or other bone building drug? My only other thought is -- if you're not comfortable w/what you've been told and/or recommendations for the pain, and especially if the pain worsens, absolutely get a second opinion. A vague explanation is never satisfying. Be sure that you get a specific dx and a plan to treat it, hopefully with a reasonable time frame to expect results. Otherwise, I encourage a second opinion at some point to further ease your mind.",

Sadly, there have been one or two in FL that I recall reading about -- cases that made the national news involving unnecessary tx for what the patients were told were skin cancers. But I don't think I've ever heard of anyone in recent years in the US totally mis-dx'd for bc, although I suppose you could argue that in some situations DCIS might be treated more aggressively than necessary. But your assertion is not something most women, especially newbies, need to worry about. I absolutely agree with you about second opinions, but not for the reason you give. As far your post just above that one -- if you or anyone makes a statement about recurrence rates, you need to back them up with research and links so that we can decide for ourselves on the credibility of your sources. As far as I know, the acknowledged recurrence rate for bc is around 30%, which varies significantly depending upon each patient's initial stage and other aggressiveness factors. \"Almost always create recurrence\" is a totally ridiculous thing to alledge, as the majority of women who are treated for early stage bc don't have recurrences. And by the way, I am extremely pro integrative and alternative medicine. But allopathic meds -- not DIM nor apricot kernels (both of which I've used in the past, by the way) are keeping me and many other women here alive. Our doctors are well aware of the shortcomings of chemo, and thank God for the researchers who are working hard to bring new immunotherapy and targeted meds to market to replace them.

I'm also sorry for the concern that's brought you here now. Unfortunately, as you probably realize -- and contrary to what your doctor told you -- there is no time limit on breast cancer reappearing. However, there are many possible explanations for back and rib pain, so I certainly wouldn't be overly worried at this point. But I do have a couple of concerns I wanted to share. First, I'm wondering why your doctor is suggesting x-rays rather than a PET or CT scan or even an MRI, all of which would show so much more than x-rays will. I'm also wondering -- without trying to flip back to the Bone Mets thread to see if you said if he's a PCP or an onc -- if your doc has done any blood work at all, which will often also give some clues if anything suspicous is going on. A CA27-29, for example, would tell you if your tumor markers are elevated. These are just things you might want to ask about because I'm not convinced an x-ray is going to give you or your doc sufficient information. Please keep us posted! And I'm glad you've found BCO and were able to figure out the profile section. Deanna",

So that -- and/or a sluggish thyroid -- certainly could be at the heart of what's going on. But I also wanted to mention that the CA15-3 might be the least accurate of all the tests for tumor markers. UCLA uses both the CA27-29 and the CEA, and my local onc uses the CA27-29. I think fewer and fewer oncs are rely on the CA15-3. Also -- when you have blood work, be sure they do liver functions -- ALT, AST, and ALK PHOS -- which can also reveal potential problems. I'm so sorry about the stress, but I also think it's great that you are aware that your body is \"off\" in this way. That self-awareness is really important.

If it was simply due to a lack of estrogen, it just seems that it would be a much more common issue than it is. Besides -- and I say this with the utmost respect for docs -- blaming the RR on a med, rather than something connected to RT, sort of sounds like what specialists do. In other words, this adverse event has nothing to do with his or her tx, but rather an outside influence. But I also wanted to address your fear of Stage IV. Yes, you are at a higher risk than someone who was originally Stage I, for example, but there are many women who were dx'd at Stage IIIC who are many, many years out without a recurrence. I realize you are only a few months past your active tx, and hopefully this fear (which we all had) will lessen as more time goes by, because, in truth, there is very little rhyme or reason (at least not yet understood) as to why some of us recur and some don't. Please try not to stress over the current complication, as stress can actually be worse for us than anything else that's going on. Get the RR under control, and then try another A/I, if you and your RO feel Arimidex is implicated. Hugs, and hang in there. I know it must be very frustrating to feel like you are finally done with tx, only to have something like this pop up. I hope it goes away as quickly as it appeared.",

If she's anemic, it's probably not due to iron deficiency, but to her tx. If she needs calories, there are plenty of healthy non-animal products, such as avocado and nut butters.

I have no advice but wanted to suggest that you might want to repost your question in a couple of other forums here, where I believe you'll get more feedback. If you click on All Topics (to upper left), then scroll down, you will see discussion areas that I think might be more re;ated to the information you're after. Take a look at the sections headed \"Family Matters\" and \"For Caregivers, Family, Friends & Supporters,\" and maybe even \"Employment, Insurance & Other Financial Issues.\" You may find similar questions to yours already being discussed, and/or you may want to repost your question in one or more of those areas. The discussion boards here can be a bit confusing to navigate at first, but I have a feeling your questions will get more views and responses in those areas than they will on this page. Hugs, and prayers for your fiance's family. Lolis, thanks for the update. I'm glad to hear your bone scan was clear, but the other soft tissue, possibly a lymph node still sounds a bit vague to be sure it's Stage IV. But even if it is, the fact that it's limited to one location is a very good thing. If it's considered ogliometastasis, it would have an excellent prognosis. It's something you might want to ask about. Here's a link with some info': https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC42026... Hugs, Deanna",

Not sure why, but brain MRIs do seem to be the imaging of choice to rule out brain mets. A wait and see approach for an area that's inaccessible is really about all you can do, short of chemo to see if it makes a difference. But why risk chemo SEs if whatever is there is benign? As far as taking a long time to get a diagnosis, I would say your situation is a bit different. One thing you might consider is getting an opinion from a neurosurgeon -- not just an ENT. And I don't know where you're being treated, but if it's not at a major cancer center, having a radiologist at one of those who specializes in reading brain scans might yield a different opinion, just because they deal with far more brain imaging than a more local facility. So I would consider a second opinion on your imaging from a facility like those listed here (assuming you're not already being seen at one) while you wait and see. https://www.cancer.gov/research/nci-role/cancer-ce...

A brain MRI is the scan most commonly done to rule out brain mets. Not sure if a CT shows as much or why the MRI is more often used, but you might want to ask your onc or PCP if an MRI would show anything different than the imaging you had at the ER. The fact that it's gotten worse absolutely merits additional imaging. You mentioned not being on tamox, but what about normal menopausal symptoms? Could you possibly be perimenopausal? Fluctuating hormones are a big cause for migraines, although every day would be quite a severe situation. If it's any reassurance to you, while brain can be the first metastatic site for ER+ PR+ Her2- bc, it's uncommon. Most of us show up with bone mets, probably followed by something going on in liver of lungs. I totally agree with the other suggestions as well -- both checking sinuses and seeing a neurologist if your onc or PCP can't make a dx. I would also be sure to ask your PCP for a very compete blood panel, including blood sugar, etc. Good luck! Glad you came here for some reassurance. Please keep us posted on anything further you find out, but absolutely insist on whatever tests are needed to reach a dx, pain relief, and peace of mind! Deanna   ",

As long as the bone biopsy was sent to a reputable lab, the results should be accurate. Bone is a bit harder to do a pathology on than soft tissue because some of its characteristics can be lost in the degrading (breaking down of the bone) process if not done carefully. But, that said, I have a feeling what happened to you probably is that the reading radiologist jumped to an overly aggressive conclusion (\"highly suspicious for...\") based on your bc dx, and that the spot is B9. Have you been having pain there, or what led you to have the CT/MRI in the first place?",

Fat necrosis is the most common type of lump. Just not sure if yours is close enough to your original surgery site to be that. It can also be a benign cyst, or a totally new bc lesion (vs. a recurrence). If I was in your situation, I would make an appointment with your BS to check it out. Not suggesting this because I think it's overly concerning, but there's no use worrying about it or poking at it (something I would do) and possibly irritating it. Just get it checked for your peace of mind. As far as would it be Stage 4 if it's bc -- the good news is even some recurrences in chest nodes are no longer considered mbc or Stage 4.

Both are referred to as \"bone scans,\" but there's a bit difference in what they detect. If you had a nuclear bone scan, that should show any mets activity in your bones. Nuclear bone scans are usually used along with CT scans as follow up for those of us who have mbc. The CT shows any change (growth, shrinkage) in the area, while the nuclear bone scan shows uptake or degree of activity. A dexa scan, OTOH, is used to diagnose osteoporosis and osteopenia. It's a much simpler, quicker test. It does not require a nuclear injection, and it's not used to dx bone mets. Bone mets pain can vary from individual to individual, but in general, unless nerves are involved, it's a deep, aching pain that worsens, especially if it's not being treated. If you continue to have pain, I would probably ask for a PET scan or an MRI, but the fact that you've been dx'd with arthritis in your neck makes arthritis in those other areas seem like the most logical explanation for your pain.

I truly believe there is always hope, especially for someone just starting down the mbc path, because there are many treatment options she hasn't tried yet. If I could give her any advice, it would be to seek care at a major medical center vs. being treated locally. I say this because the larger university teaching hospitals see the most mbc patients, so will not be overly negative about her situation, but will offer her realistic hope, including a thorough workup to determine the best course of action going forward. I could be wrong, but I suspect her progression didn't totally happen while she was getting the treatment she already has, but may have been there and missed wherever she's being treated now, especially if they didn't do a PET scan prior to starting chemo. So I would strongly advocate for at least getting an opinion at one of the places on the list I'll link below -- even if she then takes that information back to a local team to facilitate.

The way de novo mets (mets upon initial dx) is most often discovered is via a Petscan or other imaging, often ordered because a patient has a very large breast lesion and/or sufficient multiple node involvement to ensure chemo, and that makes full body imaging prudent, to be sure it hasn't gone beyond the nodes. Or a scan might be ordered prior to surgery IF a patient has specific pain somewhere and mets needs to be ruled out because it could drastically change the treatment plan. But mastectomy surgery probably would not reveal a distant met, such as in a vertebrae or rib. Hope this helps, and try not to get ahead of yourself. If you have any concerns about mets at this point, be sure to voice them to your surgeon, who can decide if further imaging prior to surgery would make any sense in your situation. And good luck on April !. Deanna",

That said, I have always been very holistic about my health, so if I could justify the cost, I would probably check in with a CTCA center just for a second opinion, if mainly to get their expertise on complementary txs, as I have heard of some out-of-the-box thinking from them -- really unusual supplements, etc. -- that I believe are aimed at controlling SEs and building our health in general, more than curing. The main \"problem\" with CEA, I believe, is that most conventional health insurance will not cover things that are not standard of care, which usually includes everything alternative and almost everything that can be classified as complementary. But certainly if money is no object, why not compare their approach? A few women here on BCO have reported being happy with their care @ CTCA. I, OTOH, have been thrilled to be at at an NCI-designated cancer center (UCLA) -- and I think Michigan is as well, although I haven't looked at the list -- because every tx they've put me on has been leading edge -- usually at least 6 mos. ahead of women who are treated by local, general oncs who often are not quite as up on the very latest research when it comes to bc and mbc. Just my two cents worth!",

Saw this thread and thought I might be able to share some experience.  You rub a bit of the Tee Tree Oil into your cuticles and nails at bedtime.  Yes, it has a heavy pine smell because it's from a conifer-like tree.  I did it 2 or 3 times a week, when I thought of it, and it does help.  If you haven't purchased it already, in addition to a liquid, it's available (if you can find it) in a little round metal tin that has more of a solid texture (like soft wax) that's easier to rub on and doesn't smell quite so strong. Putting ice on your nails (fingers & toes) during infusions will help prevent the chemo drugs from circulating to your nailbeds.  If your infusion center doesn't supply ice or ice mitts (at least one drug company makes mitts, so some infusion places offer them), then bring your own.  You can even use a bag of frozen veggies (sounds weird, but that's what I did) to cut down on the mess of melting ice.  If your nails are already lifting, you can gently tape them down to try to save them.  Someone in my August 08 chemo group recommended wig tape, which is especially gentle to remove, so will not lift damaged nails further.  Hope this helps!    Deanna",

Sadly, when it comes to mbc especially, I don't think there are even totally accurate stats on conventional tx, no less alternatives. I also think that our bc's are each so individual, you are likely to run into similar experiences with both -- women who went alternative at a lower stage and did/didn't progress and/or survive, just like those who went conventional. But who knows -- perhaps some bc never would have progressed no matter what they did or didn't do. I have personally known at least two women who did exceptionally well with mostly alternatives for many, many years, although they both eventually succumbed to mbc after seeking conventional tx when they felt alternative options were no longer helping them -- much the same as people who more frequently do it the other way, looking to alternatives only after conventional medicine has nothing left to offer them. And those who did the mostly alternatives route (and I say mostly because I never knew their original dx or tx -- only knew them after they'd been mbc for 20+ years) were quite wealthy and could afford the tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars it cost to seek tx at clinics in various far flung locations. The fact that conventional medicine for cancer is now focusing on immunology I think points to some interesting common ground, as many alternative docs and protocols, from Dr. Burzinsky (the famous TX doc) to simple Vitamin C infusions, focus on building the immune system (vs. killing the cancer cells), albeit only with natural substances or holistic therapies. What I personally do not like about alternatives for cancer -- especially breast cancer because there are so many variations of the disease -- is the one protocol fits all mentality, which I have personally run into with alternatives. In other words, practitioners who have had good results with other bc or other cancer patients, thus are positive their tx will work for you. I think this is incredibly naive compared to sophisticated testing and expertise of docs who deal with bc 100% of the time, although I suppose conventionals are also somewhat limited as of yet when it comes to truly personalized options.",

You're right, day 3 & 4 seem to be when the worst SEs hit for many of us -- often including flu-like symptoms.  If she can ride those out and not suffer any worse SEs over the course of her treatment, she might be able to handle the TAC.  Knowing what to expect and having the support of others going through it can also help greatly, so I would definitely suggest that you get her on-board here at BCO.  It can be an absolute lifeline for getting through treatment.

Once bc cells have escaped from the breast and lymph nodes near the breast, the diagnosis becomes Stage IV, which doesn't charge because of the reason Chrissy gave you. But in your Mother's situation (assuming there are no known active areas) it sounds like she might now be considered Stage IV (because bc cells were found elsewhere) \"in remission\" -- as opposed to \"stable\" (when there are known areas of disease, but they're not changing or worsening), or \"progression\" (in which case the disease is active and a change of meds is the usual course). Hope this helps! (((Hugs))) to you and your Mother! Deanna",

Bone mets can start anywhere, but my first thought is, are you on Tamoxifen or an aromatese inhibitor, because those are more often the culprit. I doubt very much you'd be walking around pain free during the day and would only hurt when you're lying flat if you had untreated bone mets going on for awhile. But as you said, not sleeping well for many months isn't good for your health either, so I think some sort of imaging is probably in order to get to the bottom of it -- maybe an MRI, rather than being exposed to the rads from a CT or PET. An MRI should show if there's a skeletal irregularity that's causing your pain. Good luck, and let us know what you find out. Deanna",

That kind of painful swelling more often occurs in the arm on a surgical side, as I'm sure you know, but many of us have had it show up in the truncal area you're describing -- underarm, over ribs -- and it can be surprisingly painful. When mine flares, it's often because of heat from something like a hot bath or hot tub (which I no longer do for that reason), or just getting overheated on a hot day. One clue would be if there's any noticeable (compared to the other side) swelling detectable in that area. If you push gently on it, does it briefly leave an imprint, especially compared to the other side? Other than that, if you had a clear scan 6 mos ago and didn't have any pain at that time, it seems doubtful that mets could appear and also become that painful in such a short time. So if by any chance it is truncal LE, you can find more info' on that here. I'm pretty sure there's an entire thread about it. Other than that -- and assuming your TMs turn out to be normal -- if the pain persists, maybe ask for a limited MRI of that area. No radiation w/that, and it would reveal if you possibly have a hairline fracture or other skeletal issue unrelated to bc. Hope this helps. I'd also be interested in knowing more about the trial you're in. Is there a thread here about it? If not, can you tell us more? Deanna",

To answer your question, unless pressed to do so -- which will be in each patient's own timing -- I don't think most oncs will venture a survival guesstimate, because that's really all it is. So much depends on how well we respond to meds, which varies significantly from patient to patient. Plus, our minds are so powerful that I think, again, unless pressed for some sort of time frame, most oncs would rather not plant the seed of 2 years or 5 years of whatever current stats might suggest, which are only as good as txs 2, 5, or 10, etc., years ago. I hope and pray your DH's upcoming scans show a great response to his tx. Triple P, what you're describing sounds like arthritis or maybe even carpel tunnel syndrome. Mets can start in joint areas -- especially the hips -- but seldom, if ever, have I heard of it appearing in a wrist or finger joints, which are very typical sites for A/I induced arthritis. Have you had an MRI to figure out what's going on? If arthritis, I've found the supplement curcumin to be very helpful. If the problem is very severe, you might ask about switching to another A/I, or taking a short break, both of which can often help.",

So if your pain isn't better in another week or so, I don't think it's unreasonable to see if your onc thinks a CT or MRI might be prudent. There are so many things it could be, but on the slim chance it's something going on in the pelvic bone, such as a hairline fracture, continuing to walk and put weight on it isn't going to help it and will probably worsen it. And that sort of fracture could be due to all sorts of things related (or not) to your tx hx, even the A/I you're on. If your pain isn't better in another week, I'd get it checked out.

As far as fearing you have mets now... I think the fact that your sentinel node was doing its job so well might actually be a sign against that having happened. That said, I did have a PET scan prior to starting chemo, and it was totally clear. I perhaps foolishly declined an aromotese inhibitor after chemo, and I'm sure that was far more a factor in my situation than the positive node with extracapsular extension.

The logic behind not scanning in the absence of symptoms is two-fold... first that repeated scanning carries its own risk, as well as being costly; and secondly that questionable scan results often lead to unnecessary biopsies. Routine scanning to check for mets might find something a bit sooner, but the constant anxiety would be far worse than finding something a bit later. In general, a good rule of thumb is to allow 3 weeks to see if odd symptoms or pain goes away. Most of the time it will.

Many of us have dealt with bloating caused by our treatments, and weight gain can also occur, especially if treatment has altered her habits, including how much exercise she's getting. Are the stats shown on your post yours or hers? If they're hers and she was treated in 2015, then she should absolutely report any lingering concerns to her onc, so that he or she can decide if some sort of imaging would be helpful to see what's causing the hip pain, for example. Beyond that, it's hard to comment with such limited information, but I would also be sure she's taking a good probiotic supplement. Tummy issues result from chemo destroying all the bacteria, good & bad, in our stomachs and intestinal tracts, and that takes a long time to rebuild. This is where a good probiotic can be helpful. Also, depending on your Mom's age, the things you mentioned can also be simply menopause related. Her onc and/or GP really needs to help her figure out if there's a cause beyond age and/or lifestyle changes. Deanna",

Cive has already given you excellent advice, and I just want to echo that how anyone of us does depends entirely on how we respond to tx, which is something no doctor can predict. I also want to point out that any survival stats you may find on-line do not include newer meds, such as the block buster drug, palbociclib (Ibrance), to which many women are having remarkable responses. Newer survival predictions definitely indicate an upward trend, especially for those with bone-only mets. And there are many new drugs, therapies, research stuff, in the pipelines, so plenty of reason to be optimistic, even if you do hear those dreaded words, \"Stage IV.\" As far as what tx you'll receive, my best guess is that it will probably be something systemic, such as an aromatase inhibitor & targeted therapy, or perhaps some sort of chemo. If your recurrence is in a bone, such as the sternum, surgery probably won't be helpful. R/T for advanced bc is more often used to treat especially painful lesions that do not respond sufficiently to oral meds. Hope this answers a few of your questions!

And if your Mom isn't already at an NCI-designated facility, that would be my first choice -- just because they are exceedingly thorough, they see the most breast cancer patients, so will have the most expertise re. her particular subset of patients (her age, ILC, any pre-existing conditions, etc.), and they are on top of the latest research because they're the institutions doing it. As far as mets without positive nodes -- yes, it happens because bc cells can also travel via blood. However, what I've observed is that it tends to happen later. In other words, someone had bc 5 or 10 years ago, turns up with metastatic disease, and is dismayed because it wasn't ever in a lymph node. However, new research is showing that bc cells can and do travel to and seed in distant sites without positive nodes, so all the more reason for a recommendation for systemic tx, because with a large tumor, it's probably been there long enough for this to potentially happen, depending on the aggressiveness of the cells. Hope this helps. I hope even more your Mom's bone scan is totally clear, as I think it will be.

OTOH, if that's representative of the extent of knowledge and follow up interest in that office, that's not the kind of care you or any of us needs. As others have said, bone mets only -- IF that's even what it is -- is very treatable, with a very good long range prognosis. Do not believe anything you may come across on the internet, as newer txs in recent years have made a big difference in survival. One day and one step at a time, but I just wanted to encourage you to listen closely to your gut about your current onc when you see him. And an MRI, while helpful for ortho issues, is probably not sufficient alone to dx bone mets. Ideally you should now because of the concern (suggested by a doc I don't have confidence in either from your description), you should have a whole body PET or PET/CT, as well as total blood work, including tumor markers and liver functions.

It really does sound like you are being rushed into tx without having a full picture of your situation. Unless you are truly in agonizing pain, the rush to treat with R/T may not be in your best interests, as there is a limit to how much radiation any of us can have, especially to a particular area. And so many times simply getting on the right med will make a huge difference in your pain level very quickly, thus saving the R/T for possible future use. I would urge you to find out exactly how big those 3 lesions are, as well as how it was determined they're absolutely mbc, and why R/T is being recommended. If any of your lesions are huge or pressing on a nerve and causing pain that affects your QOL or ability to walk, starting rads as quickly as possible might be a blessing. But short of that, I totally agree with Jen that this seems oddly rushed when you haven't even seen your onc yet and may not have a clear picture of the situation. Keep us posted!!!",

I think the bottom line is, we're all individuals, and we each need to figure out what makes us feel the healthiest. And, as was pointed out by several of you, being very rigid -- whether than means not eating sweets to one person, or not eating meat to someone else -- probably is more of a negative influence than a few bites of something outside your normal choices. I also want to mention -- just for the record -- that my style of vegetarian or vegan eating is fairly close to the fully raw diet advocated by Christina (can't think of her last name, but you can search \"Fully Raw Christina\" on YouTube to see her videos). I don't construct elaborate raw creations that taste like lasagne or chocolate cake or whatever. But when I talk about eating mostly vegan, I do mean mostly raw fruits & veggies, including a wide range of salads and other veggie concoctions, as well as a lot of fruit. I do things like hummus, nuts and European cheeses (because I think they're \"cleaner\") for protein. This isn't because I set out to be this hardcore; my taste has just evolved over several years to prefer eating this way. But this thread has helped me realize that having an occasional piece of fish or an occasional egg or other animal protein, might supply some nutrients I'm missing, and probably isn't going to make my cancer cells grow any faster than they would otherwise. And thanks for reminding us about David Servan-Schreiber's book, Bestbird. I was a huge fan and probably recommended it ad nauseum the first time I read it back in 2009, but must admit I was so focused on restricting methionine, I kind of forgot about his advice. But I still have the book and want to re-read it now from my Stage IV perspective. Hugs & thanks to everyone who took the time to share their insight and ideas!   ",

So I think it would be helpful if you could clarify some of that -- exactly what kind of docs you've seen, what tests you've had (have you had a \"punch test\" (skin biopsy)?, and what you mean by a specialty clinic. I do not have IBC, so can't speak to your specific symptoms. But it's no secret that younger women especially can be brushed off by gynos and other docs who have never even seen a case of IBC, because it is rare. And unless the correct test is done properly, things can be missed. I sadly recall a young woman who was on BCO several years ago (can't think of her name at the moment) -- in her late 20's with 5 or 6 small children, and her IBC was missed for more than a year until it was Stage IV. OTOH, the fear of IBC or any bc can absolutely make some women behave irrationally and never find comfort in any B9 dx. For your own peace of mind, I would strongly urge you to go to the closest major cancer center for a proper evaluation. The breast specialists there will be very familiar with IBC because they see more of it than local docs, and they will not mis-dx you. Here's a list: http://cancercenters.cancer.gov/cancer_centers/map... As others have suggested, I would absolutely not submit to another brain scan at this point unless there's a reason you haven't made clear in your earlier posts. JMHO.

In my case, for example, after I'd had a lumpectomy that showed some additional problems that ideally needed to be addressed with a mast., I was miserable trying to get my head around that possibility.  Then I saw breast reconstruction photos and realized a reconstructed breast didn't look bad at all -- in fact, they looked amazingly normal.  The same with deciding about uni or bi-lat mast.  At some point, I had a realization about nipple sensation being more important to me than the fear of developing bc in my other breast.  And similar things happened when I was deciding about chemo and rads -- both of which I had a very hard time agreeing to do because they seemed so against the natural lifestyle I've always lived.  But at some point, someone gave me information I hadn't heard, or an analogy or a story that made the lightbulb go on for me.  And that's one reason this board is so invaluable -- because it gives us a chance to hear from hundreds of women who all have something unique to contribute. As far as someone going on vacation before they have their surgery, I think the option to do that depends a lot on the type of bc you have.  With non-aggressive in situ bc, it can't move to a lymph node.  On the other hand, a woman dx'd with a more aggressive bc -- even though it's been there for many years to become large enough to be discovered -- probably shouldn't wait an extra three months.  So I think the answer is to take the time you need -- but not more than you absolutely have to -- if that makes sense.  God bless you, and I'm sure you will also reach a decision that you know is the right one for you.  Deanna ",

Assuming what was found is still a small lesion, it doesn't sound like chemo would necessarily be recommended for her based on her pre-existing conditions, age, and the fact that her bc is a Grade 1, or slow growing/dividing bc.  Of course, I'm not a doctor, and that's just my initial impression, but hopefully it will be the case. The other thing is that a very healthy diet that's good for future bc prevention is also good for all of those other conditions you listed. So hopefully, after some surgery to remove the lesion, she will be able to eat extremely healthy and possibly even improve all of her other conditions.     Deanna ",

So my first suggestion is possibly a second opinion to review what's been done to date, to see if they can find anything your present docs haven't.  My other thought is, since I also had a unilateral Diep, there's no way I'd go through that again for just one side if I knew I needed a mast on the other side and an implant.  IMO, it's way too much surgery and recovery to do it if you can't do both sides or are not able to keep your other breast.  I only had enough tummy tissue to do one side, and while UCLA encouraged that and I'm thrilled with my results, I do worry, what if... I think I read during my own diagnosis that as many as 3% of cases of bc that present as bc in lymph nodes or elsewhere, the original breast tumors are never found.  However, with several positive nodes, it seems like it should be large enough to find, so that certainly is a frustrating mystery.  But I'm glad they have you on chemo while you continue to research and figure out what to do.   I'm glad you've found BCO.  Please keep us posted on your situation.    Deanna",

Some have even voiced concern that this radiation could travel across the ocean and impact California. There is no increased risk of harmful levels of radiation exposure in the United States, based on the situation to date and a review of actual monitored levels by AQMD as well as other public health officials and technical experts. The South Coast Air Quality Management District, your local air pollution agency, has operated radiation monitors for several years for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). AQMD monitors radiation levels at three sites in Southern California and sends the radiation measurements every hour to EPA.  The California Department of Public Health also operates an additional radiation monitor in Southern California.  Starting today, you can get a daily update regarding levels of radiation in Southern California at AQMD's website at http://www4.aqmd.gov/enewsletterpro/t.aspx?S=2&ID=12&NL=8&N=22&SI=57644&URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.aqmd.gov%2f.  Monitors operated by AQMD/EPA will detect any change in outdoor radiation levels.

Early in the regimen, I experienced some gastro issues (nausea, reflux, heartburn), but they were all fleeting. More recently, I've had hot flashes, which is a bit odd, since I am well past menopause. Hair thinning for me has meant shedding -- hair on my clothes and a significant amount in my hair brush vs. anything others would notice. It's slowed down considerably the past few months, perhaps partly the result of cutting back on washing it to 1x/week, which also means less frequent drying/styling. I also now drag out having it colored to every 7 or 8 weeks. And I've also had the very tender scalp at times. Another bothersome SE I've had is bloating, which is helped some with (1) eating fewer cruciferous veggies; (2) an OTC gas med, when needed (the chewables work fastest for me); and (3) eating natural sauerkraut, a probiotic. Before I did these things, there were some nights (it's worst after dinner) when I looked 5 mos. pregnant -- the bloating was that bad. Recently I've experienced some weight gain. It's only a few pounds, but it's totally around my midsection -- the \"middle age spread\" I never had before -- and some of my jeans no longer fit right nor are they comfortable. My nails are thin and have developed deep ridges (like a vertical washboard) and even some horizontal \"dips.\" I wish I had the fast-growing nails SE! Mine have never looked this bad! I am still on 125 mg., but I normally have to wait 10 to 14 days for my counts to rebound enough to start my next cycle. In spite of all this, I love and am very grateful for Ibrance. I think you just learn to roll with the punches... Deanna PS ~ We're all different, but I would venture a guess that one reason I've avoided mouth sores, UTIs and some other common Ibrance SEs is that I have always been a supplement user, including Vitamin C, which may help to prevent those things. I'm not recommending it for anyone else, but I've used supplements for 35 years and have always believed they've kept me very healthy, except for having mbc.   ",

Your question reminded me of a similar one that was asked here recently.  I just looked it up and will try to give you a link to that thread, too: http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/91/topic/732214/729990?page=1#post_1252560 Hope this helps, and good luck with your surgery!    Deanna",

As far as seeing a reconstructive plastic surgeon now, I don't think I would delay your surgery for it. As long as your breast surgeon knows you want future reconstruction, he should be able to take that into consideration and leave the appropriate amount of skin. OTOH, if you can get a quick appointment with a plastic surgeon and it will ease your mind, that's fine too. I would just be sure to discuss your desire for recon with your surgeon, so that he can take that into consideration. As far as no rush suddenly turning into one, I think \"no rush\" meant you didn't have to panic and make surgery decisions within the first week or two without gathering as much information as possible. But, as you said, it's now been 10 weeks, so your surgeon's desire not to wait any longer is understandable. Good luck with your surgery! You sound like you're in a much better frame of mind than you were a few weeks ago! Hugs, Deanna",

The NP at the top breast center where I'm being treated once asked me, \"What happened in your life 10 years ago?\"  Before I could answer, she added, \"Well, if there was something stressful, hopefully you're not dealing with it now.\" I've recently shared that comment with two new friends who are also in treatment for bc, and both realized that they too had had major stresses in their lives 10 years ago (a bad business partner; a teenage son's addition problem). I don't personally believe any one stress or factor causes bc, and I don't think that's what the NP was implying.  But, from what I've read, it's most likely a number of things -- physical, environmental, and psychological -- that impact our immune system until one day it just can't function properly.  So perhaps for some, a major stress was just \"the straw that broke the camel's back,\" so to speak.  And I think that 10 years is how long it normally takes a mutated cell to divide and grow to become a big enough lesion to be seen on a mammogram.       But there's definitely a connection between stress, which depletes our bodies of nutrients and causes certain hormones to over produce, and illness.    Deanna    ",

Anyway, just to add my two cents worth... I started out at an upscale, local hospital with a surgeon who had just gone into private practice, but had been at a local breast center.  And when things about the pathology from my lumpectomy just didn't sound right, I followed my sister's urging (she's in cancer research) and went to UCLA, which is 2 to 3 hours away, depending on traffic, where I was shocked to find out what had been overlooked locally.  My bio page tells the whole story, but the bottom line is I ended up with a much better experience, including significantly better recon options than I ever would have had locally. When it came time for chemo, UCLA wanted me to do that locally, just in case I had any problems, my onc & records would be here. But my UCLA onc stayed involved, so I felt I really got the best of both worlds -- a brilliant, younger onc from UCLA plus a wonderful, mature local onc with 30+ years of hands-on onc experience.  And a similar thing happened for rads.  UCLA referred me to a local rad onc at an exceptionally top-notch local RT facility (same hospital as my onc) who had been a highly thought of resident @ ULCA.  And again I felt that UCLA's involvement somehow assured me of getting especially good care locally. So I am in complete agreement with the others.  I opted for convenience and what I thought would be comparable care initially, but switching to an NCI-designated cancer center was a whole different ballgame and something I strongly urge others to consider based on my experience.     Deanna ",

You also have to keep in mind that cancer cells are tricky and they tend to mutate. This is one reason cancer is so hard to stop, because it has the ability to change its structure to survive or outwit chemo.     Deanna  ",

I certainly don't want to alarm you because chances are your symptoms are not related to IBC.  But I strongly believe in following our gut instincts, and on the one chance in several thousand that this is something serious, I would just encourage you to find a breast surgeon and ask that IBC be ruled out, which they can do with a type of skin biopsy.  A breast surgeon (the specialists who deal only with conditions of the breast) can be found at most comprehensive cancer centers, including those listed here:   http://cancercenters.cancer.gov/cancer_centers/map-cancer-centers.html Good luck, and please let us know what you find out ~  Deanna",

There were other treatment recommendations (oncology, in particular) with which UCLA did not agree.  Perhaps all community hospitals -- in spite of the Comprehensive Breast Center sign on the building -- are not as good as others.  You have one in your area that is exceptional, but many newly-dx'd women may not be able to discern the differences.  I also found noticeably more concern for my emotional well-being at the larger facility, which sounds very different from what you've experienced.  They never pushed me into anything, but always took the approach that each treatment option is your decision, and you have to decide and be totally comfortable with what you're doing.  So, maybe we've each had the best of their particular type of facility. (edit) I just wanted to add... The surgeon I used wasn't actually a general surgeon, although a couple of those names had been given to me by the breast center.  The surgeon I used is connected to the breast center and known as a breast cancer surgeon; but I found out later that she also does other cancer surgeries, such as melanomas.  When I said general surgeon, I was trying to differentiate between those who do only bc sugery, and those who do anything else, but general surgeon really wasn't the correct term.",

You will be surprised at how each one will add something to your knowledge bank that will help you understand your dx and make any necessary decisions, no matter whom you eventually choose. Like anything else, experience goes a long way, and barring personality issues, I would probably opt for a surgeon who specializes only in breast cancer vs. a general oncological surgeon who probably does far fewer bc surgeries each year. To add to your resources, here's a list of NCI-designated cancer centers where you will find breast (only) surgeons. If there's one within a reasonable distance of where you live, you might want to add it to your list of possibilities. http://www.cancer.gov/research/nci-role/cancer-cen... I've also had good luck finding local docs who either were residents or interned at one or more of these major cancer centers, because they have a very detailed and well thought out way of approaching things. Oh, and be sure to take someone with you to your appointments who can carefully observe and may pick up on things you might miss, because spacing out is a totally normal reaction when a surgeon starts talking about bc surgery and we realize the patient they're talking about is us.

(1) For blood draws, have them use a butterfly needle in the back of your hand, but just watch and be sure they don't try to go too close to where two veins come together. It should be relatively painless.  (2) for procedures requiring larger needles, see if they can get it into the back of your wrist.  That's not a preferred location, but it works for me.  (3)  Be well hydrated anytime you know you'll need a needle stick. Drink a quart of water before your appointment.  (4) Ask them to use a heating pad to make your veins pop.  Most oncology offices have little ones they stick in a microwave for a few seconds.    If a nurse or tech can't get a vein on the 1st or possibly 2nd attempt, I insist that they call someone else who's better at it.  It's amazing to me how many lab techs and even some nurses just don't have good needle techniques.      Deanna",

Anyway, it's an April 2009 study, and what concerns me is this conclusion, which reads in part: \"...a trend for worse outcomes was observed in women with macroscopic nodal metastases who underwent SLNB alone. This was true for both recurrence rate... and survival rate... No differences in outcomes were observed among women with microscopic nodal metastases.\" So, personally, I think I would still question not doing the ALND IF your sentinel node tests macro positive, which, of course, we're all hoping it doesn't.  Another interesting thing I read is that there is no difference in outcome if you have the ALND at the same time as the SNB or later.  So, perhaps that's an angle you could use to bargain with your surgeon -- that you would consider doing the ALND in a separate procedure later, depending on the outcome of the SNB -- but that you would need time to re-evaluate it when you actually know the outcome of the SNB.  Just some additional food for thought ~  Deanna",

There were definitely times I felt like I was living a nightmare.  There were times when I wondered if I'd ever feel well and energetic again.  And there were times when I got sick of being so engrossed with bc, and so focused on how I felt.  But I have to tell you, everything I did was so worth it.  I am back to walking 4 to 5 miles a day, taking extra good care of myself with nutrition & supplements, and feel that I've done and am doing everything I can to be sure it doesn't come back.  If it does, we'll then I have to believe it's in God's hands and at least I've done everything I can and won't be replaying those decisions and wondering if I should have done more. Yes, there will be days or weeks when you'll feel like crap, but the day will come when it will all be behind you.  I think your onc's timetable is just about right, and I believe it's a process well worth moving through -- especially since you have 2 positive nodes.

As pro-natural healing as I am, I would so like for you to be right about not needing diseased nodes removed.  But I can't help believing that really skilled and dedicated breast surgeons would not take out nodes needlessly, and that there would be more research to dis-prove the need for ALND if even a handful of them were in line with the belief that it's not necessary, or even harmful re. fighting our bc.

In the mean time, I think it's really important to have your diagnosis and the recommended treatment confirmed by a breast surgeon/specialist.  Do you know if you've seen that kind of doctor yet -- someone who only deals with breast issues 24/7?  That's really the best type of doctor to confirm what you've been told, and to be sure you're getting a thorough diagnosis and the proper treatment recommendation. As far as smoking goes -- yes, it can absolutely complicate any surgical procedure because it constricts  blood flow, which impairs healing.  Can you possibly stop smoking?  I don't know off-hand the stats re. how long it takes to reverse whatever damage smoking has done to your blood vessels, but I think it would give you a better chance of having a successful duct procedure, if that's what's needed, as well as improve the outcome of any future surgery. Hope this helps some.  I'm glad you've found BCO, and I hope you'll get more input soon.   (((Hugs)))  Deanna",

If I ever need one in the future, I might be a bit reluctant to be a new doctor's first patient for this particular procedure.   Good luck, and please keep us posted on your experience and outcome.

As someone who has always been very alternative minded (never used meds prior to bc dx) and followed my ND's advice on hormone balancing post-tx, up to but not including using an estrogen supplement (I used Testosterone and DHEA)... I think the time to balance your hormones is PRIOR to a bc dx, which sadly few of us even know about at that point. After those bc cells exist and know how to reproduce, I think it's really a crap shoot, and very easy to trigger their proliferation in spite of the thoughtful advice of the best holistic practioners in the world -- just b'cuz they are so mutant and adaptive. I would not give them any known \"fuel.\" Just the opinion of someone who did not do an A/I due to a serious adverse reaction to one of them, and ended up with bone mets, which might have happened anyway, or might have been destined because of the delay in finding and treating some of my bc (detailed on my bio page), or any number of reasons. But there's absolutely no way I would tell a woman who has had bc to take estrogen now. I realize suicidal thoughts are a very serious issue, but you also have no assurance that estrogen will fix that. I'd seek out as many docs (conventional, alternative, everything...) as you possibly can until you find answers other than estrogen. And I have a friend who takes 3x the recommended amount of Melatonin (12 mg) and swears by it. Deanna (edited to fix a typo)",

The idea of using frozen veggies came from the very common practice of using a bag of frozen veggies as a coldpack, like for common kid's injuries. We're all different, but I didn't have any problems (after my initial infusion when I didn't know about icing) with my very simplistic method.  I guess my point is, do what's comfortable for you, but as long as your fingertips and toes stay cold (too cold for the Taxotere to circulate much there), you shouldn't have a problem, and don't need to worry about doing it correctly or perfectly.     Deanna ",

Beyond that, most bc lesions are not typically round like a BB.  They are more often irregular and/or spiculated (shaped a bit like a spider).  So I think both statements are pretty true.  The tiny round things we sometimes feel in our breasts are often cysts, clogged sweat glands, or other benign things.  OTOH, with MRI, we are also finding much smaller malignant lesions. The bottom line is, no lump, thickening or other irregularity should ever be ignored.  It's always best to get the opinion of a breast surgeon/expert.    Hope this helps ~  Deanna ",

I also just pulled up recent research that, just perusing the headline, seem to say that pre-adjuvant chemo might be a wiser choice with fewer risks than axillary node dissection (ALND). In other words... if I am understanding the limited information on this link, as I didn't try to get access to read the entire article, this is very forward thinking to save your level 1 & 2 nodes. But that said, it doesn't mean it's necessarily the only approach, as you've already learned. http://www.uptodate.com/contents/neoadjuvant-thera... As you've probably know by now, neoadjuvant chemo is most often done in two situations -- to shrink an extremely large tumor (as Gracie pointed out above), or with TNBC, which is especially aggressive. And what it sounds like is that perhaps observationally they've figured out that doing this saves women from needing ALND, which can lead to a lifetime risk of lymphedma. If I was in your situation, I would probably do a couple of things. First, I would ask MSK to explain their rationale for recommending neoadjuvant chemo. They should be able to point to research (i.e. the article linked here or others) that is influencing their current thinking. Secondly, because even top docs always agree on what's best, I might get a third opinion from another NCI-designated cancer center. I think (not entirely sure) Johns Hopkins does long distance consults. Otherwise, NYU is known to be very good, and Mt. Sinai is another option if you're in the city. Hope this helps some. I'm so sorry you're in the position you are. It's surreal enough to get a bc dx, but then to get conflicting opinions must be incredibly confusing. But my guess is that MSK most likely is on the leading edge of what's being done, and that you are fortunate to have access to them for tx. Hugs, Deanna",

One thing that's helped me a lot is getting out each morning for a long walk. Somehow the combination of enjoying nature, getting exercise (I walk about 4 or 5 miles, weather and time permitting), and just having that hour or so to process my thoughts about what I've been through is extremely anxiety-relieving, as well as helping with the aches & pains of low estrogen.  And exercise has been shown to decrease our recurrence risk by something like 35%.  So, as someone else here told me, when I walk I feel like every step is a step away from breast cancer. The other thing I've noticed being a huge help in moving me forward and out of the the breast cancer patient mentality is getting away and out of my normal routine.  I started noticing that each time I went away for a weekend, I felt a lot better (more like my old self) when I returned.  I honestly think that experiencing new things and meeting new people who don't know about our bc goes a huge way to resetting our thought process. But I know it's a process and never entirely goes away.  I was recently on a flight from Palm Springs to Dallas, and as the captain announced the connecting gates, he said \"B9\" -- and I have to tell, for the moment, I had such a strong emotional reaction that I felt like crying, which seems silly, but was very real when it happened.   The subconscious programming we've experienced is very powerful and may take some effort on our part to recognize and overcome, maybe starting with turning off the TV, for example, or only watching home & food channels, if you want to watch something that won't remind you of bc.     (((Hugs)))   Deanna",

Perhaps this is because the lump was aspirated, rather than having a true needle biopsy performed. I'm not sure. But \"necrotic cancer\" and \"not tested for cells\" and other wording sounds a bit unusual to me. And while it's true that breast cancer, which often takes many years to become large enough to be imaged or felt, normally doesn't change a lot in 3 months, I don't understand his comment about it being contained, especially if the lump was aspirated. If the lump doesn't go away now that it's been aspirated, I think I would ask for a referral to a breast surgeon/specialist, where you can be sure of getting an appropriate evaluation. Not saying that your doctor isn't doing that, but the technique and wording he's using just doesn't ring true for me -- unless he was 100% sure from the get-go that it wasn't possibly malignant, and was looking for something entirely different than bc, like infection. Just my take on what you've written, although I haven't read your previous posts, which may shed more light on your situation. Hugs, Deanna",

If your Mom is in good health (other than the bc) and good physical shape, and if her home doesn't pose navigating challenges (such as a lot of stairs), I think she will probably be able to take care of herself after a week at home, especially if her drains are out by then (have you been told about those?), and especially if her pantry and frig are well stocked, and if she has friends or neighbors that she can call if she needs anything.  Or, if you can arrange for some of them to check in with her daily -- like neighbors seeing if they can pick up anything she needs -- that would be even better, because she may not be comfortable asking for help. You may also need to plan out some practical aids for her, to be sure she doesn't have to move or lift anything heavy.  Even a 1/2 gal. of milk will be too much at first.  She won't be able to drive for several weeks, if she normally does.  And do her dogs need to be walked?  I think that would be difficult with a bilat & 4 dogs, as she probably won't be allowed to push or pull with either arm initially.  So, although she may be able to take care of herself with some arrangements made for these things, if you can spend more than a week with her, especially if she lives alone, I'm sure she would appreciate the company as much as the care.  When you're confined to home, the days can be awfully long and boring. Good luck to you both, and let us know us know what else we can share with you to ease your mind.      Deanna",

Often there will be someone in your area who has trained at one of these facilities so possesses the thoroughness you find at the bigger institutions. And read my bio page for an example of what can go wrong that you and a general surgeon may not even realize at the time. https://www.cancer.gov/research/nci-role/cancer-ce... The other benefit of places like those on the list is that you have all the specialties under one roof or on the same campus and used to working with a multidisciplinary/team approach. So, for example, if the team thinks you'll need radiation, for example, you won't start down a path with a recon that isn't compatible with RT. Hope this helps. Good luck! Deanna  ",

The bc in your breast is not nearly as concerning as bc in lymph nodes, which indicates your bc clearly knows how to travel. Having chemo first is a systemic vs. local tx. If you have surgery first, you will have to wait several weeks to heal from it before you can start chemo. (You cannot start chemo with an open wound.) So, in essence, having chemo first gets after the bc cells that have already left the breast and have the most logical potential to get beyond the lymph nodes and metastasize. As far as hating the decision... I think one of the keys is to find a medical team you absolutely trust and let them guide you. Without that trust, you will always be second guessing their decisions, which really makes things miserable. This is another reason -- beyond simply a tie-breaker, so to speak -- why a 3rd opinion might be helpful -- to have one more team to evaluate and compare for comfort level and trust going forward.",

After I had been on Faslodex + Ibrance for 1.5 years, my TMs did start to rise kind of dramatically (took about 6 mos. to double, but were also 10x higher than yours are now and making 100 pt. jumps), at which point my bone scan was still stable, but chest CT revealed something new possibly going on in my liver-- too small to distinguish or biopsy, but not there previously -- so we did change my regimen to Xeloda. And my liver numbers were also on the rise, but came down very quickly after 1 month on Xeloda, as did my TMs. If I was in your situation, I might try to wait until it's been at least 3 mos. to get scanned, just because if something new is brewing, it may be too soon to be picked up. I might also want to speak to your new onc and not rely on the judgment call of a PA. She might be entirely right, but I would still want to know what an onc thinks, and if you can reasonably wait a bit longer to get scanned. Other things that can make the CA27-29 go up are inflammation and some meds, so a rise doesn't necessarily mean something is going on. But based on my experience, I think your situation merits watching and scans within a reasonable time -- hopefully just to rule out any progression. Deanna  ",

Perhaps if you could figure out which chemos list changes in vision as a potential SE, you could query their manufacturer(s) to see if permanent changes have ever been reported.  I suspect it might be the Taxanes (like Taxotere), but that's just a guess.   I can absolutely understand why you're concerned about any vision loss.  Hopefully, you can get the information you're after to put your mind at ease.      Deanna",

It may sound counterintuitive, but the best thing for the fatigue caused by Ibrance is getting more exercise, if that's possible for you. Walking or swimming, for example, can really counteract the fatigue. For the nausea, first see if you can tie it to any specific foods that you can eliminate. Also, be sure to take Ibrance after a sizeable meal and with a full glass of water. Maybe try taking it at a different time of day. Ginger is helpful for nausea -- ginger tea, crystallized ginger.

This is not to say that I don't believe in a holistic lifestyle (I do!) and Eastern medicine  for many things, including complementary tx for bc.  I've sought out and used both integrative docs and naturopathic docs at various stages in my tx.  I just worry about possibly losing the window of opportunity to treat early stage bc while it's still early stage, and, quite honestly, Blubelle, the website for the Optimum Institute looks like a wonderful place for complementary care, but not the place I would solely partner with if my life was at risk.  I really hate to poke holes in anyone's belief in their doctors or treatment plan, as I think belief is so important.  And I've actually known women with metastatic bc who did extremely well on holistic only txs for many years -- perhaps better than many who use conventional only, although, again, I haven't been privy to their individual stats, so my comment is observational and very general.  But, assuming what you are dealing with is early stage invasive bc, I think you might want to check back with Stanford (assuming you meant Stanford in Palo Alto) or a comparable institution (UCLA, UCSF, USC, etc.), at least for a second opinion on your progress to date.   Deanna",

Do you know what sort of margin they had on the chest wall side?  While you may have had clear margins, perhaps it was minimal enough to cause concern in that location?  I think if they had seen anything new or concerning on your mammo, they would have explained that too you, so I have a feeling the concern is re. a very minimal margin near your chest wall. So sorry you're dealing with this surprise turn of events, but that seems to happen all too often.  But it's good that your new surgeon had a prestigious tumor board weigh in, and it doesn't sound like a decision you have to make too quickly, so you probably have some time to let the recommendation sink in and weigh your choices.    Deanna",

While bc certainly isn't common at your age, it's not unheard of, so dismissing you based on your age and stalling 2 mos. on ordering an u/s when you have an inverted nipple and suspiscious lump doesn't give me a lot of confidence in that doctor.  I am also of the firm opinion that many general surgeons do not see enough bc to recognize uncommon problems, nor can they possibly keep up on everything about breast-related problems the way a breast only surgeon does.    Another thing you might do is call the closest NCI-designated cancer center, like UCSF or Stanford, and ask them if they could recommend a surgeon in your area.  Perhaps they can recommend someone who has previous been @ UCSF, etc.  I've found great doctors from those kind of referrals.      Deanna",

Without studying up on your dx, if you were my daughter, I'm pretty sure I would want you to do the chemo.  On the other hand, unless you really need it, I'm not crazy about the recommendation for AC.  Adriamycin has potential for some serious SEs, including heart damage and also a very small (2%) but none-the-less significant chance of it causing leukemia.  Taxotere & Cytoxin (TC) is a newer regimen that you may want to ask about if a second opinion onc doesn't suggest it.

But I can share with you that I also had pain that sort of shot up my right leg and had me hobbling around on a cane. It started around the time I was dx'd w/mets and progressively worsened over almost 3 mos., until I ended up in the ER in absolutely excruciating pain, only to find out that I actually had pathologic fractures in my femur and pelvis that required a titanium rod in my femur and a total hip replacement. Since that time, I have suggested to several mets sisters who were experiencing leg pain to have their femur & pelvis checked with an MRI, to see if that's possibly what was going on, and each time it was. So it's not uncommon. Obviously I can't say for sure that's what's going on with you, but there's enough of a risk that you absolutely should ask for an MRI. In my case, the pain was not where the fractures were until it got so severe I couldn't move and was literally screaming and crying at the same time -- probably when the fractures totally gave way. But prior to that, it was just worsening pain in my shin, shooting up my leg, so I had no reason to suspect something was going on where it was. Hopefully, that's not what's going on, but the way your pain is presenting definitely raises the suspicion of a fracture. Please keep us posted! Hugs, Deanna",

I frequently ask women this question because of my own experience, where 3 additional small lesions were found by a second opinion medical team, after I initially had a lumpectomy. And, yes, I went back 3 mos. later and had a mx, because the lesions were in different areas of my breast. In your situation, since you are Her2+, it's also important to start chemo & Herceptin ASAP, so additional surgery probably isn't in your best interest right now, as long as you're sure everything was found prior to your lumpectomy. One thing I didn't understand about your post... If you didn't have an axillary dissection, how do you know you had 5 positive nodes? Was that from an MRI? In case you haven't been told, Stage 3A is still considered early stage bc, so there is plenty of hope you will do fine after all your tx. (((Hugs))) Deanna",

I suffered such severe nausea that led to a passing out episode that I not only refused to continue taking it, I was afraid to try another A/I. I'm very much into holistic health -- have been all my life -- and felt comfortable working with an ND and doing I3C and hormone balancing as an alternative, although I probably got complacent after a year or two, so can't say I kept it up for 5 years. Anyway, almost 6 years from my original Stage II dx, I had a recurrence -- diffuse and extensive bone mets. The interesting thing is, my first line of tx after my re-dx was Anastrozole (Arimidex), which significantly healed my bone mets and kept me stable for 18 mos. I had a Grade 3 multicentric bc, both IDC & ILC, and a positive node with extracapsular extension, so there's every possibility my bc might have recurred even if I'd stayed on Femara or another A/I. Sometimes I just think some of us are programmed to recur no matter what we do, but I also feel like I totally underestimated both the Grade 3 factor, as well as just how powerful these meds are. I've also learned since I refused Femara, that what we're normally RX'd is generic Letrozole, which is made by several different drug manufacturers, and that sometimes what gives us the worst SEs are the fillers those companies use, which vary from brand to brand. (It should say on your med bottle which company makes yours.) This is something you might want to look into as well, as sometimes just changing sources can improve your SEs, as can a short break and then returning to the med. I am not trying to scare you or tell you are foolish not to do an A/I. It's a very individual decision. However, knowing everything I know now (which I didn't know in 2009), I would not make the same decision today, especially after seeing the difference Anastrozole made in my mets, and, ironically, with almost no SEs. Just my two cents worth... Deanna",

If you're sure none of the swelling is heart-related or the beginning of lymphedema, all I can suggest is what I've been doing, which is using lots of vitamins, including B6, which was recommended to prevent neuropathy.  I'm also doing a liver detox supplement and just started a Chinese herb detox tea.  I've also been elevating my leg that is giving me the most pain on a pillow when I sleep, and that seems to help me sleep through the night and not be awakened by the pain.  Maybe you could try that for your painful hand and wrist. So sorry you're having these problems, but I just keep telling myself how strong we are all for getting through chemo, and that it is just going to take longer than any of us knew for the residual SE's to go away, but they will.  Christmas blessings to you ~  Deanna P.S.  My local onc had done a rheumatoid factor blood test during my chemo tx, just to be sure my pain wasn't arthritis, which it wasn't.  But he still seemed to think the pain, which started during chemo, was coincidental to the chemo and not caused by it!  (Are you kidding me?!?!) ",

I would want to know the first day you can see him.  Since your Mom already has a bc dx, knowing this, any doctors should get her in very quickly.  If they don't, those are not the kinds of doctors you want.   Shopping for a doctor is very much like shopping for any other service, except we're stressed when we learn we have to do it, and often not thinking clearly.  Just take a deep breath and know that it will all work out okay.  It's just going to take a few phone calls and letting her surgeon know that she wants to be an informed patient before making such a big decision.  You might also ask your local surgeon or someone in his office exactly how many breast surgeries he does each year.  That might give you some peace of mind, or more conviction to look elsewhere.     Deanna  PS ~ MRIs are normally the next step after you get a bc dx -- before any tx decisions are made because the results may influence those decisions.   ",

But getting it as you did with your staging changing rapidly from I to IV, is especially brutal. I'm not totally familiar with the medical system in Canada, but here in the US, not all oncologists think alike, and while most will start us on an aromatese inhibitor, there are situations where a more aggressive approach might be appropriate. It all depends on the extent of your disease. But aromatese inhibitors are extremely powerful drugs, and some women even achieve NED (no evidence of disease) with them. So either way, I'm sure you will get excellent care. You just may want to get more than one opinion to be sure you have an oncologist who will explain things to you a bit better and whom you totally trust. artistatheart, I'm not only sorry about your diagnosis, I am not happy that you feel written off. Without knowing where you're located, you may want to also get a second opinion. If you are in the US, I strongly recommend an NCI-designated cancer center, where you will find oncs who specialize in breast cancer, so may view liver mets a bit differently than a general oncologist. Our oncs should be hopeful and encouraging. The last thing you need is one who makes you feel written off from the get-go. That doesn't say a lot for their belief in their ability to get your disease under control. Here's a list of the top places where you may find more help and hope. http://www.cancer.gov/research/nci-role/cancer-cen... Hugs to you both, and hang in there!

And yet, in retrospect, the wait, as hard as it was at the time, was probably the best thing for me because it gave me plenty of time to research every little question on my mind, talk to several women who had gone through it, decide which type of reconstruction I wanted, and all in all approach May 20 with much more confidence and peace of mind about it than I ever would have had back in March.  A similar thing happened with chemo, which I couldn't start until August 6.  In the beginning, I was absolutely terrified about it.  But, by the time it came around, I was so ready to get on with it. In your situation, if you are overdosing on info' to the point of meltdowns (which I also did), I'd suggest taking a break from the research for awhile, and just letting your mind and emotions catch up.  I used to get angry when my husband would suggest that, but I did it, and it helped. Another thing that helped me with my fear of surgery was a positive imagery CD called Successful Surgery.  It's available at http://www.healthjourneys.com/.  I was so impressed with how it calmed my fears, I later purchased one they have for chemo, which I think also contributed a lot to my change of attitude about that. And lastly, while waiting for both surgery and chemo, I decided I might as well use the extra time to get my body stronger by increasing my morning walks to 3 miles and eating extremely nutritiously, both of which I think helped me sail through surgery.",

I'm also wondering, since you have very dense breasts, if your insurance would possibly cover an MRI (in lieu of a biopsy).   In the past, MRI's were only approved as diagnostic tools, after someone is already dx'd with bc.  But with dense breasts now recognized as a risk factor, I'm wondering your doctor could get an MRI approved for screening purposes.  Just a thought, and maybe someone else knows...    Deanna",

I was on HRT (Prempro) for many years, which my PCP constantly reassured me was not only okay for me but beneficial -- in spite of the fact that I have a sister who is a 2x bc survivor.   In retrospect, common sense should have told me that I was most likely at increased risk and that prolonged use of HRT probably wasn't wise advice to follow.  But I think deep down those of us with sisters with bc have a hard time believing it can also happen to us.  Hopefully, it won't happen to you, and everything will turn out to be B9.  But don't let any doctor's advice override your common sense.  Consult with the best ones you can find, and be sure whatever you're told rings true for you.  If it doesn't and leaves you uncomfortable, get a second opinion.       I had multifocal bc that was both IDC & ILC.  The ILC only showed up on MRI.  The problem is, many health insurance companies will not approve MRIs as screening tools -- only for diagnostic purposes (e.g. after you've already been dx'd).   This is one more reason why it's often better to be seen by a breast surgeon because they will know how to get a screening MRI approved if they believe you need it.          Deanna",

If you have a small lesion in a large breast (think I read your comment about that on another thread), then it sounds like a lumpectomy with radiation will be what's recommended to you.  And depending on where your tumor is located, perhaps one of the newer, shorter courses of radiation might be appropriate for you.  I know the co-pays seem monumental, but treating your bc now, while it's still early -- whatever that takes -- whether it's asking for help from the organizations and programs that are out there, and/or asking for discounts and arranging minimum payment plans with hospitals -- seems like it's by far the better choice.  You probably have some options, and it's good that you're asking questions and exploring some creative solutions.  But I personally don't believe that foregoing surgery would be wise.  Please let us know what else we can do to help you continue to think this through.  You can PM me any time, and I'd be happy to talk to you on the phone, as well.  There must be some better solutions to your dilemna.     Deanna",

Well, I wasn't imagining it. It was an ILC lesion that, thankfully, had some IDC in it, which eventually imaged -- about a year later, when it was Stage II.

What jumps out at me about the information you provided is that your Oncotype score (26) is a bit high -- probably high enough that chemo needs to be seriously considered.  There's very little in the stats you've provided to give us a clue as to why your score is 26, but obviously there's a somewhat aggressive factor in the 20+ genetic factors the Oncotype uses that is influencing your score. Whether or not you do chemo is entirely your choice.  Personally, I had a really hard time wrapping my head around doing it, but -- in retrospect -- I'm glad I did it, although my stats were also quite different from yours.  One thing that might help you think it through is a website called cancermath.net.  I'll try to give you a link to the breast cancer page, which will give you some suggested stats w/ & w/out chemo:  http://www.lifemath.net/cancer/breastcancer/outcome/index.php Another thing that might help are threads here called \"Oncotype Rollcall,\" where many women have reported their Oncotype scores and decision about chemo.  (Use the search box to the left to look for them.)   A third thing you might consider doing is getting a second opinion.  Not all oncs think alike -- especially about micromets (assuming you're referring to a lymph node), which some oncs consider a negative node, depending on the # of cells.  Whenever you have doubts about what you're being told by a doc, a second opinion can be really helpful.   Hope this helps, and let us know if we can answer any other questions for you.   (((Hugs))), and glad you've found bc.org.     Deanna",

And, due to some of the things you've told us, if at all possible, I would also want her seen by one of the larger medical centers for that second opinion.  They see the most breast cancer, and as a result will probably have experience with cases similar to your Grandma's in terms of her age, size of tumor, possible high KI-67 and other stats, which would be comforting if I was in her situation.  Here's a list of some of the best cancer centers: http://cancercenters.cancer.gov/cancer_centers/map-cancer-centers.html As far as cutting away the skin, 12cm is a large tumor. If it's also close to the surface, there would be little or no necessary margin between it and the skin.  But all the more reason to get a second opinion -- just to be sure she's on the best track with doctors you all like and trust.

I've heard wonderful things about City of Hope in general, but when I was choosing between the two for my situation, although City of Hope would have been a bit closer, I found UCLA much easier to get started with because of the multidisciplinary clinic they offer.  They're also very highly rated (#1 in the West) by entities that rate comprehensive cancer treatment centers, and their new (like 2 yrs. old) I.M. Pei designed hospital is about as fabulous as a hospital gets. Sara Hurvitz, my onc there, specializes in bc.  Let me know if you or your friend need contact information, links, or anything else I can help you with.    Deanna ",

And Melrose made another great point -- that at a larger comprehensive cancer center all the specialists are under one roof with shared on-line records.  No running around to figure out what's next or if a surgeon and plastic surgeon work together or even have priviledges at the same hospital.  Care under one roof or on one campus is much more coordinated with a much stronger team approach.      Deanna",

What kind of doctor are you seeing?  The best doctor to evaluate anything going on with our breasts is a breast surgeon/specialist.   Do you know if there's a breast cancer center in your area?  You really need to be evaluated by a breast surgeon who will know that you are not too young, as well as the fact that not having a family history doesn't preclude you either. Here's a list of facilities that will have the type of doctor best qualified to evaluate your lump: http://cancercenters.cancer.gov/cancer_centers/map-cancer-centers.html If there isn't one within a couple of hours of you, call the closest one and ask them to recommend someone in your area.  Or, as an alternative, you could also start a new thread here, asking for breast surgeon recommendations in your area.   Good luck, and please let us know what you find out.  And by the way, 80% of breast biopsies turn out to be benign, so the odds are entirely in your favor that this is not breast cancer.  But you do need it ruled out.   Deanna",

Your Mom may have prepaid for the surgery, but that doesn't mean she has to unwillingly submit to or be bullied into a procedure she doesn't fully understand the need for, and/or may not want.  It's her body, and we are talking about surgery that can have a lifelong impact.  If she's not comfortable with this surgeon's attitude or demeanor, she may need to make time to get a second opinion, and the surgeon will just have to reschedule her.   OTOH, with extracapsular extension, I can see why a breast surgeon may want to remove a few more nodes.  But if I was in your Mom's situation, I would still need to be convinced that it's prudent (which it may be), and I would absolutely insist that they not take any more than they have to -- which I don't believe is all of them.       Deanna ",

And as far as the ALND goes, if she hadn't had it, the stress of wondering if something more complicating had been missed would not have been good either.  Sometimes with bc there's just no easy answer, and no matter which path we choose, we're left worrying about what we didn't do.

Have you thought about maybe getting a second opinion?  I know with my treatment decisions, it was always helpful to talk to a second and sometimes a third oncologist (or surgeon or radiation oncologist, depending on the step).  Sometimes you just need that one kernel of information that will help to crystalize your thinking on what's right for you.   Personally, although my dx may not have been the same as yours, I was extremely anti-medicine.  But I finally decided that I never wanted to wake up with a recurrence and always wonder if doing chemo would have prevented it.  But it took me weeks to get to that decision.   Deanna   ",

As far as staging, remember, a lot of what you may read on the internet is based on data from treatment that was done 5 or 10 or more years ago.  In most cases, those of us dealing with breast cancer now are getting much more targeted treatment (like your mother getting chemo pre-surgery, which is something rather new), and even women who are diagnosed at Stage IV (the highest stage) can often do well for a very long time with today's treatment options.  No matter what your Mother's stage, one of the most important things is finding doctors who will work hard to help her.  That's why so many of us here are so keen on 2nd and 3rd opinions (even after you've had some treatment), because not all doctors think alike, and not all doctors (especially those who don't keep up on the latest research) approach especially later stage breast cancer with the same positive attitude and determination. The stages are explained in the informational part of this website (black bar at top of the page... symptoms & diagnosis... search staging).  I will pray that your Mother recovers from the chemo and surgery, and that you have some better news when you talk to her doctor.  Oh, and it's probably good that they didn't take more lymph nodes, to avoid causing lymphedema.  Hopefully, radiation will take care of anything that may have been left.   Deanna    ",

Unfortunately, you're not alone, and it isn't until it happens that we learn that doctors can be very different in their approach to the same situation -- not to mention their personalities and demeanor with us.  I hope that your sharing your story here will help other women in the situation you were in slow down and get a second opinion, especially when it comes to surgical procedures.   Take care, and keep us posted on what you decide to do ~ Deanna",

You didn't mention your family situation.  Do you have people there to help you, or friends you can reach out to?  It's hard to care about cooking when you feel so awful, but I found comfort foods like macaroni & cheese and grilled cheese sandwiches were the easiest to tolerate.  But you may need some help to be sure you eat when you can.  And are you drinking LOTS of water?  That's extremely important!      Hang in there!  Hopefully, your oncologist can switch you to Emend.  Just be sure that she is aware of all the problems you're having, so that she can make any adjustments.  Chemo isn't fun, but it shouldn't be as bad as what you're going through.      Deanna P.S.  When you first join BCO, you are limited to 5 posts per 24 hr. period.  So you may want to be careful about responding to every post.  If you do get shut out, you can continue to chat with anyone here by using the Private Message (PM) feature (like email).  Just click on any screen name or avatar, and it will take you to a page with that feature.",

From what you've told us, it sounds like she has a competent surgeon, but I am always in favor of second opinions which can validate and give you peace of mind about surgeon #1's game plan, give you additional helpful information that wasn't communicated to you by surgeon #1, or sometimes come up with a doctor or facility you just like better than the first one. Is your Mom's surgeon a breast (only) surgeon?  These are normally found at the larger, comprehensive cancer centers, where they treat the most bc.  If her surgeon isn't a breast surgeon, that might be an excellent choice for a 2nd opinion.  And has she had an MRI?    As far as staging, yes, that always comes after surgery to remove the lesion and possibly more lymph nodes.  If you click on Symptoms & Diagnosis at the very top of this page, it will take you to the informational part of BCO where you can search \"Staging\" for a detailed description of the stages of bc.  This will help you understand what your Mom's surgeon believes at this point she is dealing with based on the estimated size of her lesion and node involvement. When your Mom starts chemo, she'll find a group here for those starting it that month, whether it's April or May.  That kind of support from others also going through it makes it so much easier than facing it alone.  I strongly recommend getting your Mom on BCO, especially for the support aspect. Best to you both!  Let us know how else we can help, and please keep us posted on her situation and how you're doing ~ (((Hugs)))   Deanna ",

An oncotype score of 3 is exceedingly low.  I don't know what factors about your tumor played into that low score, but prior to Oncotype-DX recently becoming available to women with some positive nodes, with 1 positive node and Grade 3 bc, chemo most likely would have been recommended for you.  I did chemo with 1 positive node after getting 3 very different opinions from 3 different oncologists.  And while it was \"do-able,\" it certainly wasn't a walk in the park for me, and recovering from it -- getting strong again -- took several months longer than I'd anticipated.  So I think it's a decision that bears input from additional doctors, to help you decide what's really best for you.   Deanna",

How can her surgeon expect her to make that kind of decision without a lot more information, including the questions you've asked here?  As you've already figured out, there can be pros & cons to doing neoadjuvant chemo, although for some particular types and stages of bc, it can be the better choice.  However, I'm a bit bothered by a surgeon who expects a newly-dx'd patient to make that decision without a lot more input. I don't know where you're located, but I strongly second Windlass's suggestion that you get an opinion at an NCI-designated cancer center (the list she gave you), even if you have to travel a few hours.  That's what I did (after a lumpectomy that didn't get all the bc), and I met with all the appropriate specialists in one afternoon -- surgeon, oncologist, rad onc, and psychologist -- for a much more complete picture of where I was and what I needed to do going forward.  If there isn't one within a reasonable distance from you, maybe call the closest one and speak to someone in their breast center and see if they can recommend a surgeon and an oncologist closer to you -- perhaps a graduate of their medical school or former resident there. At the risk of sounding overly concerned -- just because your Mom's gyn has sent bc patients to this local surgeon for breast surgery for 10 years doesn't mean he's done a lot of them.  If you're in a rural area, that could be one a month or fewer, vs. an NCI-designated cancer center where they do several breast surgeries a day, 5 days a week.   It adds up to a huge difference in experience, not to mention keeping up on the latest research when it's all you do.  I think this is especially important if your Mom's bc is Stage III, in which case getting the right tx ASAP (whether that's chemo or surgery) from a highly experienced breast surgeon and oncologist can have a real bearing on outcome.  I'm also concerned that he hasn't done an MRI yet. JMHO, and you can read my bio page to see why I feel so passionately about this.     Deanna ",

Please encourage your Mom to speak up and question her surgeon on this, including showing him the research Omaz gave you!    (((Hugs))) Deanna  PS ~ About your question on chemo...  Do you know if your Mom had the Oncotype-DX test done?  That's what is used to determine the need for chemo. ",

Don't buy into the most negative information you see or hear, and if your oncologist isn't offering you a much more positive spin, find one who will. Of course it's true that some bc's can be very aggressive and difficult to treat. But it can also make a huge difference where you're being treated, and my personal opinion is that you need to at least get some input from a true TNBC expert -- someone who deals with it 24/7, as some do at the more prominent institutions that specialize in breast cancer. I say this because I know for a fact that UCLA and other top tier places (i.e. MDAnderson, etc.) have 15 and 20 year TNBC survivors, and A LOT of advancements in tx can and will happen within the next 5 or 10 or 15 years. I also believe, as wonderful as many of them are, there is no way a local oncologist who treats everything from lung cancer to prostate cancer to melanoma, can be half the expert on TNBC that someone who is actually doing the research is. Plus I believe that being pro-active in itself is very empowering and can lift your spirits. Also keep in mind that any survival stats out there now are based on patients who were treated 5 or 10 more years ago -- many before preadjuvant chemo, for example, was discovered to improve outcomes for women with TNBC. Hopefully, these stats will change dramatically as researchers continue to unravel the mysteries of the various types of bc's, and hopefully we will continue to have more more targeted tx's and even a cure within our lifetimes.

I haven't dealt with the BRCA issue, but I don't think I would say anything really specific to your boyfriend at this point.  If you are comfortable confiding in him about losing your Mother to bc, I think that's about all I would do for now.  If he asks if bc is genetic or otherwise expresses a specific concern about your possible fears and future, I would probably tell him there's a possibility it is, and that you've decided to get tested.  But I kind of think I would leave this on an as-need-to-know basis -- rather than hitting him with everything at once, which, as you pointed out, would be a lot for anyone who isn't as intimately familiar with bc as we are to really comprehend.   I'm so sorry about your Mother.  I know there's at least one recent thread on here by others your age who have either recently lost their Moms or are facing that possibility.  Perhaps that's another thread you might want to know about.  I think it's in the Family & Friends (or something like that) Forum (click on Forum Index above and scroll down to find it).   (((Hugs))), and let us know how things go with your boyfriend.     Deanna",

But there's absolutely no way they can be as experienced with breast cancer as a breast surgeon who looks at and performs surgery only on breasts, 365 days a year.    Hopefully, your biopsy will be B9!  But if anything about what you find out concerns you, keep a 2nd opinion with a breast surgeon in mind as a next step.   (((Hugs)))    Deanna ",

There's a thread here that might help you with your decision.  It's called New Oncotype Roll Call.  I'll try to give you a link to it:  http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/69/topic/730468?page=11#post_1598080 If that link doesn't work, go to the Forum Index above and scroll down to the Chemotherapy section.  You'll find it there.  There was also an older one that got very long,  If I can find it, I'll bump it for you as well. The only other bit of advice I can give you is be sure you know which chemo is being recommended for you.  Not all oncologists recommend the same ones, and this is something you should read up on and ask questions about if you decide you are going to do it.      Deanna",

But the gist of my comments are the same for any of us, no matter what our stats. I'm glad you had the presence of mind and fortitude to demand another referral! I can't believe that specialist yakking about himself and concerned about how giving you the referral you asked for would make him look!!! OMG!!!!! That's so bad!!! And the fact that they treat your stats like privileged information is a HUGE red flag to me!!! It's been shown that informed patients actually do better, and the fact that they feel being Her2+ is something you don't need to know, truly has me shaking my head! As far as Bible verses, I have always loved Jeremiah 29:11, and find it extremely comforting... For I know the plans I have for you,\" declares the Lord, \"plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.  ",

A question a bc survivor friend asked me when I was trying to decide, was...  \"If you didn't do chemo and it ever came back, would you regret not doing it?\"  That's a question only you can answer for you. In my case, I knew I would never, ever forgive myself.  Chemo was no walk in the park, but it's behind me now, and if you saw me today you'd never know I went through it.   One other thing to keep in mind... What if for some reason you have a problem with Tamoxifen or an Aromatese Inhibitor (the one that follows Tamox)?  I did, which now makes me extra happy I made the decision to do chemo. Just some random thoughts I hope will be helpful ~    (((Hugs)))   Deanna ",

Competent doctors welcome your questions, and they should be able to quote research studies and reference their personal experience to back up their recommendations.  They should also be totally fine with it if you express a desire to get a second opinion.   Remember, you will be seeing your MO for a minimum of 5 years when you count followup post-tx.  Best to get it right from the start.  You might also want to ask to see their infusion area.  Evidently, there's a wide range of decor (upbeat to drab), as well as patients.  Some centers only cater to bc patients, while others handle a more general population. So you might as well check that out while you're at it. Good luck!    Deanna ",

Now I believe there's a trial comparing 4 to 6.  CMF (mentioned above) is known to be a regimen with perhaps the lightest SEs.  My onc @ UCLA has an on-line video comparing the various chemo regimens for bc, their SEs and stats.  PM me if you'd like a link to it.   If you do decide to do chemo, join the support group that forms each month here on BCO for getting through chemo.  (Click on Forum Index above and scroll down to the Chemotherapy Forum.)  Going through it with other women truly eases the journey immensely!   (((Hugs)))   Deanna    ",
