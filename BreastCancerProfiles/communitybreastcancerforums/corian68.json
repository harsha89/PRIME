Maybe it is just their policy to have the testing done first? I have a strong family history with BC. My Mother was also diagnosed with the exact same cancer as mine @ 59, last year. She is BRCA Neg. Her sister, DX'd @ 27 and passed at 30. She died before genetic testing was available so her BRCA is unknown? I had my test done 2 weeks ago & just learned I am BRCA2 Neg but BRCA1 is some mystery mutation? They can't identify what kind of mutation , so they asked if I would be part of some study...sure why not? :D I know that 2 weeks is like an eternity when you're waiting! But you will be ok! I couldn't sleep or eat or carry on a conversation while in ' limbo'. But now I am great & you will be too! I am so glad my cancer is gone. I have tissue expanders in now , having them filled every couple of weeks. People that haven't seen me since before surgery, have no idea unless I tell them I've had a mastectomy. While you are waiting, start researching everything, learning saved me & my mind. Learn about surgery options, hormone treatments..traditional & alternative therapies. And remember you have all of us that understand through experience. You are not alone! Hugs ;) IDC stage 1 grade 3 ER+PR+ HER2-.",

This is also their experience not just their Mother's or ex husband's. My best friend passed from BC, her 8 year old daughter was there by her side. It was very painful but there were beautiful events as well. At the end, her 8 year old crawled in bed with her and told her that it was ok for her to go. She said the kids in Heaven need a Mommy Angel to help them. 5 minutes later she was gone......painful?

Turned out to be a cyst. I am very glad you went in for an ultrasound. It's always better to know for sure what's going on with your body. This time around When I felt my malignant 9mm lump. It didn't hurt at all and it felt like bebe placed just under my skin. No redness or swelling. I am not a doctor but it does sound like it is cystic or something like that. And you are awesome to press on for screening....never let them tell you that you are too young. I will say a prayer for you tonight, you will be ok;) peace girlfriend!",
