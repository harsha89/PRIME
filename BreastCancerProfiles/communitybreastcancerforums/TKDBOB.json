Her second round has been delayed until her thrush has cleared up. I expect it will be a week delay. The problem now is she has very weak legs and has a hard time with balance. She is 64 and doesn't have an exercise routine but has never had a problem with getting around or performing routine daily activities. Shouldn't she be close to normal after three weeks? Understanding exhaustion is expected but this is extreme weakness. She gained 20 pounds over the past week from the fluids pumped into her during her two hospital admissions. She was let out of the hospital 3 days ago. Bob",

      "Content": "Aug 12, 2017 04:05PM - edited Aug 12, 2017 04:09PM by TKDBOB My wife had to stop her chemo after one round, side effects were horrible. Hospitalized two times in a week for fever, couldn't walk, sores developed in her mouth, down her tongue into her throat. Thrush and cold sores. Lips were swollen and bleeding. She was stage 1a with 9mm tumor and Onco score 31. She also has liver issues. Her Oncologist looked at her and said no more. That was 5 weeks ago and she has recovered enough to start thinking about hormone therapy and a radiation consult. I've been reading up on the Onco score and have not been able to understand how a Onco score of 30 is intermediate and 31 is high risk of recurrence. How was this cutoff score validated? Seems like an educated guess to me. Can the science be that precise to determine the exact cutoff score? I'm not that concerned about reoccurrence, the vast majority of people with stage 1a BC never had chemo or have a recurrence and never had the Onco test. She is 64 years old. Her lumpectomy showed clean margins and being stage1a, no node involvement. The tumor was discovered incidentally from a routine CT scan for her liver. Although the Oncologist recommended the chemo. the breast surgeon recommended against it. I think he had the greater insight into the entire situation. Bob",
