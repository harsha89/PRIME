To really determine his qualifications, check where he did his training and also at which hospital/s he has privileges now, and how long he has been there. Hospitals have regular meetings where they look at the poor outcomes and examine how to prevent them in the future. Bad docs don't get to hang around long.

The RO is concerned only with local recurrence and it is his or her job to evaluate and treat your breast and only your breast. Hopefully he or she has already shared the studies with you that show the large difference in recurrence (both local and distant) between those who received rads and those who did not? If not, do ask for this information so you can make an educated decision. 2. The oncotype is a predictor of distant recurrence. In other words, it addresses your risk of mets to your bones, lungs, liver, and brain, plus the occasional other site (not the RO's territory at this time, although rads can later be used to treat mets). Your oncotype score assumes that you have had either a mastectomy or a lumpectomy plus rads, and assumes moreover that you will take tamoxifen for five years. If you do not have radiation, or do not take tamoxifen (or an AI), its predictive value is questionable at best. Here's one article that might be somewhat helpful, although it is valid only for pure DCIS; IDC would probably increase the risk. http://www.breastcancer.org/research-news/20131004 I realize you are very interested in having only part of your breast receive radiation. Or parts? I think you might have mentioned more than one site? Rather than exploring invasive (ouchy) techniques, perhaps you could ask your RO about directing the beam only to those specific areas? I think you'd actually have less chance of scatter, and less chance of skin issues/discomfort with a more traditional approach.  ",

Chances are there is very little additional informationspecific to you that anyone can give you until you have the results of the genetic testing and your surgical pathology, but that is no excuse for rudeness bordering on hostility. Not to worry about who your bs works with--all breast surgeons work with multiple oncologists, often in pretty far-flung geographical locations. Chances are your bs is very much aware that you are not the first person to opt out of treatment by this particular oncologist. Why don't you call the breast center where your Monday consult is set up and see if you can see an oncologist as well? Long term, you might prefer to work with someone closer to home, but often the docs at the top centers direct, or at least, discuss, care administered by local oncs. I don't know if you are angst-ing as I did about surgical options, but just in case, I'll mention that I remember being absolutely, and equally, torn between surgical options: Lumpectomy, mastectomy, double mastectomy (with DIEP reconstruction). I simply could not decide. Eventually I chose lumpectomy, just to get the darned thing out and find out exactly what we were dealing with. If I didn't like what I learned, insurance would have to cough up the one or two mastectomies. As it happened, I found I was very happy with the lumpectomy. ",

Please call the Planned Parenthold national 800 number and ask to speak with a supervisor. The breast center at your local hospital probably has a patient services person who maybe can help you. You can also try the NYS Department of Health (www.health.ny.gov). The website lists resources by county. Most non-profit agencies receive special donations specifically restricted to helping those who need their services but just barely slip through the cracks. Not every employee is aware of every funding source, so do not hesitate to ask for a supervisor. If none of this (or any ideas others might have suggested) do not help, please try your State or Federal congressperson. I would not rush into a divorce without legal advice, ",

Even if your genetic test comes back positive, you can have a lumpectomy now, then take a little time planning your double mastectomy in the future. You can also have one or two mastectomies now, and delay reconstruction until a more convenient time. I know--having more choices does not make your ultimate choice easier, but it might give you time to really consider your options and plan around your son's sports seasons and activities. Do read the reconstruction threads here, and also the information on the main website, and quiz your docs as well--they have to give you the real story about recovery, limitation, risks. I think some kinds of reconstruction offer fairly easy recovery. I was one who was completely stressed out over all the options and spent a lot of time researching each and every possibility. Still, I was completely undecided as to which way to turn, ultimately deciding on a lumpectomy just to give the tumor the old heave-ho--I'd work out single/double/flat/DIEP later. With the tumor gone, and with good pathology, I felt I had time to explore my options. I was surprised at how happy I was with just the lumpectomy/radiation.  ",

Oh, yes--It will also be a good thing when the ordering doc lets the test techs know they'll be using only one arm.  I was told they do this all the time, but it's always better (i.e. quicker) when they don't have to check with the doc before changing their setup.

My radiologist told me that tumors smaller than one centimeter are often not detectable through mammogram. ER+ and HER- is a very good sign. You can add that info to your profile and it will help others to help you. The mammogram image fits the size of the screen on which the radiologist views it. I asked to see my images and found the viewing room (whatever they actually call it) had several chairs, each facing a large screen, perhaps three feet in its largest dimension. The software allows the radiologist to magnify areas of concern to study them more closely; the measurement software adjusts accordingly. In addition, they can split the screen to simultaneously view different views (at least 8, maybe 16), including comparisons between current and past images. I suppose they can view an ultrasound in similar fashion. By the way, because of patient confidentiality, all the other radiologists had to clear the room and clear their screens to allow me to enter, so my visit was short. Do spend some time on the info part of www.breastcancer.org; there are oodles of dropdown menus that hold almost every bit of info you might want right now. Also, if your breast center has a nurse or social worker whose job it is to guide you through treatment, please do not hesitate to ask her everything. Once you meet with your surgeon (probably your next step), you will have a much better idea of that same everything.",

Still, without a biopsy, not even the breast surgeon can be certain of exactly what each of those sites is up to. Perhaps you are already aware, but 80% of biopsies turn out to be benign, so a determination of whether to biopsy or play the watch and wait game can be a pretty tough call. Even more fun, it is you, the non-expert, who has to make the decision. I had two lumps, one found only through MRI. The first was pretty clearly cancer, the next was indeterminate. I am not the kind of person who could relax for one minute with a six-month rescan and set up that second (MRI) biopsy right away. Although the #2 biopsy result was benign, I was very happy to have both the malignant and the benign lesion removed at surgery.",

I had what I thought was rib pain and asked about an x-ray. My onc indicated that he feels a bone scan is the best way to look for bone mets. They inject a radioactive substance into your vein, you sit around a while (I think I went to the cafeteria and had lunch), then return, and slide through a donut-shaped scanner. The result is a whole-body view, both front and back, with black spots where you have mets or arthritis. My scan was peppered with black blots, and I was terrified, but they all turned out to be arthritis. Strangely, the arthritis was in every place that I did not hurt. The radiologist and onc agreed that my rib issue was actually due to a little arthritis where my rib meets my spine. Big relief (except for finding out that I am not, after all, immune to arthritis)!",

Initially, I was disturbed by the bio you posted, kayb, where Moss uses the euphenism \"scientific communications\" for letters to the editor. These letters normally fall into the category, \"opinion piece,\" not \"article.\" On the other hand, in journals such as those listed above, these pieces are often commissioned by the publication. Their primary role is to print actual research, but they also have a need to present supplementary information that will help place the published article in a larger context. Whether these letters are specifically invited or not, their very appearance in these journals does indicated a significant credibility for their author. I then followed your link. He calls himself a cancer advisor, but his expertise seems to be in reporting on cancer issues. I'm thinking he is journalist, an in-depth reporter with a truly extensive background--and interest--in his field. My guess is that he would indeed be an excellent resource for information on both the pro's and the con's (journalists need to present both sides of any story) for various treatments and protocols. He does offer telephone consultations. I read a few of the blogs on his site, and found them informative, but not particularly in-depth. I'm thinking his book might be a compendium of many of his articles, covering a really huge swath of both traditional and alternative remedies. As such, I'd think it worth reading, but yikes! The price! Couldn't a nice publisher give him a huge advance and then market it for the masses?",

Because of its powerful beam, there is no scatter with rads, but the field is designed so that certain areas receive more radiation, and some receive less.  It seems neither your RO nor your techs explained this particularly well, but if you give them a chance, I think they'll make you feel more comfortable.  ",

I wonder whether placing a comfortable chair, maybe even a recliner, right next to the bed would help? All you'd need to do to help her transfer from one to the other would be to help her kind of swivel and take a couple of steps. And if she finds being in a chair rather than a bed to be quite a comfort, then perhaps she'll happily stay put for longer periods. Maybe, like my mother, she'd even be happier there at night.",

Yes, my HER2 was also in question, as I suspect it might be for most of us. I am not sure whether this meant my initial numbers were wishy washy, or just that they waiting for the definitive (FISH) test. Obviously, until your pathology is complete, whether you might need chemo is anybody's guess.

There's lots of conjecture about the role of our immune system in the development of cancer, yet we all know people who seemingly fall prey to every bug that's going around and never develop cancer, and those who never even have a cold, yet here they are.  Some feel stress is the culprit, but probably all of us experience moderate stress much of the time and significant stress on occasion.  Is there a specific cause?  Maybe.  Maybe it's a whole compendium of factors.  Maybe it's a genetic time bomb.  Whatever.  For us, we have it.  We are lucky to live in a age where so many scientifically proven treatments are available to help us.  We are lucky that there is treatment.  Some of us (me, for instance) are lucky to have a cancer that is proven to be slow growing (and possibly completely removed through surgery) and to allow me to live my life, maybe for decades, with just one little pill/day.",

I had not read the previous link because, believe me, I researched causation to the nth degree (three children, one miscarriage at the beginning of the fifth month) and was already aware there is no link between breast cancer and abortion, spontaneous or otherwise. I was not, however, aware of the large number of studies that quite clearly remove from consideration the possibility of abortion as a causative factor. Carrie, most of us find links to scientific studies helpful, but not links to opinion pieces. If you are interested in looking further into breast cancer risk factors, try the address below (sorry--will not turn itself into a clickable link for some reason). You will find a list of 30 or so risk factors for bc; abortion is not one. Oh, and please do check out the link April provided. http://www.breastcancer.org/risk/factors",

I suppose if I were having open heart surgery, I'd look at it differently, but for same-day and overnight procedures, it works out fine. The doctor knows who to call if anything goes wrong. It sounds as though your mother is planning to be with you, so the issue is transportation. If your current schedule is too early for her to share the cab with you, you can either arrange for two cabs or maybe move your procedure to a later time. Also, I believe your hospital or the American Cancer Society can put you in touch with a volunteer driver. Probably a local church can do so as well. Relatives sometimes just do not understand.",

Unannounced dropping in was fine in my hospital, as there are always nurses and at least one RO on site, ready to see anyone and everyone who needs to be seen. Ditto for your skin/muscle tightness, which is no doubt a result of rads, and any post treatment trauma (I showed up with PTSD). You can try gentle stretching (I used to lie on the floor, reach my rads arm out to the side, then just gradually turned away, just until I felt the pull). A lymphedema therapist can also be helpful in managing that tightness, but may not be able to touch you until your skin has healed ",
