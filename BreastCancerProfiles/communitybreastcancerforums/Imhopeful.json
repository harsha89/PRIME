I had a mammogram and ultrasound done and got my results that I needed a biopsy on both breast because they found 1cm lump on one breast and 2 cm lump on the other. I was told it catagory 4 so that's why I need a biopsy. I'm frantic and been crying with anxiety. I just need someone to talk to and that I'm not alone",
