I had my BLM July 28th 2013 and although I did get the micro beads and I do love them and I generally opt for those in the pockets of my genie bra while doing physical activities, a mastectomy specialist where I had all my treatments really turned me on to a great product. I got the new Silicone forms called \"Impressions\" by Trulife, they are the newest technology and the have a honeycomb core to ensure breathability and look natural and are lightweight. The bra that I just love that we got to put the forms in is also by Trulife and it is model 210 and it has a cool max lining so it helps to wick moisture away from your chest when you get sweaty. The forms stay great in the pockets and do not move, it is as close to natural as I have found yet. I also got a T-shirt bra called from ABC style 116. They are both very comfortable but I wear my Trulife bra and forms the most.

I will be making it a point to eat much more protein this time. Macy, I am so sorry your journey has been so difficult, but you have come to the right place for support and help, I have been spending most of my time on the August chemo thread but I feel a little more at home here as most ladies there are stage 1&2. My story differs from yours a bit but I know your fear and how hard it is to comprehend it all. I am 50 years old, I have had many negative mammo's and no family history. I went for my routine mammo in May of this year and then I was called back for more films and an U/S, next day Bx and the radiologist told me it did not look good, so the next day he called and confirmed that I had Invasive Lobular Carcinoma and it is aggressive so call your PCP right away and get a referral to a surgeon. I knew who I would go to for my surgery and I did a lot of research, my BS and I were totally on the same page about doing BLM as ILC is sneaky and tends to be B/L. I went into surgery thinking I was going to get tissue expanders in but during surgery My BS and PS spoke with my husband and they felt is was best to delay recon due to 2 nodes coming back positive. I woke up to no recon and I was scared to death and I knew something was wrong, I think they made a good call because they did not want to delay my treatment. I will try to wrap this up quickly, so I see BS for a 1week f/u only to find out 15/15 nodes came back bad, so now I have to do chemo and rads. After my 1st chemo my shingles flaired up really bad in my low back and I ended up in the hospital and they want to do CT scan and MRI and find some very small mets in my spine???????? I had a PET scan 3 weeks prior that was all clean except I had more node insolvent. So at that point I lost it, 4 months ago I did not even know I had cancer now I find out it has gone to my spine, Holy Shit, I have been so scared and emotional ever since, MO said the spots are very small and the chemo should get them but we will have to do another MRI with the PEt scan after chemo is done. I feel that BC is always a scary thing to hear but when we hear so quickly that we are a stage 3 it is very hard to wrap our minds around, but these boards have been so helpful for me, please keep us posted and if you have any questions please feel free to PM me, I don't know a lot but I have been thought a lot in a few short months and I can help at all I would love to. May God bless and keep us all. SharyüçÇ",

Hi Jab and welcome, glad you found us here I too am a stage 111(c) gal and I tell you when I first got Dx in May of this year these threads saved my life. There is so much to take in, so much to learn and a lot of fear but there is so much support here it will help you so much. I had BLM in July and stared A/C in August, I did four rounds of Adrymiacin and Cytoxin and now I will get #3 out of 12 Taxotere this Friday. Chemo sucks but you can do it, we are stronger than we think we are, like everyone say's SE'S are different from person to person and from Tx to Tx but drink lots of water and rest, take all the help you can get and let your body rest as much as possible so that the chemo can do its job and your body can regain strength between treatments. Wishing everyone a great se free day‚ù§Ô∏è Shary",

I am just about 1year out of last chemo and almost 8 months out of radiation and I too get so darn tired, I am taking Letrozole as Arimidex and Tamoxifen both did not agree with me. I just returned to work as a Hairstylist after almost 2years of being off and I only work 2 days a week but I am having a hard time wanting to do anything and that's not like me, I am very emotional and I sort of feel left out and somewhat rejected from the world these day's not sure what is going but I assume it all part of this BC journey.

I had my first A/C & Cytoxin last Thursday, did pretty well and had Neulasta shot Friday around 2:00 PM and started fading pretty fast. Long story short, by midnight on Saturday night my shingles broke out with a vengeance!!!!!!!!! I have had them for 30 yrs üò∞but they are at the base of my spine and I think between the Neulasta and the shingles my pain went through the roof. Ended up in ER, got IV pain med's and Zofran which helped. This week I see PCP and MO and I am going to discuss upping my dosage of anti-viral before next treatment and also as Jerigrace mentioned going to get the pain med's on board ahead of time to. You ladies are at least one or more cycles ahead of me and any advise or ideas would be greatly appreciated, I cannot keep up with everyone but I have enjoyed reading everyone's posts.
