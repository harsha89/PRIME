My first post here and am not very familiar with the website yet. I am scheduled for a weekly chemo of Taxol for 12 weeks followed by AC and then surgery. Anyone else going this route? Yesterday's chemo was not bad. My hand was freezing up and I had to ask for hot packs to rest it on. I was able to go back to a full day of work today- never needed to use the meds for nausea/diarrhea that were prescribed. Don't know if tomorrow will be better/worse/the same. Also I do not have a port. Is it a good idea to get one? The nurse said the port vs no port patients were about 50/50.",
