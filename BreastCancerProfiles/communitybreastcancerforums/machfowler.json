For mine there was air flowing over the back of my neck, which did give you a feeling of openess.  I'd ask the doctor for a pill if I were you. The tech told me they give meds to help people relax all the time, it's no big deal to ask. Good luck",

The regular MRI was in a trailer where it was cramped and dark. They had to pull me in and out a few times before I could get ahold of myself enough to be calm for 30 -40 minutes. The MRI guided biopsy was in a brightly lit room and the open end of the chanber actually looked out a window. After the first MRI I told my dr. I was having some anxiety and she gave me a perscription which I took in advance of the MRI biopsy, so that probably helped as well. Finally, I think the another thing that really helped was that they put me in the machine then did a quick test, then pulled you out, did some numbing and linining you up, then put you back in.... they did a lot of putting you in the machine and pulling you out in short bursts so it wasn't nearly as bad as being in their for 30-40 mins. I hope you get a room like me second one that was all cheerful and well lit. I think that really helped. Good luck.",

She is the medical director there and at two other facilities and tells me that they are building a comprehensive cancer care center. I can always get into see her in a reasonable amount of time. She has a very helpful staff that is available for questions and she works with the oncologist as a part of a larger team. PM me and I'll send her name and info. I am on high risk watch as well.",

I had an excisional biopsy in July and the scar tissue under the scar is just now starting to clear up. (It felt quite thick for most of this time) I had two other other exisional biopsies when I was younger (18-15 years ago) and those scars are barely noticeable at all.  The crazy thing I keep picturing is the old tootsie roll commercial where the character asks how many licks to get to the center of a tootsie roll? I keep picturing that commerical because I'm beginning to wonder how many lumpectomies equal a mastectomy? I feel like I might be able to answer that some day. :) Here's hoping your results are B9.",

I think core biopsy wasn't even an option at the time. Both were lumps the Dr. discovered during a routine exam. They turned out to be intraductal papillomas. After those incidents I started getting regular mammograms. I never had a single thing appear on the mammograms- but I only recently discovered that my mammogram reports have been saying I have dense breast all this time. So, no surprise they never see anything.  This June I started having discharge so I went to my doc who sent me to a specialist. She checked the mammograms and sent me for a US, which saw the suspicious area. I had a core needle biopsy which came back as another papilloma. Intraductal papillomas are considered b9 - except when they aren't (10% come back malignant) I really don't understand if the papillomas are cancer or if the original dx is wrong 10% of the time??? It's confusing.  Since excision is the standard procedure for papillomas the BS sent me for an MRI to be sure that was all that needed to be removed. That came back with more suspicious areas, including my lymph node on the same side. So, I had two more cored needle biopsies and two Fine Needle aspirations on the lymph nodes. One biopsy came back as Fybrocystic Changes - which aren't a big deal I think and the other was supposed to have been another papilloma. The lymph node came back with \"atypical\" cells but the BS thought that was an anomaly and didn't recommend removing it.  I had the lumpectomy (excisional biopsy) in July and the path report came back as one papilloma and ALH. Because of my history of biopsies, my sister having cancer at 42, no kids and now the ALH the BS recommended tamoxifen, which I am on now.  I am on the 6 month rotation and recently had my first check up. The MRI showed more activity but the BS and radiologists want to wait another six months to see if more happens because they aren't sure if the activity could be explained by scaring.  So, my ALH was definitely found on an MRI. Mammograms never show anything for me. I\u2019ve read a ton about ALH since July but I don\u2019t know how long I have had it or if it would have turned into cancer if I hadn\u2019t had the discharge caused by the papilloma and discovered the new issues. Part of the frustrating part of this is the mental game in your head. I still kind of wonder if they found everything or if there is some other issue that still hasn\u2019t manifested itself. So many women on the boards will talk about getting a clean mammo just a few months before discovering a lump. Thinking like that really doesn\u2019t help me much but I can\u2019t seem to shake it.",

I would say a year ago I would have told you that it sounds a little crazy but now I'm not so sure. I understand how someone could come to that decision. If I have any more issues (it's my right side as well) I think I will bring it up. Right now I am hoping to stay sane until May when I have another MRI. If everything is stable I'm going to stand pat but if there are more things to biopsy, I'll have that talk with the BS. I know there is a lot of complaining about the tamoxifen on the boards and I had a little trouble the first few days but now I am not having any SE at all from it so there is every reason for me to keep taking it and hope it does the trick. Be sure to let us know when you are having your surgery. I'll be happy to cheer you on if you need it. :)",
