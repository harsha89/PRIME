      "Content": "Jul 23, 2011 09:30PM - edited Jul 23, 2011 09:37PM by Dlia I was diagnosed with bc on June 30th after it not showing on the mammo or ultrasound. When I went for my yearly mammo they were seeing something in the left breastthat turned out to be cysts, but I had been complaining to the breast specialist and my gyn that I had been having breast pain in my right breast since Dec 2010. Because they saw something in my right breast in 2009 and the family history, I have to do a breast mri the following week after the mammo. Through the breast mri they found the cancer and precancerous cells across from the area where the cancer is. I have a family history of bc in two of my sisters who are both doing chemo, in one sister the cancer came back, my mom's sister and her daughter both had it, now to find out that my dads sisters and some of their daughters all had bc too. The worst part is the waiting and not having all the answers. My doctor pushed the surgery back to give my brca results a chance to come back. I'm scheduled for surgery Aug 1st. His recommendation so far is lumpectomy, radiation and the oral meds for five years, but he says that if the brca test come back that I have the gene his recommendation may change. Not sure if it's her2, estrogen/progesterone or TN. Still have peace just need patience...",

The first sister started out with ER+ and when it came back she had Her2+. I was 48 when I was dx'd, one 46 at dx and the other 54. Although the bc I was dx'd with was small my sister's was pretty big and stage 3. Wishing the best for us!!",
