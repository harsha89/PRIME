It showed evidence of lymphovascular invasion. It was not found in my lymph nodes. Mine is stage one. They can't stage it until after the surgery. I see my oncologist on Wednesday. That is six weeks after my surgery. I have not found this to be a quick process and the waiting has caused me a lot of anxiety. I am just taking it one day at a time. Despite the diagnosis and the surgery I have managed to really enjoy my summer. I love to host and socialize and found this very effective in controlling the anxiety. Also my dr prescribed me cannibas oil high in CBD and find it is working really well. One day at a time!! Good luck to you!!",
