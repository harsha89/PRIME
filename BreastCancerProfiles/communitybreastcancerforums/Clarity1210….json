I am 48 primary lesion idc 1.7 cm at 12 oclock and a day before my lumpectomy they did an MRI and discovered another mass at 10 o'clock. The 2nd mass ended up being ILC 1.1 cm. 3 nodes removed and 1 was positive. I have a blood clotting disorder so they will not be using any tomoxifen. They'll do an ooverectomy and after 6 weeks radiation will put me on Aromitase Inhibitors (I believe arimidex) I started chemo in the 17th of July. When I look at many diagnosis of women on these boards many that have positive nodes will often have adrriamycene in the mix. Rather than start second guessing after starting (as that won't do me any good) I'd like to hear from people that might have just started tc x 4 and did have at least 1 node involved. I'm about to enter day 4 of 1st round and among feeling too bad - but have just started getting some heartburn and slight burning in my esophagus. Just realized that we did not get prilosec and fearing some new side effects will kick in- no pharmacies open. Don't want this to spin out of control. Sorry I'm all over the place with this posting. New to all this. Tc x 4 positive node women let me know how it's going. But also am happy to hear from anyone. Thanks. Clarity1210 - not feeling much clarity. Thanks",
