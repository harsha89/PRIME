    "Content": "Apr 1, 2019 06:09PM - edited Apr 1, 2019 06:11PM by Zappo I have a recurrence of BC , left side. According to all the ads posted by proton therapy centers I seem to be the perfect candidate. Yet my radiation oncologist( who also does pt in addition to r.t.)says no. Because I've had r.t.before and my cancer is in the same area. I called Loma Linda, they turned me down too. I really think pt would be better for me but wonder where to try next",
