Is anyone familiar with this diagnosis? The nurse who called me with the report told me that it is very rare. My post op appt isn't until May 8th so I have no idea what kind of treatments are involved. Would love to hear from others who might have the same diagnosis. Log in to post a reply",

The office didn't give me any more information other than it's a very rare type of cancer. Unlike you, I am ER-/PR-, HER2 3+ overexpressed. At least that was the information that I got from the biopsy that diagnosed me as IDC. Seeing as that pathologist got the diagnosis wrong, I am not sure I can trust the markers. I meet with the surgeon on May 8th so hoping to get insight on a treatment plan. I had my surgery at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, a well-respected cancer research center; so I feel like I'm in the right place to get the proper treatment. I went to pubmed but couldn't find anything more than what was already on the internet.",

Hopefully, I will get more information regarding my diagnosis, markers, and treatment plan. Waiting is the hardest thing, but I've been keeping busy to make the time pass quicker. When the nurse called to give me an update, she didn't mention IDC with apocrine features; she simply said that I had Invasive Apocrine Carcinoma, a very rare cancer. Do you know if they are the same? From what I've read, my malignancy is very treatable, so I am thinking positive.",

It's the most optimistic of the few write-ups on the web. however; I'm glad to hear that your friend is doing well; that's very encouraging.
