    "Content": "DaisySummers wrote: Hi everyone, I am 23 years old and I found a lump in my breast a month ago. It has not changed in size (even with my period). I have no pain with it, although, I sometimes get shooting pain in the other breast. I went to the doctor, and he determined that my lump is a cyst. However, I never got any diagnostic testing done, just the manual exam... No one in my family has breast cancer. My mum has had cysts before and has had biopsies done - which all came back benign. My dad has skin cancer, and my grandfather died on stomach/bowel cancer. I used to smoke, drink relatively heavily, and took birth control for two years - I no longer am on birth control or smoke. I rarely drink. Any opinions? Log in to post a reply",
