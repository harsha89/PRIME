They found an odd lymph node and took it out. Sentinel nodes neg odd node positive. Port surgery before end of year and chemo starts in January. All three of my doctors say I am out of the box! I go 1 minute, hour, at a time. If not I would explode! I also look for the positive in things. My daughter is a 3 year triple neg survivor. Her dx and treatment were my hell so I can deal with my dx. We will both be survivors together and we will run relay for life together. We are special.
