I had Mastectomy on the left side but even the right underarm swells and is very painful. SOOO I got a spray bottle at Wal-Mart and filled it  with warm water and add 1/4 cup of baking Soda. Shake well.  After my shower I just spray under my arms and let it air dry,while doing my hair. No more swelling and no more smell !! Hugs Shirley  ",

I can't use anything with a scent b/c that makes me very sore, plus the lump under both arms.Where the drains were under my arm is still sore!   I bet I have 25 deodorants in my bath room. Can't use a one of them. Baking soda in warm water , works.  Hugs Shirley",
