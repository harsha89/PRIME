It took 5 days.  I was at the breast specialist's office yesterday, Friday and she told me my recurrence score was 13.  I have an appointment to see an oncologist next Friday.  My doctors said I might not need chemo but will be on medication.  My tumor size was 1.8 cm and had Stage I cancer.  On 2-14-08 I had the excisional biopsy. On 03-20-08 underwent the sentinel lymph node biopsy. Good Luck Ladies",

That's excellent that you do not have any side effects.  Do you know how long you have to take tamoxifin.  I heard that some people have to take medication daily for five years.  I'm scared about what type of treatment that I will need.  I'm just afraid of the bad side effects that it may or may not give me.  Wow, you ran five miles today.  You go girl!  I get tired very easily.  I just walked around my neighborhood one time last week and had to stop because I was tired.   Take care, you will be running for life for a very very long time.",
