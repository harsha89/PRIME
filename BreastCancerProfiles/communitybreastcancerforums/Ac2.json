I am currently 11 weeks pregnant with my third child and have always had cystic breasts. Of course in the eveing on Friday I discovered a area beginning from areola to dense tissue near arm pit that feels like a slightly curved thin fiberous vein. There are small nodules along it. At first I thought it was a clogged milk duct but it is painless. I work as a stylist so my right arm is held up and strained most days. I have had shoulder problems and burning sensations in my shoulder but that's all I can recall. I wasn't worried about breast cancer until I read a glamour magazine article stating that some women described their tumors as thin long almost coffee straw like. Once I saw that I began to panic. My paternal grandmother died of breast cancer but other than that there isn't breast cancer in my family. Two years ago I was diagnosed with very early melanoma but I caught it before it got into the blood stream. Since thenI know how scary the word cancer is. I will be calling my doctor tomorrow but so far everything online points to Mondor disease or cancer. There are a couple posts here that seem similar to mine but I can't find what the final diagnosis was. Thank you to anyone that has info",
