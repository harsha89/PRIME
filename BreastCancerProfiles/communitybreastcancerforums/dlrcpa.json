In November I managed to bruise the breast that I had treated for invasive ductal cancer 2 years ago. It was all red and purple, did not look like a \"normal bruise\" to me. I was scared witless and got in to see my radiology doctor as fast as I could. (She was the first doctor able to see me, I also called the oncologist.) She took a careful look at me and said I had bruised myself, it was not IBC. She knew because she'd seen both situations before. She said come back in a week and if it's not better, we will order more tests. In my case a week later, it was clearly a bruise that was healing. So an experienced doctor who's seen it all will be the best one to judge. Good luck, I hope it turns out to be something minor. -- Donna in VA",
