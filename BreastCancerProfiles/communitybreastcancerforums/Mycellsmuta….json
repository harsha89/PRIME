I'm in Australia so if for some reason anyone in Australia has any ideas that would be great. The Breast Cancer Network Australia site just basically says \"you won't be covered by any travel insurance for anything to do with your MBC, soz\". And every policy I've looked at has advanced cancer in 'exclusions' once you delve into the fine print, even when you try to buy coverage for pre-existing medical.",

What insurance are you getting, and have you actually checked that anything at all related to your cancer is covered?",
