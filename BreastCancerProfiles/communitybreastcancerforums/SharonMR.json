Before I was diagnosed I was told my large lump appeared to be normal! I know things have changed now. It's more so in the treatment area. Always always get further tests if your gut is telling you. If I had left my lump in I wouldn't be posting this now ? I had a good go who said I still want it out, I said so do I ! Hope this helps ðŸŒº",

I'm 58 ( I know I'm not young) BUT I was diagnosed at the age of 27 . I know at the time I felt very much alone. This type of forum would have been a Godsend for me. I'm STILL HEAR. we hear too many bad things about this cancer. I had 2 very young children at the time, so, I hope by me just still being here is of some encouragement to you all ðŸ˜ƒðŸ’œðŸ’œ",
