Like others have said, if the Oncotype DX is available to you that is a good predictor of your recurrance rate and how well chemo will benefit your specific tumor. That being said....even though my score came back fairly low, I had already made up my mind to go through chemo for many reasons. I'm a bit older than you--my 41st birthday was my diagnosis. I have no family history of the disease and no other health issues. My tumor was under 1cm IDC and I had a lumpectomy. I waited just over 2 months to get in to see my oncologist and get the result of the Oncotype DX. Waiting that amount of time made me nervous..what if something was missed. What if there were cancer cells that were traveling. Even one that ended up being missed by localized radiation could mean a recurrance in the following years. Additionally, as advanced as the Oncotype is, I don't believe it can be completely accurate in younger women. Breast cancer is typically an \"older\" woman's disease and for me I felt strongly that I shouldn't have gotten it to begin with. Chemo for me is a 4 round cycle. 4 times, 3 weeks apart and because I went into it without any other health issues I knew that my chances of tolerating it were good. I'm more than halfway done now and would definitely make the same decision for myself again. For me, it was peace of mind. If I do have a recurrance, I'll know that I did everything I could first time round. As you probably already know, the first occurance is your real chance to \"throw everything at the beast\". If it does come back, your options may be more limited. Now, you have had a mx so that is different than me. And you also had a bigger tumor. But you are younger. All of these things you need to hash out with an oncologist that you can trust. Get as many opinions as you can and do what you feel is right even if you're being told differently. For the first time in my life, I found that I could have some say in my medical treatment. That is very important. Good luck to you and feel free to PM me if you'd like.",
