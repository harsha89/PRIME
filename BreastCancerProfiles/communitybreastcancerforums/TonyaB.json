It showed up after the hyperthermia.  Right now, it is the only questionable area on the ct- everywhere else is clear. It is driving me nuts that I do not know if it is cancer or not. When I asked my second opinion onc if we should drain it again and see if it contains cancer cells, she said no.  When I told her I wanted to know, she said why?  Wouldn't anyone want to know? It would put me at stage 4 not 3. I want to know. First time I had it drained the fluid did not contain cancer cells but I was told this is not definative.

Some days are hard but there are a lot of good days too. Once you have a treatment plan in place things will look better.   Take care, Tonya",
