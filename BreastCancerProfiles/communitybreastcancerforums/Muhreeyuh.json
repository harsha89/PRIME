I found a hard immovable lump on my chest on the right side back in 2015, so about two years ago. It's located between the upper part of my breast and the collar bone closer to the sternum. I was 25 years old and brought it to the attention of my doctor during my annual physical. She did a breast exam and said that it was nothing to worry about. There were days when both my breast were itchy and some pins and electric sentsations and I feel they both were warmer than normal. They would go away and come back intermittently. Fast forward to today, the lump is still there and has never went away in between menstruation. I am not quite sure if it has grown in size. I now have a 7 month old daughter who I breastfeed. I now have a blue vein going to my right nipple that was never there before which I noticed a few weeks ago It has also started turning sideways. My left nipple is also turning but not as much as my right. And the vein is more prominent on the right with slight pain. I'm not sure if this is due to my breastfeeding on my side constantly. I've also lost a bit of sensation on both my areolas/nipple area. And have some indentions/dimpling on both breast which I'm not sure is due to the stretch marks. I have since moved and my new doctor has me scheduled for a for a mammogram/ultrasound on the 29th. I am sick with worry, I can't sleep or eat and have been obsessing about the situation. I keep trying to be seen sooner but they don't have anything sooner. My husband has grown frustrated with me and constantly says everything is fine. I can't help but worry. I just wanted to ask if by any chance I can hope for a benign result. I can't bare the thought of not being able to raise my daughter. Thanks in advance!",

It is hard to maintain composure in front of my daughter when all I want to do is break down and cry most days. I am just counting down the days for my scheduled mammogram and ultrasound. I've been obsessing with google symptoms since then which I know is a terrible way to spend my time. Praying for the best.",
