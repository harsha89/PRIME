I will probably end up going to the emergency room because the soonest appointment I could get with a specialist was for the 21st of March. My daughter keeps urging me to go as well. I will keep you all posted!  Thanks again and God bless, Sherry",

I then went to a health care clinic that was opened until 8pm. They took an x-ray of my back! He was more concerned thatI had pulled a muscle. I asked him if he thought it was lymphedema in my hand and he said he wasn't sure ,but didn't think so because it's usually on the palm rather than on the back of the hand which I thought was quite odd. To make it worse, I asked him if he was going to do anything just in case it was and he asked what I would like! I asked him if I should be on an antibiotic and he asked what I would like to take and he said \" Ok I can give you that. Do you want anything else?\" What a pip!I I would go to my own oncologist, but I moved 3.5 hours away and I'm in process of finding a new one,preferably one with a bit more sense than this guy. I'm on the zithromax and hoping that it brings the swelling down a bit. I guess I'll have to travel! Thanks for asking. How about you?",
