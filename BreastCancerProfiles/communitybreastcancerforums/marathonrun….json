I tried a Lafuma recliner, recommended elsewhere, but I am so short that I was unable to use it without pulling myself up with arms--out of the question after the surgery (and still out of the question).  My taller family  members could use it by using their legs.I'm 5feet even.  5'6\" and you would probably be good with one of the relatively inexpensive recliners. Good luck. With the pillow, I was able to get out of bed without assistance within 3 days of getting home.",
