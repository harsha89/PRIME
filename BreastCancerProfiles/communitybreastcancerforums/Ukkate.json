You will feel much better once you get some information and you start putting your \"plan\" together. Hugs",

That was some of my desire to keep working as hard as I could. Anyway, took 10 days off for the mastectomy and then missed a few weeks when I started chemo due to side effects. I declined the long term disability and have been consistently at work since starting taxol - even scheduling chemo at 2pm so I could work half a day first. I just found out that I'm not getting my promotion :(. So I'm almost kicking myself for busting my butt so much - and I have three kids at home too - youngest is 6. Anyway, I guess I'm trying to say do what feels best for you. (And I guess I just needed to vent). Kate",

One more to go!!!!  I only had it removed then because I didn't want to take any more time off work to go back to hospital after I was done with herceptin.  And I was under general so it seemed easiest.....
