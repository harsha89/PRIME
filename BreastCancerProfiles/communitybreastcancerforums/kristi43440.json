      "Content": "kristi43440 wrote: Hello all, I have been reading this site for a little while, and it is good to hear stories and experiences from others in the same boat.  My mother was diagnosed with IBC last winter.  Previously about 7 years ago she delt with breast cancer and went into remission.  She had a masectomy years ago and went through chemo and radiation.  This time she has already gone through chemo and then radiation.  She also has the estrogen negative sort of cancer.  Recently the docs found fliud around her lung (which I believe can be a side affect of radiation).  When the fluid was drained, they found breast cancer cells in the fluid indicating that it has metatistized to the lung.  She then develped lymphodema, one thing after another.  The lymphodema is in both of her arms and neck and now has fluid on one side of her back.  The fluid on her back is on the same side as where the lung fluid was drained and also the same side where recently she had a port put in.  She has been on oxygen on and off, but the last few days she has been on all the time.  She started chemo of doxil last Tuesday and it didn't seem to do much for getting the swelling down from the lymphodema (which the docs thought it would) and it didn't really help with her breathing (unfortunately).  She has been seeing a lymphodema therapist who is using compression bandages to get the swelling down to measure her for sleeves.  Last Friday she was miserable because she was in pain from the swelling and IBC.  I called her doc and she told me my mom may only have a few months left.  She has been on pain meds and they usually help her to breath better, they tell me because she is more relaxed when she is not in pain.  We went in to the doc Monday and immediately the doc started Taxol.  Whe hadn't been on this previously because she didn't want to lose her hair and had a really time with that the first time she had bc.  I told her we are at the point where she needs the strongest chemo possible and who cares about her hair.  I don't know how long it may take to see some results like reduced swelling and breathing easier.  The doc did not say anything yesterday about her only having a few months and I did not bring it up because I don't want her getting depressed or negative (I didn't tell her the other day about the doc saying she may only have a few months).  I am wondering if maybe the doc is not as negative as she was the other day or what.  I would think that if that is the case she should have told us straight up.  Unless she wants to see how the Taxol is going to work.  She is due back on the 30th of this month for more chemo.  I am wondering if any of you have had any experience with the lymphodema and breathing problems that my mom is experiencing and if it something she can come back from?  Sorry this was a long post, and thanks in advance for any insite.  (This is also posted in the IBC forum).
