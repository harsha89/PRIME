I am wondering how the side effects are on the Avastin.  I was getting the Neulasta shot the day after each chemo and the bone pain from that was overwhelming.  I googled side effects and found some folks were taking Claritin for the bone pain from the Neulasta shot.  SO i gave it a try.  It worked!  That led me to believe their might be some crazy thing that will help alleviate the abdominal pain from the Avastin if it is as bad as I think it is going to be.    Please if you have ANY information concerning this treatment and the side effects, I would love to hear from you.",
