Its still there, but lighter. Im going to the surgeon tomorrow and a little anxious, I guess its just a consult which bums me out as if it is something serious like IBC I want testing pronto. The mark as gotten a lot lighter. I know nobody is med professionals here, but would an IBC mark get lighter? Definitely still there but not as blazing red. Log in to post a reply",
