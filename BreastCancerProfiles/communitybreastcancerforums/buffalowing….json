In a similar position- 33, two kids, having biopsy today for what I thought was a previously biopsied benign lump but may not be the old one. It has calcifications too. I don't have discharge like you do but from what I have read that could be a sign of a papilloma, which isn't cancer. Sending good thoughts your way. The process is terrifying and full of anxiety and worry. Without question the most stressful experiences I have had to go through. Also, try not to focus on your perception of the size. I have learned that is way off. Both times I've stressed over the lump in this spot i would have sworn they were 2+ inches. Reports for both say 2cm",

I did because mine was done in a very \"thin\" area of my breast without a lot of surrounding tissue to buffer. My lump was basically right between skin and lung - the radiologist was crazy careful getting samples to avoid puncturing my lung. Stay iced up. The big refreezable gel cooler packs are your BFF for the first 24 hours- they're soft and moldable so you can sort of form them around your whole breast. My results came back as a complex sclerosing lesion- rare overall and especially for someone my age (33). It's very big (2.2 cm) and needs to come out even though it is not cancer. These things so thoroughly mimic carcinoma that ONLY pathology can differentiate. They are almost always birads 4c or 5 due to sharing all the physical features of invasive cancer. I feel beyond lucky; everything in my images and reports indicated IDC. See if you have a patient portal you can log into to access your report. It will give you specific language about what they found, especially regarding your calcifications. DJMammo has linked some docs with common lingo used in these reports and what they signify. Certain terms are more often correlated with benign or malignant findings. You may know more once you see the actual report. Good luck for your findings. I was a wreck during this process as mine looked so dire- I was mentally preparing for bad results. Hoping hoping hoping yours are benign.",

      "Content": "Feb 24, 2019 10:05PM - edited Feb 24, 2019 10:07PM by buffalowings whoa wait. Why are you jumping to an MRI? If a breast surgeon thinks a biopsy is worth your while you can go to a different radiology center and have a biopsy. An MRI for dense breasts with no biopsy is NOT standard and that wont be your progression. I can understand your frustration but this is way more about your anxiety at the moment than your breasts. Follow up, find a new radiology center, but in the meantime, check with your PCP about your anxiety. This is an outsized reaction to what has happened. It sounds like maybe the code for a fine needle aspiration (FNA) was entered instead of the one for a core needle biopsy and your physician just needed to re-enter a request for a CNB. At radiology centers, they cannot do the procedure until its ordered by your physician. It really sounds like the wrong procedure was accidentally ordered and they just needed your doctor to reorder the right one.Nothing indicates the radiologist just canceled it to spite you.",

      "Content": "Feb 28, 2019 08:11PM - edited Feb 28, 2019 08:12PM by buffalowings beepbop I recently had a Birads4 with high suspicion come back as a 2cm + non-malignant complex sclerosing lesion. It looked like carcinoma on the imaging because these things do, but it was not found to be cancerous. I will still need to see a breast surgeon about removing it and whether it impacts future odds of developing cancer so I am still hanging around here for now. But just so you know, sometimes even very suspicious things can come back benign.",

If they are swollen or atypical and there's a suspicious lump (or known tumor) in the breast they will biopsy the nearest lymph node as well. This is to see if the cancer has spread to the nodes which would affect staging as well as a treatment plan.",
