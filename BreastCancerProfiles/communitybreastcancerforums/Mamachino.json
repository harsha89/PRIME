Too bad none of that happened.  What DID happen is that, by mid-morning Friday, with no phone call, I had to start calling around to hunt the results down.  They were found on my doctor's desk, where they had been for at least 24 hours already, and then I was told by the office's office manager that my dr. was out of town, and that he would contact me with the results when he gets back NEXT THURSDAY. After I explained, rather loudly, that I was not going to wait another week to see if I had breast cancer, she tried to placate me by saying, \"Well, if you'd like, you can come in and I can give you some information on contacting an oncologist.\"  WAY TO GIVE AWAY THE RESULTS, EINSTEIN! My husband and I ended up going back to the hospital and speaking with the biopsy RN who cleared her afternoon in anticipation of our many, many questions.  She was wonderful.  But boy, was I ANGRY!  Probably not a bad mood to be in when you get your positive results back, because you just want to rip someone's head off, so if cancer is in the way, watch out! I am curious - why is it acceptable that, in one place, you receive results back in two weeks, in another place, 48 hours, in yet another, 10 minutes?  Why do we allow that to be so varied?  We're not waiting for strep throat cultures, for goodness sake, we're waiting on REALLY IMPORTANT INFORMATION. ",
