It seems most of you are new on this Journey. I wish you the best and please feel free to bounce any questions my way. I have had chemo, surgery, targeted therapy, radiation, and am now having more chemo....I am pretty well versed in all of it. I also work full time and have a 2 year old. You can do this!! Hugs.",
