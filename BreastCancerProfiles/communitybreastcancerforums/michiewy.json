She gave the speech that it is highly unlikely that it is cancer due to age, no family hx, and the fact that it hurts. She said that malignancies don't hurt. I hope all of that is true in my case, however I know that it's not always the case. She looked over the ultrasound and I explained how the appointment went and that I didn't feel that the tech had the transducer in the right spot when taking the images. She explained to me that breast tissue sometimes feels like gummy worms encapsulated. And when she did my exam she said that lump was a little harder and more pronounced than a normal fibroadenoma which was what she was expecting this to be. She went and spoke with Radiologist and he said to go ahead with the mammo. So she put the consult in and tomorrow I can call to make an appointment.  Meanwhile, my left breast is burning like crazy! Question, can a fibroadenoma cause dimpling? Because my breast is dimpling where the 3cm lump is. Is that normal? I was under the impression it only did that with more serious conditions.  I would be all to happy if it can with just normal breast tiasue! Ugh! This is so stressful! Haven't had a good night sleep in over a week!!",

For the last 3 months I had noticed a intermittent pain in my left breast. Never thought anything about it. Then just last week the pain return with a burning sensation. While taking a shower one day I was rubbing the area where the pain was located and noticed a lump. I wasn't really all that alarmed. Had my husband feel as well and he could feel it immediately. He insisted I make an appointment to get it checked out. I was able to get seen the next day. When the Dr. was asking me questions I was ashamed to admit that no I didn't do monthly checks. Being a nurse I should know better. Ive had a hysterectomy so I never think about since I don't get my period anymore.  He started the exam on the breast that wasn't effected then moved to the left side. He told me not to tell him where I felt the lumps. He found the lump I had stated where the pain was coming from, and had also found another lump in another area. He scheduled me for an ultrasound on Monday. I went home that night and when I was taking a shower (amazing how I find all of this in the shower) I noticed that my left breast was dimpling in the area where the Dr. found the second lump. I had seen it before, but never had put the two together.  Going in for the ulyrasound today. My husband is currently active duty Army and we are stationed in Seoul, Korea with our three children. So I'm worried that if its anything is serious, how this is going to play out. Will they send us back to the states? So many uncertainty.  So stressed. Just trying to stay positive.  Log in to post a reply",

I would visually point her in the right direction and she still had trouble.  Finally she found the but the wand was barely touching my skin so you couldn't see them very well. The only thing that was seen was one lump is 1 cm the other is 3cm and they are solid. She wiped me off and said it looked like normal breast tissues, just to continue with my monthly exams. I was like that it? I went right to my Dr.s office and said that I want an appointment.  So now that the US proved to be a joke, at least the lumps did show up. So I am going to ask for a mamo. And if necessary a biopsy. I refuse to be brushed off.",
