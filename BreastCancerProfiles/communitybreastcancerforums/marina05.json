She said Don't worry, take advil, and see you soon.(blood tests like alkaline phosphatase and calcium were normal) A few days ago, I felt like I had wrenched the heck out of my back and pain got so bad today I went to ER. Dr took a chest xy with rib films and said all was well. Well, I know bone xys can't really tell you anything and he wouldn't order a bone scan \"Out of my field, see your onc and take pain meds\". So now I have to wait 3 weeks to see onc and wondering should I go to my PCP and talk him into a bone scan? Or just grit my teeth and wait to see my onc, who is the only one I really trust anyway? Does this sound like mets? Paranoia strikes deep! Was originally diagnosed stage 3 3 years ago. Can I put any faith in a plain xy? Log in to post a reply",

I feel like I have been kicked in the side by a horse and am scaring myself to death. Can you have bone and or liver mets and normal lab tests like alk phos and calcium? I am heading down a dark path mentally and can't seem to shake myself out of it. Onc is out of town",

Hurts in my back and around front too, a dull ache and especially if I twist around. I think I am going to push for a Ct scan of the chest and abdomen. I have become a total hypochondriac. My husband told me I had bruised my back by checking it so often! But really i have become quite obsessed with every little ache and pain and they don't go away until i have a scan to make sure things are OK, and I pray that they are for you and me too. I live 7 hours from the cancer center in the middle of absolutely nowhere so I basically have to grin and bear it for 2 more weeks till i see my onc. He comes back from vacation in a week, so I am thinking maybe i can call him and have hime set up some scans before my appointment, but he always says \"I really need to examine you first\"",

I was diagnosed 8 years ago with stage 3 breast cancer and I honestly thought I was going to die in 6 months! I live in a very small town and didn't know where to turn, but managed to get to the second opinion clinic in at the breast center in Aurora and I can honestly say they gave me my life back. It's a long story, which I won't go into here, but now I travel up there for my routine screening and oncology visits. You can rest assured you are in the best of hands. There is all the hope in the world for you . Don't be afraid; you are traveling a road we have all been down and you will find many helping hands along the way. Some of the most encouragement and love came to me from people I had just met, or in the case of the boards here, people I have never met. May God bless you and your family.",

Couldn't believe it, after years of negative mammos, in fact my tumor NEVER showed up on a mammo, just found a mass of lymph nodes in my armpit! Then after countless screw ups and criss crossing the country to \"supposed\" experts, only to have one stupid thing after another happen, I have finally come to believe that it is by God's grace I am still alive, cancer free and have become an advocate for other cancer patients, esp. breast cancer patients as part of my job as a nurse. I am working on 7 years cancer free and I plan to live a long, long time, as I have said, by the grace of God.",
