I have an extensive family history with cancer, mainly breast cancer (mother and I had it at the same time the first time and she died of it, and her mother and grandmother died of it, plus two great-aunts with breast/ovarian cancer). Just found out I'm BARD1 positive (BRCA negative). My gyn-onc says I need my ovaries out, even though I don't think there is evidence that BARD1 causes ovarian cancer. I'm 51 and almost menopausal, but still, I'd rather keep my ovaries if I don't need to lose them because of the long-term adverse effects of being without. Am I crazy to want to keep them? (I had six pregnancies and one live birth--major depression issues after each lost baby. Hormones have always been problematic for me. I can deal with hot flashes/night sweats, but the emotional lability scares me).",
