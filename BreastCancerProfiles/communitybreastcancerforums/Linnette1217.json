They have been slowly rising about 2 points every month or two and as of last month they had risen to 44.  My onc told me these are low compared some of his patients, but I am wondering if there is anything preemptive we should be doing, instead of waiting for something to show up on one of my scans.  As far as treatment goes, I started on tamoxifen, had an oophorectomy and and was swhitched to Femara which I have been taking for 2.5 years.

      "Content": "Linnette1217 wrote: Hi Ladies, A couple months back I posted about a comment that my breast surgeon made when she learned of my reconstruction plans which was immediate DIEP Flap recon. Basically she was concerned of the recovery time of this surgery and that at this point in my life,  I should be \"living life with zest\" not down for an extended period of time trying to recover.  Even though I knew she was only one player from my team of care, and that my onc, as well as plastics, would have advised me against such a  procedure if they felt in was not in my best interest, the comment almost sent me spiraling to that dark place.  It was the responses that I received from the wonderful ladies on this board that prevented me from ending up in that dark place as well as reaffirming my decision to have the reconstruction I had chosen. I just wanted to thank you all and update you. I am 6 days out of a blmx with immediate DIEP Flap recon. All though there were some unforeseen complications (small blood vessels and an issue with a previous c-section scar) and my surgery lasted 18 hours, I feel incredible!!!!  The only severe pain I had post-op was shoulder and arm pain due to the positioning during the surgery. My abdomen and breasts are tender, but nothing like I had thought they would be. I am walking without pain, able to lift my arms, etc.. The drains have been a bit of an inconvienence, but if that's all I have to complain about I'm not gonna say a word. I will be ready for my oldests child's high school graduation on June 5th! I have absolutely no regrets!!!!!! I was diagnosed with limited mets, orbital mets and spread to the ovaries was also found when I had my oopherectomy in January. Three weeks of rads took care of the eye, and since my ovaries are now gone that is no longer an issue either. My last two quarterly scans have been clean, so the only place the cancer was detectable was my breasts, yes both breasts, one ductile and the other lobular. So as of last week I officially began \"living life with zest, just by having the reconstruction (thanks Konkat) and I am joyfully dancing with NED as well. LIFE IS GOOD!  Thank you all for your support and encouraging words and just for being here.  I don't post often but I follow this board regularly.  At almost 7 month since my initial dx of bc & stage IV, I am at a point where I can look at this ugly disease as a chronic condition.  It is no longer the first thing I think about when I awake nor the last thing I think about when I fall asleep. It has become secondary in my life, something I never thought was possible!  I feel with this last surgery complete and the positive scans I I have had, I can actually think about my future and make plans that have nothing to do with cancer! Thank you again Ladies, and although you may not hear from me often please know that you are always in my thoughts & prayers!   Linnette 10/19/09 Initial bc dx & stage IV. Er/Pr+ Her2 neg.

Thank you in advance for both. This coming Tuesday is my one year cancerversary, mets from the get go, and what a ride it has been! My mets were isolated and after radiation the only sign of cancer was the primary which was removed this past May. I have been dancing with NED since. I was originally prescribed Tomaxifen but after my Oophorectomy in February I was switched to Femara and although it appears to be working the se's have been so harsh and QOL has been seriously impacted. I have more bad days than good, and most weeks I will have 1-2 really good days and than 3-4 where I am on the couch most of the time. I had carpal tunnel surgery on both wrists over the summer and although the shooting nerve pain has subsided, the pain I have in my fingers and hands seems to have gotten worse. I can't open bottles/jars and even squeezing the toothpaste will seem almost impossible at times. I am so stiff after sitting or driving in the car I feel like I am in my 80's. Usually when I have a good day I tend to over due it because I know it's not going to last and then I really pay. I used to be so active and on the go, now I barely leave the house. For the last two+ months I have been so emotional, I don't even know who I am. I want the upbeat, positive girl back but I am so afraid to stop a treatment that is potentially saving my life and I know when I go to my next appointment with my on., that is exactly what he is going to suggest. I have been on a second cycle of Vitamin D with one more dose left and there has been no change. My PCP has prescribed Tylenol 3 for breakthrough pain but if I took it as often as I probably could really use it, the thirty tablets she prescribed last Monday would be almost gone by now. I feel like my children think I'm faking it, but that's a whole different post. My husband thinks if just get out of the house it will help. It doesn't. He even suggested that it may be time I speak to a professional because sometimes depression can cause pain. I told him he was watching too many pharmaceutical commercials. I am going to try a couple of other alternative measures before I meet with my onc next month. I am signing up at the Y on Monday and I'm gong to try to begin a regular but light exercise regime, and I am going to look into guided imagery and maybe a yoga class. When I meet with my onc I will ask him about taking about taking a Femara vacation. I heard that sometimes when you begin taking it again the se's are not as bad. Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I was really hoping to get at least a couple of years, out of this treatment 10/19/09 Initial bc dx & stage IV. Er/Pr+ Her2 neg.

Nothing severe, just a little nagging across my forehead. Then yesterday, I woke up with a killer headache, which felt like a sinus headache.  I have been a mildly congested, but because my original mets were found in the orbit of my eye I am concerned about location & duration of these headaches.  Maybe it's a combination of scanziety and sinus trouble.
