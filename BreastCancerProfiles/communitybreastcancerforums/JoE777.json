I'm taking letrozole with 400 mg of kisqali and monthly zometo infusions. I've lost half my hair but it has slowed after 5 months. I had enough for 3 people so no one notices unless I complain. I took letrozole 2012 and exemistane 2013 and lost my hair so I can't blame it all on Kisqali. Took two cycles of kisqali 600mg then reduced to 400 mg because of low white count. My tumors in the sacrum/iliac and small mets in lungs are significantly reduced and no new activity so ugly SE are preferred to unchecked cancer. It got me out of a wheelchair and back to a slow walk.",

Every emotion you named is so normal and you'll be so much calmer after you know you path of treatment. You can see my signature at the bottom of my post. I had a lumpectomy at the bottom of my breast(almost a partial mastectomy) but my surgeon did a great job so I just have a perky side for a 69 yr old. I did have dye injections in preop with a cat scan to locate the sentinel lymph node for removal to test for cancer. It was clean so no need for more nodes to remove. I told my surgeon if my margins weren't good, go ahead and do a mastectomy so when I woke up I had to ask what procedures they did. Needless to say I was relieved it was a lumpectomy but would have gone further if that was needed. Hang in there and try to remember to breathe. I'm bad about holding my breath and collecting all that tension in my chest and shoulders. Hugs and have a peaceful night. Keep us posted. J",
