    "Content": "WrestlingMom wrote: Good Day All,  So on Friday I happened to look in the mirror after I took my shower and saw, to my horror that half my nipple is grey/green colored.  I had to admit the breast has been burning a bit off and on over the last month, but I thought I slept wrong or something else.  Of course now that I see this, I realize how much it has been hurting, all the way under my armpit and through my breast into the center of me. Background, 4 years ago I had a small \"something\" in the same breast in a mammogram, so they sent me for an MRI which turned out inconclusive.  I figured it was just the cyst that has been there for years and never thought about it again.  And...I never have had another mammogram or MRI.  I moved, had different Dr's and never mentioned it.  Denial is a very powerful thing. I've been in a horrible job for the last 2 years after getting laid off, and all my energies have gone to just trying to survive.  My health and family has taken a backseat.  I finally had to admit total exhaustion and found out my thyroid that was normal in the spring, was extremely elevated this fall prompting an increase in thyroid medications.  But I'm still just wiped out, no energy, no focus, nothing.  I know some of it is due to menopause which I went through early at 40, but I was pretty lucky since my son was born when I was 38. Any of you that have had Pagets, does this ring true?  I can't imagine it is just a dermititis with the color and the burning sensations within.  I'm 46, soon to be 47 with a late pregnancy. I go into the Dr on Tuesday, my PCP and we'll see what happens.  I'm scared of the pain honestly, because that breast is so sensitive.  Truth be told, I haven't allowed my husband anywhere near it in a long time.
