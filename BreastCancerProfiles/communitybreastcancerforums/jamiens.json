      "Content": "jamiens wrote: Greetings everyone. I'm new to posting and only started reading about a week ago. My baseline mammogram upon turning 40 discovered cancer. Stage 1A. I had two biopsies and a lumpectomy and re-excision. The lumpectomy margins and the re-excision margins both showed DCIS, more the second time around. My surgeon and I decided to quit messing around in there and move forward with a bilateral mastectomy. I meet with the reconstruction surgeon (leaning toward DIEP or free TRAM) next week. Today, I went in for a check-up and my OncotypeDX is 61. 61! I'm scrolling through signatures and I don't see numbers that high. I'm definitely having chemo but now the team is all going to talk and see if I should have chemo first or surgery first. At every turn, my doctors say the results are unexpected. Does anyone else have a similar experience? I've been trying so hard to remain positive and have a good attitude but the last month feels like I've gone from \"lumpectomy with radiation\" to \"hope you're hardy, bye-bye boobs, hello chemo\" Help me feel not alone?

(I had hoped the same thing you mentioned.) The other odd thing was that my biopsies were both PR+ although weak but the Oncotype was PR-. I firmly and faithfully believe that I'm going to be okay in the long run. I was (kinda am) just shaken that everything seems to be going the wrong way from what was anticipated. My dh wants to make a 3 hour drive for a second opinion but I don't really see what another team would do differently? At this point, I am all for bmx and I don't think another team would say, \"Don't do chemo.\" You know? My doctor HAS been wrong in her predictions but I don't feel that's her FAULT, rather unexpected circumstances. I meet the reconstruction surgeon and the chemo doctor next week. If I am not feeling confident and comfortable with them, I will seek a second opinion. I don't feel locked in, just okay with who I know *so far* -- my general surgeon and nurse navigator.  ",
