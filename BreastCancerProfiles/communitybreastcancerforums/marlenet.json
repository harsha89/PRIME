Take it one day at a time... take a deep breath... as scary as this is, a strong support system does wonders. When you are at the Dr make sure he/she explains to you in language you understand. ",

BOOHOO. but the office gave me a iv of  fluids, antibiotics and bang i was feeling good.  I heard biotene toothpaste and mouthwash may help with the mouth sores.  I also heard munching on ice cubes dunning tx will help. I will try anything. Other then that i have been feeling okay. going to bed early, trying to eat right and walking everyday at least 1/2 hour.  The hair is really starting to go.  Going to buzz it this weekend.  Hope all of you guys are doing well and thanks for sharing.  When i'm feeling blah or scared i read this and it truly helps!  I will keep you  all in my prayers and send you good and healing vibes. ",
