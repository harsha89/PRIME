I am going for an ultrasound on Dec 23 as I noticed a lump after my last surgery in November and my PS wanted to check to make sure it isn't anything to be concerned about. Hoping its a fatty tissue or something since the DMX and reconstruction, everything is lumpy anyways ;) I will wait and hope I get accepted into the FB group. Thx again! Ally ",

In 2013 I had DCIS, triple negative, grade 3 tumor. I was also told that there was isolated tumour cells but the RO and MO decided not to do any rads or chemo, just surgery. I underwent DMX with immediate reconstruction and just finished my 6th surgery in October. As I didn't get any rads for my HD, I'm thinking that I might be BRCA2+ since my Dad was tested positive for it. He passed away in 2014 from prostate cancer and had given his oncologist consent to be genetically tested when he was doing his clinical trials. After he passed, they got the results and my Dad's oncologist called me and informed me that my Dad had the BRCA2 mutation gene. It's hard to determine if my HD and BC is tied together because of the chemo treatment or because of the gene. I was just told recently of the genetic results so its still fresh. I never made the connection that HD and BC is also closely related. I feel like I'm a sitting duck since I had no adjuvant treatment for my BC and if I have the BRCA2 mutation, its like a ticking timebomb. FYI...I sent a FB request to join the private group. Thanks for all the wonderful information. My head and brain is working overtime :)",
