But, the post op nurse put tape on me, and then realized her mistake, and ripped the tape off along with my skin. So, the next time I had surgery, I had them write on my shoulder-No adhesives, no bandages. My surgeon also used glue instead of steri strips, which don't bother me, but she didn't want to take any chances with the steri strips. Make sure they write it right on your shoulder, so they don't make that mistake again.",
