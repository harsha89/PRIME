In my case the radiologist who read the mammogram was very good at showing me the calcifications and explaining briefly why they would need a biopsy. When I went to the surgeon, she was way  more evasive- we won't know until we biopsy- etc. I think many drs are worried about offering a speculation and then being wrong, or maybe it could be a couple of possibilities.  After you get the pathology report you will get the same sort of info people here have- or maybe it will be nothing. trish",

The technician will take you into a room with the machine. She will probably give you a small sticker to place where you felt the lumb. The will give you 2 small stickers with metal dots on them to cover your nipples. Then the technician will have you stand up next to the machine. Your breast is place on the lower plate of the machine. The top plate lowers down compressing the breast and an xray is taken. They reposition you a number of times. Usually a radiolist will look at it and if they see something, they may bring you back for more pictures. I found it uncomfortable more than painful. I am quite small so the position were very awkward, but it is quick. The ultrasound is completley painless and easy. You lie down. The tech puts some gel on your breast then rubs a probe? over them. The views are on a screen. It is the same type of ultrasound they use when you are pregnant.  Normally you just have a mammogram, but if they think there is something ( and you have a lump) then an ultrasound is a pretty normal screening tool. The ultrasound is good at identifying cysts- which are normally quite harmless and quite common. Try not to worry any more than you have to until you have some results, as everyone says a high percent of these are benign. Trish",

I know I made the right decision for me at the time. I find now that I rarely wear a prothesis, but I have one I can if I need to. I too was not up to all the additional surgery recon would require. I wanted minimal medical intervention.  I'm not sure what the future will bring-- if the other side has a problem, maybe I will talk to a PS, likewise if I someday decide I'm not happy the way  I am I know there may be  options. Sure, I would rather have avoided this whole thing, but what happened did and I made the best decision I could and moved forward. The recovery was not bad, particularly since I didn't have a SNB. I din't get any \"rules\" or even suggestions from my doctor for post surgery, but I did use alot of common sense and took things slowly. I was lucky my drains came out right away. There was discomfort after the surgery, but not a lot of strong pain. It sounds like you made the decision that fits you. Trish",

Different places have different scheduling, but it would be fairly common to have to wait until the first of September anyway.( Heck the first surgeon I went to it was at least a 2 week wait to get in to see her) Then all the tests took at least that long to get appointments ( MRI, etc.)  You can have your appointments, get things set up and then enjoy your family. Disney with a large group may be just the place to distract you. Don't forget that even though they they have found Atypical cells it does not mean you have cancer.

If the DCIS is estrogen + (er+) Tamoxifen will often be recommended for 5 years. Other drugs sometimes if you are past menopause. A masectomy is usually only required if the dcis is spread throughout the breast: is extremely large: or if the women is small breasted and the lumpectomy would not leave much. There are some women who choose a mastecomty for peace of mind, but that is often a choice. The majority of people wiith dcis are successfully treated- no chemo, and most don't need mastectomy.

I was told they intentionally irrated the skin so the skin  is affected more. They use a bolus ( heavy pad) every other day to concentrate? ( not sure if that is the right word) the rays. It's too early for me to tell about other side effects, but I suspect they are comparable- I think there is less concern for the lungs, but I may be remembering incorrectly. Everything else is comparable. Good luck- hope you don't need to find out Trish",

I've had biopsies twice for calcifications. Once it was DCIS, and once it was normal calcifications. There is no way to know without the biopsy.When they suspect calcifications they seem to take so many pics it is not suprising you are sore and you focus on the breast.

I did get a bath and bodyworks gift card for Christmas that I think I will spend this weekend- something fragrant and non-white. ( I've already started back with deodorant- yay) kajo- my local walmart has aloe ( target only had with alcohol) if they don't work you can get it on amazon.

The sim was not as fun. I had a different tech for that. She put my arms in a slightly different position and kept telling me not to move. She tried to adjust to get the marks right and constantly said \"don't help me\" In the end they could't get anything to line up right. Told me I was breathing too deeply- how the hell am I not supposed to breathe at all I'm holding my arms in the air tight for 50 mins. They got real annoyed and eventually sent me home- rescheduled for 4 days later. Different techs that time- they were in a better mode. They added a pillow to the edge of the mold so that my arm had some support. It still took 40+ mins but was much less stressful. They use tatoos- only the one high on my chest is a sticker. The tech explained that the dr is adamant about using a sticker there because it will show even after radiation if it is a tatoo. The first set of tatoos were small and blended into my many freckles- the second set are definitely highly visible. When it looked like everything  was lining up they called in the doseimetrist(sp?). She verified a few measurements and left. After each xray they would run off to see the radiologist. The first day when it didn't work she  came in at the end and sent me home. Again you must be nervous you are breathing deeply. The second day she wasn't there, but the other guy in the group checked off on the xrays- he didn't come in. I ended up starting on Monday ( 3-4 days later than planned) they took pictures on Friday. Said will do them every 5-7 days. It only added about 10 minutes to the treatment. The whole thing usually takes about 10 minutes normally.( still long enough for my arms to go numb and me to get dizzy getting up everytime) They haven't said anything about lotions- it was in a handout they gave me before starting- Use any lotion you want just not before treatment.No deodorant and only shave with electric razor ( I'm ignoring that one and I do use the crystal deodorant. I don't ask) They weren't panicy about the sticker and I have put lotion over the whole area. If it falls off it falls off- I am using lotion liberally before I have a problem I'm noticing dryness on both sides but then it is winter and dry skin is a problem. The one thing I have consistently notice is an attempt to presereve whatever dignity they can. When they made the mold- the tech brought in a blanket to cover me \"so I didn't get cold\". The dr made sure the door was closed. When the do the treatments they line everything up then cover my one breast with a cloth. Hope things get better for you Trish",

I was told mild soap- no concerns about fragrances except if it irratates stop using it. I have had pain all along the arm- it feels like muscle pulls/ strain/soreness. The nurse suggested that it may be the arm position. while I'll buy that the arm position is aggravating it I can't believe it is causing it.   It feels sore deeper rather than just on the skin. Not sure if it is radiation or still scar tissue forming from the surgery. I have had some recent shooting pains- but I was warned about them.  I found the natural crystal deodorant in my grocery store ( I had looked it up on amazon so I recognized it) It sort of works. Because I am trying not to wear a bra ( which means no prothesis) I tend to wear more layers- so more sweating. I am now a bright pink in the radiated area with a contact dermatitis rash higher up on my chest. I'm saving the cortaid for when the itch gets really bad. Ulla I hope it gets better for you. I have 17/25 treatments done. Trish Bailey my local Walmart has aloe without alcohol and minimal dyes and fragrances.",

The radiologist verifies that they have corrrectly marked the area and the needle is withdrawn leaving behind a wire. The ends are taped off ( in my case covered with a paper cup- very attractive) and you are ready for them to remove the mass.

If that does happen and I need to stop I definitely will not do the last 3. Abbi- I have already said I will not come back just to have my skin checked unless I have a problem. The dr likes you to come back not sure if it was 2 or 4 weeks afterwards. I said I'll make an appointment if there are any problems. Now they are pushing for me to meet more with an oncologist. I don't want all these appointments. I know there are people who feel more comfortable when they see drs - not me. the fewer appointments the better.Everything they suggest seems to come with more frequent \"monitoring\". I met the oncologist once at the rad drs insistence. It may be petty but the onc considers DCIS a precancer- if I don't have cancer I don't think I need to see an oncologist. ( BYW- I am finishing up a series of radiation treatments following a mastcetomy- It may be noninvasive, but I think I had early stage cancer). I am ready to finish up radiation and not see anyone until my regular screening with my PCP this summer.  Sorry but some days things just get negative",

The lump may be related or totally unrelated- it sounds like they are more concerned about the calcifications. Why not ask the surgeon when you meet her/him or Wednesday. Start writing down your questions now. You will almost certainly have a biopsy- again what type is the next question for the surgeon. Good luck Trish",

I am also very small and knew that even my small amount of dcis would mean removal of a significant chunk of my breast. If that was all it would have been fine, but keeping that small amount of tissue would mean 7 weeks of radiation and 5 years of tamoxifen. For me that was too high a price for a small amount of tissue. Radiation and hormone theraphy for me was more invasive than removal of my breast.  For others the loss of a breast would be more of a problem, but when you have always been a A or AA, very little of your self image is based on breast size. I did not want radiation and I did not want multiple surgeries for reexcisions. My gut kept saying mastecomy, but it was not an easy decision to come too. In the end it would have been necessary anyway. There was not enough tissue to ever have gotten an acceptable margin and I had a small amount of dcis. Unfortunately I still have to do the radiation as the tumor was on the chest wall. My only suggestion is that if you are  even considering radiation- talk to a ps before the surgery. I opted not too- thinking that if I ever want to I can deal with it later, however the radiation  now limits my choices ( prob never would anyway). Make your own decision. If you feel uneasy go with the lumpectomy, but if you keep coming back to thinking a mastectomy is best- do that. I suspect many have a fleeting thought of just take them off- however that is different from someone who keeps coming back to \"this makes more sense for me\"  I also will add it was helpful to hear from others that I wasn't crazy or overreacting ( how the dr made me feel)",
