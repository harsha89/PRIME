I start my radiation next week - 16 whole breast, 4 booster. I'm have a fair complexion and am concerned about discomfort. Ideally, I'd like to continue to work out at the gym during treatment - provided I feel up to it. Anyone have suggestions for keeping physical activity in play? Thanks!! Heather",

Initial biopsy did not come back cancerous, but doc opted to remove trouble area which came back DCIS. When is your surgery? I'm here if you need anything. My biggest questions revolve around genetic testing and what those results could do for my diagnosis. I'd love to hear other people's experiences and choices. I wish you well!!! Edit: also found a good start of questions you should ask at komen.org",

So just like you, my biopsy was inconclusive although the microcalcifications they found were in a suspicious grouping. My doctor said there was no 'known carcinoma' but the cells were doing something strange. So, we opted for surgery which came back DCIS. I have an MRI tomorrow and genetic testing next week. Scary stuff. Please keep me posted on your progress - good luck!",
