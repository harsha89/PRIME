Although it sounds very reassuring I still need to know for certain that there is no sign of cancer to put my mind at ease and so I can stop worrying. I really dislike having a doctor that seem unconcerned with a situation like this . The last ultrasound i had the tech told me that everything is okay and im fine but my thing is how are they so sure ? It took the doctor 4 weeks to contact me with my results and that\u2019s only because my mom called the office and was very adement on speaking with the doctor because she seen how emotional this whole thing has been for me. The doctors response for why she took so long to call was \u201c if it was urgent I would\u2019ve called sooner \u201c that upset because whether it was urgent or not I still deserve to know as soon as my report was reviewed.",

I don\u2019t have health insurance so I don\u2019t have a primary care doctor. I felt the palpable lump in my left breast and I made an appointment with planned parent hood. During the exam I told the doctor that I feel a lump in my right breast too. She felt it and she told me she didn\u2019t feel anything so because she didn\u2019t feel anything she wrote me and ultrasound script for only the left breast. I was very frustrated because i knew what I was feeling and she completely ignored it. I went ahead and got the ultrasound done for my left breast because I was so anxious i just couldn\u2019t wait. Up to this day the doctor at planned patent hood never called me regarding my results I even called their office and never received a call back. So last month in October I went to a clinic inside of a hospital and had a breast examination with a obgyn because I was still very concerned about the lump I was feeling in my right breast, she could feel the lump as well ! She wrote me a script for a bilateral breast ultrasound and the results for the right breast came back as \" 1:00 7 cm from nipple 3.6 x 1.2 x 2.5 cm and 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm circumscribed solid masses are parallel to the skin and likely represent benign fibroadenomas. Your recent breast exam performed on 10/30/2018 showed an area that we believe is probably benign (probably not cancer) however within the next 6 months we feel that you should have a follow up breast study to confirm that this area has not changed \"",

The report says At 1 o'clock 3-4 cm from nipple, there is a 10 mm x 4 mm oval shaped, parallel oriented, circumscribed, smooth border, hypoechoic mass with no suspicious imaging characteristics seen. This appears to be a solid mass. At 1 o'clock 7 cm from nipple, there is a 14 mm x 5 mm oval shaped, parallel oriented, circumscribed, smooth border, hypoechoic mass with no suspicious imaging characteristics seen. This appears to be a solid mass. At 12 o'clock 6 cm from the nipple, there is a 4.3 cm x 2.1 cm oval shaped, parallel oriented, circumscribed, hypoechoic mass with no suspicious imaging characteristics seen. This may be a complicated cyst or low level solid mass. In in the axilla, there are morphologically normal-appearing lymph nodes. Is there anything I should be worried about? A birads 3 doesn't really let me know anything for sure it's like a big \u201c I don't really know we'll just watch it \u201c to me and it doesn't sit well with me. They want me to go back for follow up imaging in 6 months but that's such a long time to wait. This situation has been very emotional for me and I don't know what to think Log in to post a reply",
