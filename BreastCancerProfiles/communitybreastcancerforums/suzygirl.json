I hope you were given a pamphlet describing the procedure, which is done with you lying on your stomach, with your breast hanging through a hole and the radiologist working from below while checking locations with x-rays (they take LOTS of x-rays). If you didn't get a thorough explanation of the procedure , try Googling it and you will find out the details. My HMO assigned an assistant to stand by me, to hold my hand and to rub my shoulders and generally be reassuring during the somewhat lengthy biopsies (a total of 16 cores were taken). You will be given epinephrine and lidocaine (like for dental procedures) before the core needle punches and I don't recall it being particularly painful -- just uncomfortable lying still, face down. You will be given an ice pack to stop any bleeding (one of my sites bled quite a bit, the other virtually not at all) and to hold down swelling. I had a very, very unusual after-effect. While sitting up waiting for the bleeding to stop, I began to feel faint and started to shake uncontrollably. The nurse said it was a reaction to having had three injections of the epinephrine. I spent a very uncomfortable two hours until almost instantly I went from shaking/trembling to feeling absolutely normal. Which leads to my biggest piece of advice -- TAKE SOMEONE WITH YOU. I had underestimated the impact of the procedure and because I had driven myself I couldn't be released until I was fully recovered. I was told three days later that one site was wholly benign, the other had atypical ductal hyperplasia (high risk). I eventually ended up with an excisonal biopsy of that site which then uncovered invasive ductal carcinoma. I then had an MRI followed by two ultrasound and MRI guided biopsies of other suspicious findings. Unfortunately I had a final diagnosis of bilateral Stage 1 invasive cancer (neither tumor was visible on a mammogram) accompanied by very extensive DCIS. I had bilateral mastectomies . I thought the MRI and stereotactic biopsies were quite similar, but both seemed considerably more complicated than the ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy. For you, I hope BOTH of your suspicious sites turn out to be benign, which statistically they do 80 percent of the time!",

Has your oncologist given you an idea of the statistical rate of recurrence of your disease and how much taking hormone therapy might improve it? That will give your head some numbers to evaluate, if not your heart. I too had a mostly, not pure, mucinous tumor on one side, much larger, and clear lymph nodes. I had a low risk Oncotype Dx score so no chemotherapy or radiation (had bilateral invasive ductal carcinoma and double mastectomy). I was 66, two years ago. Despite low risk, I decided to at least try anastrozole. Many women have virtually no side effects. I have had hot flashes and night sweats, a self limiting depression and worsening bone mineral density. All these can be managed and I feel reallygreat, actually. I am doing everything I can to prevent recurrence. It's a personal decision, but my suggestion is to at least give it a try. You can always stop. But you have a really positive likelihood of good health regardless!",

I am an example. After my initial diagnosis of Stage 1 IDC, ER+/PR+ in my left breast, plus very extensive DCIS, my suspicious radiologist recommended an MRI and eventually -- after many a biopsy and double mastectomy -- a second, smaller stage ! ER+/PR+ IDC tumor was found in my right breast as well --bilateral/synchronous (at the same time) invasive breast cancer. I believe the radiologist pressed for further investigation because of what he called my \"extremely active breast tissue, which we often find runs in families (my grandmother died at 49 of breast cancer, but I am not BRCA positive).\" Only the first, larger tumor was tested by the Oncotype DX test (low recurrence score), and my oncologist said \"We'll treat both cancers at the same time\" That, for me, meant just anastrozole after surgery, no chemo and no radiation. I think it is important, and reassuring in a way, to note that a contralateral breast tumor is virtually always a new primary tumor -- it has not spread from the other side and does not represent a metastases (or even, technically, a recurrence). As breast cancer patients, we are followed carefully, with regular mammograms of remaining breasts, and the new second cancer is likely to be found very early. The prognosis for bilateral breast cancer is usually stated to be about the same as the prognosis of the more advanced cancer of the two. ",

Not one or many things we do or that just happen to us leads to a 100 percent guarantee we will get breast cancer, or prevent it. Even women with highly penetrant BRCA genes may never get breast cancer. The truth is that we are mortal, we are not made to live forever, and as complicated as our bodies are, things will inevitably break down, especially as we life longer. My OncotypeDX score predicts a 5 percent chance of recurrence in 10 years. Coincidentally, at age 67 and with good cholesterol and blood pressure numbers, I also have a 5 percent risk of a major cardiovascular event in the next 10 years. Either one may \"get\" me, but the odds are they won't. So I carry on taking my anastrozole, eating healthfully, drinking sparingly, exercising diligently, crossing my fingers, but I am under no illusion I or anyone else will ultimately be spared.",
