Does anyone know how to find that post -- or have a link to such information? Thanks! Log in to post a reply",

It was very comfy and handy in the post-surgery days. I \"wore\" it around the house and even slept with it. If you have any kind of soft over-the-shoulder handbag or beach bag, you could achieve the same effect by stuffing a little pillow (or something else that's fairly cushy) in it -- and if you wanted to go out, it would just look like a handbag! Or maybe use an old pillow case -- put a little pillow or a rolled up fleece throw in the bottom, cut away part of the sides leaving two vertical pieces of fabric that you could knot together to make a shoulder strap. You could adjust the strap to get the pillow in the right position. Good luck to you.",

I am right-handed, and used my right hand/arm for washing/brushing despite the fact that my surgery was on the right side. I was able to shower 24 hours after the surgery. My husband was told by the surgeon following surgery that the node appeared clear. This preliminary observation was confirmed to me the next morning by the doctor, and was officially confirmed about a week later. I returned home less than 24 hours after the surgery, went for a walk, and cooked dinner for my family. It's a scary surgery, but you'll be fine! Take care.",

Both plastic surgeons with whom I consulted said that the likelihood of a good outcome (avoiding infection; achieving symmetry) is increased by waiting to place the expanders in a separate, later surgery. Both stated that the tissue expander placement could be done at eight weeks after mastectomy or any time after that for equally good results. In other words, they did not believe that there was any need to rush into expander placement at the eight-week mark. Unfortunately, I think it's unlikely that you will be able to complete the reconstruction process during this calendar year. Although surgeons' approaches to expander fills vary (in terms of how much solution they use at each fill, and how often they do the fills) it seems to take about 4 months (at least) to get through the expander placement, fills, and exchange. There is generally a wait period of a few weeks after tissue expander placement and the first fill; and a wait period of several weeks between the last fill and the exchange surgery in which the expanders are removed and replaced with implants. Good luck!",

In my case the injection was a radioactive compound that was used to identify the location of the sentinel node(s). They first injected numbing medicine in four locations around the nipple. For me there was just a really brief sting with each injection, and no real pain at all. They had me lying on my back, which was more comfortable than the biopsies and MRI where I was on my front. They had me massage my breast to get the compound moving, and it showed up quite quickly (within minutes) on their monitor. The nuclear medicine tech was able to locate nodes, and marked them for the surgeon. Had the surgeon not been able to locate the sentinel node(s) during the surgery using the geiger counter, they would have injected blue dye at that time to assist. However, in my case the blue dye was not needed as the radioactive compound did the trick.Because of hospital scheduling, I had to wait a few hours after the first procedure before being taken back to be prepped for surgery. I found the wait rather difficult emotionally, just because of the anticipation. I don't think I could have focused on a book, though I love to read. I was happy to find some magazines to page through to help pass the time, and having my cell phone on hand to do a little texting (with my daughter) was also a good distraction. Good luck to you.",

All Nordstrom stores (at least all in our area) have highly trained specialists for post-surgical fittings. They handle the prostheses as well as the Amoena camis. They work with insurance companies, too. I haven't purchased a prosthesis yet (waiting for a little more healing) but a friend who had bc three years ago found the local specialty store old and depressing. She left there and went to Nordstrom, which was great. You can call ahead to be sure the specialist will be there.",
