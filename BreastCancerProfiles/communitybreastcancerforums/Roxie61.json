I was dx with breast ca in 1996. Have been cancer free for 16 and a half years. A month ago I found a lump not far from my other cancer I had. Mamo and ultrasound on Friday biopsy Tuesday. 6days later and I am waiting for results.Only I was told a solid mass like this is usually cancer so here I am visiting my daughter and waiting for results. I don't know how I will get through this again. I have a very loving and caring husband and family.I hope you have a supportive family also.",
