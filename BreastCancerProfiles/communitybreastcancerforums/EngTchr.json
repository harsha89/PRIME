Welcome, just-mary, wow there are getting to be a lot of us in June!  I'll bet those times are wrong.  I had three drugs today-Herceptin-1 1\\2 hours, taxotere-1 hour, and carboplatin--1 hour.    Maybe when you asked him about injections he thought you were talking about Newlasta or something like that? TomnDi--I'll be thinking of you, your wife and family tomorrow.  I think everyone's reactions are different and it is difficult not knowing what to expect from day to day.  Maybe after this first one is over you'll have a better idea what to plan for for the subsequent treatments.  Everyone hang in there!
