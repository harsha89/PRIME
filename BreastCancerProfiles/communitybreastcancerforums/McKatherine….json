I gently rubbed the skin on and off for a few days to de-sensitize it (after spending a very interesting day trying to not let it be touched at all!) and that really helped. Hope you are all doing better! ",

As long as I know it's possible, I'll have something to aim for (hey - worked with me for hypnobirthing, I can make it work for rads, too, right?). ;) DiZZy -yes drains came out on Monday. I get my first fill this coming Monday, and I think my PS wants to get me expanded ASAP for rads. I kinda wish we could drag our feet just a little so we could wait until after school starts to begin. I hate to think of spending my last two weeks of summer starting rads - but I know timing is important. Hoping the fills won't be too bad since I don't plan to upgrade - but I know they want to over expand my L side to compensate for the shrinkage that rads will cause. :/",

Only 12 more to go (and only 9 more to the sclav lymph nodes)! :)",
