      "Content": "Nov1 wrote: Hi all, I hope everyone had a fair thanksgiving day. I am 37 years old. I have three beautiful daughters, 5, 4 and 2. Three weeks ago, on my daughter's 4th birthday by the end of the day i discovered a lump on my right breast. I freaked out since i am a nursing student and during that week, all of our assignments were related with breast cancer....... I made appointment on the following day and got checked by my PCP. My doctor was not alarmed like me but ordered mammogram and ultrasound. On the mammogram, it showed a dense tissue so for that reason ultrasound was done. The radiologist said it worth it to do biopsy. Then on Nov 13th, biopsy confirmed i have DCIS, Right breast, 10 o'clock, core biopsies: Ductal carcinoma in situ with the following features: Architectural pattern: Solid (cancerization of lobules). Nuclear grade: Intermediate. Necrosis: Absent. Associated calcification: Absent. Invasive carcinoma: Not identified. Additional findings: DCIS appears to involve portion of a fibroadenoma. It also said 100% Estrogen positive and 40% progestron positive. I haven't sleep the last three weeks. From the time i found the lump to this day i have been emotionally drained. I have been doing lots of praying. Friday i was advised to do the gene test since i got the cancer at a \"young\" age. I have no family history of any kind of cancer. I got the genetic counseling and gave blood for the test. I was told it could take 2-3 weeks to get the result. Last Wednesday, i had MRI and anxiously waiting for the result. I joined this support group and have been reading the postings and sounds like MRI could find more cancer, which is scaring me more...... I have appointment to meet with my surgeon to talk about treatment option and was told by then the MRI result will be ready. I am scared to death, no appetite, no interest for anything. I feel like my life turned upside down. I am feeling hopeless and please i need your help in reassuring me and saying \"its going to be OK\" . I work with patients wit dementia and i am a good listener. I have given my shoulder to many families to cry and lean on me. I have been supporting the patients and families even during a though time. I have never felt helpless like how i am feeling right now. My family is very supportive during each and every step of this new journey. But i feel like i wanted to hear from a person who is in my journey. Please pray for me things will go well. I will keep you post. Log in to post a reply",

I had very stressful weeks and the day i found out about final pathology, i felt better and slept long hour. My life has changed since this diagnosis. However, i came to conclusion that God has done a favour to me. He made me closer and now i see life differently. I appricate everyday and what i have. It made me humble. I am breast cancer survivor and i have to stay strong and together, beat cancer. I am greatful for having sisters like all of u ladies. Women like u made me feel better. Happy holidays!",
