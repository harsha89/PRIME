Anyway, I like you never did shave my head during Chemo since I still had enough hair left to show as side burns and the back of my head under a baseball cap. There might be something to what he said. Mine is growing but ever so slowly and I am at 10 weeks PFC. Have faith and it will start growing like crazy. Has anyone tried Nioxin or the primrose oil like Sweetcorn asked about?",
