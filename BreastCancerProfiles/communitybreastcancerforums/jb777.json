I went 12/2 for my annual mammogram and ultrasound (my gyn's standard referral). Was called back in while still there for additional magnified views.

(No lump.)  Went for a stereotactic biopsy on 12/16.  After two heroic attempts the radiologist told me (on the spot) he was unable to get the tissue he needed. I would need to come back for another try on a different machine (not available that day). Went back on 12/30. Success!  Got the call (benign!!) on 1/2. I go back in 6 months.  The waiting is torture, but know that you are moving toward answers. Breathe. And stay busy. Fingers crossed. ",

I was very nervous, particularly when the tech showed me the microcalcs in the picture of the tissue they took for the biopsy. They  looked \"linear\" and\" branching\" to me, so I was certain I knew what the results would be.  (I guess I will stick with my day job.) Bottom line, only the pathologist can determine if it is cancer, and the results are much more often benign. ",

      "Content": "jb777 wrote: Let me start at the beginning. I had a routine mammogram in November which showed microcalcifications in my left breast. First attempt at a stereotactic biopsy was unsuccessful; second attempt two weeks later, and it worked. Three days later (January 2) I had my results: benign. Yay. Come back in six months? Fine. Then in mid-February I think I feel something. Not a lump. Maybe an area of thickness or denseness behind the breast tissue. Not hard, but definitely firmer that the rest of the boob. I never ever did self-exams before the microcalcs, so I am new at this. LOML says he doesn\u2019t feel anything. OK, good. Never mind then. Early March, just after my period ends I notice that lefty is looking bigger than her sister. Huh. I give myself a feel and am not sure whether I can still feel the thickness, but my left boob feels pms-y \u2013 sort of full and very tender in some areas -- while the right one does not. LOML agrees that one is bigger than the other, but tells me that many women have one breast larger than the other. Yes, honey. I know that. But did you ever notice that one of mine is bigger? Uh, no. OK, thanks. Two weeks later (one week ago), lefty is still bigger and still tender (I have stopped feeling around for the thickness) so I call my gynecologist and ask to come in so she can have a feel. She told me to wait until after my next period, so I am going in a week from today. I can almost convince myself that it is an infection -- from the biopsies? Except that I have no signs of infection (no warmth, no redness) and none of this started until almost two months later. I am 50; have never been pregnant; have no family history of breast cancer (just my maternal grandmother, post-menopause). According to my gyn (and if my mother and older sister are any indication), I am still many years away from menopause. I am not panicking, but am definitely thinking about it a lot. I welcome any suggestions of benign conditions this might be. Log in to post a reply",

Waited two weeks for a stereotactic biopsy after microcalcs were seen in routine mammogram. They were unable to get to the needed tissue due to its location.  (Directly behind the nipple close to the chest wall.). They also said I had \"thin breasts\". (That was a first for me. Thin as opposed to fat?  Thick? I never got to the bottom of that!). I went back two weeks later (waiting was torture but I was glad for the time to heal) for another attempt at the stereotactic biopsy, this time in a seated machine rather than the face down on a table machine. And it worked. They got the tissue they needed and I got the good news three days later (January 2). I had a very large and ugly bruise - not at all painful - which is only now really starting to fade.  I go back in six months for another mammogram. (So why am I still here?  I was so comforted reading about good outcomes on these boards while I was waiting. It helps to see stories similar to yours with happy endings.)  You can do this. It is really scary, but it is how you get the information you need.  Breathe. And stay busy. The odds are strongly in your favor for a benign result. ",
