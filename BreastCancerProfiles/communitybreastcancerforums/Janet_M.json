Still, I didn't like the way I looked (grandpa) so I dyed it, and everybody had a comment about that. Since it's so short and dark I wear a hat (Ken Doll) whenever I'm out in public. And - guess what - everybody wants to talk about the hat. I just went back to work, and I'm told to 'take the hat off' several times a day. But- 3\" is a lot of hair! I'm not encouraging you to go full Bozo, but I bet a stylist could work it into something lovely. I saw your avatar - you're  pretty - and I bet you'd look fabulous with short hair. I long to return to normal. I literally dream about putting my hair up. But 'normal' is a work in progress, so in the meantime you have to do what makes you feel comfortable, and work with what you've got. Of course (in my case) that may include the occasional crying fit, but thats' part of 'normal too'.",

My hair started growing in last March and now it is about 1\" long, and like Ossa, growing straight up like Don King. Or more like a baby ostrich since it is still very fine and whsipy I used to be one of those girls with thick beautiful hair, and kept it in long bob forever because I'm a huge chicken. My hair was really my best accessory and I always felt comfortable dressing super casually because my hair made me feel feminine. It was fabulous. When I announced that I'd be shaving my head my friends said that it would be 'free' and 'liberating' and 'fun'. Well it was some days,  and other days I just felt bald. BUT, I'm finally staring to enjoy having really short hair. I really love the the wash 'n go aspect of it, and I like having my neck completely exposed, and I LOVE the feeling of the wind on my tiny ostrich hairs.  I've also started to dress differently, and have gone from very subtle accessories (or none) to earrings that are bolder, and blouses rather than t-shirts.  And cus I have a giant forehead, and no bangs at all, I've started experimenting with hair bands and bandannas.  All during my chemo, in an effort to look the same,  I wore a wig that was much like my old hair. And now I'm that I'm not trying to look the same anymore (after 40 years) I'm starting to have fun. I never thought I'd get to this point, cus my goal was to 'get back to normal' but since I'm not so anxious to 'get back' to anything anymore, and I'll probably keep it short. (But not quite this short since I still look like a sportcaster) Anyway, for anyone who is getting discouraged, or impatient, or are big chickens like me, it does get better and can be fun. My eyelashes have all came back, and longer than before, and yesterday I was looking at them sometimes in my rearview mirror, and feel a genuine quiver of excitement. The other drivers must have thought I was crazy, sitting alone in my car, grinning from ear to ear, and no hair to hide behind. I'm so so so so so  grateful for these little things that I took for granted. Best wishes everybody, Janet ",

However, I ran into a guy who worked at my hair salon, and when I showed him what was under my hat he said I was in need of bangs and a bit of colour. I tried to stay gray - but I couldn't, and had my hair 'organically' dyed last week. The reviews are mixed. Some of my friends love the short brunette, but some preferred the gray. My partner ( who I trust implicitly as my 'stylist') was dissapointed. He found the gray more authentic, and he like the hint of vulnerability.  Deepdown I'm very grateful to be heatlhy and to have hair (etc etc etc) but closer to the surface, I REALLY misss feeling carefree about my appearence.  ",

It didn't get longer - just fuller. I've got about an inch of hair now and  I took some photos of the back of my head, and was suprised to see that it looked thick and kind of normal. Kind of like a deliberate short haircut. However, from the front, not to pretty. Looks like I'm wearing a short wig that is slipping backwards.  Still wearing hats for the time being Janet ",

When was wearing my wig this winter, I went out to try on some prescription glasses. I didn't really need them , but I was so worried about having no brows and lashes, and I wanted a cammoflage. Anyway, I was trying on glasses and the salesgirl said that it was really important how they fit around my ear. Before I knew it, she had her little hands all around my head and was digging around. I swatted her hands and said 'Don't touch my hair!'. I think she thought I was crazy. (I probably was).  I'm glad the wig is gone too. My new hamster-hair is much more managealbe. ",

Before my diagnosis I was a salmon and blueberries kind of gal, but during chemo I couldn't get enough bland carbohydrates, specifically lemon pound cake with icing.  The best thing for me was the people. Chemo was not as bad as I expected, and certainly not as bad as the mental stress of test results, surgeries, and radiation. I was a complete mess before my first chemo session, and when I came home I stayed around the house, waiting for the side effects to kick in. My cell phone was charged, I had a fridge full of frozen food, and I kept my anti-nauseants close by. However, my worst physical side effects were light sensitivity when I was outside, and a bit of dizziness and leg pain. I never felt ill, and was able to keep up a pretty good activity level. I went to yoga (gentle) and spent a lot of time with my dog (basset hound). My chemo sessions became so popular with my friends that I often had two people with me at once. The nurses were amazing. Thoughtful, funny, compassionate, lively, and I was constantly surprised at the amount of laughter in the room. I'm needle-phobic and the nurses went out of their way to distract me when administering the IV, making sure my arm was always covered with a warm blanket (they always offered one to my partner, too) Another side effect came from the steroids. Those two days of the treatment were brutal because I turned into a complete lunatic. I lost my internal censor and was extremely impatient. After throwing a box of cereal at Jim's head, we decided it was best for his safety if there were no social or household demands made on me at that time. I also steered clear of the dog park  as I was always just a breath away from saying things like 'shut up', or 'I don't care'.  As far as hair goes- I shaved it before it fell out - just before my second treatment. We used the electric razor, and buzzed it all off over a glass of champagne. My hands were shaking, but I was advised to take control, and it's one of the best things I did. Bald by my own hands! I could go on forever about baldness, but the one thing I loved was the feel of my scalp against a clean pillow. Of course there was a lot I didn't enjoy, but it really helped to have a good wig.  I've had the same hairstlye forever (brown bob) so I had my wig cut the same way. Firstly it was cut at the wig salon, and after I got used to wearing it for about a week, I took it to my own stylist, and asked him to make it mine. (It was a very good wig salon apparently, a lot of transexuals go there) I brought a friend with me for both my wig fittings by the way, and tried to make it as much fun as I could. Often it was - and often I'd break out in tears. But now that I'm looking back, bringing someone with me and going out for lunch makes it a good memory, rather than a bad one. I finished chemo in January, and radiation last week, and today I have about 1\" inches of hair that I just had coloured. It feels very weird and exposed to have such short hair, but a little bit thrilling as well. Ellebee, accept everything. Take every offer. If someone asks if there's something they can do, allow them to do it. If anyone volunteers to make you a meal, let them make it. If your husband wants to make the bed, let him. Now is the time when it's all about you and it is your job to take care of yourself. Eat what you need, nap when you can. (And Atavin is a godsend!)  Also - when I said I could go on about baldness forever, I'm serious.  I started a blog (hence the avatar) about living in wig-land and other stuff. And there's nothing scary in it, I promise. If you're interested, it's  balderdish.blogspot.ca/  I sincerely with you all the best, Janet ",

During my chemo IV (taxol) I had my hands and feet in ice packs, which were provided by the hospital. After treatment stopped there was discolouration to the nails on my hands, but they've since recovered. I put polish on my toes, but it actually came off in one piece (big toes only) and took some of the  toenenail with it. My nails were weak, and maybe I was using crappy polish. I don't know. But I found that for matter like this, my best resource were the chemo nurses (and these boards ). The nurses were amazing, and had tips on just about everything.  I'm not sure if you've started yet - but it's a lot easier, and much less scarey, once it's underway.   ..thinking about you, Janet ",
