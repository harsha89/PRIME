Doctor said i have no papilloma and everything are fine. i asked why i had blood discharge. doctor said it might be scar tissue on duct....  doctor sounded like she believed i had papilloma .. i wont be able to breast feed. i know i have left breast but i could have saved and not have surgery.. im so lost. i dont even know what to say or think Log in to post a reply",
