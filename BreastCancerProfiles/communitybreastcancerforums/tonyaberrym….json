On the upside, the small surrounding towns are having a benefit for me next Saturday and all of my kids and grand babies are coming up, so I'm definitely looking forward to that. I'm just fixated on counting down the days until chemo is completely over and I can go back to my normal life, I'm truly blessed, but just having a hard time of dealing. Thank you for the prayers, as you willl be placed on my prayer list . Tonya",

Not having a good day today, haven't left the house much less get off couch, chemo Monday is right around the corner and I'm dreading it something awful. I've cried a lot today and won't even allow my boyfriend to come over and pick me up and take me to his house, bones and joints are bothersome today......I still have such a long journey, when will this feeling of hopelessness leave me? Why can't I be thankful I'm not terminal and this too shall pass? Praying constantly",
