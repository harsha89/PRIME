It's a 20 minute drive from home to hospital and we're all ending up at the same location. And it would be out of their way on their 45 minute drive. So geeeeez already!

Enjoy this weekend and try not to fret too much, I found none of my fretting affected any outcomes as far as I can tell anyway. Not that it stops me. One thing I wanted to share for those doing last minute shopping this weekend. It may be helpful to pick up some tape, gauze pads, and large waterproof bandaids for when your drains come out. I was told I need to keep the sites covered for two weeks and change them everyday. I have been meaning to hit the drugstore for three days and still have not managed to. It is such an effort to leave the house now: shower, makeup, struggle into clothes that fit, wig, then fiddle with foam boobs that refuse to lay naturally or symmetrically. It is a two hour process that is exhausting. I did all that to go to the dr today then totally forgot to stop at cvs on the way home. What a waste! I wish I had thought of it beforehand when I was nesting. Meanwhile I am playing medicine cabinet mcGuyver. Congrats on the bits of good news Grammab. On the topic of nipples. I wish I had mine and wish I had the option. But as someone else mentioned maybe lucky I didn't have the choice so I didn't end up guessing and second guessing decisions.

I'm still having a terrible time with my node arm. Constant burning, raw, feeling. Heaviness, needle like pains, pulling feeling down into my forearm when extending it. But it is better than it was. I seem to have some feeling back in it. Wishing good thoughts for those with surgery this week and easy healing for those in recovery rooms today. One caution I had forgotten about is Chapstick. It was one thing I had read over and over to take. I used it frequently. I was on oxygen into the next day after the surgery. I just happened to be putting on some Chapstick the next morning when one of the nurses was in the room. She told me not to in an almost panicked tone. She said with the oxygen it could give me burns on my lips due to the petroleum in it. Good to know 24 hours into the game. Ha! The hospital did provide some gunk in a tube that I was supposed to be using instead. Oops. Goodnight ladies",

A 70 degree August day in Texas is something not to miss enjoying. I think I overdid it a bit yesterday. I had a one hour each way ride to and from the doctor then decided since I had real clothes, fiber fill boobs and a wig on already that I should drop in and visit my team at the office for a while. I didn't really exert myself much but I think just moving around so much irritated my arms too much. When I got home I discovered one of my drains was leaking from the exit part which was scary. It stopped but I am going to have the nurse look at it when he comes by tonight. My entire chest and left arm are numb and it is a very uncomfortable weird feeling to touch it. My only pain so far has been under my left arm. It burns as if my bra is digging in it but when I look, it isn't. So it must be something internal. I have not taken any pain meds today and have not has an increase in pain so far. So that is nice. Not nice is that my Coumadin levels were not high enough at the dr yesterday so I have to keep giving myself these injections every day for at least another week. Ugh! I find that worse than the chemo infusions! Gamma you are right about the Buddha belly. I thought I was so swollen after surgery which I was a little but then realized that it is mostly the fact that I have no boobs to hide my fat belly under. So when I look down its just THERE. It is not helping me escape the uncle fester look that I took on during chemo. Good luck to everyone with surgeries next week. Honeybair, try not to over think it too much. I was so very fearful and anxious before and like unplugged said, so relieved to find that it has not been nearly as bad as I expected. I am still having a hard time emotionally with having no breasts but I am ok when I don't dwell on it and just keep looking forward to what is next. I just have to get through rads and then can prepare for recon. Every step I have been fearful of along the way has turned out to not be that bad. Chemo was pretty easy on me. Surgery, check. Just have to keep going. I still have to get my pathology back and figure out what my scary CT report really means. (Worried about mets becuse spot on my lung shrank during chemo, but everyone keeps brushing it off). So try not to worry too much because I have found that nine if the obsessive worrying I have done has made anything any better it easier. Just getting through each step has. And all the wonderful ladies on this forum and everyone sharing information has been the best and most meaningful help I could hope for. So grateful for that. :-)",

Grandma is snoozing on the couch, but even the morphine I got earlier didn't make me the least bit drowsy. So I still have not seen my surgeon and I guess I should have prepped the entourage with questions for when they saw her.. I knew I was having axillary dissection but no one will tell me how many nodes they took. I had modified radical on the left and simple on the right. When I am laying still I have zero pain on the left but the right hurts like heck all the time. I'm starting to wonder if she took the nodes on the wrong side. Neither the morphine or tylenol3 is touching the right. Oh, she also decided to reposition my port while I was under since I have had so much trouble with it, that is probably causing some of the issues on the right. I hope that is not a sign that she thinks I will need more chemo. My blood oxygen is low and I have not been able to get it up all day with either breathing exercises or oxygen. Other than that I'm ok for now. Besides being used as a pin cushion while they tried to get an IV this morning. It was So terrible. I cried like a baby. I have never experienced pain like that through this whole ordeal. I seriously think the first nurse should look into retiring, soon. And from then on I was so tense and sensitive that it was no use. They ended up using her messed up (third try) one to put me under, after sticking me four more times. I then woke up with another stick in my neck, an IV placement in my ankle, and receiving meds in my port. Ok, done whining. I have not had the nerve to take a peek under my big bandage ( looks like a tube top) yet. So for now not too emotional. Sorry for rambling guys, wired and loopy is not a good combination!

On the downside I apparently twisted the wrong way when I was changing last night and my bathroom looked like a set from a horror movie. Blood everywhere gushed from the right drain spot. Oops! It has been fine so far today though. I also got my path report, not so good news. While I had clear margins because the tumor shrank so much, there was 8mm left of live cells. Which means more chemo for this girl in addition to the planned rads. So sad. My hair is just starting to come in good. I also had 3/30 positive nodes. 2 micro,1 macro. While chemo was not THAT bad, now that I've had a few weeks off and feeling better, I realize how bad I did feel during. I so didn't want to go through that again. I want to be done with all this. Such is life I guess. Good luck kristy and dmarie on your upcoming surgeries. Hoping for you and I'm sure it won't be as bad as all the terrible worries you are having.",

The scary part is that it grew 1 mm in the week between ultrasound and surgery. I know that's tiny growth but still this cancer is a fast and nasty fighter. Back before chemo it grew 5mm in less than a week between ultrasound and ct scan and 2 more cm in the next two weeks between ct and my first chemo tx. Unbelievable. But it made sense to me then how the lump has just appeared as if overnight. Anyhow. I don't know what the timing will be with chemo and rads but suspect they will make me so rads first since the RO has stressed how quickly I need to start after surgery repeatedly. So I should really have a goo showing of hair by the end if that 7 weeks. Very depressing indeed. I stopped taking my biotin today. Don't see any point to it now. Although it is doing great things for my nails that had some damage from the taxol. Jeannine how many treatments did you have? Looks like we were on the same cocktails. So glad your mammo and ultrasound are clear. Very positive!

What is very confusing is that none of the drs can say if this is mets to lung or a separate lung cancer. My BS feels like it is mets because of my age and bc history. But the pathology report says it does not completely match my bc pathology. Of course there are no estrogen receptors which makes the path dr lean towards lung cancer, but hello, my bc didn't either. These spots were always there from my original dx, but they started out as 2mm an 4mm last march. Now they are 6mm and 13mm. I don't know what the point to my rambling is... Other than I am dismayed that I still have no answers or treatment plan. I have to have a PET (which they have not done before, and I'm scared that the whole thing is going to light up) now and see a thoracic surgeon, so more waiting while I am ticking like a time bomb. Has anyone else had an experience like this? Also they keep asking me about shortness of breath and coughing, which I have not had. But it just occurred to me that maybe I should have mentioned the constant throat tickle I have had for the last month. I am constantly clearing my throat and it feels almost like a sore throat but not exactly. Could that be related?",

The way the surgeon talked beforehand it sounded like driving by for an oil change. Afterwards, I got to hear from everyone about how it was the most painful surgery. I had kind of figured it out on my own by that point. Lol. I was lucky that they were able to do it video assisted though, rather than an open surgery. He did have to make the incision larger than expected though because he had trouble getting to one of the nodules. So I have about a 10\" scar from the middle of my back to under my arm. They had to retract my ribs and I learned from dr google that there are some very important nerves that run under each rib. He took a wedge from my lower lobe and one from the lingula (sp?).  The report said \"tumor not pathologically identical to previous specimen\" thus lengthening the primary vs mets debate. I am going to ask the MO to explain that to me the next time I see her. I'm one that always remembers a question on the drive home from an appt. I know I need to write things down. MO wants to wait another month to do another scan before starting chemo again. Hoping more than I've ever hoped for anything that it can remain as simple as just cutting those suckers out of me and never seeing them again. I now know that I was metastatic from diagnosis. The nodules were always there but were smaller and grew slightly with each scan I had over the year. They always told me they were nothing. \"Lots of people have nodules that are nothing\". From my non scientific calculations, none of the chemo drugs shrank them but held them steady and they would grow during the one and two month periods while off treatment.  I did Neo adjuvent AC/T and Halaven as an adjuvent clinical trial because I did not have a complete pathological response by surgery time.  If/when I start chemo again it will likely be gemzar/carbo first. How did you fair on that combo? Forgive me, still learning about all this lung business, you mentioned pleural effusion. Are those tiny tumors actually attached to your lung? Or they are in the fluid?  Are there many or can they tell?  I hope the dr is right and your lymph node is just being finicky. I had one node near my pancreas show on my last CT but didn't light up on the PET.  I hope you get some answers soon. ",

It was so painful!! The first time I felt the puncture when the needle went in. Uncomfortable but no biggy. Second time the dr was so good I thought he was still numbing me when he inserted the cath. Hair a tiny bit of chest pain from the suction on the second bottle. Today: dr was tapping on my back as he put in lidocaine. That itself hurt like crazy. When he inserted cath, it was like I could feel him stabbing me repeatedly deep inside. I am sure that he wasn't but it felt that way. He mentioned scar tissue and nerve damage. I buy that. Could feel the pressure from the bottle the whole time. Even up into my abdomen. I sort of liked that though because I always feel so swollen there and don't think it ever drains enough. I Told him about this pain and he said it was up to me if I wanted to stop. I'm not the expert! How should I know iifwe need to stop? Anyway i kept on because I wanted as much out as possible. Suddenly out of no where I got all these sharp stabbing pains in my abdomen area again. It was crazy, like I started uncontrollably saying ow ow ow ow and gripping the pillow. He finally stopped it and took out the needle. Oddly enough, I have never had the relief so immediately after. The uppe back pain was gone as soon as the draining started. Abdomen/front of lung is still quite sore feeling though and painful to touch. Only had a couple of coughs as so posed to before. Then I went and had chemo. Lol Ok rant over. It was jut such a bad/weird experience. Has anyone else had anything like that happen? The nurse had said I had fibrous something in there. He said that can make it more difficult. But it drained freely for about a liter. Hoping the chemo will help it this time. Wishing beyond a pleasant night.",

I had to do a PET (finally) to determine if there were any other spots and since there weren't they allowed me to have a lung resection (2 in the same lung). Only then were they able to text the receptor status. And even then, it wasn't completely identical to my original tumor. I still don't know what it all means.

When I was on them during WBR, I was on a huge dose (32 mg a day) for over a month and half due to the amount of swelling I had initially and also due to the pharmacy messing up my rx, At that time, I had near total muscle waste, serious facial swelling, near zero sleep, adrenal gland issues, actual Decadron psychosis, depression, hallucinations, headaches, the whole gamut. It was the most horrible experience of my life and seemed like it would never end. And the dose was so high that it took forever to wean off, and I also went through all of the withdrawal symptoms. Decadron is a very dangerous drug. but a necessary one for us. Medicaid is the one jacking with my surgery. Metlife is my STD insurance. They denied my claim saying i have a pre existing condition. Even though the only reason I cant work was because of the brain mets, which I never had before. My job is 30 miles away and the dr still has not cleared me to drive. I worked the entire time through my \"pre existing\" cancer treatment. Got my approval letter from medicaid yesterday. It was dated 1/5/15 approving five fractures between 12/15 and 12/31. Genius, also a waste of the paper it was printed on. Now another week has passed and they still have not granted the extension. I just don't get it. and it seems there is no one to talk to. Dr office isn't helping me either. They just say that they have called about it. I wonder if there is a size limit of the tumors for Cyberknife? Mine tend to grow very fast when they are growing. and I can tell that they still are from my symptoms. I was supposed to have this procedure nearly a month ago now. What if they have grown too latge to zap now??",

I did it the first time around, including 3.5 hour taxol infusions, brrr! The best method I have found in my experience is to fill 2 gallon ziplock bags 1/3 of the way with ice. You have to press all the air out of the bags too. Then. With help, I place one on top of foot and one on bottom and use big rubber bands to secure them to my feet. I make sure they are covered from ball of feet to around my toes. You can keep socks on or not. Still gets cold with socks but is more comfortable. For my hands I just hold a refreezable block of ice that the chemo room has for our use. I should be more concerns with my fingernails too but my toes freak me out. Icing is also supposed to help prevent neuropathy. I did four rounds of taxol last year with no issues. Know what you mean about tires and unable to sleep. I started feeling pretty good last couple days but this morning I am having a lot of Chest and back pain. Took some hydrocodone. I had been completely off them for a couple of days after increasing fentanyl to 25. Do you get chest pain afterwards? This is like in he center of my chest. It seems to happen always the next day. Don't know about cyber knife. Need to call insurance today to inquire. RO is on vacation this week. Ideally I could do it next week during my chemo off week. All of my hair came out during brain rads this time. Then the ixempra kepr it gone. I've been wondering when this stubble will start coming out. I hope you have a nice week and good luck with number three. I am anxious to see tumor markers but dr said she won't compare them until the first tx of cycle 2. Take care!",

As it turns out, this was all being caused by the high dosage and did not resolve until I was off the meds. I was able I figure it out myself finally and eventually just made my own weaning schedule.

My Halaven experience was as a clinical trial, so I told the research lady about it very week. She said she had not heard that from anyone else on the trial. But she also said that I was having the least SEs of everyone. Another odd one that I has was that on the next night after infusion, at exactly 9:20pm (seriously, every time), I would have excruciating pain in my spine. It felt like it was going to explode or something. After the first time it happened, I learned to take a Codeine and lean back and be perfectly still. It would last exactly 20 minutes then be gone. Aside from that and the fatigue, it was smooth sailing. I also didn't lose my hair.  I'm not currently on any treatment. I had lung resections in March. My CT in May was clear, and now per MO, we wait. I have another scan next month. I have not been feeling well for the last couple of weeks, so that makes me worry of course. But trying not to since it doesn't help anything.  Since you are liking cold things, what about smoothies?  It might be more appealing to be drinking instead of eating and you could get a fair amount of nutrients that way. Do you have enough energy for exercise? Maybe some light strength training to combat the muscle loss and maybe help the appetite. Sounds good in theory anyway. I was gung-ho with a workout schedule starting the week before AC/t then by my second treatment, all that was out the window and I have not been able to get back on board. Every time I start to feel better, I have another surgery or treatment. I know everyone says it helps, but I couldn't get motivated. I have a lot to lose and really need to get on it though. I hope you can find something enticing that helps motivate you to eat. ",

Like turning in the shower then stepping in with my underwear on, silly but true. Or doing things out of normal order, like putting shampoo in my hair first before shaving my legs, which I have done for a couple of decades.  One day I couldn't think of my work zip code for the life of me. But as far as work went, I was always able to focus and make quick decisions, write sensible emails and complete reports. It actually seemed like on the days that work would be impossibly busy, that I would perform best and forget about treatment and SEs. The fatigue was far worse on my brain than the chemo though, I am sure. And the irritability is a factor too. My team has learned not to bother me too much on treatment days, because I become very blunt with them. We have named it \"chemo rage\". Good luck to you with whatever you decide is best. If you can, try it out before making a decision one way or another. Many of my cycles resulted in different outcomes and taxol was a lot easier to function through than AC. ",

I have to see what my brain mri looks like in a month though before I can consider changing. Ixempra and xeloda are thought to maybe cross the blood brain barrier.  Hoping I can get gamma knife after a couple months. But I had to focus on my chest and lung first. So much going on at once!  Is anyone else taking ixempra?  I have not found hardly anyone who is. ",

One time it became four days, and the center decided to open on Saturday and Sunday to help everyone catch up on treatments. Good luck. I know it's frustrating!",

Is that true about AC not causing nail loss?  I would just as well do the icing anyway, just in case, because I am so scared of losing the tootsie nails.  Any experience with that, anyone?  BTW, I am still on my pain meds from the port placement, which my coworkers are saying make me random, talkative, and loopy.  :-)",

I got sent all over the center to be poked and prodded and ended up with a vascular ultra sound. The verdict was blood clots. Seriously? Another thing gone wrong. I was prescribed blood thinners and have to give myself shots for the next ten days until the pills kick in. The only parting wisdom I was given was if you have chest pain, go to the ER immediately, IMMEDIATELY. This was not comforting and I have not found any other info on my own yet. I will let you know if I do. Has anyone had their follow up mammo and sono yet?",

Towards the end I did have mild neuropathy in my feet but I believe it would have been much worse ha I not been taking the l glutamine. If I forgot to take the mid day dose, I could tell by late afternoon. Also, I mixed the powder into Tang (random I know, but I had major cravings for it during AC) and it didn't taste a bit off. I would also make up little containers to keep at work, with one glass serving size of the tang mix and glutamine  together. It saved loads of time in the morning and kept me from missing doses. Good luck. I hope you get some relief. ",

I began having neuropathy in toes and left thigh ( which no one has heard of at my center) during my first taxol infusion. I began taking L glutamine and acetyl L carnatine the next day and I believe it is helping a lot. I still have constant numbness in the tip of my index finger and some occasional tingling toes but if I am late taking one if my glutamine doses, I can tell because my feet get tingly all over.
