Apparently the nausea usually comes on two to six hours after treatment. Nausea meds are like pain meds, they do a good job of PREVENTING if you pre-treat and anticipate the problem ahead of time, but not so good at quelling the problem once it has surfaced. Some say an apple a day helps keep nausea away. Be sure to tell your doc about this nausea, he can pre-treat you or give you further advice.",

I live an hour from my treatment center and I am already switching to a closer hospital (5 minutes away) for the chemo.

For the tongue do you have the Biotene mouthwash?  Rite Aid and CvS has it, and Walgreens has a purse size as well.  Try sugar-free powerade as it might not have as bad a taste.  YOU MUST drink or you are not going to be visited by the poop fairy for days.   ",

(Note that I am \"lucky\" enough to be at one of the top 15 cancer hospitals in the entire United States, i guess that means i'd be dead now if I were at one of the bottom 4500 hospitals?) Next my son tells the nurse practioner that since my calcium is low already, he thinks I should take more Vitamin D.   I only take 400mg right now.  The nurse says NO!  Don't give her Vitamin D!  She Should not be taking Vitamin D!  Instead she gives him the name of a multivitamin that I should be taking, and when he goes to buy it he sees that it contains, you guessed it, 400mg of Vitamin D.  So I took two of my regular vitamin D's today just to spite her.    Oh, and I tried my aunt's wig on, this morning. !  It fit perfectly and looked pretty darn good .  ON MY CAT!",

Now if I am so high on life right now, why have I not been here to support you all, you ask??? Well, complications are keeping me busy.   I am on some heart medications and my cardiologist won't let me stop all of them for surgery.  I must at least keep taking aspirin to keep my blood thin.  But the surgeon disagrees and dammit they are at a standstill.   So now I have to knock down doors at other hospitals and try to find a surgeon who will agree to my cardiologists demands.  At the same time I am about to start Herceptin which can be tough on the ol' ticker.  So, lots of research, lots of phone calls, and lots of trips to the motel front desk to chat with the manager because he is SUCH a hunk. Cutie Patootie.     I am trying to figure out which one of my scarves he likes the best and I am shaking my maraccas for him while I still got two to shake.  Kinda hard to flaunt my cleavage with this damn port still making life miserable but you can't blame a girl for trying!  Hoping for Grandma Mickey to have as great a result from the Taxol as Shara did, and hoping for everyone else going through this hell to soon see a big bright light at the end of your rainbows as well. ",

Are you on any cholesterol meds or BP meds? If so, it almost sounds like maybe your chemo drugs are interacting with something else in your system to intensify the pains. One thing you could do is to log onto a drug-interaction-checker like the one in the pharmacy section of drugstore.com. Create a list of all your meds to see if any shouldn't be taken together, and to see how many list joint pain as a side effect. It is probably some kind of double-whammy effect that is hitting you. I'm so sorry, it sounds just AWFUL. You might ask about vicodin to see if that would work better for you than percocet. Not everyone gets relief from the same medications. At any rate, your doctors and nurses should not just be scratching their heads, they should be trying to help you. YOU TELL THEM YOU'RE NOT LEAVING THE OFFICE UNTIL THEY DO SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR PAIN! They cannot make any guarantees about cancer treatment...but THEY CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT PAIN. This is the 21st century, any good doctor will tell you that ONE THING that they have made great strides in over the years is controlling pain! There is no way that you can go through another treatment like this, AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO. If your team cannot help you, tell them you're going to have to seek treatment elsewhere. Your husband, I'm sure , wants to help...he can try and find you a team that can help you through this with better pain control. Find a support group in your area that will guide him through the search, or search these boards for other members in your home state and ask their referrals. YOU WILL NOT have to give up this treatment, it is your best chance. As bad as it sounds, you may have to resort to weekly treatments at a lower dosage if that is offered to you. It has been found in many trials to be just as effective so ask your oncologist. Did they give you Ativan? If not, ask them why the hell NOT, and demand some. Several taxotere patients here on the board swear by it. And as for the brainiac who told you that usually they don't hear of pain like this on taxotere...tell her to google the words \"Taxotere\" and \"excrutiating\"...and then to get back to you in six months after she's read all the posts. Keep us updated and if anyone here knows a good oncology team up in the Arlington, Washington area, please send littlebird a private message.",

Don't be shy about asking every doctor and nurse who enters that room to wash their hands, in fact put a sign up right by your bed \"NO WASHY, NO TOUCHY!\" Have them wipe down that CT scanner with alcohol, too! You are not in any shape to pick up any more germs so don't try to be kind or shy with anyone who visits you. Tell your husband to demand this as well, since at times you might be too loopy to care.

Check with your dr. again, but I would imagine that Senna is not good if you are experiencing blood, doesn't it state this on the label? If it were me, I would try two stool softener afternoon and two early evening, plus keep up with the fiber. Both soluble (benefiber,metamucil) and insoluble fiber (shredded wheat n bran, raisin bran, brown rice, veggies.whole wheat toast with at least 3g of fiber per slice) are probably needed to keep things soft and moving. If you start to get constipated or go a couple of days without a movement, then I would hit it with a laxative. I'm not sure how wise it is to take the laxative if you're not sluggish, but I do understand that you don't want to risk getting too constipated. The stool softener is just salt, so perfectly safe, and POUNDS of good fiber won't hurt you as long as you don't get too gassy. This with plenty of liquids should suffice, I'd think, especially since you've recently had two whoppin' good cleanouts. I've also heard a little olive oil in water, an hour or so after your fiber doses, helps to keep things SLIDING out. You say that hell breaks loose 4 days after treatment, so one thing that you could try is to continue what you're currently doing, but ease up on the doses day 2 and day 3 in preparation for what's been hitting you on day 4. See if you can tweak a bit so that day 4 and day 5 are a little easier on your system. It sounds to me like you've just gone a little overboard in the loosening-up, and need to reign it in just a bit but not enough to let a nasty clog take hold. I sure hope you can find the happy medium.",

My toast went down very well this morning, I am using the calcium enriched butter spread on it and it's delightful, I can almost taste the calcium in it...(or is that iron and steel and RUSTY NAILS that I am tasting?) Right now I'm trying to decide on an outfit to wear for my afternoon Taxol. It's at 3pm so I'm hoping they have a happy hour. Maybe I'll get a two for one deal on the Decadron and the Zofran. I've got a sleek little black cocktail number that one of the security guards always enjoys. I was thinking of wearing that with my new heels. But because of the color, if my hair starts to drop today it'll be very noticeable. Plus I don't know if I should wear these new heels if I can't even feel my feet. I'm leaning more towards a beige sundress instead, I'm thinking I could breeze into the joint with a parasol and really be NOTICED. Like a grand entrance. Aw, what the hell, I think I'll just go in this damn housecoat. Barefoot. Might not even take a shower beforehand since even the shower water, which I don't get in my mouth, somehow tastes like an old hammer these days. I'll check in with y'all tomorrow to let you know how things go....hopefully they don't send me to the wrong wing of the hospital where I end up getting a kidney transplant by mistake. Because I'd hate for the real kidney transplant patient to have to get my Taxol. I'm sure she's got enuff problems without having to worry about peeing flames from the depths of hell.",

Immodium should not constipate uunless you take more than the recommended dose or take it too often. It seems to me you really need to try a dose to slow things down and give your butt a rest. Blot instead of wipe, when sore, and use wetted UNSCENTED toilet paper from now on. Finally, you could try wetting the TP with distilled white vinegar then blotting (to prevent rash)...but this may sting at first. I like my hand-held shower spout because I can move it down and wash/rinse well when I just can't wipe anymore. If you do end up taking a dose or two of Immodium, just be sure that as soon as you feel better you start drinking lots of water...and that once you start eating regularly, take a stool softener (docusate sodium) every night until you're back to regular soft movements. Do you know if they PRE medicated you for nausea? If not, make sure they DO next time. Olive oil rubbed into the knees and elbows might help, otherwise I've heard to alternate a heating pad and an ice pack back and forth, 20 minutes at a time. Alternating the two seems to help with the pain. Also, be sure to check the \"HELP ME GET THROUGH TREATMENT\" topic for some more ideas. I hope you find something that works for you, otherwise the doc may have to move you to smaller doses more often. (Are you on the big-long-chemo-every-three-weeks routine?)",

You might start with that article. As for lymphoma, there should be the latest information at lymphomafoundation.org......Also, if you do a google search on \"Can Vitamin C block Cancer Drugs?\"....a few stories will come up about this topic. As far as vitamins in general...it gets confusing because you'll find lots of information about certain vitamins PREVENTING cancer, but this does not necessarily mean that this vitamin is good for you during cancer treatment because some large doses of vitamins can interfere with certain drugs . It's all pretty confusing so be sure and discuss with your onc as everyone's case is different. Also some people might benefit from Vitamin C, while certain forms of it such as abscorbic acid might be hard on the tummy during treatment. (ie might need to avoid juices with added citric acid ). There is lots of info on vitamins here on breastcancer.org as well, in the health section/ tips on treatments. P.S. For those of you developing mouth sores, if you can eat yogurt it always helps with most types of mouth sores...make sure it has \"active cultures\". Lastly I have a tip for anyone developing a rash....you may have already been told to use the \"free and clear\" detergents and no 'bounce' or perfumey-softeners....If you want to soften your laundry, use 1/2 cup of white distilled vinegar in the rinse water. It helps to soften the laundry and vinegar also protects against rashes. (no your clothes won't come out smelling like vinegar!)",

Hi Brenda, are you ready to conquer the world today? Good morning everyone, 6am and I'm just about to hit the sack, been up on a Decadron high all night. Cleaned the fridge, fixed a lampshade and waxed the floor. Called my ex at 3:30am and told him if I don't get the child support check soon, I'm gonna drop clumps of hair all over his front porch and pee a big brown circle on his front lawn. (Did you know that our pee can take out a flower garden in two minutes flat? Just another handy dandy chemo tip from Shara! Next week: how to use your bad breath to move quickly ahead in the supermarket line.) My 3rd TX went okay, I had to wait two whole hours while they got things straight but once they got everything cleared up it went more smoothly than the first two. My White Blood Cells went from 3.6 last week to 5.8 this week, so I guess the bloody marys for breakfast and the margaritas for lunch are doing their job. I think I'll start adding a bottle of Merlot at dinnertime and REALLY start to set their statistics on fire. You can expect to see it soon in the medical journals, \"women with well-stocked liquor cabinets have better prognosis per Mayo Clinic\". Hope everyone has a good Wednesday!",

Plus my hair is on schedule to go down the drain. My son says \"don't call it hair and you won't be so attached to it. Call it \"clairol-drenched dead nerve endings\". Looking at it that way he thinks I'll be happy to see it go. 3rd TX is tomorrow already and my daughter is going with me this time instead of my son. He is so nervous. I heard him in the other room, preparing my daughter for the day, quizzing her and sounding like a drill sergeant: \"Remember to stand on her right side at first, and before you let them touch her port, tell them what happened last time. Make sure there is forcefulness in your voice!\" \"Read the labels on the stuff they are giving her. They usually get the Decadron right but make sure they give her only TAXOL. They will tell you that you are wrong and they will look at their paperwork and show it to you. If it doesn't say TAXOL, tell them that it's wrong and stand your ground. You might have to put your hand over her port and threaten to call the police\". \"If that nurse who looks like Robin Williams comes around, don't make conversation because she'll never shut up, and she'll touch mom's face with her germy hands. She's trying to be nice but think of her as a germ-spreading dirt machine and avoid at all costs\". \"Ask for a printout of her blood draw and bring it home for me. Check at the top to make sure that mom's name is on the top, last time they tried to give me some DUDE's paperwork. A dude named George. I said to them, ' DOES SHE LOOK LIKE A GEORGE to you???\". Oh my kids, bless their hearts, they shouldn't have to be worrying about all this. Wish I could just send them away to a tropic island for a year and be healthy-mom again when they return. On the other hand, it's so comforting to know that they are all grown up, can take charge, and are learning the ropes as it will, I'm sure, come in handy for them through the years. We older girls tend to be so trusting of anyone in the medical field and we don't question things enough. I am learning right along with my children.",

I love all the girls who say they were \"expecting it to be worse\". What the hell were you expecting, a nuclear explosion? That's about the only thing I can think of that would be worse. I'm on day 3 so not feeling too freakin' funny today - sorry to disappoint. Day 4 usually is a bit worse but day 5 improves as food starts to taste more like tires and less like hubcaps. Day 6 is always fun as I get out and shop for a new TX outfit, usually making it home in time to hit the toilet .(Why is it that 5 days of stool softeners only seems to kick in when I'm out shopping???? I know where every damn public toilet in this whole city is located, and if your store doesn't have a decent throne, you've lost me as a customer. KOHLS, I love you, and thank you for the soft toilet paper...sorry I used so much of it) Anyway, Day 7 is Decadron-delightful and then TX day I am so popular as all the nurses greet me with a big smile and then wait for me to rip their damn heads off. I don't think the compazine agrees with me, it makes me feel anxious or something, I am going to try to get something else. I did indeed get a NICE gift in my Christmas stocking, but almost spent New Years in jail. More on this later! Hope you all have the best day yet this year, and please keep posting....sorry but my dry, callous fingers are spending less and less time on the keyboard and more and more time up my ass with a suppository.",

In other words, when you hop out of the hot bathtub, hit it with ice....then when the ice stops working, hit it with a hotpad. Alternate. As far as the percocet, you've got to try and stay ahead of the pain. Just prior to the 4 hour mark, take your next dose...don't wait for the pain to set in.",

Are you taking calcium and vitamin D? Apparently they are recommended to prevent osteoporosis and bone complications further down the road so ask your onc. As far as your 4 hour percocets....there is something called \"breakthrough pain\" which is more severe...it's the pain that breaks through your medication. This is why you need to \"stay ahead\" of the pain because it is easier than dealing with this breakthrough pain. Some people only want to take the pain meds as they feel the pain, but at times they can end up taking more medication in the long run because they are always chasing this breakthrough pain. Better to stay right on schedule with it because once the pain breaks through it is harder to quelch. (P.S. I'm not a pain brainiac...I'm just leafing through my books and guides! One that I like I got at the library, it's called 'Choices in Breast Cancer Treatment' by Kenneth Miller. I like it because it has chapters by several different oncologists).",

I have a heart issue to deal with at the same time so this is all very scary as Herceptin is very hard on the heart, apparently.  I'm sure the other two drugs are no picnic either.  I'm not quite sure yet about the details of the treatment, 6 months was mentioned....and this is pre-surgery.  I have not had breast surgery yet.   I have my port placed early next week and even that is scary since my heart can't deal with any clotting.  I have so much research to do my head is spinning and meanwhile my cardiologist and my oncologist are always duking it out about something.  I figure that's good....if they weren't talking to each other I'd be up a creek.  ",

The kids are going to be running around with virus after virus, unfortunately...they're just at that age. Take heed to the mask suggestion, wash hands religiously, and take your temperature two or three times a day. You may need hospitalization if your temp gets above 100.5 because your immune system has been dangerously weakened during treatment. It's very hard to get \"immune boosting\" advice from most docs, in my experience. Eat plenty of veggies and nuts and beans whenever you can. Are you on any vitamins or supplements? Make sure that they give you a printout of your bloodwork at every treatment so that you can see where you're declining...calcium, etc. And have them do a vitamin D check on you or order a home-test kit.",

What you eat during the two days before your treatment should be stool-softening foods and maybe colace twice per day (docusate sodium/generic). Very ripe fresh fruit is going to soften the stools better than just water, so whatever fruits normally \"agree with you\" should be front and center whenever you're feeling good, along with the water. \"Shredded Wheat w Bran\" is a good cereal to have on hand, I like it soft with hot water poured onto it. I've heard that a teaspoon of mineral oil or olive oil twice a day in your tea will help things 'slide' out, but check with your doc before taking mineral oil. Check out the \"Help me Get Through Treatment\" section for some tips from others, the thread is labeled Toot Toot. The main thing to remember is that CLEARING OUT this hard/constipated stuff is going to be much more difficult than trying to prevent it in the first place. Usually \"cement\" like this forms because there is not enough liquid in the system for it to absorb, so make sure you are drinking plenty especially in the days leading up to your treatments. However, if you are drinking to the point where you are urinating clear every 30 minutes, then you can ease up on the water because you're getting over-hydrated. At this point be sure to add the docusate sodium and some ripe fruit or prunes to work as softening agents.",
