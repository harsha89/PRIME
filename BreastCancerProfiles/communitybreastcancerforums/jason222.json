I was really devastated, and thanks to the ladies here and other boards, I was able to find out more about this disease and help me cope. However, it's still pretty tough for me and my family. I have been reading through the boards, and I really hate this disease for causing so much pain and suffering. I just want to get some input from everyone, it seems that a cure may be far away, I just want to ask, if there exist a very promising therapy, and no one is funding the therapy as it does not generate any revenue for the pharmaceutical company, and the beneficiary of this therapy are only cancer patients themselves, would anyone, do their best to help this therapy starts clinical trial no matter how small the chances is? Lets say the clinical trial of the therapy cost about 3 million dollars, do you think ordinary people like ourselves would come in and rally together to give this a try,  ? Since the trial do not need hundreds of millions of dollars, and the result can be obtained in a matter of months and not years, perhaps giving the people who needs this now one final opportunity, do you think it's worth pursuing?  There are so much to gain and so little to lose. Worst case scenario ,money could be lost, but if the therapy may have a small chance of working, is it worth risking 3 million dollars to be raised by people affected by cancer either directly or indirectly like everyone on the board here? It seems that there are quite a number of people going to other places and spending tons of money for alternative cures for one final hope, with no trials or data to backup, but they needed one final hope. Just wanted to ask your views on this, if a promising therapy exist that may be a possible cure, in the above scenario, shall it be pursued by people like ourselves when the pharmaceutical companies does not seem to be bothered as there is no money to be made. Looking forward to the views of anyone that is affected by cancer, on this scenario, and assuming there are proper pre-clinical studies and the preclinical result has been extraordinary, with proper data to backup .. and let's assume it has a 50/50 chance of working. Do share your views. And to summarize the above, basically just wanted to know, if you stumble upon such scenario, would most people take the risk and join in the effort, perhaps resulting in waste efforts, time and funds, or just shy away, thinking that this is another futile effort or snake oils and not worth the time. Thanks, hopefully this topic is not too weird or something. Log in to post a reply",

Billions has been raised over the years for breast cancer, and if this happens in the commercial world, the people involved in managing the funds would have been replaced as so much money is spent and the outcome has been disappointing. How can so much time and money be spent yielding such result? A cancer researcher friend of mine told me, as long as cancer still kills people, cancer foundation can continue to raise funds for the next 200 years. All this would stop if a cure were found..  But with no target or feasible direction in sight, it seems that more funds will continue to be raised that we are not sure would go into what kind of research.  That was why I assume if a scenario such as the above exist, where you know exactly what kind of therapy the funds you raised will go to, with transparency involved, detailing how much time is needed and the exact funds needed to find an answer, wouldn't it been better? With the current situation, funds raised, but without knowing what happens after that other than waiting indefinitely and hoping for a good news to appear tomorrow, would it be better if the fund raiser knows exactly what's going to happen and decide for themselves if it's worth funding? Just wanted to share my thought and see if it's even feasible for me to have such thought, as from what I see now is we raise the funds, do the run, and repeat the same thing year after year, with nothing concrete in sight. I sincerely hope that the standupforcancer foundation will be able to do more.",

I just got my career on the right track and wanted to share the news with my mum, and it was suppose to be the best time for my life, but it has now turned into the worst. There are so many things that I'd like to share with my mum, and the uncertainty is affecting me. A few days ago, we received the biopsy result, it's IDC. She has kept the lump to herself for 2 years, which is a long time, and the adds to my concern. From the ultrasound, the tumour size is about 4.2x2.7x1.6cm. She is scheduled to go for mast next week. From what I read in the forum, some of the ladies have gone to seek for 2nd opinion or even 3rd. We have not done so. We thought of just going for mast first. I am not sure if we should do that first before the mast? Or shall we do the mast, get the tumour out first , and later seek other opinion on the treatment plan? There are too many choices to be made, and i really need your help. What should I do? Where should I seek for the best treatment for my mum to maximise her chances? I really hope that my mum can win this battle. I am worried thinking of the coming days. Please help us make the right decision. Log in to post a reply",

But my mum is known to have sensitive skin as well. Checked with the breast surgeon, she says it takes time to heal, and there is nothing to worry about. And the oncologist felt that there may be a low grade infection going on, and prescribed some antibiotics. My mum has finish taking the antibiotics, no improvement yet. Anyone has similar experience? Is there anything we should concern about? Log in to post a reply",
