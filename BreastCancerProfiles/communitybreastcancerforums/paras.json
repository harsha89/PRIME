SICK IS HAVING TO HAVE BLOOD DRAWN EVER OTHER WEEK. SICK IS HAVING PAINS IN THE ARMS AND SE TO MEDS. THIS IS SICKNESS. WHY DO WOMAN HAVE TO FEEL LIKE SUPER BEINGS. WORK full time TAKE FULL CARE OF CHILDREN , PLUS MAKE DINNER AND CLEAN THE HOUSE AND IF THEY DON'T, THEY FEEL GUILTY. I BET THE MEN COME HOME AND SIT ON THE COUCH AND ASK FOR SPECIAL TREATMENTS.SORRY I AM NOT GOING TO BE VERY POPULAR BUT I TRUE LY CARE ABOUT ALL OF YOU AND DO WISH EVERYONE TO GET WELL AND BE CURED OF THIS SICKNESS. OK ,Whatever you want to call it a walk in the park. sorry for the caps my computer always slips to the caps. Why is the word sickness so offensive to you all a word by any other name would still make you throw up, it means afflicted with an illness or a disease. We are all under Dr.s care for this affiction and disease cancer is this . Why do you all have a need to lable it something other than it is. Does it make you feel more in control or stronger? somehow i do not understand this. When people try to take the load off you and treat you differently i take perceive this as a kind gesture. not a permanant disability but alittle help when your imune system is compromised through chemo and other treatment to cure this disease. woman are always more defensive when they feel that they are singled out as a sign of weakness .  I however never had that problem. Although i undersatnd the psychological implications.  alot of women who i admire decided to enter the working world while taking care of the children , the husbands and doing the housework, making the plans for baby sitters because ultimately they are responsible for the kids even though they also work full time comining home cleaning and making the dinner.too.oh not to mention birth control responsibilty. No wonder they feel threatened when someone calls them sick. now they feel equal to a man when in fact they are doing twice the work, and are also responsible for the other house hold chores, they did before they worked full time. no wonder they say they are not sick ,they are wonder women. hope i did not make enemies but this is how i see it. they are not liberated they are now doing twice the work . and taking on all the stress and the strengh is depleted.",

I am wondering what this stage 2 DIEP IS? that must be something different. anyway i wish you well i am not having rads i had a mastectomy and was told i do not need rads. but i will need the als i am leaning toward the femara it seems to have the best information about being tested and proved to be better than tamoxafin in some studies not much better but the chance of recurrance was alittle bit less for the femara. and the se were alittle bit better. since i am post menapausel i would qualify for als instead of tamoxfin. i will keep you informed if i hear any different. i called the american cancer society and they are reluctant to say which product is better.",

I had no node cancer in the sentinal node and the dr removed 3 . i have no evidence of lymphedema . i had this procedure 2 weeks ago .  I also had the right breast mastectomy with the normal axillary node dissection which the other dr removed 7 nodes this way and i have moderate lymphedema feels like a rubber band around my arm is is very heavy feeling ,and is annoying and tiring when you try to do any house hold duties. also you have a permanant numbness in the back side of the upper arm that has not gone away it has been since early aug.2008. i think the axillary node disection is both inferior and unnecessary to diagnose cancer in the lymph nodes i would never go to anhy dr who recommends this at this time 2008 when this sentinel node dissection is available and has been perfected. if you find a great dr to do the the sentinal node dissection it is well worth traveling i went to usf and the moffet hospital group to have the left breast done and i am happy i did. my dr was dr cox who is a great surgeon who did the left breast with this sentinel node dissection and mapping. i hope i can spare someone else this terrible uncomfortable feeling which is in fact nerve damage this is very common occurance in mastectomy without this sentinel node mapping procedcure. i am so glad you asked and that i could respond.",
