I had bmx, sentinel nods biopsy and axillary node dissection. I finished chemo in August and started rads this week. It honestly hasn't been that bad. I was expecting a lot worse with the chemo as far as side effects. You have to remain positive and accept help from others!! One thing I did learn is that I feel better when I am more active. I am married with two young children and managed to work a little bit through chemo and now radiation! Good luck to you and send me a message if you have any questions!",
