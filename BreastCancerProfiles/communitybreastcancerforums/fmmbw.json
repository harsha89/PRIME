Barely could eat, lower back pain chronic, all kind of tests, finally diagnosed with pancreatitis, then thrush. The thing is all the meds they gave me are pill form and I can barely swallow. I just gag. Chemo 4/30 just wiped me out, so have not had anything solid since then, just fluids. Any ideas? I'm so glad I can vent and get knowledge and strength from you all. Also chemical tongue and urine smell. Geez!. Marla ",

Had good cry with MO, So back to square 1, treat the severe diarrhea, stop worrying so much about eating, just stay hydrated and possibly not doing chemo in the future, or cut back on the dosage. Have to pick up prescription of super duper oral meds. One of my daughters drove in after her last final (3hours) and I was able to bake a ham, baked beans, potato salad and would love to eat it all, but it didn't effect me at all. Then my school did a conference call (I'm an elementary principal) and they all yelled how much they missed me and Happy Mother's Day! Tears.....",

Did tests, had a 2 day hospitalization had 2 EUS, so far results look good will confirm on Thursday, and hopefully start chemo My port has been used 3 times to give fluids, as veins had collasped, 2x were awful, 3rd time the nurse was pretty good with the insertion. I want to start this chemo (4x) over the anxiety, but that damn port worries the hell out of me. Help me!",

Will get the plan on 5/27 and thankfully many of the SE are lessening, but for 3 weeks out I'm still experiencing too many.
