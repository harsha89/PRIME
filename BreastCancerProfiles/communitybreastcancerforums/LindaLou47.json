At a friends suggestion I bought the Crazy Sexy Diet by Kris Carr (excuse her language).  She has some wonderful ideas to give your body that extra boost.  I am totally into the \"green\" juice!  Currenly I am not vegan, but I limit my sugar and eat (and drink) lots of veggies.  Kris has recipes on the internet.   Not sure if it fights cancer, but it sure helps the rest of your body!  Just wanted to let you know you are not alone.",
