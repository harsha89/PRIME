When 2 years passed without much feeling returning, surgeon said I would be very unlikely to ever regain feeling. The good news, I suppose, is that I have mostly gotten used to how it feels. Hopefully others will weigh in with other experiences - and good luck to you.",

Speaking of stress, I went back to work 2.5 weeks ago (after 2+ months off for surgery & recovery) and work has kind of slammed me - lots of travel & responsibility, and I feel rusty and not really \"on my game.\" Maybe this stress has also contributed to my hair woes? I'll contact my dr. Sherry, were there any home remedies that either helped stop your own hair breakage, or helped you camoflage the damage that had occurred?  I look really weird, and it's been very distracting this week, as I am working with clients and look like a 12-year old victim of a bad haircut. :(",

I thought \"heh, weird, I guess it's some new hair that's at that awkward growing out length.\" The bang-type strands were about 1.5\" long whereas the rest of the hair framing my face is 4-6\" long.  The next day, it seemed like there was more of it. I joked with my husband - what, did you take scissors to my head overnight? He laughed - of course not. Two days later, and it is extremely noticeable: I have bona fide 1.5\" bangs, and there have been no scissors anywhere near my head in the last 2 months! I can't for the life of me figure out what's happening. I can't trace it to any big diet or product changes, though my hair seems very dull and lifeless all of a sudden. I honestly have no idea what's going on, but in a google search tonight I came across the theory that surgery and anasthesia can affect hair's life cycle, about three months later.   Well here I am three months post mastectomy, so could that be it?? What is totally freaking me out is that my hair isn't falling out, it's clearly breaking off somehow, but I don't see evidence on my pillow or in my hairbrush. Any thoughts???
