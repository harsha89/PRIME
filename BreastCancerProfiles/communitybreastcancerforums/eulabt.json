I was diagnosed at 40 and am now 41. I am just 4 1/2 months from diagnosis. I had a BMX with Tissue Expanders. I am having my exchange surgery next week. I am stage 1, no chemo or radiation and on tamoxifen for 5 years. My children are 8,10 and 12. It has been hard on them, but they are doing well. I am strong as well, but have my moments.  As far as the surgery, I would get as organized as you can. Take anyone up on any offers of help. I had friends cooking dinner for me for a month and that really helped. My husband was home for 2 weeks, which was great as well. I was able to get back to doing most things to some degree at 2 weeks.  Good luck, Eula ",

I was small to begin with and I will say that I don't love my new boobs. I liked my old ones, but I was flat. The expanders were pure hell for me and my DH was ready to demand that they be taken out. I stayed small because I wanted to be me. I never wanted to look any different. My husband and I have a very good sex life, but I will say I really don't like him to touch the foobs, because they are fake and they remind me of what cancer took from me. I am so thankful to be alive today and happy to move on. My husband loves me for me. I do think it is sad to be happy that someone got better boobs out of having BC. I really respect not having reconstrction as my mother did not. My father was so in love with her until the day that he died. She was 59 when she was diagnosed and that was a large part of her not wanting reconstrction.   I guess what I am trying to say is that it isn't any better to have reconstruction verses not. We have all been through so much and if you are in a truly meaningful relationship, your partner will not care about your chest. ",
