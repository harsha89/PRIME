See if your dr will prescribe Norco or Vicodin (use generic) for you.  Norco worked wonders for me, and a dr will be less apprehensive to prescribe it to you vs Percocet, which is a more closely controlled drug. Your doctor will know what to give you, do not be shy to ask him/her for a pain killer that works. Norco worked for me.  I wish you well!",
