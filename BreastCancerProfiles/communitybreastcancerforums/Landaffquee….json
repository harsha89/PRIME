I was diagnosed last March (2013 ) with liver mets stage 4 ....no symptoms whatsoever beforehand...had a terrible pain episode which brought me to the hospital and cat scans showed the tumors in both lobes. After some time and discussion of tx options I chose to start Xeloda  since it seemed to be the least intrusive given my plans for the summer which were at that time to put my affairs in order etc  I began Xeloda a year ago this month and have been on it ever since. My tumor marker was over 1900 when I began and it is now 37 one year later. I am managing the side effects well...feet peeling, eyes watering and diahrrea being the main ones. My weight went down at first with the amount of diarrhea I was having so the dose was adjusted...twice really so that now it take 4 pills a day for two weeks and then one week off. Just this past week the marker went from 40 to just 37 and my oncologist remarked that it looks like it may be plateauing.....which means it has reached its max efficiency....and that means switching to another tx ..... So I will keep in touch and would love to hear from anyone with a similar experience. My first bout with BC was in 2007 when I had a mastectomy (PR ER + 2 sentinal nodes ) plus a nodal biopsy then chemo and radiation and arimadex till last year when mets occurred Am Canadian by birth .....moved to US in 1985....still have strong can ties eh?

Started Xeloda pills last May....my tumor marker was 2900! Very high! It is now 37 ! That is a 98 % reduction !  I am feeling fine....doing everything I did before diagnosis....gym several times a week, gardening, painting, traveling...my friends all tell me I look great! For those of you on Xeloda, we had to reduce the dosage due to diarrhea ( severe ) . I still experienced diarrhea but less so my Hospice md ( yes I have a hospice md, a wonderful support) suggested chia seeds which have taken care of the problem totally...I take a tbsp twice a day and I have normal stools. I have N0 fatigue and minimal hand foot syndrome, I do have dry eyes which affects my contacts so I have to treat that . I keep reading about all the various tx for liver cancer mets ....so I am sure you will find one for you. Keep us posted? Carol",

But yes living from scan to scan is tough! I have lost your email address, sorry to say. Lots of changes in my life...sold our Wakefield cottage to one of our four children. We will be going there ( Ottawa )on the 21st to help them open up for the season...means I will be in Ottawa for the first time since last September...maybe we could get together...or at least talk on the phone. I am feeling very well, doing everything I did before the liver mets diagnosis but of course concerned about the plateauing of the Xeloda My onco doc says not to worry which means keep making travel plans which I am doing. Happy Mother's Day! Carol",
