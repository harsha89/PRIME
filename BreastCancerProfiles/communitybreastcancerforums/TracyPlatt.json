I mean, really?! Do you think they're going to perk up any more or get prettier if you just stepped out?! This is just as good as it gets!!\" Thank god I started laughing (which I do when I'm nervous, anyway, but then he started laughing and decided it really was stupid to leave when I just had to take it off when he came back in! Back to the seriousness of this - he felt the lump and said that the doctor would come in and take a look at it and she did. She used the u/s and said she couldn't really see anything but she can feel it. She's sure it's nothing - just normal breast tissue - but if I WANT HER TO take it out, she will. Then she re-itterated that she was sure it will be sent back as normal breast tissue... I told her that I want it out. I don't want to seem like a hypochondriac but this is the breast that I've ALWAYS had a weird feeling about. It wasn't mammogrammed when the right one was for that biopsy... it's just been a bad feeling I've had and now I feel kind of worse because I feel like they think they're doing this for no reason. I have to believe in better safe now than sorry later, right? Does anybody agree or disagree with me? I'm going on a cruise on May 15th, come home the 21st, and have the excisional biopsy on the 24th. Hugs, Tracy Log in to post a reply",
