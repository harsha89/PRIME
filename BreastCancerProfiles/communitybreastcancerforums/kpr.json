I have been in close touch with my family and 3 close friends (they are all a distance away), and have told 2 friends who are nearby. So now I'm wondering how many other people I will tell - other parents at my sons' school? my employers at the very large school where I do occasional substitute teaching? people at our church? other mothers in our local mother and child group? I don't feel like carefully keeping this secret, but also don't want everyone to be thinking only about my cancer whenever they speak to me. (Or maybe I do want that?) I won't talk about it to anyone else until I've thought some more. Does anyone have any thoughts on this?Â  Log in to post a reply",

I have a few meetings before the surgery - bone scan, liver scan and anaesthetist. I went to work yesterday. I'm a substitute teacher so I'm under no obligation to work. I wondered how much time people usually take off work? Is it reasonable for me to decide I can't face going to work from now until after the surgery and then maybe till after the end of chemo and/or radiotherapy? Thank you Log in to post a reply",
