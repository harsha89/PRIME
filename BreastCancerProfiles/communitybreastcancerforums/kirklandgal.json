I find the START trial side effects article especially interesting since it is so recent and uses modern techniques. I hope they continue to report longer term side effect results on that patient population - 10 year and 20 year data using modern methods is needed. The 5 year breast and arm complication rates are unsettlingly high. I wish they had specifically separated out the RIBP numbers. Doe - Even though that article was written in 2004, the patients received their radiation between 1980 and 1993 so the technique is not the same as current day. However, the article definitely shows that radiation side effects increase with time! I find it scary that RIBP rates went from 3.9% at 5 years to over 50% at 20 years in that article even though it is old data. That suggests to me that when a 5 year incidence of a complication is reported, we still have no idea what the real risk is!",

I just finished it one week ago and am still burnt but I think it is just starting to turn a bit brownish. Hopefully another week or so and it will stop hurting! I really feel for everyone who has this horrible side effect. It sounds very difficult to live with and I admire those of you on this thread who show their strength and support each other. I was and am afraid of developing brachial plexopathy from radiation treatment. I have SEVERE neuropathy from my chemo - I was told it would probably go away within a few months of finishing chemo but it has gotten worse instead of better. When I spoke with my RO about the very article sited above, his response was that the data is old - patients were from between 1980 and 1993. Back then they used cobalt instead of photons from a linear accelerator. Back then they gave 60 Gy - today they usually give 50 Gy (I opted to go even lower and get 45 Gy). In the study, people received 3 Gy/fraction - today they give 1.8-2Gy per fraction (I only received 1.8 Gy/fraction). Although my RO convinced me that the statistics from the article weren't valid today, I (and especially many of those on this forum) know that the risk is still there. I have read articles regarding people who got 40 Gy and still ended up with plexopathy. I would like to see them do a new study with todays parameters to determine what the real risk really is to the brachial plexus. It would certainly help patients to make a more informed choice if we had accurate numbers. I felt I needed to do the radiation because of my cancer ... but also felt that most of the statistics I based that decision on were outdated (i.e. most studies were done before Herceptin even existed). The bottom line is that more studies need to be done in the modern era looking at long term side effects. The old data isn't necessarily relevant and most new studies report survival rates without talking about side effects. For something like radiation, many of the side effects might not appear for years so a 5 year follow up period may miss what's really happening. I find myself unable to find figures regarding lymphedema, plexopathy, secondary cancers, and hypothyroidism that I truly believe. That being said, I still ended up doing the radiation. I",

It was severe after the TCH, started to improve in Sept, but has worsened in Oct and Nov. I am wondering if the Perjeta could be responsible for the worsening neuropathy. I paid attention before and after my last infusion and the neuropathy in my mouth and legs definitely changed/worsened within a few days of the infusion. Has anyone else noticed worsening of neuropathy that they think may be associated with Perjeta? Other things that I noticed and think may be attributable to the Perjeta - increased fatigue, diarrhea/nausea, taste change (my taste was starting to improve on the Herceptin only then went back to weird after starting Perjeta), and a lot of acne (although the acne could be due to my hormonal changes).

Hair Loss with little kids - I wanted to put this out there since it was very helpful with my 7 year old girl.  She was really worried about my hair loss.  So, after I had it buzzed we went to the Party store which had wigs in every color for $13.  We had a try on session which she totally enjoyed.  We ended up buying 4 colors and I told her I would wear whichever one she wanted to each of he T-Ball games.  So far I have had pink, purple, and bright yellow hair (rainbow will likely be soon!)  Now she thinks it is FUN.  My 9 year old is reacting differently - he just wants me to look normal.  So I wear a more expensive natural brown wig to drop him off at school and hats while I am home.  The couple of times he saw me bald, he was able to articulate that he doesn't want to remember me without hair so that when this is all over he can pretend it never happened - so I try to wear hats for him.  Every child is different! Hair Loss - Thankfully I no longer need to have electrolysis on my chin - yeah!  One of the benefits of chemo.  The hair on my legs is so sparse I haven't shaved in over a month.  I also still have about 20% of the hair on my head which looks funny since it's so patchy and shaved short.  Has anyone reached smooth bald yet?  I think I will look better then! Vaginal Dryness - I asked my onc about this since so many people in my support group complain about it.  Many of them have started VagiFem for it.  My onc was fine with my starting it during chemo (she said as long as I wasn't having periods anymore it was okay).  I am hoping it will prevent the dryness before it happens.  That being said, I'm not even in a relationship so I won't know how helpful it really is for now! Jen - That's awful about your son - I hope he heals quickly!  Sounds like you have a lot going on all at once.  My thoughts are with you.  Things will get better! Heather - Yeah for the negative BRCA test!!!!! Neuropathy - I LOVE my oncologist!!!! I have had increasing peripheraly neuropathy with my first two infusions - mild after number one becoming severe after number 2.  I also have abnormal liver function since my first infusion (ALT ranged between 109 and 123 since second infusion).  I was on Carboplatin and Taxotere which can both cause neuropathy.  So, my once switched me to Cytoxan and Taxotere which I had today - if my neuropathy gets worse we will blame it on the Taxotere and switch to another regimen, if not we will continue which Tax/Cytoxan and blame it on the Carbo.  Hopefully the liver problem is from the Carbo too! I LOVE my onc!! I love that she listens and is going to adjust based on how I'm doing!  Just wanted to say that since I am sooooo worried about this neuropathy!

I just got heartburn today.  I'm going to try Pepcid - hope it helps! I have been given 2 Neupogen shots - on day 2 and 3 of this cycle.  They will check my counts when I go in for my next Herceptin to see if the Neupogen was enough.  They say that there is less bone pain from Neupogen than from Neulasta but the Neupogen doesn't last as long so it takes more shots of it to achieve the same effect.  I think they individualize which one to give you based on your counts.   I am taking Claritin to prevent bone pain and haven't had much problem.",
