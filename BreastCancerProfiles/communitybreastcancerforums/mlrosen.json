Is anyone taking Zometa and could possibly give me some insight? Thanks.  Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "mlrosen wrote: I have four family members who have/had BC - all are directly related to my great-grandmother (who did not have BC as far as we know and lived to age 94.)  My grandmother was diagnosed 30 years ago at age 61.  She had a masectomy only and is still alive at age 91 with no reoccurrence.  My mother was diagnosed with BC in one breast in 2002 at age 60; and had a lumpectomy, lymphadenectomy, chemo and radiation.  It went into remission until 2009 when she was diagnosed with stage IV BC metastasis to the bones.  She's currently being treated with faslodex.  Her sister was diagnosed at age 47; had a lumpectomy and lymphadenectomy, but no chemo or radition and is in remission.  My cousin was diagnosed last year at age 58 and had a lumpectomy and radiation. She's currently on Tamoxifen.  All four cancers were estrogen-positive and outside of my aunt, all were postmenopausal.  None have had any other type of cancer. I'm 42 and my sister is 44 (we get yearly mammos) and we are both worried we will fall in line with the family stats.  Does anyone else have a multiple family members with BC?  And if so, are there any preventative measures you are taking?
