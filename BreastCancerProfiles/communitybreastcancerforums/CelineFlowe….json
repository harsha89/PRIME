Heres some advice while you wait... 1- Collect ALL reports... take notes..keep a journal and bring someone to the appointements with you that will help you keep info straight. 2- If you are unhappy with your doc..get a second opinion  3- If researching and reading stuff, is making you scared ... stop 4- If not knowing anything is driving you nutz... read/research (double check ALL websites) 5- Grab a drink... a cup of tea... or take a ride on a purple bubble 6- remember you are not alone, you are strong and you are loved. be well, flower",
