The only cancer history in family is Melanoma, in my dad. So when I found out that I was BRCA2 positive, I was in shock. I guess I'm want to know, how did you guys handle learning you were positive. Have you taken any prophylactic measures? I know that I'm only 23, but I've been researching mastectomy's quite a bit and am already leaning towards that. I have an appointment with a Breast Specialist and Genetic Counselor. Do you all have any advice for me? Thanks! Shelby Log in to post a reply",
