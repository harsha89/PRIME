I'm her person. we were colleagues and neither of us are married (she is a widow). She moved in with me, I retired early and I watch out for her, take her to appointments. We are the best of friends. And I am so very sad right now....the stroke happened this past monday, it's taken some of her umph...her speech, her quickness. I'm worried and can't sleep... I can't seem to find much on the internet about what happens now....she has been on a regimen of herceptin and tratruzamid (not sure of the spelling) every 3 weeks. She had a treatment last friday and then a stroke]Monday morning. That is when I noticed her speech slurring. At the hospital I learned for the first time that WBRT increases the likelihood of stroke. Does anyone have experience with stage 4, brain mets, WBRT and stroke? What should I be doing? Usually I read up on any treatment options and pepper her docs with questions so she gets the best chance given the treatment options....but this time I feel like the wind got knocked out of me and I don't know quite what to do next. Haven't found anything online to help. Any recent research on best next steps? Tips? Suggestions? Many thanks.. ( Man, does cancer suck.)",

No one had said anything yet about her treatment cycle...to continue or take a break. Your response was very helpful and a bright spot to my day. Thank you. Happy Easter too. Beth ",
