NO ONE told me my breast might shrink. I didn't pay much attention until about 5-6 yrs ago as it was so gradual it really wasn't noticeable. I have always done aerobics & had pride in my body & now I have a left breast that is a full B cup (I know that is not big but it is perfect for me) & one small rt A cup breast. I feel deformed. Yes, I am happy to be alive, that is not the issue. I have seen 2 PS now, the 2nd one just today. The 1st one said the only real option is reduce the left breast to the size of the rt one. That is NOT going to happen. The one today said he could put a implant into the rt breast & do a lift on it & a lift on the left breast but there may be a double bubble on one or both breast. Anyone have that problem?? The one today said the real problem is that Medicare MAY NOT pay for it because legally they only have to pay for mastectomies. He said they have always paid in the past but due to the length of time since my surgery (19 yrs), he thinks they may not pay because they may consider it \"cosmetic\". I thought all breast reconstructions after BC surgery was cosmetic unless women want to go around all scarred. Obvious men are making those rules. I probably shouldn't say that but I do wonder. Anyway, I was just wondering if there are other women having these problems. Since Medicare won't tell you whether they will pay or not until AFTER the surgery, I don't know whether to go ahead & just do it or not. Someone please help me. Thank you. ",
