    "Content": "avo wrote: I have been offered a choice by my RO and I'm not sure what to do. Either start radiation in January 2013 which would be over 7 months from my mastectomy on 30 May 2012 (stage IIIa, 2.3 and .7 cm tumours, 4 of 11 nodes positive, left breast); or start radiation in mid December 2012 which means gaps for Christmas, Boxing Day, and New Year's Day as well as weekends. I've heard a gap of over 6 months from surgery to radiation isn't great but I don't know what the impact is of gaps in treatment.  My RO says neither is ideal but he won't give an opinion as to which is worse. Does anyone have any thoughts?  Thanks! Log in to post a reply",
