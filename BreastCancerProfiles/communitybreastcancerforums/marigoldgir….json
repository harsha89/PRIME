I lay on my back with my arms over my head. I have the mold around my body. I don't have to worry about my heart because I am being treated on my right side. I am not to uncomfortable. They expose only my right breast and always tell me when they are going to touch me. They seem very sensitive about this to me. I am a little worried about lymphodema because I am missing 16 lymph nodes on that side. I have not had any swelling yet. I hope to keep it that way. Anyone get it from radiation? Radiation today got cancelled because of thunderstorms last night took out the machine. yikes! I usually don't post much but read daily. Healing prayers to everyone.",

I found it not unpleasant at all. My nurse was very nice and explained everything to me. My uncle who has been having treatments for non-Hodgkins came in to see me and wanted to make sure everyone was taking good care of me. He knew everyone there. It was very comforting. I felt fine during infusion. Then my daughter took me to lunch, and a quick stop for shopping. I did get tired later at home and felt weird, my body felt tingly and my tummy felt warm, kinda of like I drank whiskey. I will start nausea meds before bed and clairtin. I have the nuelsta box. She put it on my tummy. I am glad to hear how everyone is doing. It helps. I think everyone looks great in their wigs and scafves.",

I also drink tea, coffee, and sparkling water throughout the day that I don't count. Sorella- I was bruised terribly from my port placement. It took about 10 days to fade. I have also bruised from my treatment. It is a small purple bruise. I think I will probably just buise every time. I am pale and have always bruised easy. Pamela23- My MO advised me to take Clairtin 3 times a day for the bone pain that is a SE of the Nulasta injection. I start the day before it infuses and continue for 2 or 3 days. (not sure if it helps yet as I get my injection today, will keep you posted) Looking forward to hearing how everyone is holding up today. Sunny thoughts to you all.",
