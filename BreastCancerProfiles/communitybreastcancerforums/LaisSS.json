I guess it must be a normal procedure. Are you doing any reconstruction? I will have it at the same time, my breast is not too big so my Plastic Surgeon will do the reconstruction and add an Implant (Only left breast). If implant doenst react too well to radiation or the breasts are unbalanced he will correct 6 months after. ",

My last chemo was yesterday (Feb 1st) so yayy! and I'm glad you'll also be done soon, according to my onc the worst is over. I'm having an MRI on the 13th to see how chemo has helped me, we already know it has gone from 5cm to 1.5cm which is great but the proximity to my areola leaves a question mark on the surgery route. I'll see my surgeon on the 22nd to find out. I would personally like to have a lumpectomy with immediate reconstruction but if that is not an option my plan B is a BMX with reconstruction like yours, fingers crossed",

Sitti thank you for the tip, I will shoot her a direct message. Update: Saw my PS, Onc, and BS the past 3 days. They all say is healing great, 7 nodes were taken off and they all had negative results and the tumor went from 5.5x6cm to 1.4cm no surprises on the characteristics and all margins were negative so I guess I can say I'm cancer free. They are starting me this week on hormonal therapy Tamoxifen for a couple months while Zoladex supresses my ovaries and PS said in about 2 weeks I can start the rads. Happy the recoveries are all going well, and good luck for the upcoming surgeries. Hugs to all! ",

I was able to come home a couple hours afer the surgery, those first 2hs were a little tough I had no pain but every little bit of liquid I injested would come out 10 min later (nurse said I was gassy). throat feels raspy from the intubation but nothing that bothers too much and I have pain killers ready for when anything starts hurting. I was out going and leaving the surgical room so I just feel like I went in there and got implants on one breast (I told my friends i'm half fake and half real now lol). BS told my mom was much better than she expected with a big smile (she doesnt smile that much and they have a language barrier that prevents details so that was a sign for my mom). PS also spoke to her and said everything went great. I'm excited to see them in a week to check the pathology results. Getting up and moving around has been difficult too, feels the same way from when i did the biopsy but 10x harder. Anyways, I wanted to share the first feelings with you guys. I know a lot of you are getting the DIEP or MX which are a lot harder so i wish you all the best of luck",

I went through a similar process of having a fast lump growth, I waited for my results researching everywhere in the internet and that made me even more scared so I suffered way too much ahead of time. Unfortunately I cannot tell you my diagnosis was the best, at age 25 was a real shock and a life changing experience (I know everyone says that), however thinking negatively only leaves us more fragile and weak to follow the fight path if that is the case. Which I deeply hope won't be yours. Stay positive and live one day at a time. My best wishes are with you",

I think is because I'm no longer taking any meds and the swell has come down a lot on my operated breast. I did the same chemo regimen before my surgery and you're right, go day by day. Keep the same mentality through the port placement -- which will be easy breasy compared to the surgery you just had -- and chemo and take in all the info your Oncologist and these amazing forums have to give you. However don't stress over the side effects, we all react differently. Let's say I got 2/3 down of my processes, but the fact that you got one of the out of the way is already a victory. At the end of the line we will feel like it all passed in no time. Sitti Thank you! I love to see how you interact with each and everyone of us and gives us comfort it inspires me to do the same. I was feeling a little off due to the meds but overall great about my recovery. I will see my PS, BS and Oncologist (to talk about hormonal therapy) this week, I haven't had any news about the path reports yet but they sounded pretty confident after surgery so I'm not stressing about it, not even one bit. From what I see I'm really happy with the result, much better than I expected and I don't think it will be so bad to be half fake and half real for a while. my biggest anxiety now is to be ready for rads and get it over with. To all, So happy to hear how you are going after your surgeries and that overall everyone is doing well, of course is not easy and there are ugly parts to it that some choose not to share and some get it out there and that is a comfort to us as well, after all we are not in wonderland here. I cannot relate so much to the MXs, TE and drains because I have not gone through it, but I keep you in my prayers and I really like to read all your stories. I confess that when I see some of you had lumpectomies like me in the past and have to go through all over again I do feel for you and cannot deny the fear, but I learned that we all have to follow our path. We have different cases but we are all going through something that is extremely painful, hard and stressful. However we are also going through something that makes us reflect on/get to know ourselves, to become fearless, stronger and powerful. I wish you ladies a fast recovery and my best wishes for the upcoming surgeries!",
