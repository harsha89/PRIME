You my God is everything You're all I want more than anything The glitters of this world will pass Your love for me will never fade I praise you Lord, my Holy Lord.  You shed your blood and died for me. The life I have was Yours to give and what I do is my gift to you.  WE ARE OVERCOMERS.  -Connie-",

Keep talking to God.  Your wife is so blessed for having a husband like you.  Continue the good work that God has started in you.  You are not alone in this journey.  BE STILL AND KNOW THAT HE IS GOD.",
