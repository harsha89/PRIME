Altho' it is not a constant pain, it frequently is a shooting pain, followed by aching and not just the breast but my ribs too. Only lasts a few minutes, subsides but comes back again at least 20 times a day....excruciating and worrisome. I have not had any problems until just this week. I don't recall doing anything out of the ordinary...just woke up one night and could not go back to sleep....hurt so much. After reading all the above posts, I guess this is normal, altho' it doesn't feel normal. Just another reminder of this horrible disease.",

Start rads on 5/4/11. In all my researching I did read that NOT washing the breast before rads helps alleviate burning. Has anyone else read this or experienced it. I thought I just might shower the night before and grease up. All comments or suggestions are welcomed.....this web site is wonderful. Wish I had found it weeks ago.",
