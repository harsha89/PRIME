To date my mother, grandmother, and two out of three aunts have been diagnosed with HER2+ breast cancer. Not to mention my mother also had IBC in her left breast at the time she had HER2+ cancer in her right. I started having issue about 3 years ago. Found lumps in my breast and in my armpits. Doctors did ultrasounds given my age at the time was 25. And said it looked like nothing but \u201cjust watch it\u201d. Well within the last few weeks my left nipple has become flatter/pulling in and almost purple in color. Went and had another ultrasound which they said was normal but thank goodness my mother spoke up and wanted me to have a mammogram regardless due to her IBC not showing on a ultrasound. The doctor once again said it looked normal but what I saw of my left one did not look \u201cnormal\u201d. I know what a normal mammogram should look like and my left did not look normal. Should I seek a doctor that is more willing to hear me out despite my age? I am still only 28 but all these red flags keep pointing me to Paget\u2019s disease of the nipple. I would appreciate any input! And thanks for letting me vent lol Log in to post a reply",

Only saw the picture on the screen for a few seconds. Never saw films again, But doctor still said it was normal but very lobular, if that makes any sense.",
