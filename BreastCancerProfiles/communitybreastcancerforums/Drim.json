Lasted the normal amount of time but only had 1 or 2 days of medium bleeding. Now waiting to see if it will continue every month.

When I first found out I was going to be on TCx4 I did find the Taxotere and Cytoxan thread and it kinda scared me. I have to say, although I wouldn't describe it as a day at the beach (and I know you're just kidding about that) I'm actually not having a bad time with it at all (I've only been through 2 cycles so far so hopefully this continues). I read a lot about how to combat the side effects and I drank tons of water days before and after (and really tried to continue that as much as possible throughout). I tried to move around when I felt fatigued, took claritin for neulasta side effects, rinsed with Biotene, stuck my fingers and toes in peas for the neuropathy/nail issues and sucked on ice cubes. Also, I'm using cold caps to save my hair. All of this seems to be working because during the 1st cycle I was fatigued for 2-3 days and got a cold sore. During cycle 2 I was fatigued for 1 day but my tongue felt like it was burned and I had some issues with taste for a few days which was not great for my water drinking. Note that I didn't do a good job sucking on ice cubes during round 2 (not sure if that's just a coincidence or not as I know these treatments have a cumulative effect). I know everyone is different but it is nice to have a thread with some positive news out there for those who will be doing this treatment for the most important reason of all - to save their lives and keep this sucker from ever coming back!",

In this last treatment I was much more diligent about the ice cubes during T and my tongue did not get 'burnt' this time so it really does work. I also feel like I was not as good with the water drinking which seemed to drag out the fatigue an extra day. It does get harder to keep up with the water because it tastes 'boring' and it makes me feel a little bloated but if you can do something to flavor - like lemon drops - it does help. Continued good luck to all!",

If its free of cancer you will most likely not need a drain. If they have to take a bunch more nodes you might. I only had one node removed so I can only speak about my experience. I did not find it to be very painful. The one thing I would recommend is to keep the ice on the area as directed even if you feel perfectly fine. I was feeling so good and didn't do the best job with the ice so I was sore for a couple extra days. When I had the re excision I learned my lesson and had very little pain. I did not need anything more than Advil for the pain either time except initially when I woke up from the anesthesia. I didn't have much of an issue with range of motion so I can't advice on exercise. I'm pulling for you!!",

I am a small C and it's amazing how much they can take out and it hardly makes a difference cosmetically. My BS told me she moved some tissue around a bit for better cosmetic results but did not fill it in with anything. I know everyone keeps mentioning re-excision so I guess it's pretty common. What they do is take out the tumor and surrounding tissue (think cube). Then they stain the 6 sides of the 'cube' and microscopically test to see if any cancer cells are found in the stained area. Your path report will tell you how close to the edges cancer cells were found. If they are too close to the edges (close margins) or on the edges (dirty margins) they will go in and re-excise. In my case I had 4 close margins so for each margin that is not clear they need to take out a chunk of tissue. Luckily my re-excision showed no residual cancer at all. So I had a 1.9cm lump plus all that extra tissue and you can't really even tell. If anything, the cancer side looks a little better since it has a better 'lift' than the other one.",

Still have the hair. My eyebrows are starting to thin and I have some patches on the right side. Nothing a little pencil can't cover. I'm going to LGFB class on Thursday. I'll let you know how my experience is. I have been feeling a little bloated lately and guess what came back. Yes - my period again. What happened to chemopause. The last period was very weird so hopefully this one isn't going to be but I'm not holding my breath since I got no cramps or anything so is this another fake an-ovular one? Still having insurance issues with rads. Not happy about that. Have a good sleep everyone. Next time I talk to you all I'll be done done done!!! Woo Hoo!!!",

I had such a fabulous weekend. I spent all day yesterday in Central Park in 90+ degree heat with my friends. It's an annual picnic we have to honor the passing of one of my best friend's mother who died  6 years ago. It's really such a nice tradition that brings us all together for fun, laughter, eating drinking and honoring our families. I feel pretty much back to normal now. The only thing going on with me is that my eyebrows are really starting to thin. I'm not stressing this - just filling them in with pencil (probably not doing a great job because I'm clueless). Eyelashes are still there as is all of the hair on my arms and the part of my legs that I didn't shave. The part I do shave grows back really slowly and thin. Chin hairs are starting to re-appear slowly. I was very interested in the discussions about mortality. It made me realize that I'm sort of in denial about this whole thing still. I guess I'm trying not to think about this coming back again. I think I will be really nervous when I go for my first mammo/ultrasound. I also really appreciate the discussion and information on nutrition. I know this is really my downfall and I'd better get serious about improving what I eat. I know this is supposed to be my wake-up call so I better wake up. Unfortunately I don't like to cook but I'm still going to get Cancer Fighting Kitchen and I'm sure there must be some things in there that are easy to prepare. So tomorrow is my rads simulation. I'm not nervous at all (I only get nervous when I'm waiting for test results - like really nervous). I'm going to bite the insurance bullet and just pay whatever and hope for the best. I really love my doctor and I hear she is one of the best so I don't want to mess around and look for someone else - not to mention it is more convenient for me to stay with her. I don't want any more delays (I feel like I really delayed chemo) so I would like to for once start something on time. I will most like start on August 11th - a couple days after I get back from PR. And like GolferGirl I want to stay with the group although I did go check out the August rads group because it's good to hear about what others are doing for pain/redness. Summer - it was nice to hear that you too had a wonderful time with your girlfriends. It is important to do things that make you feel normal and not have to discuss cancer. patricia - I hope you are starting to feel better. My grandmother used to make me dresses and I still have some of them. fotopet - congratulations on finishing up your treatments. I hope you had a decent weekend and that you are starting to feel good by now. LauraM - good to hear from you! I hope you are feeling better with the taxol. njbhwgirl - so terrible that you ended up in the hospital but how great that your friends and family showed you how important you are to them. That's really amazing that they would be such a huge help with such a large party. I can't imagine me organizing a party like that let alone any of my friends taking over for me. Good luck at the PS this Wednesday and happy b'day to your granddaughter. Also, congrats for getting selected for Casting for Recovery. Packjen - that was hysterical about possibly having to share a bed - yikes! So glad you don't have to. x-raygirl - I hope you get selected for this program as well. Day - You're amazing. It's just fascinating to read your posts. Leanna - Happy Anniversary!! GolferGirl - You and I are really traveling this road together. I'm right behind you once again with the rads so I'll count on you to pave the way. You seem to get a lot of good information from your doctors. Hopefully I get on the nutrition bandwagon like you have. Happy belated Birthday. I hope you enjoyed it. I'm sure you did!! (((((HUGS))))) Drim",

I'm so glad that everyone is either done or so close to being done with chemo. Patricia - what an amazing piano story - 11 years old! WOW. Sacphotomom - so sorry you are in the hospital! Get well soon. Tess - Funny you should mention swallowing the pills. I never had any trouble swallowing pills and a few weeks ago (during rads) I almost choked on one. It has been a little harder to swallow the bigger pills but my throat doesn't feel funny at all. As for me I am now DONE with rads. I had my last tx on Friday but I have been working like a lunatic. In fact I am working now (yes 7:30pm on a saturday). I have a deadline on Monday which is why I've hardly been on here. Rads went really well. I did not get fatigued except for one week at the beginning. Good thing because I had no time for that. My skin held up great up until the very end. Now I have one red spot in the boost area. Leanna, most people get a series of regular treatments - that is radiation to the entire breast, and then get a few treatments (I had 7) directly to the scar area where the tumor was. The boosts aren't more radiation than the regular treatment (in fact I think it is less radiation) but the treatment is more cutaneous than subcutaneous which is why your skin feels worse with the boosts. The boosts are weird because they need to mark the treatment area and for me they did that with sharpies and I had to make sure not to wash it off so I went around for 1-1/2 weeks with sharpie markers on my boob. For those of you doing rads or moving on to rads - good luck!!! njbhwgirl - I can't remember when you said our gathering was going to be or if you are even having it anymore but the only week I cannot do is the week of Oct 9th and that may very well be when you were going to have it. I really hope we can all get together soon once we are completely done with treatment and everyone is feeling back to (new) normal. HUGS!!!",

That is just awful news. Just sending you big hugs! Your hair looks fantastic. I love have everyone's been comparing their hair length to yours on the various days. Leanna:  You have been gone forever. I missed you and was definitely hoping that the TE fills were going well. It is completely understandable that you would be in some pain and would want to stay away from the computer. Jenn: So happy to hear that your surgery went well and that you sound so great. How is your son doing?  I just love to hear stories about him and how perceptive he is even at his young age. Jean: Thinking about you and hoping all is going well with your mom and son and that you are handling your new living conditions okay. Jen: I hope you're on a sunny beach in Hawaii having the time of your life. Can't wait to hear how it went when you get back! patricia: Welcome back from Paris (I know it's been a while already). Sounds like you had a great trip. How exciting that your sweetie will soon be moving in with you. It sounds like he has been extremely supportive throughout this whole process. Hope that rads is going well. How many times do you have to go? Also, that's very exciting news about another grandchild. It's nice when they are close in age. Glad your thyroid issue is just a goiter which I hope like the others said can be treated without surgery. Too funny the things we are now thankful for. paxton: Sounds like you are making a really good effort to exercise and eat better. I wish I could say the same for myself. The Y is great! YAY for WHOOPIE (hee hee). That word makes me think of the Dating Game. magda - I'm so glad you joined this group. It's been really interesting to read about your journey all the way from the Czech Republic. That bone marrow biopsy information is very interesting. In all my readings I had not heard of this becoming part of the staging in the future. I'm so happy that your surgery went well and hopefully you will be able to escape rads. latte - congratulations on being done with surgery! Sounds like everything went well. Denise: I have been following your posts all along. I'm so happy rads is finally coming to an end for you!!....and yay for eyelashes!! I know you've been waiting patiently! WOO HOO!! Daiva: Oh man....that's crazy about your puncture. Hopefully the \u2018fix' for this won't be too terrible. Thank goodness you're almost done with rads. I did great during chemo but definitely had energy issues during rads - somewhat around the middle of rads and then more so after it was over so all of that is totally normal. I am really sorry to hear about the BRCA+. That's a terrible blow. I know they recommend an ooph so it's good that you will be getting that done soon. LauraM:  Nice to hear from you and what a great picture. Glad you are moving on from treatment. Very interesting about the lymph nodes. Thanks goodness your doctor noticed the other \u2018bad' areas. I wonder if all of our surgeons/labs are testing everything they should. It's amazing how much information I learn all the time from reading others' stories on this site. golfergirl: Hope all is well with you. I'm sure you are reading when you can so know that I'm thinking of you and hoping you're settling back in to \u2018normal' life. Irishtess: How are you doing? Haven't heard from you in quite some time. I hope you are fully recovered from rads and not suffering from too much fatigue. Summer: Miss you too. I understand you are posting on facebook and that you are doing that crazy traveling to rads so it makes sense you are not posting on here anymore. Speaking of FB, I changed my security settings so you can search for me and friend me now if you'd like. I don't get on that often especially since I can't access it from work. wellsey6, nanaof2, KimLoves, redbarb, JennyB and fotopet: Just giving you all a shout out and hope you are doing well!! As for me, I'm doing okay. Work is not as busy as it was before. When it's not busy I get concerned that I won't have enough work. Our company just went through layoffs last week and there will be another one in January so some scary times. I went for my first post treatment mammo. They said everything was fine. Then I get this letter in the mail that says they saw something on the film they believe to be benign, which they put in big bold letters. My heart skipped a beat anyway. Then I was thinking - which breast did they see something in. Then I remembered that they only took films of the right one. I know there is something in there that is benign already so hopefully they are referring to that same spot (that supposedly has a clip on it). I'm going for another full mammo in February so they'll have another opportunity to go in there. I'm wondering if this is all too much radiation for such a short period of time. I'm on tamoxifen yet I got my period anyway and I have not had a single hotflash in over 2 months so I'm seriously concerned that this stuff is not working on me. I'm going in for herceptin on Tuesday so I will of course mention this to my onc. My eyelashes have stopped growing so I just placed my order for RapidLash. I'm going to try it and see if it lengthens my lashes without giving me any irritation. I've missed you all. I'm glad so many of us are still coming back here! Hugs and Happy Thanksgiving to all!!

Don't let your mind wander too much. I don't know your husband but I'm sure he will be by your side wanting to do whatever he can. Please don't feel like you are a burden. You will most definitely get through this!!!",

I will also be doing the cold caps and I will need to have those on my head for 8 hours (hopefully 7 hrs starting with treatment #2). This should be a real adventure which I will share with you. I'm of course so nervous but it sounds like you guys are doing well so that's encouraging for sure!",

The steroids kept me up for 4 days (I really need to take something next time to make me sleep) and my taste buds are not good. I was describing something similar to you. My tongue feels like I burned it. It doesn't look red or anything but that's just the best way to describe the feeling. Things don't taste that great including water so I have put some lemon drops in my water but it's becoming increasingly difficult to drink enough and now I am a bit constipated. Day 4 was definitely my worst day as I just felt 'heavy' all day. But I'm happy to report I finally got some sleep last night and I'm feeling much better. Now I just need to get my taste back.

I'm doing well except for the past 2 weeks I had my bout with my an-ovular period which start 3 weeks after my last real period. The first week it was very light. Week 2 it started to pick up a bit and by mid week - holy cow - the flood gates opened! On Thurs. night I couldn't even sleep. This went on all day Friday but thank goodness it has slowed down. Also, I have been so bloated these past couple of weeks but I think that's getting better now too! First of all I would like to give a big shout out to all you mothers (and grandmothers) out there who have the added responsibility of taking care of your kids and the issues that come along with that. There are so many of you and I am just sending you all a big hug! LauraM and GolferGirl - love the stories about your daughter and niece. These kids are so insightful. Sacphotomom and LauraM- congrats on 4th AC. What a relief to be done/almost done with that part of your treatment. YAY!!! Leanna - I love your story about shaving your head if the Celtics had won. Can you imagine the look on your friends' faces? They would have thought you are the biggest Celtics fan ever! Also, really cool about your son and the Jr. Olympics. LibraryJenn - happy B'day to your son. We share the same birthday! Also, I love the boob art story. It's great that you have so much support around you. Nanaof2 - must be such a relief to have the school year done (almost done). Hopefully you can focus on just you now and finish up this treatment! LisaNJ - I am your friend's sister. I'm so happy you decided to join. I'm sure you have already realized what a great group we have going here. I hope this makes you feel better about how you're doing with your treatment and I hope you have a great weekend! Summer38- I seemed to be having some weird eye issues yesterday. No tearing but I couldn't see distance very well. Kind of like I had a light shining in my eyes and it was causing a cloudy film. I was ready to make an eye doctor appt. and get glasses. Note that I just turned 44 and refuse to admit that I may perhaps need reading glasses but never before did I think I needed them for distance. Today seems to be better but I still feel like staring at the computer screen all day is probably not great.  Sorry about that long post but that's what happens when you stay away for a week . May you all have a SE free weekend!!",

I gave them a little rest if they were getting cold because I certainly don't want frost bite. I have seen other people saying things like - I had no issues with my nails because the infusion room was so cold and I wore sandals. So I think the idea is just to slow down the circulation to the extremities.

CTherese- I got my period yesterday too. It seems a little bit heavier than usual and it came a couple days earlier than usual. It will be interesting to see how this affects me the next couple of days. I also thought I was getting a UTI which I never get. I had some burning in the area (TMI) and I did feel like I needed to urinate quite a lot, which I think means I need to do a better job with the wipies those first few days as to not irritate the skin. Luckily the probably seems to be pretty much gone now which I'm surprised at. I guess healing of any kind surprises me now. Last night I went out for dinner with a bunch of friends and had what amounted to a glass of wine. I'm not sure that was the smartest thing to do as I did get a headache and did not sleep very well. I feel pretty okay today but feel like I can't wait to get home from work. I'm starting to get nervous about my hair. Nothing at all is happening yet anywhere (Day 9) and I'm doing the cold caps so the anticipation of the results is killing me. Good luck to all of you receiving treatment this week!!!",

Somehow for boys it doesn't seem like that big a deal (I guess depending on what kind of hairstyle they currently have). nanaof 2 and sacphotomom - so sorry to hear about your port issues. Hopefully that doesn't happen anymore. Glad they finally got it straightened out for both of you. Tricia - the wig story made me cry.

Do you need any help with anything? Summer - I'm sorry you could not be with your daughter. I do not have any kids and I can't imagine going through all this while having to worry about kids too. God bless all you parents out there!! Hair stuff: I am doing the penguin cold caps so I'm not losing the hair on my head. The only other hair I seem to be losing (Day 24 of TCx4) is the hair down there. It fell out a bunch around day 15/16 something like that and then it stopped so perhaps in a couple of weeks it will all be gone. I haven't noticed any other hair loss but it does seem like the hair is growing in slower like under my arms and legs. I also got the irritation down there about a week after my first treatment. I thought it may be a yeast or bladder infection but I just think it was the cytoxan irritating the area and then it went away completely in about a week. This time I'm making sure to always wipe with wet wipes so it doesn't happen again. Also - drink drink drink water. I've finally had to resort to lemon flavoring in the water because the water is starting to get boring after 4 weeks of massive drinking. Hope you are all well!",

Interesting about the hip pain. I had hip 'issues', not so much pain but it felt like the hip joints were out of line (which I do get normally sometimes anyway) and this went on for a few days starting about a week after the neulasta shot. Now I'm starting to feel them again and it's been 5 days since neulasta. That's the only affect I get from the neulasta so not bad and good to know that it means regeneration!",

I've gained about 7 or 8 pounds so far since chemo started (but I had lost 15 from the stress of waiting for results) so I'm okay with how I am now - although I would not mind dropping another 5. I wonder how much is water weight as I do feel bloated at times. As long as I take probiotics I feel better. Hopefully I will not always need to take probiotics to feel better. I am also starving all the time. I feel like I could just eat and eat. Nothing in particular - just everything. JennyB - CONGRATULATIONS on being done. I know this was a really rough time for you but it should be all uphill from now on. I will be starting rads mid-August. I am supposed to go in for my rad simulation on Tuesday but I am having insurance issues (Aetna is having a difficult time with my health care provider or vice versa) so the coverage that was previously in-network is now being considered out of network unless I can get Continuity of Care which should not be a problem, however until it is resolved I will not schedule anything and find I am not covered. I still have time so even if I don't get my simulation on Tuesday I should still be on schedule for a mid-August start. x-raygirl - welcome to our group!

As far as the rads, once you get a time you do stick to it for the whole 6-7 weeks. The appt itself is supposed to be pretty short - get undressed, get positioned into machine, get zapped, get dressed and leave. Once a week you're supposed to spend some time with the doctor. While writing this post I got a call that they were able to give me a better time/date/location - woo hoo!!! So I will start rads at 8:30am on August 10th. I get back from PR on Aug. 9th but thankfully I won't be home too late. I have herceptin right after rads on that day which is nowhere near the radiation place. Then off to work - boy I'm exhausted just thinking about that....but so happy I got a better time for rads. njbhwgirl - I hope your lungs will be all better in time for your next treatment.

It's really a lot of work because you need one or 2 helpers to constantly replace the caps as they warm up. As a result of doing this I've been able to keep my hair but that is a chore as well because it's kind of dry now and you can't do much to style it because it and the follicles are still fragile. Even though I'm only 44 I have a ton of gray hair so it's a real challenge to cover up the gray without using real hair dye. With all that said I think I made the right decision for me to go forward with this. I don't think I would look nearly as good bald as you do. Re: Oncotype testing. You should google it. It's very interesting. In a nutshell, you end up with a recurrence score that tells you the likelihood of a distance recurrence within 10 years assuming you are ER+ positive and will be taking tamoxifen. It sounds like the scores are similar to Ki-67 which is definitely one of the indicators they test. I got a 19 which is considered low intermediate. What this means is that they are not sure if I would get a benefit from chemo or not. There is a large clinical trial going on called TailorX to try to figure out more about the intermediate scores. The test is really for early stage breast cancer. At the end of the day I am HER2+ so by today's standard of care I had to do chemo in order to receive herceptin. I would absolutely love to have the opportunity to meet you all. Have a great weekend everyone!!",

I started rads 3 weeks ago and all is going well with that. There are no signs of redness or burning to speak of yet but I am definitely feeling tired. Last night I went to sleep at around 10pm and usually i'm up until at least midnight or sometime 1am. It is true that I worked about 50 hours this week plus the additional 45 min/day added on for rads could have contributed but I still think it's mostly the rads. I spoke to my rad onc and she said she had no problem if I started tamoxifen during rads so I will speak with my med onc on Tuesday when I go for my herceptin. I've been reading about tests they can do to see if you will respond to the tamox so I'm going to ask her about that too. I don't want to take it if my body isn't going to process it. I just starting getting hot flashes (fun), but they are not too bad. I mostly feel it in my back - weird. I'm sure they will get a lot worse once I start the tamox (I heard that you know it's working if you get the hot flashes). Golfergirl - thinking about you and hoping you're doing well through rads. njbhwgirl- CONGRATULATIONS!!! I'm so happy for you that you are done with chemo. It is very emotional to be done. Like everything you've just been through has come to a head. You know I'm praying for you to get clean scans which I know you will. About our September get together at your place - I am definitely in. Just let me know when. I have a queen size aerobed so you don't need to worry about me. I'll also be happy to bring the ingredients for those biscontinis. I can't wait to try those. Irishtess - CONGRATULATIONS to you too!! I'm sure you will not miss those long trips into the city for your treatment. I'm sure you can't wait for vacation. I know how you love Ireland so that will be terrific! Summer- CONGRATULATIONS - you're done too!!! Thanks for the biscotini information. I am definitely going to be making those. I'm so sorry that you have to drive so far for rads. Hopefully you don't mind driving and enjoy being in the car. I love being in the car and singing (sure - this coming from the city girl who doesn't even own a car). Funny - I thought your name actually was Summer. Packjen- what a lovely story about your CFR experience....and congrats on winning the rod. You deserve it for driving all those people. I hope you (and everyone else) can make the trip to the Jersey Shore. Patricia - I always enjoy reading your posts. It's sounds like you have a great guy and he has a great gal. I highly recommend going on vacation between chemo and rads - Paris sounds just perfect. Leanna - I'm so sorry you are struggling with this treatment but you are almost done! I know you can do it. I was picturing your 'new' bathroom and it sounds great. I love changing things up in the bathroom. Sacphotomom, Kim, Daiva and Day - thinking about you too and hoping you are doing well!  Everyone have a great weekend!!!",

Hopefully we are all done forever!!! BRCA negative - what a huge relief. Throughout everything, the only time I cried when I got results was when they told me I was BRCA negative. I was just so relieved. I had convinced myself that I had too much going against me to be negative. LauraM - congrats on being done with Rads. Something else to put behind you! How great! Keep putting the creams on -especially at the boost area - for another couple of weeks. Day - I hope you're feeling better. I really do miss your educational posts. Jean - thanks! I had a great time doing the piece and am happy to go public to spread the word. Knowledge is power. Doesn't mean the caps are right for everyone but good to know about at least. Yay for the eyelashes. Mine are looking pretty sorry these days. The bottom ones are fine but the top ones are so short. They are a good thickness but then they just stopped growing. Guess I may need to go for that help eventually. Thanks Denise - yep, it was me. I'm glad I wasn't in it too much and that the story featured Shirley who is an amazing woman (she started the Rapunzel Project to raise funds to put freezers in cancer centers so that there can be a more affordable way to use these caps if one wishes to). Leanna - so happy to hear that your pain is getting better. It does kinda sound funny that you get to pick your size. What size do you start out at when they first put the TE in? and how often do you go for fills? I had heard that they like you to be fully expanded before the rads so they don't have to stretch your skin after rads. I'm sure your doctors will explain it all to you. I keep forgetting you have a teenage daughter. I know Nolan and Ryan are young athletic boys. Are they watching the World Series? Nolan Ryan...haa haa. Gotta love it! This is really going to put their names in the spotlight. I'm rooting for the Rangers now that the Yankees are out. Hugs to all the Warriors! Ditah",

I'm sure it must be extra hard to have the kids to care for but I'm sure they give you lots of love too. fotopet - all I can say is YAY!!!! I'm doing a happy dance for you! Good luck tomorrow. juliebed, snipinfool, and Summer - good luck to you on Wednesday. Hopefully this group is giving you inspiration that you will do well too!",

What a good looking bunch we are. I'm pretty sure I have the anovulatory thing going on too. I got my period a week after my first treatment and it was pretty normal. Then 3 weeks later it started again but very light and without cramps or anything. It's been about 3 days and its pretty much the same - just light. I had lost about 15 lbs. over 4 months from all the stress of waiting for test results (and boy are there lots). I was actually really happy because I needed to lose 10 and the extra 5 was fine too. Right at the same time that I got this 'period' I have felt sooo bloated. I'm sure I've gained at least 5 pounds if not more in the last week.  Good luck to those getting treatments tomorrow and Friday.",

It's supposed to go away when the herceptin is done. I just had my first dose of herceptin on Tuesday and it was uneventful. Hopefully it stays that way. I go in again next Tuesday and after my 3rd TC they will decide if they will continue on with H weekly until TC ends or of they will make the switch to once every 3 weeks. Hugs to all of you! ",

That's how it's done in the clinical trials so the normal couse of treatment is one year. Some people get it for two years (not typical). Others with metastatic cancer can be on herceptin for life. It's really quite a miracle drug. In terms of monitoring the heart, I got an echo (ultrasound) before I started treatment and will get one every three months throughoutt so yes, what your onc is telling you in terms of frequency is normal. Hopefully it's an echo and not an EKG. Not sure EKG is good enough. I know some people get MUGA scans but those are more invasive (I think since I've never had one).

Also wanted to mention for those of you on Taxotere.

I will probably come back soon and post again when I get out of work but I did see that some of you were starting Taxotare so I wanted to throw my 2 cents in since I've now been through 3 rounds of TC and still doing well (including the hair on my head). The only issue I'm really having is bloating so I need to get back on the probiotics. I have been fortunate enough not to have allergic reactions to the T. My infusion time the 1st time was 1-1/2 hours and now it's 1 hr. since I don't get reactions. My premeds include Dexamethasone, Pepcid, Benedryl and Aloxi. What I've been doing during each T treatment is to bring bags of frozen peas and put one on my toes and stick my fingers in the other. This is supposed to help with nail changes and neuropathy (although Taxol is supposed to be worse with these things). The other thing I do is to suck on ice cubes (big ones that hardly fit in my mouth at first). The one time I didn't do a good job with this my tongue felt like it was burnt so it seems worth trying. Like others have said, if you feel anything, let them know and they will slow the drip. Good luck to everyone!!!",

I know what you mean about seeing your doctor's number pop up. It freaks me out too. I'm still in for our Octoberfest Barb - welcome back. I was wondering how you were doing with rads. Funny that you asked about eyelashes. You and I were on a similar schedule and I am just now starting to notice thinning eyelash. My eyebrows are totally back.

I still have 2 weeks left and the middle of my chest is a little red and bumpy. Other than that it is going well. Chris and Magda - Welcome to our group!! It is never too late to join. Magda, I'm 1/4 Czech (and 3/4 Hungarian). I only found out a few years ago about the Czech part. Both of my parents were born in Hungary so I just assumed all 4 of my grandparents were too but turns out my dad's mom (who died when I was like 6) was originally from Czechoslovakia. I have always felt an attraction to people from that country so I was very excited to find out about me and I would love to come and visit one day. As for me, the rads are going really well. I was fatigued at first - like week  2 or 3 but I really feel fine now. I'm going to start tamoxifen soon so that will be my new adventure. There is a test (genetic) that they do to see if you are a good metabolizer of tamox but my onc said it's starting to fall out of favor. Basically what she said to me is that the only alternative to tamox for me is ovary suppression. I'm already having hot flashes (not terrible) so I suppose if they get worse it means the tamox is working. Have a good evening everyone. Here to a great week!!!",

Did the walk yesterday - 5 miles - and feeling a little sore today. Will probably be worse tomorrow. A transvaginal U/S is an U/S of the cervix, uterus, ovaries, fllopian tubes and endometrial lining. I got the U/S before I started on the tamoxifen because tamox can cause a thickening of the endometrial lining (and probably other issues too). I wanted to get a baseline and make sure I have no issues to begin with. I guess if something does start to happen (and hopefully it won't) we know what to blame it on.

There was a long delay in testing between the IHC and the FISH so I asked for the lumpectomy tumor to be tested so we could make sure I was truly HER2+ before I went ahead with chemo and herceptin, and that came back negative via FISH. The doctors did not like that answer so they investigated further and determined that my tumor was heterogeneous with some parts of the tumor being HER2- and others being HER2+. Needless to say I was given the herceptin. Sarika - I hope they get to the bottom of this for your mom so she can receive all possible treatments that may work for her.",

Laying low this weekend trying to get all my water in and just here watching the French Open. I'm a big tennis fan although I have not played in a while. nanaof2 - sounds like you have a wonderful support system around you between your husband, sons and school staff. I'm sure that helps a lot. redbard - i'm so happy you doing so well be sorry that your son's team lost the baseball game in that fashion. Another one of my favorite sports - baseball. This is actually the first year in a very long time that I had to miss softball season. njbhwgirl - been thinking about you. I hope your mom is doing better! summer38 - what an amazing story about your coworkers/friends. I just kept thinking I wonder what the men were thinking. It's so nice to feel the love! Day - I bet you can't wait to get the new Onc. Its terrible what this doc has put you through. PackJen - you are so creative. Definitely sounds like the pressure is on to top yourself but it sounds like you will have no problem doing that. I am so NOT creative. I really admire you. JennyB - good luck with your CT scan. I had one a few years ago with the contrast and its not that bad. The stuff you have to drink is a little yucky but with all the stuff we've been going through it will probably be no big deal to you. Leanna - have fun at Disney. It's one of my favoirte places to go on vacation but definitely keep re-applying that sun screen. GolferGirl - Yikes - your period again. I keep wondering what's going to happen with mine. We are the same age and I got my period one week after TC#1. It was a little heavier than usual but not terrible. Lets see if my ovaries make one last stand. To all - I hope you're having a great memorial day weekend! I'll check in soon to let you know how #2 went. (((((hugs))))",

I too ate a lot the 1st 2 weeks after Tx 2 but I think it's back to normal now. I gained some weight which is a combination of the eating and the bloating. The hair is actually doing really well. It's all there and I'm starting to get used to this whole - no styling it thing. The gray however is a different matter. I have lots and lots of gray hair and it's becoming impossible to do a good job covering it up. I'm just so thankful to have the hair that I don't even care.

They brought a smile to my face! Redbarb- YAY!!! VACATION!! Have an absolute blast....and then the two of us it seems need to start improving our eating. I am terrible - always eating frozen foods, pizza and bagels (can you tell I'm from NYC). I need to get my hands on Cancer Fighting Kitchen as well!! Leanna- I have not officially congratulated you on your DH's job!! Thank goodness. Also, about rads, I'm not sure if I have the fight left in me to start arguing about the tattoos. My mom had BC a few years ago (LCIS) and she had rads and the tattoos so maybe I'll just give in and get them. Summer - so sorry about the Taxol reaction. Hopefully they do better next time. x-raygirl- NYC with your daughter!!! I hope you were able to enjoy yourself for the day. Were you able to take in anything or were you just too busy with the headshots. Patricia and Irishtess - hoping Taxol went well!!! Irishtess, I should be starting rads mid-August but still working out insurance issues so I don't have anything really lined up yet. YIKES! njbhwgirl - God bless you and your son. I can't imagine what this feels like but your son is a true hero. Now about Cape May - I am there!!!! fotopet - good luck with your final treatment. Don't be nervous - all good thought!!! You will be so happy to be done!! Wanted to let you know that I went to LGFB class yesterday. They gave us so much great stuff and the make-up woman did great with her demonstrations. I really did feel pretty walking out of there. However, I wish we had the opportunity to meet one another. They never went around the room and there were only about 8 of us. I'm off to follow up with the insurance people about my rad treatments. Have a great day!!!",

Would be nice to meet up with you if you have to be in Manhattan again. Did I mention I got my period again? I may have. It's really light like it was the last time so that means I'm expecting it to get really heavy again next week. I hope not but it just seems like a pattern. I know my RBC count went down a little from that but not too bad so I suppose I can handle it. I used to get really bad nosebleeds all the time and it never made me light headed so maybe I'm used to blood loss. Still - not fun at all.",

Since it's in NYC, GMA wanted to speak with my doctor and do the story there. So my doctor called me with questions since she is not the expert on the caps - she's the doctor...and by the end of the day she was asking me if I would be willing to be a part of the story. It happened so quickly. I had a blast. I was there for about 2 hours speaking with the crew and Juju Chang who is a wonderful person. I didn't feel that articulate today so hopefully it comes across okay. It wasn't so much that I was nervous but the words were just not flowing today.",

I hope you and your family are having a great time as I'm sure you are. paxton - I got a new mattress right before I started chemo because I thought it would be a good idea to be able to rest well but I didn't get anything fancy - just a good bed from Sleepy's. Maybe I should have gone with something more fancy.  You should definitely treat yoursefl as you so deserve it.  libraryjenn - Congrats on going back to work. I think that will be good for you. I was definitely fortunate to be able to work throughout my treatment and I feel like it helped me push forward and not allow myself to think about what was happening to me. Count me in with the HER2 group. I'll be having herceptin until the end of May. Leanna - I asked my MO about follow blood tests, etc. and she printed out the guidelines showing that you don't do that for Stage 1. I know that's not your stage so I would push for whatever tests you feel will put you at ease. I guess the issue is that if they test for stuff and there is anything that is the least bit suspicious they have to do follow ups and that could be stressful too so they prefer to wait until you present with symptoms. Crazy, I know. magda - love the picture. Glad you decided to post it. sacphoto - how fun about looking for venues for your daughter. ENJOY!! LauraM - I am so sorry to hear about your friend. That is awful news so it's no surprise you are thinking about recurrence. Daiva - that is an incredible and uplifting story. Thanks for sharing. How exciting that you are intimately involved in this. Yay for Emma. Happy Birthday Patricia and welcome back!! So I finally got my approval from the board to go forward with the renovations. This is going to be soooo much work. I'm not really nervous - just excited to get started. I've been busy at work but not too bad. I have tomorrow off for the first time ever (22+ years of working) because we got acquired by a new company and they give off for President's Day. I may be doing a news segment on those cold caps next week. If it materializes I'll let you know but I think it may just be a local news segment.

As you can see, my best friend took over my computer and posted last night. My family was great yesterday (day 1 of TCx4) and I'm happy to say that I'm feeling just fine. I know it may still be too early to tell as I go for my neulasta shot later today. The only advice I can give so far, just like everyone else says, is to drink a lot of water. I started my water routine 3 days before treatment. I made sure I had 8 glasses that day and the next and then stepped it up to 10 the day before and 11 the day of (plus they give you some hydration in the drip). They also gave me all the premeds beforehand - aloxi, benedryl, pepcid and the steriod. I also ate a little bit throughout the day. Then I took anti neasea when I got home. The craziest part of the whole day for me was definitely the cold caps. It was kind of hard but for the most part went smoothly. I also put my fingers and toes in frozen peas to help with nails and neuropathy - I did that during the Taxotere part (and a little before and after). I did nothing for my brows so I guess I'll have to deal with them someone.  nanaof2 - I'm glad you're feeling good as well. This group is fantastic! sunflower - great to finally hear from you. I'm glad you're doing well now. I'm sure next time they will give you benedryl up front. njbwhgirl and redbarb, mcshusi, and leanna - thinking about you and praying it all goes smoothly for you today/tomorrow!!",

CTherese - I love your posts and so happy to see how well you are doing. That was amazing for KristyAnn to share with us. I don't know what I would do without this site. I would say by day 7 I was feeling totally like myself with very little side effects before that. Now I'm on day 12 and still feeling good so I'm hoping the same for you. I'm very grateful and hoping it stays this way. GolferGirl - welcome back. I think being busy at work is definitely a good thing. Makes you feel totally normal. I made it through the whole week of work no problem (days 7 - 11). faithfulc - thanks for stopping by! Have a good weekend everyone!",

I hope you will be able to get a good night's sleep tonight after all that baseball and I hope your kids had fun!",

My rad onc suggested I take vacation bewteen chemo and rads and the PR trip just happened to work out. Good luck to all of you starting your new chemo drug this week!

      "Content": "Aug 12, 2010 06:00AM - edited Aug 12, 2010 06:03AM by Drim Hi May Sisters!!! I'm back from Puerto Rico. I've been back for a couple of days but have been so busy ever since I got back that I haven't had time to read all the posts until now. I missed everyone but had a great time in PR. I started rads on Tuesday (got back from PR monday night). It's definitely too early to tell how I'm doing but really it's no big deal. About the tattoos, mine aren't as small as GG's but I have so many freckles (really sun damage) all over the place that I figured the tats would blend in. I was going to pull the Jewish card too but then decided not to be a rebel and just go for it. Maybe they will fade over time. Funny story...After a long day of traveling back from PR I was happy to grab my bag and head home. I finally got home ($60 cab ride) and realized I had taken the WRONG BAG! It was the exact same as mine and unusual so I couldn't believe it. So back to the airport I went. Can't blame that on anything but me! LauraM - congrats and good luck with your last chemo tomorrow!! YAY!! Leanna - I hope you're doing okay. That FB story was nuts. Don't people realize that if they post on FB everyone can see what they are doing. That's why I rarely post anything on there. The MRI story was every crazier. Good thing you are on the ball. RedBarb - How exciting about Extreme Home Makeover. I really never watch the show but once they did a makeover around the corner from me (I live in Manhattan so the makeover was to an apt. so it was nothing like your experience). I always wanted to do habitat for humanity. Sounds like you had a blast and I'll be looking out for you. Day - good luck with your ALND. Your hair stories are really funny. With regard to hair, so far so good with the eyelashes. They are all there. I have a few of old eyebrow hair still intact and a bunch of new growth but without eyebrow pencil it looks very light. I'm happy I still have no armpit hair but I totally have to shave my legs although not nearly as often. No sign of hair down there at all. I better get to bed now. Have to wake up nice and early to get to rads on time.",

Daiva - rotated TE - oh my! But how fun is Vegas!! Jean - what a great idea to have everyone post updates! Okay, here is mine.... I finished chemo on 7/13, finished rads on 9/24, my company got acquired on 9/30, had my first day off in 3 weeks on 10/2, got my hair colored on 10/3 (very very happy with the results as it's made my hair feel back to normal - just a tad thinner), started tamox on 10/11 (i.e. 2 days ago). I will be on herceptin until the end of May 2011 but I'm not getting any side effects thank goodness. As usual I have to echo a lot of what Beth is saying. I feel really tired and moody but not sure if it's all of the work, the chemopause, the rads (can't really be the tamox yet). I am also feeling 'fat' although I'm really not fat - just feel kind of uncomfortable. I haven't even made an effort to loose weight but I do feel like I'm trying to eat a little healthier and my appetite seems pretty much back to normal. I'm going to start going back to dance class (jazz) in a couple of weeks now that I'm back in a real bra. The naturopath does sound amazing. None of my places offer that so I need to find one on my own (Beth, thanks for all the info). Oh yeah - got reading glass last week (I've always had great eye sight but I'm 44 now so I guess that had to happen sometimes). Jean - sending you hugs that you can keep up with your mom. It must be hard. Can't wait to meet all of you!!!! Ditah (Drim)",

I wonder if my period is now around the corner as the 2 of us are traveling down such a similar path. Good luck with your color. I used 'organic' but who knows what that really means. I know it has no ammonia or parabens. Daiva....my parents are Hungarian but my mom lived in Israel for several years before I was born so although my name is not Israeli, the inspiration came from Israel. I guess I hesitated to post it because it is so unusual that it makes me easily identifiable and there are so many people I have not told about this. I just need to get over that. If people find out I guess it's fine. I just hate to be the topic of gossip. I know most people would not gossip about such things but there are always those few who do. Guess those are the types of people I don't need to associate with. Leanna....if I don't get on here before Wednesday I want to let you know that my thoughts will be with you for your sugery which I know will go really well. I'm sure you will be so happy to get past this next hurdle. Hope you're enjoying your very busy day. I'm doing the Making Strides walk tomorrow. I've been doing that for over 10 years. Can't believe I'm going to be a survivor this year. It's been 3 weeks since last radiation and the area seems to be clearing up nicely. I have some brown spots (think sunburn that turned dark that peeled but there is still some dark skin left over). I've now been on tamox for 6 days and don't feel a thing. I'm actually a little worried that I have not had hot flashes in almost a month. I'm worried that estrogen is fueling other cancer cells (which I'm really hoping do not exist). I'll give it a little while longer. I see my onc in a couple of weeks for my next herceptin and I'm sure we'll assess the situation at that time. On the suggestion of others on these board I had a trasvaginal ultrasound. The gyn called me with the results and said something like - 'it's amazingly perfect'. Sounded a little funny to me - but at least funny in a good way. I guess they don't normally do these things unless there is some kind of complaint. Have a nice weekend everyone....I'm gearing up for Game 2 of the ALCS - Yanks vs. Rangers. Last night's game was amazing. Yanks were down 5-1 in the 8th and scored 5 runs and ended up winning the game which ended at 1am. Very exciting!",

I didn't have this at all until I got my mammo sometime around the end of October (surgery was also 10 mo. ago). It doesn't hurt - it's just sore and same thing with the SNB site - it doesn't hurt, it just feels tight if I really stretch it a lot (like try to pull my arm up and back. I haven't mentioned this to any of my doctors. I wasn't really worried about it - more just wondering how the healing process works. Maybe some nerves regenerated and we are having more feeling in the area. Hopefully this is totally normal.",

I'm sending you hugs as well. Yes, definitely getthat lump checked out - if just for peace of mind. I can't believe it will be May 2011 on Sunday. What a year. I have been out of my apt. for over a month during these renovations and I've been staying with my parents. It's actually been pretty good. Everything is wonderful except for the commute which is 1hr. instead of 15 min. I'm truly blessed to have such great parents thought. They are doing everything to make me feel comfortable.
