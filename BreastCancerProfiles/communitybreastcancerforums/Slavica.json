      "Content": "Slavica wrote: I should be used to this by now. I am 43, have very large, very dense fibrocystic breasts. My mom had DCIS at 34, her cousin died of the BC she developed before menopause. I get screened every year. Every other year, it's an MRI, and in the intervening years, it's a mammo and U/S. Today was the mammo and U/S day. The doctor said my breasts are very dense and mammography is not very informative, but that they saw \"many calcifications\". On U/S, the right side was not worrisome, but the left side, where I already had a core biopsy for a large lump while breastfeeding 9 years ago (fibrocystic changes), had many more calcifications than the right and also a large non-homogenous area on U/S. The doctor said he'd compare it with my MRI from last year and said it's very hard for them to evaluate my breasts by any modality. Then asked me how I deal with MRIs and whether I already have a followup appointment with my gynecologist. From his comments, I'm wondering whether I'll have another MRI pronto and/or a biopsy. The thing is, I am in perimenopause and my left breast has started hurting in the last two months of so, sharp, stabbing pain unrelated to my period. I did not mention it because I know it's neither here nor there and many doctors still say that if it hurts, it's not breast cancer. No new lumps that I can feel, but that breast is so full of lumps and \"rafts\", for lack of a better word, that it's hard to know whether any new ones are there. No nipple changes, no discharge. I am a bit freaked out, but I have to wait for the report, of course. Thank you for reading, if you got this far. Log in to post a reply",

If you do end up being one of the first to have it in your hospital, I'd be curious to hear your experiences with it. The blazing white mammo pictures look scary and are not very informative for those of us with dense breasts, I'm glad to hear newer additional methods are being developed.",

I know breast cancer can hurt, I have read many stories on these boards... my mother got diagnosed because her lesion started hurting and she insisted on a biopsy. The fact that it hurts cannot exclude a malignancy. Of course, what bugs me is the uncertainty and waiting. Luckily I have a very interested gynecologist, I'm in a country with good health care and insurance (Switzerland), and I am a geneticist, so at least I know how to read the literature if I need to.",
