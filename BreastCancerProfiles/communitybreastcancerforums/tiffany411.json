      "Content": "tiffany411 wrote: My story is a little long I am 32 right now at the moment. Back in 2009 I noticed I had a lump in my right breast at 12:00 position close to the nipple. I thought nothing of it so I went on with it there for 2 years finally in 2011 I noticed it had gotten bigger so I decided to schedule me an appointment I went in and the Dr found another lump at 5:00 position they sent me for mammogram and ultrasound in 2011. Results came back I had irregular complex cystic mass at 12:00 and 5:00 positions and what appeared to be a b9 internal lymph node at 9:00 position all representing minimal vascular flow . Follow up 3 to 6 months. This  continues over the next few years with 3-6 month follow ups. In November 2013 I noticed my lymph nodes under my arm were swollen so I once again call my Dr they bring me in check it and send me for mammogram and ultrasound and by then the radiologist department switched me to another radiologist instead of the one I had always seen. They do not have it anywhere that they have scanned my lymph nodes nor have them visual on any mammogram. I had another ultrasound on May 2, 2014 the last 2 reports have said indeterminate with internal septae more blood flow is shown with in the pictures now and the size has gotten bigger. The reports also state I have dense breast which could obscure cancerous lesions. The radiologist and my Dr both has refused to let me have a biopsy. I was sent for aspiration of the \"cystic mass\" and no fluid was obtained. I must mention during all this time my WBC count is always high high monocytes  lymphocytes high MCV and mch. I have night sweats very often more then twice a week have had them for years now. I have felt increasingly weak and barely able to hold my own body up at times. I have felt like that since October of 2013. I feel feverish a lot but when I check my temp its normal. The veins in my right breast have widened. Some even look like new veins. There are more veins in my right breast verses my left. Sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy. I don't feel like I can trust theses drs here. This is why when I went in for ultrasound in November I told the tech scanning me my lymph nodes were swelled up she did scan it 2 big roundish jagged objects showed up  when she did the color on it the whole thing was red. When she was done the radiologist came in said he recommends I get an MRI to make sure nothing was missed that couldn't be picked up on ultrasound. I asked him about my lymph nodes he said the one internal lymph node appeared fine I said no the ones in my arm the axilla lymph nodes and I told him to feel them and he reached down felt my lump at 12:00 and said its fine. I said no not that spot he never would touch my lymph nodes. I told him I seen her take the pics of it she held her head down and didn't say anything and he told me to get dressed. When I picked up copies of the pics they were not on there and 3 mins of pictures were missing there was a 3 min gap between pics and that was of my lymph nodes thats why technically there is no pics of them. This is why I feel like I'm going crazy but I know what I seen. I'm wondering if they made a mistake years ago and now trying to cover it up. I'm going this Friday to an actual breast doctor out of this town. I hope I can get some real answers. Any one else experience this or any of the symptoms I have? Log in to post a reply",

When I finally got them to do an ultrasound of my lymph nodes the results were abnormal with cortical thickening. So from there I was sent to an oncologist for lymphoma and leukemia testing which was all fine. It's only the lymph nodes on my right side anyway the breast with the lumps but yet I was still sent really pointless too. I have tried like crazy to not stress on my whole breast situation but it's hard not to especially after so many years. I mean 6 years and no biopsy. Even if it's not cancerous don't you think they would at least rule it out after 6 years of appointments? So it's been a few years since I've been on here but all this is really weighing on my mind again. My last appointment for follow up mammogram and ultrasound was in June. Sometimes I just want to stop going altogether that's why I'm always a few months late getting in for the appointments, because I dread them. I just want them to rip it all out but I can't even talk anyone into a biopsy or aspiration so there will be no luck with that. I'm stuck guess it needs to be followed according to them but at a certain point enough is enough and if it's still there do something. I get a weird feeling that someone has messed up real bad with all of my stuff and that's why I always get the run around!",

The only program that was offered to me was the breast cancer screening program. Which has paid for all the mammograms and ultrasounds for the last 6 years. Sometimes they have recommended ultrasounds yearly and sometimes it's been every 3-6 months. Mammograms are only yearly though and bilateral every other year! That is always in the radiologist reports. They have all these rules to the program not sure what they all are though. Even though I had a report from the radiologist recommending a breast MRI the local health department who runs the program turned me down due to my age according to their rules. It also took me about 6 months to talk them into looking at my lymph nodes on ultrasound they said no it's breast only! I kinda thought that was part of scanning the breast but what do I know right. Then the Dr at the health department asked me if I had a fear of cancer or something. I said no I don't fear cancer I fear not knowing, I fear being left in the dark for many years and not really knowing a definite answer of anything, I fear that if something is wrong by the time they decide to let me have a biopsy we waisted years of following these dumb lumps! 6 years of waiting and watching... I never heard no bull like that before! I have many other health things that have increasingly gotten worse over the years too. I'm sorry I'm sure the last thing you wanted to hear was someone rambling on about stuff they technically have no diagnosis on. Thank you so much for taking your time to be compassionate, listen to my rants and give me a little direction and guidance.",

Therefore my only way of being seen is by my local health department who sends me through their program. Considering I'm in the bi rads 3 rating and have been everytime with words like indeterminate breast nodules and dense breast that can obscure an underlying malignancy and patient will benefit from breast MRI that's what is keeping me having to follow up. The town I live in don't do breast MRI and the program won't pay for it until I reach a certain age. Should I start demanding better from the health department here? I also had them give me copies of all the doctor's notes on each visits I went to there. I just don't know what to do anymore just stay at a bi rads 3 and do nothing like I have for 6 years or just say screw all of it and just not go back at all, or push and fight harder for fair treatment.",

      "Content": "tiffany411 wrote: sorry this is so long! really no way to shorten it. In 2009 I found a lump in my right breast at 12 o'clock right on the nipple. I didn't go have it checked until 2 years later I figured it would go away. Well 2 years was long enough to wait so finally I went in because it never went away. That was in 2011 since then I have had yearly mammogram and ultrasound. Ultrasound sometimes twice a year. They have never biopsy the areas. By 2012 i had spots at 5 o'clock and 9 o'clock plus the one at 12 o'clock still all close to my nipple. All reports have said they are complex mostly cystic masses. In the 9 o'clock they said it appeared to be a lymph node. The latest report said the 5 o'clock may also now represent a lymph node. All spots demonstrate internal vascularity at the septa according to reports. My lymph nodes in my armpit were abnormal with mild cortical thickening in 2013. There is a spot they have never had images of even though I have asked them to get them. The location is about 9 o'clock but out farther from the nipple right beneath the auxiliary nodes down the side of my rib cage. This area bulged out in 2013 and it has not went down since. But for some reason no one will ultrasound that spot. I even place markers on my skin before my mammogram but they yanked and pulled my breast around so much that the marker wasn't even in the original spot that I placed it. Sometimes I feel like saying screw it and then I can't do that because I mean hello something is there and has been for years now. Just can't get them to biopsy it. Like really why not it's mine and if I want it poked I should not be refused. I must mention my nipple is a darker color more like a purple on the side with the lumps which happened around 2012. Also I have dark green blackish discharge from it which happened in 2015. My veins in that breast are odd I have a blue Vien about a 1/4 inch thick all the way around my nipple. And a very small one extending from that on to the nipple it self. 2 large veins leading off the one surrounding the nipple. one extending to under my arm and the other extending across to my other breast as it gets lighter as it goes toward the left breast. The veins appeared maybe around 2014 ish. I am 35 years old I have had 2 kids. I have never breast fed. I had a tubal in 2006 so I am not on any birth control. I also had a nova sure which is laser surgery to stop periods. So I have not had one since 2006. Also when I had my last son in 2006 I never leaked milk from my right breast only my left one. Also I must mention that in 2000 a hard lump was found in my breast by a nurse who sent me for an ultrasound and it revealed that it was a solid with vascularity believed to be a fibromedema but could not rule out cancer. I had actually forgotten all about having to go in 2000 until I was getting copies of all reports of any breast imaging and that one happened to be in there. Recommendation on 2000 imaging was to follow the lump with at least physical exams. However I was never told of any of that. I guess my question is does any of this sound like it should have been put off for 6 years? Do you think it's something I should worry about? Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this? Should I stay on them about it? How can a breast all of a sudden get lymph nodes in them if they weren't there to begin with? Also if they changed their mind from masses to now lymph nodes on two spots should I worry about that? Because it kinda sounds like they don't know what they are talking about? Also if I had a solid lump in 2000 where would it have gone? Can a solid just go away on their own later on? I feel like I'm not getting proper care. Sorry for all the questions I'm just so sick of all the follow ups to hear them say the same crap. Why do they still want to follow it if it's nothing to worry about? Just biopsy it already and that will make me feel better and probably them and their dumb follow ups. It's so frustrating. Log in to post a reply",
