Took the anesthesiologist a half hour to get one in my for mastectomy and she said that was her last needle try and if she didn't get it, she was going to shunt me just for surgery.

When I was getting my licoaine IV infusion, he brought it up again. He said it may help LE. I don't know if he meant the pain of it, or if it helps the swelling. I didn't have time to go into much detail because he has too many patients to treat on procedure days. Has anyone heard of this for LE? Medicare pays for the lidocain, but they won't pay the $440 for the procedure to put it in me. They tell me they pay for the spinal stimulator for pain though. I am not thrilled of having a wire in me for three days to test it to see if I can handle the tingles it sends out to mask the pain. Even less thrilled that I have to treat myself like after my BMX -no lifting more than a gallon of milk, no raising arms above the head,etc etc. Then if it works, they put the one that stays in (the nurse said scar tissue forms around the wire to hold it in place...another thing that is NOT appealing). Batteries last about 5- 10 years I think she said. Log in to post a reply",

Only three sentinel lymph nodes were taken out on the left. I have severe post mastectomy pain syndrome/neuropathy which is worse on the right. My surgeon poo-pooed the idea of me taking lymphedema precautions because in her words, it was only the sentinel lymph nodes removed, but according to the path. report, it was actually axillary nodes (Since then , I now refuse all bps and needle pricks on my arms). Could this explain my worse symptoms on the right and should this make me more cautious of lymphedema developing as opposed to only having the sentinel nodes removed?My surgeon has long been fired for other reasons and I have no oncologist so I really don't have a dr. to ask.

I went to the local mastectomy boutique for two sleeves and two gloves with fingers. I TOLD them how my fingers swell. Well they gave me half finger gloves. So now when I wear the damn things my exposed fingers get cold and swollen. Now I learn that Juzo makes gloves with longer finger portions. Why is my job to make sure all these people do THEIR jobs.I AM NOT the expert!! They are!! They are supposed to be certified fitters. Certified my ass. They charged me $150 per glove!!! I found them much cheaper on the internet! I got the bill. I CAN NOT BELIEVE IT. THEY TOLD ME EACH SLEEVE WAS $62 AND EACH GLOVE WAS $82. THE BILL SAYS $150 PER FUCKING GLOVE THAT IS THE WRONG KIND AND $105 PER FUCKING SLEEVE. BIG DISCREPANCY IN PRICING HERE. Friday I found out that there was ANOTHER  huge mistake made on my medicaid decductible plan for WI. First I had to go over every single damn line with the agent cuz she can't read and count the amounts in the patient responsibility portion of the itmeized bills I submitted. Now I get a call that they made a fucking $500 error!!! I need another $500 in medical bills before they will start to pay. I only make $960 a month and had I known that, I wouldnt have borrowed fucking $1600 to get my damn car fixed. I just can not fucking win. SO many drs, nurses, therapists have fucked up with me. I can not take anymore. The horrible care I am receiving is far worse than the cancer and surgeries themselves. Update: The gal who sent met the bill wrote down the wrong information regarding MY cost for the sleeves. I wil get the cheaper price they originally quoated me. AND I HAVE BETTER NEWS.....They must have felt bad for me for the predicament and stress I have been in. Evidently there is a group of women who do fundraising for women who have had a single or double mastectomy and need monetary help getting the products they can't afford. I was one of the women chosen to receive help. It is so hard not react so negatively for me in the first place, and seems like everything about cancer is so damn complicated and there is so much crap besides the cancer itself, treatments, and side effects. Luckily, I had you guys to unload on and I didn't go crazy bitch all over the ladies at the store. On last Tuesday night, I started cyring in the shower, cried through the house and went to bed hysterically crying. My brain doesn't work right to begin with cuz of benign lesions on it, anxiety, and all the stupid meds I am on. I really felt like I was having another nervous breakdown and pretty sure I did. Even my partner, Brian, was worried. One problem down....Now I have a call into the Medicaid supervisor to discuss the major mistakes being made with my account. I am so mad at stupid cancer.

Today during my pre-op appt. with my family dr. she said she was worried about my high blood pressure. Its been taken in the leg and is higher, of course, and especially when I haven't laid down for a bit before they take it. I tried that logic with her, but she is concerned enough that she wants to put me high blood medication medicine. Just what I wanted, another stupid health problem. I know part of is my weight, since I found cancer I have gained about 25 lbs which I really don't need since technically I am considered obese anyway. Cuz of all the stupid meds I am on and neurological dysfunction, I don't drive, so getting to the YMCA is hard. When my stupid PMPS is acting up, I don't like walking cuz it hurts the arms and back and chest. So I do light activites, sit, eat, do an activity, eat. Things are so hard right now. Very rarely do I whine like this. But what else is gonna happen?? When I am healed after the hysterectomy, i am seeing a neurologist for my memory/concentration/verbal/neuromuscular problems and the undiagnosed brain lesions I have had sitting there since 2007 and were still there last fall when I had a nother MRI. After my mastectomy, I had no idea that the amount of pain I was in was not normal. It took me until a call to the ACS to find out about PMPS. Im so sick of drs, tests, being sick. Plus I am  biploar with severe depression, anxiety and agoraphobia. Isn't that enough?? Thanks for letting me whine, I really don't have anyone I can let it all out like this to.

I realize that it takes 6 months to a year to heal up after this type of surgery and that it is an extremely painful surgery to have. BUT. I have a flapping feeling when I inhale and exhale when breathing when I am laying down, laying back in my recliner, on all fours (like in the garden), or certain other positions. I never feel it when I am sitting up or standing. I tried to explain this to the cardiothoracic surgeon at my post op visit but I couldn't get the right words to explain so he could understand. About 6 weeks ago, I saw the younger surgeon physician assistant for this problem and a new pain. He said he never heard a patient complain of a flapping feeling. But he did say the increased pain is probably from increased activity. He had me get an x-ray and of course the x-ray was fine. He said come back in 4-6 weeks. In the meantime, my pulmonologist had a CT scan ordered and I saw him for a follow up. Everything looked good. I saw the older physician's assistant last month. He, like the other PA, told me he never heard a patient complain of flapping when inhaling and exhaling. He wanted to see my scar, so I lifted up my shirt. Then he placed his hand on the rib cage and had me breathe deep. He told me that I have a rib moving. I didn't feel the flapping when he did that. He said it was normal because the surgeon had to cut the rib and cartilage to get at the mass. The surgeon came in and told me the same. I am not sure about them saying it is normal because neither one of the PA's had ever heard a patient complain about it. The surgeon let me go and told me that if the flapping doesn't go away, then we need to find plan B. Has anyone had a thoracotomy (not the VATS) and had a feeling of flapping like that? Thanks.

The next step would be putting some kind of spinal stimulator on the outside of the skin for three days to see how it works. It would make the nerves that were damaged tingle, masking out the pain.,If it worked for me, the next step would be to surgically plant one in my spine. I would have some sort of mechanism that I could use to turn it on. He forgot to give the DVD to watch, so that is about all I can remember. He sure knows patients, though, because he knew I wouldn't remember everything he said when I got home. I am very nervous about that. One, because I don't know much more than what I have told you guys and two, its another surgery and to the spine. If the stimulator doesn't work, then I live with just medications I think he said. It is scarey and disappointing time right now regarding my pmps. Log in to post a reply",

I get blazed orange wristbands to wear for limb restrictions. At first, a few would forget to check my wristbands and I would have to remind them. Now they pretty much all rememeber. When they saw what I had written on my arm, I had instructions for Left and right, I was ridiculed, made fun of, snickered at,argued that THEY would never do BPs or needle sticks on arms, and looked at like I was a freak of nature. I was highly disappointed. That staff needs some training on LE (I posted a few days ago that one nurse was telling me it would just be a SMALL needle put in the arm and I replied it is not the size of the needle that can cause an LE flare up...that a mosquito bite could do it). AND I think they need some senistivity training towards people with LE.  Cripes, most of the time, we can't get our OWN doctors and nurses to repsect and know about LE, so I understand how they don't \"get it.\" So they would have no idea what we got through to protect ourselves. HOWEVER, I deserve respect no matter what I have written on my arms. I learned the hard way, doctors will do what they want once I am totally out and under and on their table. I went in feeling confident, more assured, with that written on my arms. I came out feeling like a freak and bulllied. I will be writing the head of the unit a letter. And the nasty nurse I had problems with in the past and reported her, will no longer be able to work my case. PS....I used a Sharpie to write on my arms before we left. I got home and the ink came off with a washcloth and water.But the washcloth came out with stains. Log in to post a reply",

I was discussing with the nurse in detail (I am now armed with more information since the last appendectomy in Feb and IVS). I told her that I want written in their surgical ink NO NEEDLE OR BP ON THIS ARM. On the left I want written IV in hand only in emergency. She said, oh we have blaze orange wrist band we put on you. I said some times those are overlooked. I know for a fact that the nursing staff does not regularly look at the blaze orange bands because I have been going to this clinic for two years now, and I STILL have to remind staff that I have blaze orange bands on and there are NO blood pressures in my arms.(And how would they know that left hand only in emergencies? Like the last surgeon who was a jerk, just picked a hand and happened to pick the arm with the most problems) Then she argued with me that she has only done one foot IV in xy many years. She said the risks are too high with blood clots and phelbitis. (I am at high risk for blood clots and I have diabetes). I didn't tell her about those two issues. Then the nurse said, But we will only use a little needle. I informed her it doesn't matter about the size of the needle, it is the poke. I told her people can LE from a mosquito bite. So, it is up in the air on what to do on Monday.My pain doctor SUCKS at putting in foot IVS. Even when I am well hydrated, it takes him 2-4 pokes to start one and that clinic doesn't use a small lidocaine injection to the foot to numb the area. They tried a useless cream (and then the pain dr didn't put the IV in where he told them to put the cream). What do all the rest of you do with bilateral LE and foot IVs, and have  your surgical team argued with you?  Are there any out there prone to blood clots and/or have diabetes and bilateral LE? What do you do? Log in to post a reply",

It also uses very little blood which is great because sometimes I can't get a lot of blood out of the thigh area. She also recommended that I not take samples too close to the knee. I write this just in case someone else can't poke the fingers or the palm on either hand and has diabetes. Log in to post a reply",
