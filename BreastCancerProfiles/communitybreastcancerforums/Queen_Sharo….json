My thanks goes out to your Husband and Son for their service to our country and also to you for being the support behind the scenes. I feel that Military families do not get enough credit for all the sacrifices they make. It is those who are left behind to hold down the fort and keep things together while we are gone who deserve all the credit in the world. I am thankful that your son has not seen combat. I compare going to war with childbirth. You cannot imagine how it feels and it is hard to describe to someone who has not gone through it. I have been trying all day to get in contact with this VA lady who is the coordinator of my care. It has been an exercise in futility. She does not answer the phone. And in the past, when she does answer the phone, she is scatter brained. I know she is overworked due to the fact that someone in her office is out and she is doing twice the work. I know this is just the administrative part but if they cannot coordinate such simple tasks as appointment scheduling and referals, how can I trust that they are capable of more important details of my treatment and my overall healthcare? I'm just venting. Thanks for listening. I guess at this point my concern is the cancer growing and spreading, as you stated. I know what I need to do is get busy and stop letting these frustrations get the best of me. I'm off to clean my house and make better use of my time. Thanks for listening. I know there are women here with bigger and more serious issues so I will shut up and stop complaining.",

Good morning Grandma, I'm sorry for your anxiety. But feel free to PM me if you need to talk. I am like you as far as trying to remain positive and strong on the outside. But I have always been one to stuff the things that bother me until they build up and boil over. Basically, that is what Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is. And that is what I have due to my military service and the events of Desert Shield/Desert Storm. My brother found out in May that he had breast cancer. No it is not hereditary. But he had surgery to remove it within a few days of his DX. And he asks me why my doc is taking so long to get this thing out. Do you feel like this is taking forever? I was diagnosed about a week before you and I have yet to see anyone to discuss my treatment plan. Because I am a Disabled Veteran, I normally use the VA healthcare system. But they really seem to be dragging their feet on every aspect of this situation. Of course I was taking tests and that was part of the hold up. I am really considering going to MD Anderson to get it done right after my company insurance kicks in, in Jan. Hell that's only 11 days away. And the VA seems to be taking too much of a lackadaisical approach to my healthcare. I was waiting for an appointment to see a surgeon to get a treatment plan. After giving them a week, I finally called today and they have not received a referral from the VA. Sorry to be ranting like this but I guess the damn blew before I knew what happened.",

Waiting is so hard! I am having a hard time sleeping. And then when my alarm goes off I bang on the snooze like a drum, over and over. My doc told me to try melotonin. I'll let you know how it works.

I woke up about an 30 minutes before my alarm went off and had a lot of energy today at work. I also take Trazodone sometimes, a scrip from my doc. But it leaves me not wanting to get out of bed. And I'm always afraid I am going to over sleep. As far as genetic testing, my doc suggested it as soon as I told her that my brother had BC a few months ago in May. I do have a few other relatives who have other types of cancer as well. Had my brother not traveled this road recently and is doing great, I would be a basket case and freaking out BIG TIME! It never hurts to ask your doc about testing. Hello SVG, My bro had BC in May. He had genetic testing, not sure what kind he had or I had. His was negative. But the docs just wanted to make sure and had me tested. My sisters have not had testing. But they all recently had negative mammograms. Hope everyone if feeling well today. Take Care! :) ",

Whether you believe in prayer or not, I am praying for all of us travelling down this road to recovery. To those of you who are in pain and/or having a bad day, know that I am thinking of you and sending positive vibes of healing out into the universe especially for you. I wish you peace for one moment at a time and every minute until this day is through. And you can best believe that I wish you the same tomorrow! Grandma, just wanted to update you on the Melotonin. I have been having minor stomach cramps for the past few days. The only thing I can think of that I've been doing different is taking the Melotonin. I did some research online and found out that stomach cramping is just one of the many side effects. In addition, I also found out that the 10 mg recommended on the bottle, is way too much according to many websites I visited. \"The correct dosage for melotonin for it to be effective is 0.3-1.0 mg.\" With all we are currently going through and will go through, none of us need additional side effects and added pain. BTW, melotonin was recommended to me by my doc. Good luck with your sleepless nights..",
