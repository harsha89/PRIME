I'm fairly new here, and like you, I'm also wrestling with the lumpectomy vs. Mastectomy issue.  It's the hardest decision I've ever had to make.  I haven't posted much myself, but I have combed through the boards and the ladies here all are wonderfully encouraging.  Wishing you all the best, Lei ",

But I would think, based on my experience that you are probably looking at Ultrasound, perhaps MRI and most likely a needle biopsy on the lumps.  Needle, or core biopsys only require a local, or at least mine did.  After the inital shot for pain all I felt was pressure. I went home with a bandaid and was sore afterwards, but it wasn't too bad really. As for your partner being allowed in? Well, I wouldn't think it would be a problem with anything except maybe the mri--- I was in the room alone with the machine during my breast MRI.  Hope this helps some! ",

I'm anxious about getting it inserted, since I was told I'd just be getting a local... I am only doing 4 tx of A/C, and my Onco wanted to spare me another scar.  Not to mention being knocked out again.  Anyone with any words of wisdom would be appreciated!

Now that I think about it,  I bet that 'Press'N Seal' wrap would work even better than regular Saran does. I don't know about having a home nurse out to flush it.  I will be going to town every week anyway to get my fills. I might could just stop by the C. center and have them do it on my non-treatment week.  Anyway, nothing has been mentioned to me about it yet.  Perhaps they'll wait and tell me all that when I get it put in.   I'm having my first chemo right after I get my line... I guess focusing on the picc line is helping me keep my mind off the A/C. God bless and best of luck! Tanz",
