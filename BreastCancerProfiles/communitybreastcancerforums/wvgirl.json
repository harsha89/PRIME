Well its only been twice but he has went out and stayed out. This first time he did have the since to have someone bring him home and did not drive. That Sun. Morning I went to get my car to drive him to pick up his truck. My tire was flat. When I went to put air in it it was coming out as fast. I found a hole about the size of my thumb. The DH laughed! I told him I did not think that was very funny and was not very nice. No I have to but 2 tires that I did not intended on. He still laughed ! Last Friday I wanted to go to a survivor picnic and told him about it. When I got home from work he was still in his work cloths. He said you are just in time to help clean the garage and laughed. Well I said you make it so F\"N miserable I don't even want to come home after work. He laughed I can't understand him. He does ask he how I am. I just tell him Fine. The love I had has turned to hate. Well the relay went great Saturday. All survivors was given a butterfly in an envelope. They read about and old Indian tradition. When you make a wish . wish it up on a butterfly. For they can not talk and will fly away with your wish to the sky.It was very emotional. There was a 40 year old survivor. They read each name and told how many years they were a surivor. I was the newbie Then we made our survivor lap. Then another for the caregivers my mom was there and walked with me. The DH did come later and walked 1 lap after the luminaries was lit. One lady came up and gave me a hug and said bless you. It was very emotional. The local Wal Mart donated 5,000.00 It was a great day. I called to make sure I was on the paper to have my MRI and MUGA Friday. Yes on the MUGA no on the MRI  The registration desk F-ed up. This is not the first time. I am so up set. I can not take much more between the problems at home the the new found lump and now this mix up with appointments I am ready to SCREAM!!. Carla",

Its been a rough time at work there are a lot of changes going on. I feel over looked for a job and wounder if this BC has any bearing on the changes. There last few says I was ready to drop after coming home  Really Tired part form chemo rest from stress.  I finally was able to get more than 4 hours sleep last night. Steroids are wearing off until NEXT time Kimberly I think I spoke to soon about SE's on day 5 I did have some bone pain. I am also taking the decadron the same way you are. I also have been feeling a little dizzy and jittery. D1 a drear friend who works at the American Cancer Society gave me a tip about hair loss. She said when your hair begins to start falling out to wear  a turban to bed. That way when you wake in the morning it will be all in 1 place and not over your bed. She aslo said it is a good idea to have at leat 2 wigs. You can get free wigs,turbans and bras at the ACS. That is wear I bought mine. Tonight on the way home from work I stopped by the Hospice thrift store. Must have been my lucky day I found several head scarfs. Dana, My prayers are with you and your family as you go through this rough time. Thanks to all on the tips for mouth sores. I was eating chicken strips yesterday for lunch and broke off a piece of a tooth around the feeling.y Called the dentist they told me when you are on chemo you need to do a daily  fluoride rinse. They are going to sell me a bottle of the fluoride treatment they use. I hope everyone is doing well in thier journey.",

I found it on half.com I am putting in an order. You can purchase used books at a fraction of the new price. The dd's have bought some of there collage books from this site also. Sista. So far I have not received any bills for port surgery, office visits or chemo. I just now received an EOB from dh's insurance company from my hemorrhoid surgery that I had to have in Oct. (right before bc dx) Funny story about that ...When I went to see midwife about the lump in breast.I had seen her when I had the rupture. She said Well they fixed your bottom end now they are gonna have to work in your top end. KathyL-Thank you for posting and sharing your pics. Another beautiful baldie and the little ones are soooo cute. SheShe Hope your tx went good Dana-Sounds like the insurance thing is working out for you gal. POP girl (power of pray) Carol-Like the pic of you R and R. Lord knows us gals deserve it. Keep an eye on the ins issues. I too have 2 insurances. dh employer has the working spouse rule. If your spouse works they have to have their ins as primary and use his as secondary. I always thought that was silly until now. I was told that what mine don't pay his will probably pick the rest up minus the co-pays and meeting his deductible. Good luck I pmd you too. Vettegal- You look great Love the hat it matches your shirt well Well better go for now gotta go get a load of laundry folded",

The dh met me and went in when they were sticking my port. He said I have to turn my head I can not watch this part. I was placed in a very small room with 2 other patients. I told the dh to go get something to eat and come back later. He did he brought me come baked chicken back. He had to sit in the hallway for about 45 minutes. He was able to talk to one of the gals in my room dh until she was finished. He was then able to come into my room. I meet gorgia's mom she is finished with her chemo and now doing rads. I was so glad to finally meet her. We went on about how wonderful our Onc is. Tina Lee Hope you got along well with the Neulast shot I have to go get mine tomorrow.

I'm still behind but will keep in touch better than I have been. DH was gone this weekend.Me and dd's had a great time. One did get a job at Camp Dawson (it is a small military base for the army reserve) it will be part time wile she is off from collage. Other dd has an interview for a part time tour guide with the collage. She is also taking 2 summer classes. Good news they will get some finical aid to help with next year. I am behind a week on my chemo. I will have my7th treatment this Friday then only 1 more to go. Onc said I will then see surgeon the find out when surgery will be. I know I will have to at least have to wait 3-4 weeks after last treatment. That will put me into July. Then rads will start. My company will have a team for the Relay for Life...I will be going to 2 relays. The first is for the county I work in the other is for the county I live in. For the county I live in I joined one of my best friend's. Her sister passed away 1 year ago of melanoma at the age of 43. Sis Kimberly you gave me some good advise awhile back. I am going to look into options. I have decided I would rather live penniless than miserable and lonely the rest of my life..Right now I need to take care of me and focus on the surgery and rads to come. I think he does not like to see me as I am now a Stronger Women Funny thing the time when my WBC count was down the doc ask me if anyone was sick in my home. I said yes my husband was. He said try to stay away from him..I laughed and said you don't have to worry about me catching anything from him.. We have't slept in the same bed in over 10 yrs. He did not know what to say..He was speechless. Take Care I have missed everyone...and the support also Carla  \" ",

Sorry I have been away for so long....I was so tried after working then getting rads(33) I would just come home a drop. I am so glad that part is over with. Co-workers have been GREAT 1/2 way through my rads they surprised me with a Relay For Life Blanket. The day of my last treatment. I come into work last after having treatment there was a cake,card with gift certificate to have a pedicure and all kind of food. The General Manager who by the way is a Retired Corneal in the Army told me I was his hero . Things on the home front...well well I had a talk with the husband AGAIN  told him I was not happy and he has managed to destroy bit by bit any love I had for him. Over the years with the verbal abuse.His first words was well we can get a divorce I told him I don't want the house he said he would give me 25 thou I said I am not stupid . I know this house would appraise for at least 100 thou. He said I could go live with my mommie. He said we were to old to start out on our own again he 50 I will be 47 next month. He then said he did not want to loose me I was pretty and a good women and he was sorry. I told him it might be too late. What bothers me is I think his first remark should have been He was sorry not that I could move in with my mommie. I am having a difficult time with this. He yelled and cursed the girls the other night over something really small and silly. They took me in there room and ask how I could have married such a man. I have started to look further into things..I found out you can go to the court house by packet of divorce papers for 150.00 and file for divorce go in front of a judge. It will be difficult finally for me..But if I have to I can get a 2nd job...I am taking my time I need to see what kind of medical bills will be coming and try to put a little bit of my pay back to have something to start out on.. Rent is so expensive and I also need to consider my girls even though they are of age will be 20. They are the best..never have had not even one problem with them. Good students Collage Sophomores this year..They would not want to stay here with him I am sure of that.. He did take us out to dinner last weekend..My gf said let him spend some money on you and the girls.. I had a great Sunday df(breast cancer survior)and I went to a Brest Cancer Survior lunch. My onc his staff and my surgeon were there. It reminded me how blessed and lucky I was to have them. Onc is director on onc surgeon is directior of surgery two of the best doctors in my state.\\ I tell my self if God brings it to you he will bring you thourgh it.... Take care sorry I vented so much and this is sooooo long... Carla",

I remember the day after my b day I went to have my biop done. I am going to get a tattoo to celebrate being a survivor if anyone wants to see it type in pattysartspot go to June 2008 almost at the bottom is a butterfly with the breast car ribbon  This has a lot of meaning during the Relay For Life all survivors are given a butterfly to release. The story is read about Indians believed If you desire for a wish to come true you must first capture a butterfly. Whisper your wish,since a butterfly can not make no sound it can not revel the wish to anyone but the Great Spirt who sees an hears all things.In gratitude for giving the butterfly its freedom the Great Spirt always grants the wish. According to legend by making a wish and giving the butterfly its freedom the wish will be taken to the heavens and granted Thank you all for your support. I did meet with an attorney last week found out what I need to do to begin the process.. Had a good day 2 day My Brother and I went out for breakfast and talked he has big shoulders He and I looked at a home for sale But I think my beast option is to wait untill spring save more money and not jump into things too fast. Hell it's been this long it will not hurt to wait for another 3-4 months. Paula Happy B Day this week Our leaves are almost all gone here. In Morgantown they are still hanging on. Last week we had Snow 2 days my Aunt lives in Terra Alta (Alpine Lake) she had to shovel snow ! Let me know when your coming I will take time off from work we can meet and celebrate our B-DAYS My surgeon told me when I am ready to have my port taken out she can do it in her office. I do not need to go into the hospital..I am kinda Leary about that. When she took out my drain it hurt like ****. I too have not had a period since Jan. My onc told me that I may or may not get it back since I am 43 I hope I don't. I still have hot flashes also. Julie loved the pic if the little girl I cut and pasted it and sent it in an e mail to friends I found a saying the other day that says: I am thankful for getting out of bed this morning And blessed for another day.

He proceeded to tell me his 2 sons age 24 and 25 still in college. One has no degree and on heroin and his girlfriend pregnant. He then said 4 years ago at this time was when his wife left him with the Baptist Preacher. Before she left she made sure to wipe out both bank accounts. He told me he has crippling arthritis and is mostly bound to a wheel chair. He said but you know what I make the best of things and there is always someone out there with worse problems. About the trip I would be willing to share a room with someone to cut down on cost. I am starting to SAVE some cash back. Told the dh I want to go he said if we could afford it. I told him I am going to save for it. I have never flown before I am excited!!! Take care as you can see not very busy at work I better go find some busy work... Talk soon Carla",

I can totally understand with the Police officer and why so many people showed up. I had a cousin who was a Firefighter he was 34 at the time. He was responding to a wreck that was just 1/2 from my home. It was a drunk driver. He was running back and forth setting up the landing zone for the helicopters to land. After the last of the 2 patients was transported the collapsed of a blockage in his heat. The weather was getting bad and the helicopter could not come back a tried time. The was so many police and firefighters that came to the funeral. And when we were at the grave site the helicopter flew over to pay there respect also. It was a touching moment . He was very much loved by so many. He donated his organs to CORE and has helped so many in need. Shot out to Peg, Deb, Paula, Vettegal and Pa Lady Have a restfull with few SE's from yesterday.",

I have a new wig I have been wearing and kinda unsure of. Well the customer ask if I had just had my hair done that she thought my hair style looked really nice. I thanked her and told her the truth. She could hardly believe it was a wig. I have a new outlook on the DH situation  I am concerting on ME and keeping myself well. The stress and depression is not good.  Why should I think things would change. It is lonely at times but I have a great Bro, you wonderful Sis's a few good friends for the support. I still have an appointment also in a couple weeks with the referral from my onc. Joteac-I have hear a little about Reiki from a lady who use to have migraines. She said since she has been having the Reiki done. She no longer suffers from migraines. Sorry you are having to deal with teeth problems on top of bc. PALady- My 3rd treatment was also the worst. I had a friend tell me. That when her dad was getting the Nuelasta shot the more shots he received the worse bone pain he had. My mouth and tongue like when you taste something hot how it burns your mouth. And the food thing everything taste bad. My onc told me the nuelasta shot cost more than he does (around 3,200.00) Paula- What a wonderful son you have to be so tough-full and caring. Be Proud as I know you are. CHJ- I like Paula have a busy Onc. 1 day Iwaited 3hrs to see him He did take his time with me He is wonderful and is always conerened  . Deb-My prayers are with you and your dp as her mother is not well. Hospice is a wonderful program. They were with my Aunt while she was suffering from bc. My m-in-law is a currant Hospice patient they are wonderful. JulieK-Happy Belated B DAY to you. Hope you feeling better. KathyL-Your potty traning back memories. I remember one time when twins dd's were wearing training pants they decided to use the bathroom # 2 in their closet what one didn't think of the other one did.

He said we will do a Ultrasound. I want to make sure that this is working. I also meet with Onc Consoler. He offered to give me eflixer (spelling?) He said it is harder to wean off of than other medications. I told him I would think about it and let him know at next visit. He did give me an option to give the dh. Things can get worse, stay the same  or get better I am only giving you 1 option. I am still crying but not as much. It's not than I am scared of the BC its the the feeling of loneliness. I pray for strength daily. Dear Brother called tonight I cried on his shoulder, Gottta love him. Trian Lee Best wishes for you Dana-Gotta B that's great. Hope you are resting When I was first taking the decradon I take 8mg night befor 8mg day of then for 2 days after morning and night I was also taking 8 mg. I could NOT Sleep. I told the onc about this. He reduced my days after to 4 mg am and pm and it helped. Di Sorry for the lousy day you had. Liked the story of the T Shirt My friend who just finished rads in Oct said that at WalMart they sell something called radial pads and they helped her alot when she was burned by the rad Carol- Well Well Well Maybe I am suppose to only receive 1 hug a month.Ha Ha He is withdrawn to the couch after dinner and remains there until the crack of dawn. He has at least decided to go with me tomorrow to my treatment. This will be his first treatment experience. I am the same way. I have been telling my gal pals to make sure you do your self breast exams along with your yearly mamo. And if you have dense breast ask for ultra sound. I spoke with a bc survivor her lump was the size of a golf ball and did not show on her mamo. I was talking with a friend this afternoon. She said when she had her mamo someone there told her if her mamo was clear she did not have to go back for 5 years! I told her they were crazy. She is over 40 I told her she better get going to get one. She said she has no health insurance. I told her that the midwife I go to can give her a yearly and and a momo for free. It is based you income. She is a single mother of 3 and only works part time. I hope she listens to me. Enough of the ranting onward KathyL-Ohh Power ball. I was just talking about that today at work with some co workers. I told them we should get a pool and buy a bunch. Then when we will we can plan on our trips. I told them I would go on a cruise to Alaska first. Then I would fly to Hawaii to thaw out. JulieK and Kimberly- You both are great. Teachers never get the praise and respect the deserve. She She-Good Reddens to your old center. Sounds like you made a great choice Paula Hope you have a great trip. I will get the information to you as soon as Shannon (Clinical trial nurse) e mails me with the information on the conference here in Morgantown. Vettegal-Hey there I  hope that you have been able to display your gifts so that you dumb PITA(pain in the a##) boss can see them. Maybe this will give him a wake up call and realize how lucky he is to have you as an employee.",

With Taotere my nurses told me it causes more achy bone pain. I will now be on the A/C . She said it will cause more gastro problems. The fogginess yes I do have it. Funny story I was loading the dish washer and noticed something different . It took me a couple minutes to notice that I had placed some writing pens in with the silverware. Oh Jeez! Vettgal-Sorry you had another reaction to the T. Sounds like they were well prepared for you.  KathyL- I still get my dd's a easter basket and they are 19. They will always be my little girls. I for got to mention I wore my FUBC shirt yesterday and the nurses told me they really liked it. I did not get to take a picture I was in a very small treatment room with 2 other gals. I did have dd take one of me befor I left for work. I will have to post if later today. I am off to buy a baby shower gift for a cousin. I hate it that I will not be able to go to the shower. Gotta go get my nasty shot . I called the charge nurse to ask if I could get it earlier. She advised me not to. I will have to have my mom take it for me.",

I wish I would have said that does not show much for his character.I told her I am not happy and emotional destroyed. She said so is my sister and I, I told her why should I stay. Oh listen to this. The other night dd's were at football game he was on couch I in chair he blurts out lets go have sex.(real charmer). I said no he said come on all you have to do is lay there you wont have to move. I told him I am having a hard time and don't feel that is the answer. I said you emotionally abandoned me when I needed you the most and the comments made to me had destroyed me inside.

I The girls said they do not want put in the middle I told them I would never ask then to pick a side. They still live at home and commute back and forth to collage. I told them they know there dad and I have not really gotten along for years now and why should I stay just because finacally it would be better. I told them I deserve to be happy. They just don't understand.Well enough of me venting...But I needed to let this out and no better place than here with my sisters..Don't know what I would do without you all.

The thoughts of thankfulness has been racing through my mind today. I am thankful for D1 for starting this and to each and everyone on my sister Jewels.I have learned to not be in a hurry and to laugh more, look at situations in a very different way than before. I sometimes tell my self things could be worse. When I was diagnoses a PA friend of mine said Carla if there was any kind of cancer to have this it the one you want. I know of a young lady who recently passed away of a very rare cancer . When the doctor told her your cancer is not curable we can only treat is so it wont grow too fast. The week after she passed away her husband died of Lou Garrick's leaving 2 teenage sons behind. I am thankfull for my familyand friends I am thankful to have on of the best Onc in my state. I was at a survivor dinner he was also there he made it a point to stop by each table that his patients were sitting at. Talked with them gave them a hug. Heck he even knew I was to see him in December. This coming from a doc who sometimes sees up to 40 -50 patients a day. I am thankful to have great friends (the Jewels) whom I have never met in person yet but know we will soon. I hope everyone great health  in the years to come. As the saying goes \"Youv'e come a long way baby.\" Take care and God Bless  You are all in my thoughts and prayers. Carla",

I had yet another very painful experience with my port access it brought me to tears. I even had the FMLA cream on. I again had a newbie trying to get the needle in the port. She missed and hit the side of my port. She went and got a senior nurse she took needle out had to get a new needle and stuck me a second time. The 1 inch needle I was told to ask for stuck out 1/4 if an inch go figure the last time they said the 3/4 was to short now they say I should have had the 3/4 inch.And after all this when Igot home the DH yelled at me. I feel lonely he was never one to show much affection but now is the time I NEED IT. I am just feeling sorry for my self I guess But a hug now and them would help. During my treatment (mom went with me) Some of the rooms there are shared rooms. There are 2 or 3 infusion lounges . I shared a room with a really nice lady going though lung cancer. She had to be there for a 5 hour infusion. She had a very cute hat on that she made. She said the web site is reversible chemo cap. It tied in the back. I have not been on until tonight and have not had a chance to check it out. Another web site is heavenlyhats.com they will sent you free hats,scarfs,or turbans. Kimberly,Vettegal,JulieK Love the pics you all are beautiful baldies. you rock.

Our survivor club is starting our own Relay for Life Team for the upcoming year. We had decided on the name Susan's Army in memory of her. How are you feeling after port removal ? Remind me did you have it removed in hospital or in docs office? My surgeon said she can remove it in her office when I get to ok from Onc. Paula Hope your trip was a safe one and Ed's doing better. Lifting you both up in prayer. I had my us of thyroid this am. The radiologist said it looked to her like is was fluid filled cyst. And probably nothing to worry about the largest was 1 cm and they usually wont do a biop unless it is 1cm or larger. But whit my history it will be up to the Onc.

I ask to have an MRI after treatment # 4 he said we would talk about it in 3 weeks. I ask for a referral to see the clinical Onc he agreed to make me an appointment. Wednesday night I went to a Cancer support meeting at a local Church. It was very helpful I meet a very nice lady who actually had the same Onc as I She calls herself PRESIDENT of his fan club. She had some very good stories. She was very inspiring she gave me her phone numbers.  She had brought a box of Ginger Snaps to the meeting and when she found out I was taking Chemo she gave the them and said that they really helped her with the nausea but make sure on the box it says made with real ginger. I did have a little nausea tonight and did eat a couple and it did help I have been very distant from the DH and I think he knows something was wrong. I never got flowers sent to me at work in the 23 years we have been married. This was the year my dh sent me 1/2 Roses Boy was I shocked. Get this the card was signed --Your mean husband--Got a laugh out of that one. I brought supper home from work  and went and got his VDay present Redstone candy He dearly loves. He was happy He came back to the bedroom and lay down beside me for awhile I told him this is all I am asking for and told him I really appreciate it. I hope things get better because this stress I have been having is not helping with the healing. Well enough of this Sista2 Your attitude is great. Sounds like we are close on the same amount of treatment. The General Manager where I work who raley said 3 words to me in the 9 1/2 years I have been there now makes it a point to stop by and ask how I am doing. Monday he said boy you are a fighter I told him you have to be you can not let the cancer control you and take over your life. D1 Your story about Dave maybe he was afraid of saying the wrong think and did not know what to say. Hope you have a great visit with collage girl this weekend Vettegal The card was great loved it. My girlfriend sent me a Vera Bradly chain purse this week. It was in support of BC a portion of the sale goes to BC research. Carol- What a wounder thing to do to be able to pass down a ring with sentimental value. My wedding rings belonged to dh mother when she was married to dh father. Juliek Love your FUBC picture I hope your SE's are not as bad this time. Well wishes are being sent to you. Paula I to can not do coffee after chemo the taste is terrible. I also drink tea for that week CarolC sorry your having a tough time a friend told me her sister got Bio Freeze form PT and said it helped. Kimberly Glad you have a great V Day withe the dh Paula Glad you got through # 3 I hope the SE's stay away this time Dana glad to hear from you and that things are moving forward with you I am praying for a clear MRI  GOD IS GOOD Here is what I get Saline Herceptin Pepcid 20 mg Aloxi .25 mg dexomethozone 20 mg Taxotere",

Thereas WOW congrads on last one. Sounds like a nice time you were able to have with dd and her friend. Rest well",

They had to take out the needle and push and push around port. They then put in a larger size needle. I found out there are differant. size needles they use. Any one getting a port ask what size needle will be needed and let them know this when you go for labs to prevent the pain I had today. At work will check in later today take care ((())) to all",

But if you stop your car, or walk by, You will notice something quite amazing.... Looking into the eye of one horse will disclose that he is blind. His owner has chosen not to have him put down, But has made a good home for him. This alone is amazing. If you stand nearby and listen, You will hear the sound of a bell. Looking around for the source of the sound, You will see that it comes from the smaller horse in the filed Attached to  the horse's halter is a small bell. It lets the blind friend know where the other horse is, so he call follow As you stand and watch these two friends, You will see that the horse with the bell is always checking on the blind horse, And that the blind horse will listen for the bell and Then slowly walk to where the other horse is, Trusting that he will not be led astray. When the horse with the bell returns to the shelter of the barn each evening, It stops occasionally and looks back. Making sure that the blind  friend isn't  too far behind to here the bell. Like the owners of these two horses, God does not throw us away just because we are not perfect or Because we have problems or challenges. He watches over us and even brings others into our lives to help us when we are in need. Sometimes we are the blind horse being guided by the Little ringing bell of those who God places into our lives. Other times we are the guide horse,      Helping others to find their way.... Good friends are like that...you may not always see them, But you know they are always there. Please listen for my bell and I'll listen for yours. And remember ...be kinder than necessary-everyone you meet is Fighting some kind of battle. Live simply, Love generously,  Care deeply,  Speak kindly... Leave the rest to God.",

Hope everyone is doing well that had treatments this week. I had a customer call in and start yelling at me because there was a main line water leak he threantned me and said Don't make me come in there after you. I started to cry  any other time I would have told him to calm down but this was a pretty bad week emotionally I told him while crying Listen I do not deserve to be talked to like this and your not being very nice. I wish I would have been able to say Listen here I have a cousin who is with the local Police Dept do I need to call him and let him know YOU are threatening me? I talked to a nurse who works at the Midwife I see for my early She was telling me that women who have no Insurance the state will not pay for a mammogram until they are 50 that is sad. Things need to change with health Insurance companies. I was telling her with my lump is did not show up on a mammogram and the after my biop the only thing that showed was the clip they put in beside the lump. This is because I have dense breast and a lot of times your lump will not show sometimes it talked 6-8 years to show up. Had it not been for loosing my weight and doing self breast examines I would have never found it. So now I am a spokeswomen so to be telling all my girl friends if you have dense breast  ask for and demand an ultrasound. Well here is to a great week ahead of us getting chemo I myself will ge going for round 3 on Friday. Take care and good night.",

You have to watch out for hospitals over billing. When I went for pre-op work  befor my port placement they wanted to do a chest x ray I told them just had a ct of the chest why cant they use it. They said oh yea we can. Then they wanted a urine sample I told them I just gave on the day before use it. If I would not have spoken up there would have been 2 unneeded test and bills. Ohh I will have to post a pic of my new  head topper.(wig) Tonight a friend said I can't believe you have not lost your hair yet. I laughed and said oh yea I did.

I was told that someone in the office wrote it and ask this person to type it up for them. Gave them a frame and told them to put in on my desk. Ok gals grab a tissue here it is: Life on Earth Life on earth is a journey that we all must travel.... For reasons unknown, some are given a road that is paved with others are presented one that is gravel For those who are traveling the paved life on earth seems to be so much smother and the ones traveling on the gravel seem to have a lot more hills and curves to maneuver No matter what road you are dealt, it is all in what you make it Paved roads seems to be more easy...and you tend to go too fast.. Gravel roads are rough as hell at times,but it makes you slow down and enjoy the things that others have passed Family and friends are the most important things you will ecounter as you go through the years Take it slow and enjoy life...with lots of laughs and smiles and no so many tears Life on Earth is a journey we all must travel and its knowing friends like YOU that make me glad to be one on the gavel road.

Could have been there up to 8 yrs so I was told. Hope you have a great golf day . no explosions erupted. The other day I saw a 2 YOUNG gals puffing away. Don't think they could have been more the 18. The thought went through my mind. To walk up to them pull off my wig and say \"Put down those cancer sticks\" D1, Theresa  I also have found myself stopping in mid conversation and having to think of a certain word or remember what I was talking about. Paula- Sounds like you have a great job.  The students are lucky to have you. KathyN- Bioetene mouth was, tooth paste rinse with baking soda/salt.

My WBC count was too low Friday to have treatment. I am to go this Friday and will have to have the nuelasta shot for the last 3. Let me ask you my sisters about this. The 1 time the DH went with me to my chemo appt. He said make it last as possible so I do not have to take a whole day off. Well last Sunday night his friend called and ask him if he wanted to go to Florida for 4 days. (Free plane ride down) Friend will be driving his boss's car back to WV. He said Sure I will only have to use 4 Vacation days. When I spoke at the Breast Conference it went very well. I was ask if they can call in me again I said sure. When I told the DH he said Why would the ask you again. My dd said she was going to get a job at a local restaurant. He said you could not do it.

Yippe And they removed a radius  50 by 50 by 50 mm and 4 mm showed invasive cancer cells. Which she said was good report.  I will see Onc in about 3 weeks for follow up and to plan the  radiation. I was surprised they did not give me any exercises to do for the arm.My are is sore but I am able to do a littler around the house. Even 1 are laundry. I will not see surgeon aging for a month. The Sat before my surgery the DH wanted to go to a rodeo I did not want to go. He got mad and said he would just go get drunk then. And this he did. Sunday he awoke with a hangover-blaming me. He told me if I would get my head out of my mothers ass maybe I would do something else. He told me why don't you go live with your Mommy. I just laughed and said it is ashame you jealous of the relationship my mother and I have. It is sad and I told him I just don't care anymore. He yelled and ask our daughter what she was going to do that day. He then answered himself and said are you gonna lay in your room and play with your ass all day. I believe he is miserable and wants us to fell that way also. A friend of mine told me let it go in 1 ear and out the other. It's easier said than done. I have called to make and appointment to see my options on this matter. They are to call me back for a meeting next week. When I mentioned this to my mom she said would you leave your daughters ? I said mom they are 19 and are free to come with me. She was not very encouraging and does not think I could do it on my own. Maybe if I confined in her about what has been done and said she would be a littler more supportive. Oh well. I had a good day today. Went with gf to a thrift shop got 2 cute hats. Funny story on this. When I arrived home I put one of the hats on. One of my daughters said please don't tell me you got that at the mission. I said I sure did!  It was brand new and I only paid 50 cents for it. She said mom your gonna get lice. My other daughter said no she wont , you have to have hair before that would happen. We got a good laugh over that. Take care my wonderful sisters ! Carla",

Just enough to make the roads slick and cause a few  wrecks, Took longer to come home tonight than usually. Carol  Hope your feeling better Had to laugh about your reference to the se's. Your story of the warm blankets reminded me of my cousin. During her 2nd surgery she was ask if she wanted a warm blanket, She started to cry and told the nurse she did not have any insurance and said the hospital charged me $85.00 the last time. The nurse said don't worry dear I wont write this 1 down.  Kimberly- Here's to a Clear PET scan on sis Kat. I too am thank full for a job.Even though there are days customers curse,yell and even threaten me. I am great full to awake everyday  to get out of bed and to to work.
