      "Content": "Charliestweetie wrote: Hi!!!  My final pathology report came in. I am so blown off: what was supposed to be a Stage 1 IDC turn into a Stage 3 with 24/24 nodes involved and 6 tumors in my right breast---one was 1 inch---which neither an MRI or mammogram had picked up. The only indication that something was wrong, were those microcalcifications. I am scared out of my mind--I never expected to be a Stage 3. What to do know? How can I beat this shit?
