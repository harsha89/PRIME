I'm not sure that I would have handled it as well without those drugs. Anyway, It went well--great radiologist and great ladies who did the MRI. That makes such a difference. I had more pain after than during the procedure, but was able to drive two and a half hours home, then put a new ice pack on, and now feel fine. They hope to have the results tomorrow, so I am waiting until then. I do have bruising and a pretty huge hematoma, but they said that this is normal. Thank you all for all the support, and I'll post when I have the results. Pam Knapp Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "knapppa wrote: Hi, everyone. I have been reading the discussion board for about a month, but this is my first post. My sister was diagnosed in late February at the age of 46, after following a friend's recommendation to have an MRI. Our mother had breast cancer twice and it metasticized the second time. She passed away four years ago. A first cousin died of metasticized breat cancr at the age of 51 a year ago. Anyway, my siter had stage 2 cancer, and decided to have a biltateral mastectomy and reconstruction. Came through it really well. Has had three of her four chemo treatments (last one is next week.) Has not missed work at all. She is amazing. Anyway, I had my yearly mammogram right after her surgey, and it was fine, but I had an MRI about six weeks ago,and it showed a lesion in my right breast, and something about a lymph node under the right arm. The hospital wanted to do the MRI guided biopsy the next week, but I consulted a surgeon recommended by a friend, and he refused to use that hospital (in NH), as he only sends patients to Boston to the Sagoff Breast Center at the Faulkner Hospital. The radiologist there is tops in her field. So I had an MRI there a month ago, then got a call that I needed to do the Ultra sound, which I did three weeks ago. The radiologits was great, and she went over and over the area and told me that she was seeeing nothing. She told me that I should rest more easily, as usually if there is something serious it will pop up. However, mys sister had nothing show up on her US, either. She didn't check under my arm, and I figured it didn't show on their MRI. Anyway, I am finally having the MRI in a week. I have started feeling like there is something under my arm, although there is no lump I can detect. I am thinking now that I may be imaging things. But my sister told me that the biopsy was the most painful thing she has ever gone through, including her surgery! I told the radiologist that, and she seemed surprised. She told me I could ask my doctor for a valium to make things better, but my sister is telling me she'll give me a vicodin (not sure of spelling.) Has anyone here had this kind of biopsy? Was it really painful? And do you think I should ask the doctor about taking the pain killer? I will be happy when this is over, as I will at least know what I am dealing with. I am 54 years old. Thanks for everything you share and for being so supportive of everybody! Pam Log in to post a reply",
