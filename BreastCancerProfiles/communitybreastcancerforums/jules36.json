I've always been told when I self exam, I shouldn't when it's close to that time of the month. Should I reschedule my appointment for after my period? I didn't know if they would feel something different or unusual because of my period. Sorry for the silly question, just curious? I guess I should call my doctor and ask her. Has anyone else gone to a breast exam while they had PMS? Log in to post a reply",
