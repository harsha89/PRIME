      "Content": "Bflox wrote: hello everyone, I am 18 years old and woke to find a small red patch on the side of my breast about the size of a 5pence and didn't think anything of it. However I woke up the next day and it was the size of a 50 pence piece and bright red with small blood vessels visible, and hurt to touch. It already began going down after one day but I have also noticed I have very faint dimpling of the skin however I don't know if that is just how my skin on my breast is as they look like they could just be hair follicles. I have also had a full aching all through the day in my breast. Having googled the symptoms I'm really beginning to freak myself out as I know that some women get this but it's rare if you are not breastfeeding and of course all these symptoms match inflammatory breast cancer!Is this something I should be worried about aged 18? Is there anything that you may think it could be instead? Log in to post a reply",

What I meant about the breast feeding was that I understand that breast infections are less common amongst women who aren't breast feeding and that is why it made me feel as this wasn't an infection, as I am only 18 and have never breast fed before in my life, and I've been told that breast infections with similar symptoms to mine such as mastitis are mainly linked to breastfeeding ",

However the one thing that concerned me and made me not believe that is was a breast infection as I have pain behind the breast and inside as opposed to on this skin, plus the skin is smooth but just red and sore to press ? Any ideas what this could be? the only reason in my head that I had panicked so much and ruled out a rash or bug bite is because of the aching actually in the breast, and the dimpling to be paired with it? Is it normal to be able to see each hair follicle all over a breast without it being skin dimpling or peau d orange? Thank you all so much for being so lovely I think I'm just freaking myself out!",
