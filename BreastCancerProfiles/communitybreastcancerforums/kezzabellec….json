The lesion is not a cyst as in the FNAB the mass was solid and they had trouble getting anything out at all. I just wish he could do a lumpectomy to take the whole mass out and then at least they could test the whole thing not just a small part, the waiting is the hardest part, I feel like I am standing on then edge of a cliff. Anyway thank you to all that replied, you are my inspiration.",
