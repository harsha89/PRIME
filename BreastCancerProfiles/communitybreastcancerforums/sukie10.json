First I didn't sleep well and woke up freezing cold even though I was dressed well and well covered. I added a blanket and stayed in bed an extra hour until I warmed up. I had a slice of whole grain bread and peanut butter first but that only brought me up to 97.7 and sure enough an hour later 97.3. It's taken me all day but I just reached 98.2. I'm getting the tired feeling again and I'm sweating. This is good because I can tell when I'm running at a higher temp. I start to feel cold if I'm below 97.1.The colder I am the lower my temp. I think I really need to get my schedule a little more regulated. Tomorrow I'll have the sausage and eggs again. That seemed to get me up there initially and I'll try and snack on veggies and nuts between meals. I still think that I will come up with a combo that works if I keep at it. Right now anything in the 98 range would be good. I have chemo again this week so maintaining this for 2 weeks will be unlikely but I'd like to get an idea  of what works and what doesn't so I can put my full efforts into this as soon as I'm done. MBJ. I totally agree that years of bad scheduling, surgeries etc... caused this low temp. If we can break it we can fix it. Just gotta figure out how! ",

I started keeping track of my temp back then when I was trying to get pregnant. Over the years when I randomly take my temp it's always at 97.? not 98.6. My blood pressure has always been low except for the day I went to get the scan results from my onc and I was so scared about what he might tell me. I'm keeping much better track now. I've started a journal and am trying to get through the reading on low body temp. I'm recording my blood pressure when they take it at chemo. I'm going to join you ladies and see if I can raise it up. I know that the day after my last chemo it was nice out and I pushed myself to get the yard work done before I crashed with nasty SEs. My body temp went up tp 98.4 that day and my SEs were so much better. I'm thinking now that this makes sense. This morning I took your advice and had sausage and eggs for breakfast, a hot cup of green tea with lemon, wore my slippers and a sweater and my body temp just went up from 97.3 to 98.5 in 45 mins. Lets see if I can keep it there all day. ",

Basically after achieving 98.5 after breakfast this morning my temp dropped to 97.6 within an hour after that. So I ate an apple and it went up to 98.3 (not bad) within an hour back down to 97.4.This is pretty much is how my day went. It seems that the only way to keep my temp in the 98 range is to eat a little something at least every hour. In my case when I got into the 98 range I would get this terrible urge to nap. I resisted. When my temp dropped the tiredness went away. I'm thinking I've been functioning at a low temp for so long when I start to get to a normal temp my body reacts by trying to shut down. Just a theory. I kept myself very warm all day. I was actually so warm I was sweating. Tomorrow I'm going to try staying warm and eating a little something every hour all day instead of having a meal. I've worked shift work most of my life and rarely ate at regular times. Maybe I messed up some internal clock along the way.",

I'm having the same issues with my friends and family. It's a burden to try and reassure them when I'm not reassured myself. This is tough. I like the ideas the other ladies have, I'm tired of explaining cancer to people when I don't even get it myself. I just wanted you to know I'm feeling it with you. We are going to be okay eventually. Failure is not an option. ",

This just happened to me last weekend, they knew on Friday and wouldn't tell me until Monday at lunch. I couldn't eat or sleep, the waiting was so very hard already and then THEY knew. Pretty near sent me over the edge. My advice is to go out if you can get around people stay as busy as you can to try and take your mind off of it. When you do get the news either way you'll find an enormous sense of relief. Everybody told me this was the worst part and so far it seems like that is true. The gals here know stuff, nobody else on your life can understand. 1 more day... you can do this!",
