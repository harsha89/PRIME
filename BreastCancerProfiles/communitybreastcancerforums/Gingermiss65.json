I have been on Naproxen with a pain killer since about 3 months after all my treatments. My legs right after finishing my treatments were so stiff from feet to upper thighs it was like walking with wooden legs. After being on the Naproxen now it has helped, I only have the stiffness in my lower back and thighs now, at times. I think a lot of it is and was inflammation from the chemo. Anyways, my doctor suggested seeing a physiotherapist, which I did last week for the first time. She also agrees after testing me a bit, that it is not neuropathy. So what is this? I can't seem to get limber. It is like atrophied muscle. Anyone else experience this? DCIS and Stage 1A, Pagets, IDC, 7mm. Lymphovascular. HER2+, Grade 2, 0/3 Nodes, 12x weekly Taxol, 17 Herceptin.

But after 5 years there can be 20-30 % chance of recurrence locally or distant. That seems high to me. So how curable really? I'm not trying to be a Debbie Downer, this just worries me.

I am post treatments now for 1 1/2 years. Pls don't think this is a dumb question. I obviously double think everything I do now after having Stage 1 BC and wouldn't go into a smoke filled room to sit or sit anywhere with chemical fumes coming from something...probably even non BC ppl wouldn't either. I was offered a part time school bus driver job. I have done this before. But, the buses can be old and can have metal smells, etc. I am afraid this could be harmful to me, and even bring on BC again. It can't be healthy. I am thinking of not taking it. I need the work.
