I had a 2cm tumour, a lumpectomy with clear margins and no lymph node involvement, grade 3, stage 1. I was given 16 rads and told that they are equivalent to having 33 due to the fact that they are slightly stronger but at the end of it you get the same amount of radiation, it is just more convenient to only have 16. I had no side effects. I have been attending a very up to date hospital that keeps abreast of all the research and have been told that 16 is now being given to all radiation patients. It is not any less effective than having 33 rads. So if you get 4 weeks of a slightly lesser strength for each treatment and it equals the same radiation in the end as the 3 weeks one then you will end up with the same treatment, but it will just be less convenient for you to have to do 4 weeks as opposed to 3 weeks.",

When I got to the hospital I was put on a drip and after spending the night on fluids I was feeling great the next day. My last, 4th AC, was cancelled and I am going straight to Taxol this week. My nails are fine, I have lost most of my head hair but none of the rest of my body hair although my leg hair is still growing but very slowly. I lost a couple of lbs and gained them again. I had a mixture of constipation and diarrhoea and I feel that contributed to keeping my weight stable. Hoping that Taxol is easier. I already had my lumpectomy so no tumour to shrink, but I would say that yours has as I have read this on other forums from people who have had their tumours shrinking after 3 ACs.",

Can't imagine this tiredness to get worse with each round of Taxol.",

I inject myself now.  However, I would not take any chances and not take it, better to be safe than sorry.",

Just goes to show how important it is to drink water. Then my Onc decided to cancel my 4th AC as my white cells were crashing every time I got it. I was certainly relieved not to have the last AC and am now on my 2nd Taxol and so much easier so far. Hope you feel better soon.",

You are estrogen and progesterone positive and this is also a good sign because it means that your cancer is hormone related and you can get medication to block these hormones from feeding the cancer and you may not have to have chemo. Hope this eases your mind.  ",
