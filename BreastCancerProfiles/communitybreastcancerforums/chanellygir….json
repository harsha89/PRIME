Wedesday I go for my second opinion and not sure if I am hoping for another expert to confirm the recommendation or to offer another opinion and course of treatment. I know in the end the decision is mine and I need to be able to sleep with whatever choice I make.    I thank all of your from the bottom of my heart for opening up to me and making me feel like I have a place and community that will allow me to reach out... Best of luck and good week to all, Barbara ",

I know in my heart it is the right choice and at 48 years old feel I need to do everything I possibly can,   Cookiegal, I decided not to go with the onco who was suggesting/pushing for the study. My family and I really thought I needed to make a decision and not let someone  I did not know randomize me...  I'm sure they will be able to find others who do not to want to make the decision.  All the best to everyone and thank you again, Barbara",
