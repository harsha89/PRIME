At first they thought it was bone cancer because my mom's type didn't show up in any other tests except an MRI. I know it's hard, but keep in mind that you just don't know yet. I am happy to report that my mom's body shows no signs of cancer today after taking a drug called Ibrance, which she will have to continue to take. There is so much out there for breast cancer now, so it is NOT a death sentence. Hang in there",

Also, do something you love. I am taking an online writing class and that's helping to occupy my mind. Let's also hope you get good news on your son's birthday. I'll say a prayer for you that day. :) Artista928, you are right, cancer is jaw droppingly expensive. My mom pays $1200 per month for her pills and I've seen her medical bills. My brother in law also has stage iv rhabdomyosarcoma and even with great insurance, he and my sister are struggling. My family has been through the ringer with this illness. As for not having insurance, I have to take that one day at a time as well. Today I got financial assistance for the MRI from a foundation, I'm very grateful for this. I'm realizing a lot of people seem confused about ACA. I had it last year, they dropped my plan, and I couldn't afford the new plans this year so we opted out, which means we will owe a penalty. This is the current problem with our healthcare system and why I think we need single payer. I make too much for Medicaid, but too little to afford the premiums.",

I had a very similar experience at the radiology office. They told me the pain was probably my dense tissue and hormones, but the breast surgeon said nothing about that. I forget, can you feel a lump? It might be musculoskeletal, I thought that the way you describe it, I'm a massage therapist, but not a doctor. I would either get a second opinion from a breast surgeon or wait and see if the pain goes away. I'm not sure what tests besides an MRI they would do for musculoskeletal. I lean more towards a second opinion.",

I actually asked the breast specialist if my pain could be musculoskeletal and she said its a possibility. I perform deep tissue massage regularly and that can be hard on my pec muscles. BUT she thinks anything presenting as a breast cancer symptom should rule out bc first. This is coming from a doctor who specializes in hard to dx malignant and benign breast issues. Another thing is that 80% of all biopsies are benign, so there's some hope in that :) .. Artista, what were your original symptoms? Breast lump and pain? But nothing at all showed in a Mammo or us?

I'll report back as to what the doctor thinks when I find out this Friday. I figure that might be helpful to anyone else who experiences anything similar. Question: what does BPE: mild, symmetric mean? That was also in my MRI report.",

The skin tethering on my breast comes and goes with my hormones (right now it's gone) and I still have pain. Lump might be fibrosis she says, BUT she still wants me to come for follow up in 3 months, mostly because of skin tethering. She says not to worry, but it's better to be cautious since my mom has ILC. I feel ok about it and am going to try not to worry :)..",

The specialist seemed really clear that nothing seemed abnormal on the US, but still wants me to get an MRI. Why wouldn't my lump show up in either of these tests? I feel like I'm afraid all over again and now I have to wait. I'm afraid of the contrast dye thing and not sure what it is, but from reading this site it sounds not so good. Plus, I'm extremely claustrophobic. Anyone have experience with a painful lump that didn't show up on Mammo or US but turned out to be benign or malignant on MRI",

It makes such a difference to know that I don't have to worry about the money part. That was really getting in the way for me. I know it's best to get the answers I need and now I am financially able to. :",

I don't know where you live, but I would google 'breast cancer foundations and your state name or city name.' That's what I did. It took a lot of phone calls and leaving messages and also being persistent, but it paid off. I hope you find something too. Let us know how it goes",

I know I must seem like a big baby, but I am so scared right now about getting the contrast injected for my MRI tonight after they poked me so many times last week and couldn't get a vein. Both the needles and the contrast dye going into my veins freak me out. Plus, I'm scared of my results. Just overwhelmed and wondering if someone out there can share some comforting words. Right now there are two stage iv cancer members in my immediate family and that has really caused me to have bad anxiety regarding my own health.",

The receptionist says if they find something concerning they will call me in sooner. I'm a little freaked out that if I get a call sooner something is wrong and then having to wait two weeks is going to be stressful also. Is this normal",
