I am nervous and going through major anxiety issues right now. I have done my research. However, I don't know what to expect from this procedure. Does it hurt badly? If so, for how long? Does radiation make it worse? SMH! This disease has me really feeling like a skitzo at times. One minute I am ok and the next I'm not. I really would like to hear from someone that has been through this procedure before. Help me...nervous and afraid.",

I had my post op appt yesterday and things are doing much better. I had two drains removed and my pain is much more managable. I am still having some minor spasms but anything is better than what I was dealing with at first. I hope everyone else is doing ok. I feel so out of the loop. I miss you guys...",

Mine turned out to be adhesions and cording that stemmed from surgery. I was referred to a lymphadema specialist for treatment. I am doing much better. My cords and lumps are breaking up and the numbing has improved some. We do a lot of stretching exercises. But please...do check with your dr. I know its easier said than done but try to relax...it is more than likely scar tissue or the adhesions. Praying everything works out for you.",
