It is still your free will  (even tho it often feels as if we have been thrust into something not of our choosing).  Coupled with the fact that not knowing what happens next, all any of us can do is try to find that quiet place (frequently involves sunning myself in various locales around the house) where we can ponder all of the information we are forced to confront since frequently, doing nothing, altough feeling easier, is akin to holding a weaon to our mouths.",
