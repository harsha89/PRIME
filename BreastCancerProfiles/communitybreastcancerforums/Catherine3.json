I don't think I realized that I was literally covering my head all the time. Anyway dr gave me a prescription for some relief. I wonder if it's going to itch when it grows back in as well. Can't worry about that now but I am already anxious to be getting my hair back. ;) thanks for your post.üëç",

Right now I just finished my second chemo treatment and my head has patches of stubble all over it. My head really itches and I just want the rest to fall out so it stops bothering me. I am wondering if any of you experienced this when your hair was falling out? Is there any creams you may have used or anything to help? Thank you for any advise on this!",

My dr felt it and said that he sees this happen all the time during chemo and after a surgery. I had some nodes out there and radiation. He says it's like a big blister and usually it goes away after chemo ends. I just finished chemo so I am anxiously awaiting to see if it dissolves on its own. I will keep you ladies posted. Now interestingly enough, this dr seems to have lots of experience and confidence in this wait and see idea while another dr I spoke with wanted me under surgery ASAP. Hard call on my part but going with my gut here. Keep you all posted",
