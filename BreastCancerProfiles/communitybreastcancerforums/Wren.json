I just had my exchange surgery on June 11th to replace the expanders for implants. I'm still sore, but I've requested meals from people at my church and help from a lady who cleans my mom's house. I am a teacher, natural caretaker, mother-hen type... and it was really frustrating when I was first diagnosed because now I was going to be on the receiving end of help instead of the giving, nurturing side I was used to. I mentiond this to a priest at my church and told him that I didn't know how to be the 'sick' person, nor did I want to... And you know what he said to me that was soooo profound? He said, \"Well, somebody has to be the sick person, in order for others to do their work or calling\"... I never looked at it that way (he didn't mean that I should just roll over and give up)...This is a little out of context, but he said to me, that for whatever reason, this was my time to learn how to receive help and to let others help me--and that if I did that, I would be living -- living an example of how to be gracious, etc... So, I've learned now, that it's OK to accept help (I'm having meals brought over this weekend) and that by me expressing my gratitude allows others who want to help to do what they are called to do. I have learned how to let go of things and be accepting of where I am and living my life to the fullest. I just spend a couple days in the hospital with the kindest nurses and I told them how appreciative I was of their willingness to help me with the smallest of details. I'd still rather be the one taking care of everyone else at times, but I have learned that it feels just as good when I allow someone else to help me (by bringing food, cleaning my house, running errands for me, or just sitting with me)... I just know you will find many shoulders along the way--and that you may end up giving those people more than you can realize. I'm happy every day that I wake up and know I've done all I can do to take care of my DCIS. Please take care of yourself and allow some of your family and friends to do what they can that you'd want/need. Start asking questions of your doctors and medical team of where you can get the help you need. I did that an it was wonderful. I was plugged in to social workers and nurses who helped me navigate all the confusing stuff in the beginning and now almost 10 months later, I have new breast implants and smile on my face that won't go away. I am keeping you in my prayers. Hugs!",

I had no nodes involved, nothing invasive, but I made the decision because I knew that I could not have any peace of mind having to ever go through a breast biopsy again. I'd already had a scare a few years earlier and then to go through all that again and find out I had DCIS was just more than my personality could take. I also had aunts who had a mastectomy and treatment only to have another cancer in the other breast a few years later. That was enough for me to know what I needed to do. I also knew I did not ever want radiation because I wanted to preserve my skin and I was told if the mastectomy came up all clear that I would not need rads. That was a major issue for me because I do not live anywhere close to a radiation treatment center and would not have been able to easily get there, let alone put up with the treatment. I wanted reconstruction and I wanted good skin to work with too and I just didn't believe that I would be happy with radiation. I told the doctor that I would be so ANGRY if I were to go through radiation and taking tamoxifen only to have DCIS or worse happen to me again and then not have as many options open for reconstruction. Finally, I did not want to take any tamoxifen and was very clear that for me it was bilateral with immediate construction or nothing. (I'd already lost one ovary a couple years earlier to a non-cancerous tumor and I told my doctor I'd rather have the other ovary surgically removed than take tamoxifen). Personally, the mastectomy gave me hope and a peace of mind. I could endure the pain of reconstruction and losing my breasts more than I wanted to try to save them and go through rads and tamox. There are those who can endure the rads and tamox, keep their breasts, and endure years of mammos and biopsies who never ever have and sign of cancer again too... (and if I thought for a minute I could sleep at night and be in that group, I would have joined them) My plastic surgeon, who is a BC survivor, who has undergone chemo, rads, and breast reconstruction herself, said to me, \"Just do it and don't look back.\"... So, I did... and I have no regrets. This horrible disease puts us in a position to make decsision we never thought we'd have to make and honestly there is not 'good' choice or 'right' choice... they are all hard choices.  The only choice there is, is the one you believe is best for you--when at the end of the day you are putting on your PJs and counting your blessings that you say, I did the best for me with the knowledge I had and I can live with that. There is always hope. Hugs to you!",

It sure doesn't make it any easier to go through, but fortunately, my mom and my husband were in total support of whatever decision I made so I just turned to them for support. I think my breast surgeon said, \"it's reasonable\" when I asked him for his opinion too--and I really appreciated those words. I repeated them to myself and anyone else who questioned me... I had reconstruction also, and my plastic surgeon, who is also a BC survivor gave me great words to hold on to also. She said, \"Just do it and don't look back\" and that is what I did... *not simple, but very do-able... I miss being online whenever I want but my new job has me working six hours a day assisting developmentally delayed young adults and when I get home I'm just so tired. It's a good tired, but definitely more than I used to be since sitting around having surgeries for a year, LOL. I plan to work right up until my next surgery in November. After that, we'll see how I feel. I rented the DVD called \"Young At Heart\" yesterday. It is a documentary about a senior citizen choir that has performed over a 20 year span. They sing popular songs and rock music (in their own special style)... For example, the song \"Stayin' Alive\" by the BeeGees takes on an entirely different meaning when being sung by someone 80 years old on oxygen. It is amazing to watch the dedication and energy these wonderful seniors give to performing in this choir. It's definitely a one or two hankie movie. Don't miss the bonus features either, they are great. Also, you can watch the \"Young at Heart\" music videos on YouTube if you really want to get an idea of what they do. Hugs to you all!!!",

When I start to feel anxious or worried, I think of my grown kids (23 and 21) and their lives and I get some spunk back and determination to work through whatever it takes to go on because I want to be here for them (and for me too). This year I decided, like honeygirl, that I will decorate my house as much as possible for Christmas and I am not taking down my Angel collection and string of white lights on my mantle.  I love Angels and decided that I need them all year round--the white little lights are my little lamps of love that I have burning for all who go through this difficult disease. I lost my MIL to BC in 1997 at age 57 (she fought for ten years and worked so hard to help others--died New Year's Eve) and then I was diagnosed at 45! Not a day goes by that I don't think of her and her strength.  My daughter is 21--and I pray and hope that she never has to face this, but her odds don't look so good. So, when the doctors asked me to be in a four year research study having to do with 'younger' women getting cancer I said yes without even caring about the details (blood draws, etc). My heart aches for anyone who must battle breast cancer (including myself)--but I know I can reach out here--and just knowing that I am not alone--gives me great comfort and hope. Hugs to you all.",

The doctors at the cancer center told me that waiting and waiting causes undo anxiety so they just try to move as quickly as possible... It sounds like, although you have to wait, it won't be six weeks (thank goodness).  I'm holding your hand in spirit while you wait... Sheila, thank you for clarifying what a \"Wiggie\" is.

I asked them to go easy because it is Easter coming up and my kids are home and I wanted to be able to cook for them and not be in pain.  I got my wish! Only 45cc put in for a grand total of 715! Then I got to see my plastic surgeon who measured me and said I am about done! I will go next week for one more fill and then I was told surgery to get the implants will be in June!!! I walked out of the office with a grin from ear to ear. I smiled all the way home... Finally, after all these months I am seeing the end off in the distance. Shirlann, I'm glad your cut and paste worked for you. Wish I could send you my compter-programmer son to figure it all out for you.

He says just type in to Google whatever your problem is and most likely someone else has had it...

I know it was overwhelming to deal with your family and their worries; but now you have their support and you don't have to keep this a secret any more. About the Tamoxifen... I don't know much, but all my decisions revolved around my super sensitive body and allergies to so many things. I had DCIS (non invasive) and no nodes, etc...  The cancer cells were grade 3 and both ER/PR positive but verrrry little (low) numbes. One was 2% and one was 10% hormone receptor positive... My first reaction was, \"oh good, I won't need Tamoxifen\" but my breast surgeon said that anything above a 2% was considered enough to treat with Tamoxifen. Wow! I was surprised. After much thought and visits with several specialists, I decided that for my body the best thing was not going to be rads and Tamox but a bilateral mastectomy so I could avoid those two things. I hope you can find some doctors to talk with who will answer your questions. I went to a gynecological oncologist -- and I believe that would be a good doctor for you to consult. You can discuss fertility issues and the horrible side effects you felt from the first Tamox pill. I also asked for a referral to a breast cancer psychiatrist -- who does nothing but counsel women (and prescribe medicine as needed) who are going through breast cancer treatments. I have to believe that there must be something similar where you live. Of course, your oncologist will be able to answer the 'percentages' questions and the 'odds' of stuff, but you also need someone in your corner who is acknowledging your desire to have a child; your extremely sensitive body, and your need for a good quality of life. Try to relax today; sleep if you can, go to spinning class, have a nice warm bath. You don't have to make this decision TODAY. Give yourself permission to take a 'mental health' break and take time off from thinking about this today. I wish you the very best no matter what you decide.",

The doctor debrided her ear and put in a wick and more meds... but she is really unstable (balance) poor kid.... then I got her some Thai Noodle soup and drove her BACK to college where her friends are monitoring her and perhaps she can get to class.

If my daughter is not significantly better by Thursday I get to go back and get her for a follow up debridement. Never in all my 23 years+ of motherhood have I had a child get this ear thing; and now this. At least I was needed and could actually drive... It was a good feeling even if I was sick myself; I got to do the 'mom' thing; and believe me, I had my hackles up by the third doctor visit in three days for my daughter.

The 800s would have been bulging under my armpits and up too high, so I got 700cc high profile silicone. Then she said in order to make them look larger she lipsuctioned all the skin around the sides and tummy (she did my entire front from belly button to boob, and both sides from arm pit to waist.

They are soft and squishy, and allow me more range of motion with my arms again. I am not allowed to lift, push, pull, etc, but I do have less pain than when the expanders were placed 7 months ago. So, that is good. I love all the photos you all have been sharing. Karen, your daughter is really cute--and you look similar to her... you are very lovely. OK, now back to my resting...",

I haven't decided if I'm up to it yet, but I do have this on my list of things to do when I can. We had to get one of our kitties put to sleep today--he was OLD and having what appeared to be kidney failure so we just took him in. It was sad though because it was my late in-laws pet that we got over ten years ago when they died (MIL from breast cancer). It was like we sent their kitty up to them in heaven though...

Karen, thank you for asking about me. I just finally feel like I 'turned the corner' and it's been four weeks since my exchange surgery and liposuction. I think the lipo was the horrible part, but the swelling is going down and I can actually get my pants on again, ha! I am liking my new breasts more and more. My plastic surgeon said she'd wait three months before doing anything to even them up or whatever they may need because they change so much. She is right. They are looking more like breasts every day and softening up. I am so happy to have them. My PS told me, just remember they are \"girls\" not \"twins\"... haha! I love her way of explaining things. I never had even breasts anyway, the left one (my cancer boob) was always a bit bigger... so I actually think I have a better match in size now that they are the same. Shirlann, I have sold our books online too, but I use half.com. My daughter showed me that link because she's in college and she buys and sells her textbooks there. Ulla! It's great to see you posting. I just know each day you are getting back in to being busy and getting closer to being able to work as a dentist again.

We're here to support you, no matter what you choose to do to fight this.  My plastic surgeon is a BC survivor and she was the one who told me to \"just do it and don't look back\"... She was referring to getting a bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction.  So that is what I did. Take care!",

I love going shopping and getting a bargain too. It's like finding treasure... and if you love the clothes and wear them for a long time you will think of that deal every time you wear them. I have also gained 20 pounds that I'm trying to get rid of--but it's just not going easily... You'd think if you had a bilateral mastectomy you'd lose weight--especially with the boobies I had, but no... I gained. I am trying, but I think it's because I have been sitting around more (wasn't as active with my arms either). I can't wait until it's warmer outside so I can walk more (and not in freezing rain)...  My next fill is Wednesday.  I'm only going every other week because it takes me so long to recover from them. Oh, and welcome to all the 'new' ladies here too.  I had DCIS and chose a bilateral mastectomy with expander reconstruction because I didn't want to go through this again (please God) and I didn't want to do any of the other treatments... I did what worked for me; no one influenced me one way or another. I just know my personality and it fit with what I chose. Hope everyone is staying warm and well.  Shirlann sure is a good cheerleader! I so appreciate her words of wisdom and experience.",

Moving, settling in, changing is tiring and takes time. Soon you will get a new routine. I'm thinking of you. I've been doing \"spring cleaning\" a season late and it's making me sore and tired. We moved into our house about two weeks after my diagnosis last year--the same day I met my breast surgeon--and six days later I had my first surgery... Then I had three more surgeries, which brings me up to now. (I haven't even lived in this house a year yet). I am finally deep cleaning my house (as much as I can) one chore at a time, and doing it just the way I like it. Thankfully, I've had help this past year, but I never felt like I had a chance to settle in and really clean things...  On the one hand it feels great to be able to do it, but on the other hand it sure hurts my pecs and muscles that haven't been doing much. I have fibromyalgia too so sometimes I can overdo it... and then I just have to stop for a bit. Oh well, I am loving my little house all on one floor. It is so much easier to take care of.

My left side (cancer side) is shifting left, has a ripple (slight) and I have an extra crease in my cleavage... kinda hard to explain. Also, I had one 'dog ear' fixed at surgery and any other bumps and stuff my plastic surgeon said would be fixed when nipples were made. I won't know if I'm getting nipples and the minor stuff fixed at the same time or if those will be two separate surgeries until my next appointment, perhaps. I know how you feel about wanting to like what we've worked so hard to reconstruct. On the one hand I am so happy to have something on my chest and to look OK in clothes, but on the other hand I want to know I have something that appeals to me when I am not wearing clothing too. I think it will be worth whatever it takes to get that look. I know that my breast surgeon said there is no reason not to have my reconstructed breasts look however I want them to...

Take off more days from work so your body will heal up faster (if you can). I'm sure that 'vacation' time you have coming will really help you... Thanks for letting us know how you are doing now. I'm still praying for you -- and thinking of you. Hugs!",

I have friends and former colleagues and neighbors and I am grateful that any of them have supported me so much. I wish there was something I could do for all these people to let them know how much I appreciate them. I am going to copy this and send it to my mom, daughter, and sisters though. Thank you. Sue, I am so sorry your mouth hurts again and that the steroids have made you so wound up again. You are such a trooper! Thank you for sharing your rant here too when you were sreaming at bootface.  I am so glad you put a holler in there for me too.  I need to rant more sometimes... only I'm not so good at it... \"darn bootface, I hate it\" That's my rant... LOL, you do it so much better. Please rant away. I love how you do it... and I'm glad you were cussing when that mean nurse was poking and pulling at you--what a nasty nurse... you'd think they'd have training to be kinder... Ulla, where are you???  Everyone else--I read your posts every day but seriously, by the time I am ready to post my mind is mixed up and I can't remember it all... I'd have to take notes! LOL... I didn't have chemo, but I think all the meds I take for pain and muscles do affect my memory--that and the mixed up sleep... I am dreaming.... I would love a personal assistant right now--or just a buddy with free time to come sit with me and help me with some boring chores, like spring cleaning or organizing my closet... I would love to shop for new clothes but my body is still changing so much from this that I dare not... I have no idea what my finished boobies will be like so I am just trying to make do with what I have. Plus, I'd be too tired to shop much... however, my mom did buy me some cute Ked's sneakers (all patchwork print in spring colors) and I got a new tote bag for spring so I'm not complaining, just missing my old body a bit. Darn bootface. I gained weight so I know none of my spring pants will fit either--I think I will live in stretch pants or skirts until I get the weight off... Well, I had a great lymphedema massage yesterday by my new physical therapist and she helped stretch a muscle in my left armpt that has been really painful so I am feeling better. She did myofascial (sp?) release... ahhh... I get to go weekly or twice weekly if I want. The good news is she thinks once my reconstruction is done and all the cutting/stretching is done on my chest that the mild lymphedema will go away! Yay! My left arm is only a cm larger than the right so that is good news. Thank God! Tomorrow I see the dentist for a toothache--why is it that bootface seems to make our teeth weak? I have had no cavities for years and years and now I have a zinger up there hurting... OK, I've rambled enough.  I love you all sisters... You are in my thoughts and prayers. ~Wren",

I spend my morning on the phone two hours with doctor's offices and insurance companies trying to fix a billing mess that has been mixed up since my visit in September! It's been a nightmare trying to get this all fixed and fingers pointing all directions and the billing company is in another state--as is the insurance, etc... I was on hold so long it finally just hung up on me... Anyway, I was finally told that nothing could be changed anywhere, but the doctor's office who had been paid for 2/3 of the visit finally felt sorry for me---cuz it was so weird to have the insurance pay for two of the three items and then deny the third view of this ultrasound and use a different dianosis code--like I'd had two visits for two different things--- that today after over six months of phone calls and stuff I was finally told that the doctor said to just 'wipe' the account as paid--and remove the charge! Ladies, that is an $800 charge just 'vanished'... I'm speechless... really... I was up all night (insomnia) crying at 230AM and hubs had gotten up and I told him I felt so useless not working right now and not being able to make a difference--and well, today, this little victory made me feel like I did make a difference. I'm thanking God and a very kind doctor's office manager and doctor (radiologist) right now... There was no way to ever fix the mix up and they just wrote it off--you have no idea how relieved I am... and now, those collection agency calls that were waking me up (machine calling at 7AM) will stop -- even though there were countless notes in my file that this was being reprocessed I was still being hassled... I have never had anything go to collection in my life, so you can imagine how frustrating this had been. Amen, it's over.... just 'poof' gone...",

I remember you mentioning less steroids or a new med. Perhaps that is why you are more tired now too... you were going like gangbusters for so long that you are crashing a bit more now without the steroids--and that is actually good because now you can catch up on some sleep--and that will heal you up more too.

I have 670cc in each side now and we will stop around 800. The last fill made my left armpit (where the lymph node was removed) hurt so bad that not even pain meds helped. I was up for two nights with constant shooting pain down my left arm...and I could not find a position to get comfortable.

I'm glad to hear it will go away--or at least lessen. Ulla, I've missed your posts. I feel so bad for you that you have to deal with a language barrier in addition to a cultural difference in treating depression and sadness. I hope you can talk to someone who will help you even a little bit. At least if you can post here, we all seem to understand the emotions and can send you our hugs and love over the internet. Sue, I haven't given you a \"Woop woop\" yet to celebrate your great news, but I sure have been thinking of you and hoping you are having some happier days. Fumi, I'm so sorry your trip didn't end up the way you'd hope, and I know you must be feeling so sad... When you are ready, I'd love to see some photos from your trip. I'm sending positive thoughts your way. Big hugs to you all!",

I really am not as limber as I used to be at age 47 underneath a sink... and trying to pry off 30 year old fixtures... Oh, did I mention that because I couldn't find a replacement for the leaky faucet I just bought a whole new one?  #3. Even though I'm all put back together again (reconstructed), my pec muscles just don't work like they used to... so I needed help from hubs and I just hurt laying there trying to make sense of it all (he worked for an hour -- but can only use one hand due to an childhood accident, so there we were... each using one hand to help.... ) #4... The new faucet is all put together but now we have a couple 'new' leaks in places where the water pressure increased because the faucet isn't leaking... *sigh.. #5. We threw in the towel, pun intended, and gave up until tomorrow.... or the next day...  I just wanted to cry a little... it was THAT hard. I know it will all be OK eventually... it just sucks right now. My left shoulder is still not 'normal' from all the surgeries so laying under a sink didn't help. I wonder when I'll give up on the do-it-myself stuff? It's hard not to when it's so obvious what needs to be done--it's just physically doing it that is rough.

Suebee, some doctor's offices will give you samples if you can't afford an entire month of medication. Also, some pharmaceutical companies will help you pay for your medicine if you contact them; or they will give you coupons or a rebate. When I was taking a couple allergy medications that weren't available in generic I went to the company website and registered (and sent an email) asking if they had any 'frequent buyer' or 'rebate' programs--and they did! It's worth a try if you like the Effexor better. I wondered what date your 'cancerversary' was... I knew what was up in late July, early August, but I had my first surgery (lumpectomy) on Aug 29th, so I guess that is my 'cancerversary'... I think I will do something special, just don't know what.

Sue, I'm so glad you are going to see your doctor next week. It's not fun to feel bad, but it's even worse to worry and wonder about why...  so you will feel better just having a chat with the doctor. I wonder if you have something like we have here where you can call a consulting nurse with questions? It's kind of like a hotline that some hospitals or clinics have just so you don't have to worry about things until your doctor appointment. As to limey or any other expressions--I ususally go to urbandictionary.com to find out about slang. Most of the time I find what I want to know there, and sometimes I find out more than I want to know! LOL!!! My kids are home from college for a just a few hours tonight so we can get a family picture taken! It will be the first one in many years. I am so excited! I don't even care what they are wearing, etc... Best part is that the photo is done for free by professionals for our church directory.  All I had to do was promise my kids (and their friends they brought along) a spaghetti dinner. Hugs to you all!",

Even if it's just rearranging something or puttering around. It must be evening there and that is when you need to be relaxing. Do you still have medication that will help you? I know that when I was worrying and worrying about what 'it' could be, I requested some medication just to help shut off my mind so I could sleep at night and the breast surgeon gave it to me, thank God. You are a smart, brave, lady and I wish anything that you didn't have to worry about Bootface again so soon. Please rest and relax as much as you can. Hugs!",

I had THREE of them about a month ago -- right after I had some dental work done. I took the precautionary antibiotics before the dental work, but it was so soon after my exchange surgery and for some reason the dissolvable stitches just don't dissolve in me, LOL. I got a very red spot which hurt and was sore so I called my doctor who put me on a week of antibiotics. The next week I went in to see her and she removed three long long stitches--one of them was almost two inches long! I then got another week of antibiotics...  So, I'm hopeful this is just an infection. I know that one of my stitches worked its way out after eight months too, so anything can happen. Shirlann, thanks for letting me know about the coritsone. I have had four surgeries in the last 10 months and they pumped me up with a lot of steroids at each surgery. Because I have asthma, my allergist insisted that I have prednisone before my mastectomy along with a breathing treatment before and after each surgery so I did get a lot of cortisone in the last year. That makes complete sense as to why I binge ate after each surgery and felt so hungry! I did sign up with WW again and the ladies there told me to stop being so hard on myself--and that I could probably get back to my goal weight by Christmas (or very close to it) if I just stuck with it. I've got surgery scheduled for Nov 10th so we'll see (more steroids)... Jane, we do our dates in reverse here so my son's birthday is on October 1 and my daughter's is on Nov. 11th. Son will be 24 and daughter will be 22. I can't believe they are so grown up already. Judie, I live near you and Karen, but I'd have to PM you the details... :) I'm a teacher whose been off work a year and now I have an opportunity to work as an assistant in a temporary job that ends at Thanksgiving (but they said I could stop when I have surgery). It's not as many hours of work as a substitute teacher nor the pay, but I think I may do it for some money for Christmas. It is working with special needs young adults 18-22 and a really wonderful teacher. This could help me get my stride back after sitting around all year recovering from surgeries. Anyway, I am going to check it out tomorrow and apply for it. I've been asked to apply for it so it makes me feel good to know that someone is thinking of me. Fumi, I hope you are having the time of your life! Ulla!!! I'm thrilled you are so busy with life and school and getting back into doing what you love. Everyone else... whoever has the kitty--I hope you get her back soon... Hugs to you all!",

And you know, I think it's normal to have some post traumatic stress. The other night I couldn't sleep and suddenly 'remembered' the PAIN I felt when I first woke up from my bilateral mastectomy. I just started to cry and cry and wished that I could forget it. Once I was done crying I was able to sleep... I guess they didn't give me enough amnesia meds or something because I can remember waaaay to much... I think sometimes the emotions can sneak up on us and for me, I just have to go with them whatever they are (anger, grief, etc)...  Roderadio, I chose a bilateral mastectomy with 'immediate' reconstruction (expander placement) a year ago. Four surgeries later (and lots of pain) I have nice soft squishy breast mounds and no cancer. I don't think I had to wait longer than four weeks from initial discovery of 'calcifications' to the lumpectomy. I did wait about another six weeks until the mastectomy in order to coordinate with my breast surgeon, plastic surgeon, and family members who would be taking care of me afterwards. Get as much medical information as you can and then trust your gut. I'm thining of you. I started my temporary job Tuesday--and I love being out in the school again. I miss having my own class but I am working with disabled students as an assistant and I really like it. I only work this job until November when I have my surgery and then I can decide what to do after that. I've had to deal with lots of strange things here like coming home from work to find my bathroom flooeded due to a broken faucet valve--and many other of life's annoyances... and yes, I cried over that flood.... BUT I thought, at least I am alive to take care of it...   **PS... that is a LOT easier to say now that the mess is cleaned up, LOL... but it's very much how I feel... I still get upset over life's troubles, but it just doesn't last as long or seem as bad as before...  For me, THAT is one of the gifts I got from having cancer and losing my breasts.  Hugs to you all.",

I hope to go home tomorrow (Thursday afternoon) Thanks for the good thoughts and healing wishes. I felt them all. Hugs~",

How do they expect you to unload stuff for work? Maybe your employer will pay your fine. I hope you get a break soon; I can't believe they are grinching at you for taking an extra day off for chemo, of all things. Honey, I think I have a sinus infection too, darn it; and I was trying so hard to stay healthy. I went to see my son last weekend at his university (and he'd been sick)... so I probably caught his germs. I spent last Saturday cleaning a bachelor apartment bathroom (yuk) and kitchen, plus doing his laundry, changing his sheets. I wanted to help him since he'd missed a week of work out sick and his place was a mess--because he is so busy with schoolwork... I wouldn't trade my time there for anything though, even a stupid virus... Just need to hurry up and get better before my surgery date June 11th... My daughter is coming over today for a short visit -- so then I will have seen them both in the last week! Yay! Hugs to you all!",

Sue, I want to see a photo of you in those shoes too! Ulla, hope you can get that sore port removal looked at to make sure it's healing OK... I want to thank you for your amazing insight the last few posts you made too. I really agree with you that none of us know when we will die or how--so just because we had cancer doesn't make us any more likely to die or know when or how... We just get to live with a better appreciation for our lives because we fought a tough illness and came out the other side... In some ways I feel more fragile (like how vulnerable our bodies are to disease, etc) but most of the time I'm amazed at my strength and bravery... I still can't believe I had the courage to have a bilateral mastectomy... I still can't believe I did it... We are waaay stronger than we think we are... this I know... Congrats again Sue! Someday I hope we can all meet in person and celebrate.",

I know that if her show is insterested in helping us to meet I will be eternally grateful. There is no way I'd ever afford any kind of trip like that any time soon. I would love to meet everyone too. We could do so much to show how support for each of us facing breast cancer can cross miles, countries, and languages... It has helped me every day, whether I post or not. My memory has trouble keeping up sometimes with who did what or whose real-life name matches their screen nickname too, so I just tend to read a lot and post a little. Olivia's photos are beautiful. She has a natural inner beauty that just radiates from her outer appearance. I love her 'free' prom dress -- it looks like a princess outfit on her. My surgery is in one week--June 11th, and I will get my expanders removed/replaced with silicone implants. I am nervous/scared/excited. Today I went and got some short-sleeved button front tops because I don't own any that fit this shape (and I need looser than my normal stuff to go over the binder/bra I have to wear for a while...) I filled all my pre-surgery prescriptions too--so that means it's really happening!!!  We got new vinyl floors in the kitchen/laundry room yesterday too so I will have a nice clean kitchen to use while I'm recouperating. There are lots of interesting details about my surgery, but the bottom line is that I will look and feel sooo much better when it's done and I'm healed up. The thing I look forward to the most will be sleeping on my stomach and sides again. It's been almost eight months since I've been able to... I have to wait one month after surgery, and then I'm going to sleep and sleep and sleep on my tummy... *ahhh the little things that make life so good. :) Hugs!",

The implants don't hurt though. I hate the side effects from the pain meds (constipation, etc) so I had been trying to take less, but that's not good either. I am definitely hurting, so I'm taking meds... Today I have done nothing but rest, sleep, eat, and I am still tired. I know my foobies are not done healing but one is migrating north and one is going south. (where the expanders were too, darn it) I'm glad I see my PS tomorrow to get stitches out if they are healed because I'm cranky and sore. I hope she will give me some good news. I feel so fortunate to have anything that resembles breasts at all, but all the soreness just gets me down... I'm trying to keep my chin up and all, but today, I just can't. I do not know how you remain so strong and active, Sue. I am beaten down by the least thing... Karen, you must look very young for your pharmacist to think the meds were for your mother. That is a compliment. I think you look cute in your photo--and would probably have made the same assumption. Surgery just takes so much out of me. It messes up my hormones and I have hot flashes for a good week; the side effects from pain meds, my digestion (nausea, etc, too)... then getting used to this body -- which right now is barrel shaped and swollen... I hope that I feel better soon. I have tears thinking about how much this stupid bootface messes up for us. I hope my PS lets me take a shower tomorrow...   Sorry, I guess I just needed to have a little rant. Tomorrow will be better. I just know it.",

I have had two weeks of the most bizzare circumstances (nothing life-threatening) that I have been unable to even post. First, I had a hair disaster two weeks ago... I went to the same stylist who has done my hair for years and is a top colorist to have her dye my hair back to my normal color (dishwater blonde) from the bleached blonde that it was... and much to our surprise it turned RED... Howdy Doody red... and she tried for TWO days to fix it...  until I finally went to a premium salon and they did their best with a new cut and color highlights...  The hair colorist thinks that perhaps all the surgeries put some chemical into my hair that caused a totally unpredictable reaction because there is really no explanation why this happened. Then two days later, my areaola tattoos were canceled because someone forgot to do an allergy test --so I had that done and rescheduled for the next week... AND had to go back and have MORE hair adjustments... so there I was, no areaolas and strawberry blonde hair... I could deal with that OK, until the weekend when I ended up in the ER with a serious intestinal infection. I will spare you the details but it was horrific... and painful. My white count was off the wall... and my poor intestines... So... I rested a few days and poor dear daughter calls from college with some freakish eye pain... so the same day I'm having a CT scan of my tummy she rushes home from college and has a CT scan of her head... What are the odds of that?   She has some kind of sinus cyst but the doctors (and she saw three, opthalmologist, EENT, and family doc) now think she needs a neuro... but she is mildly better -- thank goodness...  I lost four pounds without even trying and then got my tattoos (which are too orangey for my liking, but at least they are fading and in some parts didn't take at all) ...  Then today, a week and two days later, I had minor surgery to remove a fold of skin in my cleavage; where I DO have feeling. So here I sit on pain meds and nausea meds.  BUT, I am thankful and happy. I do have pretty hair, I do have some kind of nipple/areaola (even if they don't look even or perfect) and my tummy is much better...  Hubby got a pink ribbon tattoo on his upper arm so he would be like me and have one too--and that is just so sweet... (if you knew what a nerdy science teacher guy that he is you would neve in a million years think of him as a tattoo guy; and he has a fear of needles).... Even I can't believe it. I just could NOT post all my trivial drama when I was still reeling from it all... and it just pales in comparison to some of the more serious stuff...  But you can laugh that for a while I was a RED headed Howdy Doody with no areaolas.... and a diet of Gatorade and rice... Thankfully, I can eat almost normal foods again...  Life is weird. Cancer is weirder because it puts us in situations where we end up saying and doing things we never imagined... At least I know that I'm a lot stronger than I ever thought I was. Thank you ladies for your inspiration.",

Thank you so much! I have never been to Japan but I would love to go. My daughter has been as an exchange student to Takaktski (I can't spell it) and Abuno, and Kyoto, and others. We have also hosted teachers and students from Japan through an exchange program for several years. I have enjoyed all our guests and learned a lot. My daughter hopes to return to Japan and learn Taiko and other music. She is studying opera singing/performing and hopes to become an ethnomusicologist (specializing in Japanse cultural music perhaps). My older son's girlfriend also has a college degree in Japanese studies and has lived in Japan. She also hopes to return there to teach after she is done with her other college degrees. My dad said Japan was one of his favorite places when he was in the Navy and the ship would stop there. He loved Tokyo. In August it will be one year since my diagnosis and I am just happy to still be alive and have new reconstructed breasts. Thank goodness for early detection! Hugs to you all!!",

Anyway, I am getting some help, but I'm allergic in some way to the antidepressants so I guess for now I won't be getting those. I do have ADHD, so I have a med for that, which does help a little too--I just needed more than a half a pill. Seems like cancer, menopause, etc really changes our bodies... I need all new doses and stuff... My DD came through for me today. She called me up when I was feeling sad (and didn't even know it) and set up a lunch date with me on Monday.

How can 'they' possibly think that changing the mammography guidelines is a good idea???  For whom??? I swear if I'd have had to follow the proposed new screening guidelines I would NOT be here to sign the petition. I was diagnosed at age 45... on a 'routine' mammo... NO symptoms... just there it was one year and it wasn't the previous year. I'm furious that anyone would think a few false positives would be worth missing all the positives for the rest of the forty-somethings... OK, end of rant--please sign the petition.  And, more plate smashing... my DD found out today that a polyp removed from her colon was 'pre-cancerous'... so she's off for genetic testing.... She is only 23--but there is so much cancer on both sides of the family for her--and now this...  I'm smashing a few plates for her. She is fine; young, strong, resilient; and equipped with more knowledge than most about her colon and breast cancer potentials so she will fight the good fight and be fine. However, again, I'm angry to think that someone would try to rob her of her 'early detection'.... Luckily? for her, our history of cancer entitles her to a mammogram at age 35... I pray that she doesn't find something sooner, but thank God that she won't fall into the crappy new recommended screening guidelines... Who'd a thunk I'd be so glad that I have had cancer so she qualifies for a mammogram at a younger age than what is now suggested?  Oh the insanity. Hugs to you all...",

My reflection on 2007 will be the year that I not only lost my breasts but also lost my innocence that I could get cancer. However, it's also the year that I found new friends and felt much of the goodness that humanity has to offer.  My hope is for a cure for breast cancer to be found in 2008 so that no one else, especially my daughter, will suffer from this ever. My late MIL, who finally lost her battle to breast cancer on 12/31/97 told me that she would never give up fighting cancer or helping others. She is an inspiration to me. I sit here looking down at where my breasts used to be--looking at these little mounds, waiting to expand them into some new boobies--and I wonder what she'd say to me now. (although I think I have an idea) Some day I will post some of her journal entries... I asked her to keep a journal while she was going through radiation treatments and all when she had bone mets...  She used to type up a page and mail it to me... then, after she died, hubby and I found another journal--of all that she was thankful for---It was buried in her craft basket under a rag rug she was crocheting.... and it was so full of gratitude and hope. This is how I want to live in 2008, if I can be half as grateful for my life as she was for her painful life, then I will have succeeded. Anyway, I'm rambling...as I sit here watching \"The Sound of Music\" on TV. *singing....    Happy New Year to everyone!",

Anyway, I've never done this before so I hope it's received with the spirit it is given.

If your DH is on the registration, then he can go contest it if he's all that concerned.  I think they'd lower the amount if you went in and told them (or your DH did) about your situation and that you haven't ever missed a license tab before.

Now hubby requests his own hotel room because he knows he snores loudly.  Sheila, I am so glad your Alloderm was finally covered.  My plastic surgeon routinely uses Alloderm to help build the muscle. Mine were so stretched thin that I needed it.  She also told me that using Alloderm makes the recovery less painful. Thank goodness my insurance covered it.  It's not considered experiemental anymore, so I think that's why. Sue, Ulla, and everyone, you all sound like you are in good spirits in spite of all the misery bootface can bring.

I don't have anything but pain (and not constant, but off and on) to blame it on--perhaps that is one SE of bootface... our minds and bodies just change sleep routines until we process it all. I dunno. Sometimes I can sleep all day and other times I'm up for what feels like two days in a row with only a couple hours sleep. Here's hoping you get sleep when you want it, as much as possible. Hugs!",

I did have some (slight) training from the agency I worked for, but most of what I could share was from my own experience breastfeeding my children, and also from my bachelor's degree which included many nutrition classes and child development classes. sue, what is spag bol and where is seychelles? everyone, you have all lived such full and interesting lives--now I just want to know more about everyone... my life has just gotten broader and fuller because of you all... and...

Nancy, I am spitting mad for you. I think a call to a local TV station to out your crappy insurance could help them uncover a good story --even if it's nothing new, it certainly is bad press... and perhaps the insurance company would respond faster... &^*(^*!  I just don't do a good rant--I need Sue to rant for me... LOL... OK, Shirlann, I am soooooo living vicariously through you. I am dreaming every day of a vacation--somewhere warm and sunny where I can just enjoy the scenery and forget my cares for a bit. You absolutely must post photos!!! Those ruby slippers.... just stunning really... we all need a pair! Lisa, I hope you feel better soon--and Ulla, check in when you can...

Are there instructions or a website so I can see what one looks like? My son is home this week from college (I just did TEN loads of his laundry) and my daughter comes home Saturday for next week's break. I have a 'fill' tomorrow early in the morning and as much as I am looking forward to getting the expansion done, I'm not looking forward to the discomfort. I think I'm going to tell them to just put in a little so I will be able to enjoy my kids home for the weekend.",
