I know my chance for having cancer, whether in be in situ or otherwise, is a small chance. But after having my test results for about a week now and trying to figure out a couple things on my own, I decided to reach out. (If youre curious.. my 1st post \"vague radiologist report \" is in the not diagnosed but worried section) I am very interested to know if any of you have ever had this happen. Standing upright, both of my breasts look pretty much as symmetrical as they always have. HOWEVER, after noticing the discharge (which prompted the tests) I noticed when I bend over and sway back and forth..the breast in question doesn't hang quite right. It seems to be \"fixed\" to my skin up top. My left is very very movable. The right \"lags\" behind and LOOKS WISE reminds me a bit of how a water balloon would if it was over filled. I also have nipple deviation on that breast. My left is normal but my right points the opposite direction. On the inner part of my right, at the top, when I sway back and forth (when bending forward) the \"tissue\" is very visible. Where on the left it is not. I would really love to hear if any of you, benign results or not, have experienced this? ??!! I read to do this on a breast exam website. I know it's not a typical way to check your breasts..but I tried it one day and the difference in my breasts are unbelievable. Log in to post a reply",

Here's where I'm stumped.. my surgeon (who removed papilloma ^ is a GENERAL surgeon) did my central duct excision at our local hospital. The hospital is reputable with on-site pathologists. My surgery was same day and on my discharge papers it stated that I have ADH. I'm sure some of you are familiar with EHR'S (electronic health records through patient portals) Not only did it say that on the discharge papers but it's on all my EHR'S through the whole system in the hospital patient portal. It's listed under my \"problem list\" I went for my follow up with the surgeon a few days ago and he acted like he had no idea why they put it on there,as the pathology report did not mention ADH. So now.. I'm very confused. Happy that the papilloma was just that. But am still feeling in the dark about the possibility of the ADH (which I know is NOT cancer or even precancer) anyone ever had a situation like this? There was also an attending physician if that helps. I will attach my pathology report from the excision biopsy and also a pic of a random EHR from the patient portal. EVERYTHING I've read about a patient's \"problem list\" as far as EHR'S are concerned says that section of the EHR is VERY important and NEVER the place for a differential diagnosis, etc. Which was my first thought.

I know the duct ectasia with stasis is a dilation of the ducts. I've been knowing what that is and that I have it since my abnormal mammogram. I don't know if she was referring to the fibro cystic changes and lobular change?? I know that non proliferative fibro cystic change is fine but that proliferative fibro change can be ADH. I dunno it's frustrating trying to figure this out on my own. I shouldn't have to.",

You don't just write things of insignificance on there for no reason. Because that will be on their health record indefinitely. The only way to have it removed is if it's proven that it was added by error or through audit. As we speak.. it's still on there.",

But it's so exhausting and to be honest...not my job! Though I have spent countless hours trying to put the pieces together. I'm just frustrated because I figured he could explain it at the follow up but he didn't. All of the other things on my problem list are 100% accurate. I'm confused as to why this was added. Surely if it was a differential diagnosis or admitting diagnosis they would've put that somewhere other than there. Maybe the surgeon misinterperted my results wrong??? Do they usually say right on the path report if its adh?? I know ADH isn't anything but damn... I think I deserve to atleast know if I have it. Ya know?",

I resorted to asking here because there's simply a lack of information on this online. If you search \"breast fixity while leaning forward\" on Google, you get quite a lot of results. But I've yet to find any real women talking about it. June 3rd will make 2 weeks in between my tests and biopsy. So I've driven myself nutty trying to figure it out.i know regardless of what I find, it doesn't matter, and that I'm sure the surgeon will kn o w exactly what it is. But as I'm sure you know.. the wait can drive you to go to some crazy lengths. I guess the fact that neither my referring dr or the radiologist knew of this issue prior to my tests, to know to look for it, is somewhat unnerving. On top of me having heterogeneously dense breasts. I know I need to STOP searching and just let the surgeon guide me in the right direction. I feel so guilty knowing I'm asking in a place where women have actually been diagnosed and had their lives turned upside down by breast cancer. My issues seem so trivial. I just had to \"know\" if I was alone in what i know I'm seeing in the mirror . Also sorry for the long response. I'm just frustrated and will be so glad for this appt to finally get here!",
