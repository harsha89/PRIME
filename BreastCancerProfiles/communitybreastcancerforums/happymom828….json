I went through early menopause (age 40).  Now 57.  I was not surprised when I got BC.  I knew it would be just a matter of time. What I couldn't figure out, with all my precautions, I was the one who discovered the lump.  So where was it last year on my mammo?  My DCIS was all over the upper quadrant of my boob!  They say by the time cancer is detected it's already been there for 8-10 years!  Go figure.  I certainly don't understand it! How attached are you to your boobs?  That's the big question.  I had to think:  they're attached to me, I'm not attached to them. As far as the estrogen being concentrated in denser boobs, I've not heard that.  I had a hysterectomy in 2000 and part of my BC was still estrogen positive.  Our bodies always produce some estrogen even after menopause or a hysterectomy. Just part of being female! So much depends on your family history, too.  Have you discussed this with your dr?  It is a hard decision, with no guarentees.",

He really should teach other tat artists his talent and knowledge.  I'm sure it would be put to good use.  So sorry you're having such a hard time. :( I've been reading here about a lot of depression and uncertainty even after a few years of good results.  I think what my onc told me has changed my perception.  He said that more and more doctors are looking at BC as a chronic disease that needs to be managed just like diabetes.  There's not a \"cure\" per se, but just like with diabetes, you learn to live with it and take advantage of the breakthru's in medicine to help it be managed.  We all know that diabetes is a killer, just like BC.  But with diet, exercise, meds and being proactive in our health will go a long way to longevity.  Our drs. are supposed to be working for US.  We're paying them boat loads of money (or at least ins., is, but I've got ridiculous premiums!) to make sure we stay on top of things.  And if we feel that we need a scan after several years of non-recurrence, then we should get it.  After all, doesn't it take BC years to form before it's even detected?  After several years, I think a scan is warranted. I really pray for you sisters in the doldrums!  This is such a great place to vent and get support. I hope I haven't ranted too much! ;)  {{{{{{{HUGS}}}}}}} to all. ",

Whippetmom is the bomb when it comes to knowing about our breasts.  They call her the \"breast whisperer\".  She's really great and has helped me tremendously! I know we get tired of yet another surgery!  But, we shouldn't \"settle\", either.  If you're content with your body, then so be it.  If there's a way to make it better, then we should go for it.  And drs. who tell their patients, we shouldn't expect much because, after all, we've had BC, are full of bologna.  That's not an excuse to give up and we should just be grateful for what we have.  How cruel and insensitive.  Ok!  Getting off my soap box now.  :) I do have good news!!  Had a colonoscopy Wednesday (colon cancer in the fam as well as the BC!) and it was clear!!  Clean as a whistle.  LOL.  I had one 5 years ago.  Will have another in 5 years.  I hate the prep stuff!  YUCK!  I've been told the protocol for that test has changed.  Used to be every 10 years.  Has anyone else heard it's changed to more often?
