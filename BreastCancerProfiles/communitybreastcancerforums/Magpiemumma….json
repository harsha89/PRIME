I've followed your struggle - and some struggle with this awful disease it has been. Your experiences have been inspiring and scary. You gave us all an insight into what is to come. I am pleased you are now receiving love, compassion and care. I wish you pain free days and peace. Many gentle hugs to you Judy",

In Sep 2016 I was dx stage IV with Mets to the omentum and bones. I took affinitor ( for 3 weeks before side effects led to this being discontinued); Exemestane and monthly Xgeva shots. In Oct 2017 I was dx with Mets to the liver. I\u2019ve also been diagnosed as a type 2 diabetic in the last 2 months and take metformin 1000mg nightly and 26 units of insulin nightly. I had a liver biopsy which showed that my cancer has changed from ER+; PR+; HER2 - to ER+ (25%) PR- , HER2-. My oncologist says we are now dealing with two different sorts of cancer. Tomorrow I\u2019m starting Xeloda, (2000mg morning, 2000mg nightly) but keeping on with Exemestane. Has anyone else taken an AI with chemo? I hope the Xeloda works for me with few side effects. Best wishes to you all, Cheers Judy",
