      "Content": "DoraFlora wrote: Hello Forum Readers, Thanks for reading my post.  I am a 30-year-old woman.  A few months ago (Start of June) I had pain mostly in underside of left breast.  It felt warm and tender.  My nipples also hurt.  The left breast appeared larger than my right, it also felt heavier.  I did not notice a rash/redness.   There was no discharge.   Just increasing soreness & heaviness.  I went to my doctor who did a breast exam, said he felt a small cyst and sent me for an ultrasound.  A week or so later he called me to say it was just a cyst. The pain/soreness went away.   For July & August I had no breast symptoms other than typical pre-cycle tenderness.    Now, for about 5-6 days my left breast pain is back.  Again the breast is larger, heavy.   It feels like a slight burning pain.  I am also tender beneath the left armpit.   I have again not noticed discharge or any rashy looking spots.   I guess I have two questions:  1) Based on people's personal experience (taken as such, and not as professional opinion) did your symptoms wane or stay consistent?  Have you heard of a case where symptoms presented and then went away for a period of time with no intervention?  Is that something IBC can do? 2.) What possible next steps might be wise for me to explore?    I am torn between asking for another ultrasound and possible biopsy.  (Concerned my DR will see no cause to do that)  Would an MRI or chest show anything of note? Should I seek refferal to an OBGYN?   Or an endocrinologist?  Again, \"should\" is relative.   I guess I am wondering what avenues other people in my similar situation explored.    Thanks in advance. -Dora Log in to post a reply",

I do have an appointment but my PCP didn't have an opening until next Wednesday.  So I am certainly going, but in the meantime my brain has been racing. Although, Kicks, I am so sorry to hear about your experience, though it does reassure me that in your personal history the symptoms presented and did not go away.  Thank you for sharing that with me. I hope a few other people may be able to chime in and let me know if their circumstance was similar...?",
