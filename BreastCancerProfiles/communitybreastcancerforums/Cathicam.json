      "Content": "Oct 13, 2009 05:56AM - edited Oct 13, 2009 05:57AM by Cathicam Melanie, I was diagnosed on sept 10th. They were pretty sure it was cancer from the diagnostic mamogram I had. It was a lump I could feel very easily. For me I was in panic mode alot like you it seems. They set me up with a surgeon and rather then doing a needle biopsy because of where the turmor was being so close to my lymph nodes under my arm I was scheduled for a lumpectomy within two weeks of diagnosis (took a week to get into the surgeon). It did turn out to be cancer, next step was testing to see what stages ect like you have been told. I have one more surgery I have to do and instead of just another lumpectomy I have opted to have a mastectomy because the cancer is aggressive and they didn't get it all.  Most of the choices will be yours and there will be lots. Find someone to go to appointments with you. Have them help to ask the right questions and to make sure that you are getting the care and treatment you need. It is amazing how numb I have been and the things I dont' think about when I'm getting overloaded with so much information. Find someone to be your advocate it really will help you so much. Wishing you the best Cathi",

One thing to do is go over these forums there are alot of good questions posted here to ask, write them down so you won't forget. Also try and take someone with you to your appointment. You are going to be in a bit of shock for awhile and might not always think of things to ask or might miss some of the things told to you at the appointment. Good luck and hopefully it won't be bad news! Cathi",

I'm feeling so wishy washy about it, one minute I know I have made the right choice and the next I'm wondering if I should meet with a plastic surgeon and radiologist first. Then I go back to just lop the dang thing off and get started with treatment, then I have a year to find a plastic surgeon I feel comfortable with and will be able to discuss my options then. My breast surgeon told me the type of cancer I have because of the testing they have done so far is very aggressive I don't feel I have the time to wait around seeing all these specialists. I'm worried if I don't go ahead with the mastectomy that it will spread further or even go into my chest wall or into my other organs.  I have learned far more about breast cancer then I would ever want anyone to have to know. No matter how much I dislike someone I would never wish this hell on them. I spend my days at work laughing and kidding with people trying to make light of things so \"they\" won't worry. How messed up is that? I thought I could just hop into the hospital get the surgery go home the same day like the lumpectomy have 3 or 4 days to recover and go back to work like nothing happened. That was the one question I failed to ask the surgeon when we were at his office. How long will I be in the hospital and how long do I need to take to recover. I'm lucky I work here so I shot him an email just waiting to hear back. Am I being to impatient to want all this behind me? To want to just get it over with and go on about my business like nothing happened? I wish I had more patience. Cathi",

      "Content": "Cathicam wrote: I don't think I will ever forget that day for as long as I live. I have been going through the postings and so releaved to see others going through the gamat of emotions I have gone through. I made a horrible mistake 7 months prior to my diagnosis, I didn't go back for a diagnostic mamo after they found something suspicious. I had for years listened to my mom talk about how they always wanted her to come back and how it was always just a cist or her very fiberous breasts, which all of us girls have. So I took the same attitude towards my findings as she had with hers. That is until my husband found the lump in my breast. I went in the very next day, scheduled a diagnostic mamo which took almost a month to get and then was told I needed a lumpectomy because of the size. It was huge and each day seemed to get bigger or so it seemed and it did, by the time the day for surgery arrive, actually become a visible lump on the side of my breast. I was so hoping it would just be a cist and that I wouldnt' have to worry anymore. When I came out of surgery I was told it was cancer, and that it had gone to my lymph nodes. They removed 26 and 3 had cancer. The results of my biopsy report which came back over a week later were Infiltrating and intraductal carcinoma, grade 3 of 3 with Metastatic ductal carcinoma involving 3 of 5 lymph nodes, including lymph node utilized for frozen section as a sentinal node. The tumor they removed from my breast was 4.5 cm.  I have been going through a rollercoaster of emotions, since there was cancer in the margins I have to go in for another surgery. I was told by my oncologist that I wouldn't have to have a mastectomy that a lumpectomy would be alright unless of course there was cancer in the margins again in which case it would be another surgery. The surgeon that did the first surgery was all hot to do a mastectomy, he is an older surgeon and rather old school in his views. So I went for a second opinion, he is a younger surgeon with high recomendations from everyong I have spoken to. He wouldn't recommend one way or the other but really talked to me about my cancer and my options. I hope I made the right decision as I did opt to have the mastectomy it means I won't have to go and speak to the radiologist first, it also means I will be that much closer to starting my chemo and radiation which I am told I will have to have. Is anyone familiar with my type of cancer? Any advise at all? I'm sick to death of the waiting and worrying that this cancer is still in my body and has possibly spread. I want to get started on chemo but don't want make the wrong choices simply because I hate waiting. Its been over a month since the first surgery and I keep reading here about how long it takes to get things going.  I'm scheduled to have surgery on the 23rd, 2 weeks after I can start my treatments at which time I will go through a battery of tests to see if its spread and to test to see if I have a gene (can't remember the name). I am also Her2 possitive. Extra findings from report The average of Her-2/neu copies per tile: 20.7 The average of cen17 copies per tile: 2.3 Her-2/cen17 value of 10.2 and is therefore considered amplified for the Her-2 gene. ER Positive 5% favorable PR Postive 5% favorable HER-2/nue amplified with a ratio of 20.7/2.3 I don't understand all that but from speaking with my surgeon that will be doing the mastectomy he said my cancer is very aggressive. I'm scared to death over what all this means. Dx 9/10/2009, IDC, 4cm, Stage IV, Grade 2, 3/26 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

He remembers the questions we discussed before and if I forget asks. He has let me make all the choices and has been a wonderful sounding board for all my indecesions of what to do and not to do. I have a journal as well and when I'm feeling troubled I jot things down so I can think it over and go back to see if I can make a decision at another time. One thing I have been thinking of doing is finding an artist to paint something with a non toxic paint on my head, something that will make people stop and ask so I can warn them of the dangers of breast cancer. When I recieved the diagnosis I went to my hair dresser and had them cut my long hair short so I could donate it. I want to make people more aware so they won't make the same mistakes I did. And even with all these ideas I'm scared to death. I worry I was too late and I won't see my youngest grown, that I won't get to meet my grandchildren. I try not to dwell on those thoughts but its hard not to.",

I had hopes for just a few days then maybe back to part time but three weeks is going to drive me nuts. I just don't know how I'm going to handle myself emotionaly after the mastectomy, I think I'm more worried about that then the actual healing aspect of it. I have always been a very well endowed woman and have been very pleased that even though I was large they were even, sensitive and weren't yet hanging down to my waist line. Now not only am I going to be completely lopsided but I feel like I'm going to be mutiliated. With my paticular case I was told I can't have reconstruction until after my chemo and radiation are done which could be a little over a year depending on how I do. I know many women have gone before me but I also know we each handle it differently and I'm not sure if I can handle it as well as I hope I can. I'm making myself sick over this I know I have to do it but every time I think about it I want to throw up or curl in a corner and cry myself to sleep. Thank you everyone for your support and thoughts they do help. Cathi",

I was like you thinking they needed to cover their hiney and the fact it happened to my mom so often. The thing that is bugging me now is this hurry up and wait. I have always been a want it done yesterday kind of person and this waiting to see this doctor and that specialist is killing me. I want to throttle people some times and just get in their face saying. \"Don't you get it my life is at stake here!\" I just have to take a deep breath and try and be patient though it's not easy. I did meet with my surgeon yesterday. I switched from the one that did the lumpectomy as he was old school and I just didn't feel comfortable with him making any more surgical desicions on my behalf. The one I chose however was a surgeon from a large city hospital and all he did while there was breast surgery, lumpectomy and mastectomy. So I feel much more comfortable with him. He sat with my fiance and I for an hour and a half going over my test results, my type of cancer and what it meant to me as far as surgical options and treatment as well as reconstruction down the road. I have found it does pay to be picky and shop around until you find someone you are comfortable with. Just so long as you don't take too long to find someone. Wishing you and everyone all the best.
