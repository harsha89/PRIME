The neuropathy seems to have gotten worse since! I had bilateral mastectomy in Sept and waited almost 2 weeks for pathology. I was totally shocked to find lymphovascular invasion and skin involvement!! So they want me to have radiation! I started last week...they are doing the entire chest wall in two separate fields and have me all marked up with sharpies. They won't let me wash it off or use lotion! I thought you shouldn't get radiation twice? And what about my skin? It is already swollen, bumpy, and hard with lymphadema! I am miserable with fear!
