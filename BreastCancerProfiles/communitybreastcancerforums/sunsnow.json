What did I do to deserve this? Why is my drug addict brother cancer free but me, a mother of 3 kids, got breast cancer? I think I've gone through 4 of the 5 Kubler-Ross stages, but acceptance is not on the horizon yet. Please don't beat yourself up for feeling the grief you feel over your many losses. You've lost your breasts, your perception of control over your health, your security, your self-sufficiency, among the countless other losses. I will say that once some of my stamina came back, I did start to feel somewhat better. Don't be angry with yourself, be angry at the cancer. When it ends up being directed at the wrong people, just explain what you're feeling. Those who love you probably already understand. I wish you strength and peace through this journey. MauraÂ ",

It's a step in camisole and I wore it for the first 10 days while I had the drains in. I found that I liked having something on under my oversized shirts. When the fabric of the shirts rubbed my underarm area and sides, it felt very uncomfortable. My BS said it was the nerves waking up and being overstimulated by the friction from the fabric. My surgery was 3 weeks ago today, and it's been getting better every day, but I still wear a regular cami or fitted t under my shirts to avoid the rubbing.",
