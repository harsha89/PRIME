I did see another surgeon this week, and he says that mastectomy is not even a conversation we need to have. He's consulting with my other doctors, but doesn't think he will change his mind. I already know that my radiation oncologist (who is the chief of the cancer center at one of our hospitals here) agrees. I had said that I wanted to know how much my recurrence risk percentage would drop if I had my boobs off. He said it doesn't work that way, and that I shouldn't be so willing to sacrifice a part of my body when the payback wouldn't be worth it. He's not concerned about recurrence of breast cancer; he says that I should be more concerned about the risk of another type of cancer. Since BC is so \"easily\" diagnosed and treatable, I shouldn't just have the surgery \"just in case\". My oncologist put my risk of another cancer at 15% based on the treatment regimen she is giving me. So I assumed that I could lower that risk by having a mast. But apparently that's not how it works. So, I'm going to consult with the others too of course, and might even get a third opinion, but I'm happy so far. I'd like to avoid that surgery if at all possible!",

But I know my doctors are up to date on the information out there, and trust they they are as right as can be. Deciding to just trust someone and go with their recommendation takes away a lot of my stress. If the surgeon doesn't lay off, he will be sorry. Don't make my NY come out! Don't make me get my flying monkeys!!! Can someone explain \"neoadjuvant\" therapy, vs. \"adjuvant\"? I don't know what the difference is.",

I gave the surgeon a BIG speech when he called, about how I have a TEAM of doctors, and they need to determine together what is best for me. And then I will make the decision on what to do, not THEM. It is my body, and I call the shots, not him or any of the other doctors. I also told him that I never said I wouldn't do the mast, just that I wanted to do chemo first. And that if he had just LISTENED to me the three times I was in his office, he would have KNOWN that. He is the only one who is putting his foot down about doing surgery first. I was SO great in that conversation and totally caught him off guard. I don't think he's used to his patients standing up like that and reminding him that it's OUR bodies, not his. I was doing an end-zone dance after I hung up the phone. It felt so good! Anyway, I had already decided to get a new surgeon, and he of course doesn't know that (because first he needs to put in my port tomorrow!). I'm done with him. He is not a team player and he does not want to accept what the rad and onc are suggesting. I'm going ahead with the chemo, and I'm not worried about that course of action at all. I'm calling another surgeon tomorrow (who the rad had suggested) and making an appointment to see him. I will definitely keep you posted on what happens. ",

My radiologist (who is the chief of one of the cancer centers here) said that she does not know where he is getting his stats, and that there is no study to support them. The MRI was done after the lumpectomy, but the films didn't show anything really, just the report. So we're not sure right now what it is, but it would be removed later (either lumpectomy or mast). She said that it didn't matter if I did chemo first and then the surgery from a recurrence risk perspective. I will be getting a second opinion from another surgeon, but I'm not sure how quickly I can get the appointment. Also, I'm not sure how much input the surgeon is supposed to have as far as timing? Who really knows for sure which should happen first? One doctor tells me that it doesn't matter if I do chemo first, and the surgeon says it does matter, that this is \"news to him\" that chemo can go first.",
