It seems like the most popular location for the port is the chest just above the breast. I heard one woman had hers in her stomache. Anyone have it put anywhere else? I worry about it getting infected. Is there anything I can do to prevent that?",

      "Content": "Apr 9, 2013 09:43PM - edited Apr 9, 2013 09:45PM by SandyinPa So, there can be reseeding from where the cancer began? I just wonder if the chemo is or can kill the cancer in other parts of my body that aren't being removed then why can't it kill the cancer in my breast too? I don't really care about having them. Fine they can go. But surgery is always serious and I just want to make sure it's the best thing for the healing of my body. I have read several/many posts by women who have been around for a long time who had IBC and they all did the same plan; chemo, radiation, remove breasts, chemo again. Are there studies on this anywhere? Where do the doctors get their game plan from? Presumably studies? By the way, thank you everyone for your feedback.",

I though maybe it was a misdiagnosis. No one referred me to an oncologist or suggested additional radiological testing. Log in to post a reply",
