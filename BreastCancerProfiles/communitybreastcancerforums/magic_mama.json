I made the appointment because I had been feeling sore/tenderness in both of my arm pits for several weeks (getting slightly painful over the last few days). She did a CBC and we haven't got the results back yet. There aren't any other symptoms and she didn't seem to be concerned by anything else. She told me to make an appointment for a \"bilateral axillary\" ultrasound and gave me the phone number. She never once mentioned the word cancer during my appt. But when I called to schedule the ultrasound, she sent the order to a breast cancer center. The ultrasound is scheduled for Friday and I'm not sure how long it takes to get blood work back. I'm worried out of my mind! Not knowing is killing me! I've been trying to come up with a diagnosis other than breast cancer but nothing else seems to fit. :( Anything help take your mind off waiting for results? Log in to post a reply",

The doctor told me right then that he didn't see anything. I was so relieved I didn't really ask any other questions about it. I haven't gotten blood work back at all yet either. Does this mean I really dont have anything to worry about or should I have asked for images of the breasts as well? Trying to take this as good news but its hard when I feel like I still dont have the complete picture.",

I wonder if my doctor felt them too, she didnt mention it during the exam. I suppose its possible that these are just swollen lymph nodes, possibly for some non cancer related reason. Just keep getting more scared :( Firday can't come soon enough.",
