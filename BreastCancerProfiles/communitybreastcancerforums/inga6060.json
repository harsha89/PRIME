For instance, something real simple, that I thing has helped me a lot, is putting a drop or 2 of essential oil on liver every day.  Just food for thought.  Stay strong.  Attitude is everything!! ",

Tube came out, and so far haven't had that problem again.  So, I am on a protocol.  And there has been many  positives since then.  However, my cbc panel came back with even lower numbers than I had when I was in the hospital.  And I was not doing well in hospital.  Any ideas?  Can the numbers drop when u r healing?  I was told it was due to trauma happening.  Healing can b traumatizing as well.  Wondering if anyone has experienced this.  Also heard that platinum,.which is in chemo, can cause anemia.  I am not on chemo, but my natural product does contain something similar???
