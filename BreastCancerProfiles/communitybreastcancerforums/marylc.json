I finished 20 radiation treatments--my daughter's wedding was scheduled for 2 weeks after final treatment, and my mother-of-the bride dress has a V-neck. Was really worried about how my skin would look so-- I used Aquaphor ointment 3 times a day (except in morning before radiation). I slathered in on \"from my ear lobes to my waist, both breasts\" as suggested by my nurse. Yes, it was greasy, sticky, etc but it worked. Just pile it on. I wore loose T-shirts and no bra when possible. Did NOT wear underwire bras--too annoying, so got some loose sports bras (Athleta has some great ones). I had some discoloration (like a mild sunburn) and some funny warty looking brown spots. My underarm got dark and did peel a little. Worst thing I experienced was a REALLY itchy nipple that did peel (weird). I had scheduled a sprint triathlon 3 weeks after radiation ended--kept on training for it as best I could (swam until skin got itchy--about half-way thru treatment) and rode my bike and walked when I could. I think exercise really helped--had little fatigue, no nausea. Did do the sprint triathlon and wasn't dead last (I am 61 years old). All-in-all it was much less scary than I had anticipated. I did wear my v-neck dress, no problem. Now I am almost 6 weeks post-radiation--breast looks normal!",
