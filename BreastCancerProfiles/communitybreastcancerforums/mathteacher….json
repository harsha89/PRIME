For once it came in handy.  Both \"I'm cured,\" and \"I'm in remission\" are statements that can't be proved. NED is a medical, \"damed if we know\" statement. The only thing we can say with accuracy is that we have a \"history of cancer.\"",

Did you realize anatomy hasn't changed so the study date doesn't matter? Are you familiar with using Pubmed for research? It might be helpful to learn how to use it since you are giving frequent advice. I realize it's hard for you to accept you were unaware of the medical research when you had your node dissection. But please don't try to talk others into a decision that has already harmed you and all the poor souls on the many Coping with Lymphedema threads. I wish you the best. You have a lifelong disability and it can't be easy falling into that 49% after trusting your doctor. You are in my prayers.

You must have read it wrong. Read the San Antonio study and look at the video of Armando Guiliano, MD http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jnq-LVlgyIw Institutions vary in their resistance to change. I see the San Francisco area doctors are more progressive.",

I wouldn't suggest letting your radiation oncologist anywhere near your nodes. Radiating nodes virtually guarantees lymphedema. I don't know what he meant by tweaking your treatment. Can you get more details? Chemo is temporary. Radiation damage is forever. I have a smart friend who is a lawyer who made her surgeon sign the consent form that she would take no more than three nodes. She had seen her mother suffer with lymphedema and she wasn't going to risk it if she could help it. If you have one positive node they are saying it trumps the Oncotype DX?  It depends on the philosophy of the surgeon. The guidelines are only guidelines. Can you get your surgeon to read the Guiliano study? Do you have the NY Times version? Surgeons don't like reading complex stuff, they like to cut. Ask any nurse :)",

It was quite painful for me. I got cramping almost immediately. So, I went to a bioidentical specialist at the Cleveland Clinic and she prescribed DHEA ovules for vaginal insertion. It is a compounded bioidentical drug. Does anyone know of the bad effects of this? It is 100% helping already and no cramping.She said there is minimal absorption, althought, I've read studies that the vagifem and other estrogen suppositories are absorbed at a higher rate than first expected. She is not monitoring blood levels... just gave it to me and said it wasn't a hormone-which I believe it is of the adrenal glands. -------------------------- I've heard that DHEA vaginal suppositories will soon be a patented prescription item. Anybody else have info on vaginal DHEA?",
