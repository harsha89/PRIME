Thanks Skigirls72 and Deyla for all of the tips! I will definitely read over your posts again when the side effects hit and I am trying to juggle the meds. I got 4 prescriptions filled today. I still need to read the info on them to see what they are used for and when to take them. I almost want it to be Tuesday so I can get started. I'm starting to feel more confident. Wish my husband was, though. He is very nervous and stressed out about the next few months and doesn't want things to change. I keep telling him everything will be okay and it will not be as bad as we anticipate. He should be encouraging me, right?! I guess we all handle stress differently. Plus I have this site to help me sort through my fears and emotions. He tends to keep things to himself. Tricia81-I will be 10 days ahead of you with the AC/T treatment. I have learned a lot from the wonderful girls on this thread and I'm sure you will, too. Hang in there. Well, it's off to bed now so the Easter Bunny can visit!",

I was by far the youngest in the class and received many sympathetic looks...which of course brought tears to my eyes. My mom came with me and she kept tearing up also. The instructor suggested that I take my 14 year old daughter wig shopping with me. She said to try to make a fun afternoon of it. She also mentioned that I would start losing my hair 10 days after the first treatment. That seems real soon. I thought 15 to 17 days was the normal time frame for hair loss. Skigirl72-Timing all of the different medicines with the treatments and side effects sounds so challenging. Did you have to write everything down to keep it straight? Or does it eventually come natural to you? It sounds so overwhelming. I hope I can stay on top of everything like you did. Thanks for sharing the details of your treatment. Maltomlin- I can't wait to be on the other side:) 5 years is something to celebrate! Thanks for the encouraging words. encouraging words!",

I never thought I would join, though! I was expecting my lump to be benign. This site has helped me through the three months it took to remove and diagnose the lump. What a process! I start chemo on April 2. I will be doing 20 weeks of dose dense AC/T. I guess it is time to shop for a wig, scarves, and hats. I am still in disbelief and don't know when the reality of my breast cancer will sink in. I am scared about how my body will react to the chemo. When I read this site I know that I am not alone. I hope to find advice and support from other women starting chemo in April.",

There are so many end of the school year activities coming up and I worry about how I will look and feel. I don't want to miss out on anything. I see that you are doing the AC/T treatment just like I will be. Has it held you back from life's activities? How have you felt? Will I need help with my kids, making food, or cleaning the house? My husband is very supportive but works long hours. Thank you for your insight.",

Within minutes my stomach was fine and I was back to sleep. I was back to normal by day 7. I lost 3 pounds the week of chemo, then gained it back the next week. Both weeks I craved fruit and made lots of fruit smoothies. For a few days I couldn't taste them, so that was sad. I had to put salt on foods that I wouldn't usually salt, like sandwiches and cottage cheese. I drank a lot of water, but found it was harder to get down the second week. I guess that's it for now. My infusion is almost done. I need to come back in tomorrow for the white blood cell shot (neulasta?) then I'm good to go for two weeks.",

Even some of my freckles are raised now and feel dry and a little larger. (I was born and raised in Florida. I keep my dermatologist in business!) I showed my onco my skin and he said it was the chemo fighting off the bad pre-skin cancer areas. If I had bumps/scabs everywhere and not just in the sun exposed area he would have thought it was an allergic reaction to the meds. So, I hope my skin looks better after all my treatments. Could be the one good side effect of chemo for me!",
