It is available at www.butidontlikelemonade.blogspot.com  I intended to start one throughout my mom's journey but between chemo and drs appointments and law school I didn't have time. Now I'm still unemployed and all I have is time so I might as well put it to good use. ",

I'm going to call dad's doctor on Monday to find out more details (dad already gave permission to the doctor to explain the situation). My head is killing me now (um, drank a wee bit last night under the circumstances). I'm planning on calling my PCP to get some anxiety meds to get through this.   Pocketsizevenus...You will get through this. You are a lot stronger than you think you are. The diagnostic/staging/planning stages are the worst (which is what we are in right now with dad). You just have to take everything day by day and one step at a time. Up until last week believe it or not, things were pretty normal and *sometimes* you can forget the whole nasty cancer experience, or at least treat as a bad distant memory. Unfortunately that happy time has been shattered now for my family and its time to pick up the pieces again. How old are you? I'm 26 and still single. My worst fear was that my mom wouldn't live to see me fall in love, get married or have children. Now I'll be lucky to have *a* parent around.",

      "Content": "rdelrigo wrote: I first want to warn you all that this is a little OT. A little history...I'm 26 years old. My mom developed BC three years ago, which was supposed to be DCIS but turned out to be stage IIA with 2+ nodes requiring 4 rounds of AC and 4 rounds of T plus radiation, tamoxifen, lumpectomy and re-excision. She has been NED ever since her surgery. Before her diagnosis and after a \"bad\" mammo with calcifications I just had a \"feeling\" it would turn out to be cancer even though the odds were against it. Turrns out, obviously and unfortunately that I was right.  Flash forward 3 years to now. Two nights ago I had a terrible dream my dad passed away. Then yesterday, the nurse practitioner called with the results of his physical. He had a \"spot\" on the upper part of his right lung found during a routine chest x-ray and they want to do further testing. The hospital called 20 minutes later with an appt for a CT on Thursday. He has to pick his x-ray images from the office today to bring with him to the hospital on Thurs. He will have CT results on Monday.  I am just a basket case right now and terrified that he will have that six letter word I never want to hear again in my life. I still have really bad anxiety and worry about my mom recurring or developing mets nearly every day of my life. I just don't have the energy or stability to deal with this again.  Its enough just worrying about one parent and I feel like I'm going to \"lose it\" if I have to worry about both.   Does anyone have any stories of such a \"spot\" like this turning out to be nothing? My dad was a former smoker but he smoked for 10 years and quit when he was 30 (he's 58 now). He has no other symptoms but did have a bad cold at the time of the physical (which was 3 months ago). I know this is not a lung cancer board, but I've been searching everywhere and can't find a board as caring or supportive for persons who are not diagnosed with lung cancer but worried. I just want to crawl back in bed and sleep and never wake up until this is over. EDITED TO AD--I'm a current smoker and I live at home right now (graduated from Law School last year and still can't find employment). I do not smoke in the house and always smoke outside or in the garage and I don't smoke in the car when my parents are in it. I still feel like if it turns out to be lung cancer it would be my fault and my second hand smoke causing it.

The hard part comes when people have legitimate issues and you can't shoulder their burden along with your own. My best friend is upset because her dad has a spinal condition and will lose his ability to walk. All I can think is at least he won't die like my mom. I know I am being selfish but I can't help it. Btw, if I am not welcome here please let me know. I don't have breast cancer but I was there 100% of the time with my mom until she passed away December 31, 2011.",

      "Content": "rdelrigo wrote: OK my mom was diagnosed with DCIS, then had lumpectomy, axillary node dissection, which revealed a .9cm IDC and 2 nodes positive out of 17. Her margins were not clear so she had a re-excision 2 weeks ago. They took out a fair amount of tissue from her breast...her scar is 3.5-4 inches long but she is a DD so it hard to tell the difference. Its been two weeks since the re-excision and her breast is still swollen from the surgery and her skin around the incision is dimpled now. She also made the comment that her breast is lumpy and hard now (the one that had the surgery). I'm freaking out that she has IBC and the doctors don't know. Now they have run the pathology on the tissue from the first lumpectomy and the re-excision and there was absolutely no mention of IBC. The doctor told her they got all of the cancer out. IF she would have IBC, wouldn't this have shown up in the pathology report. She has been under the care of a breast cancer specialist at the James Cancer center, so I am assuming that she knows about IBC. Are these \"symptoms\" just a side effect from the surgery? She never had any of this prior to the surgery so I am hoping it is just the result of the lumpectomy. I just don't know what to say or do and I don't want to say anything to my mom to scare her but I am scared. Please advise. :-( Daughter of Mother with BC, diagnosed 2/07 stage IIa, .9 cm, er- pr+ her-, +2/13; stage iv with mets to cervical lymph nodes and pleural effusion 9/2010; mets to brain and spinal fluid 9/2011; RIP my beautiful guardian angel 12/31/2012 Log in to post a reply",
