If you do not have full ROM by close to 5-6 week post op you need physio. If you get cording you will need physio. I developed cording and started physio once my drains were out. I am covered for one assessment and 6 treatments post surgery, meaning it is direct billed to Alberta Health Care and I pay nothing. I thought why not goand get help?",

After my last scan they thought there might be subtle progression so I just met with the radiation liver Dr and I could have RFA or targeted radiation. I chose RFA because I felt you need to have less than 4 lesions to qualify and not everyone can have it so I should do it now while I have the chance. Also, radiation can't be given more than 1 or 2 times, so I thought it made more sense to choose RFA. I'll need a repeat special liver ultrasound before. Hoping they can see the area (unless all this mindfulness really made the mets disappear). I mean why not zap them months ago when you could find them!

There are duds everywhere in the world... I am grateful for every single healthcare professional who is trying to save my life. From the first round of taxotere that landed me in the hospital with febrile neutropenia to the interventional radiologist who did my SBRT. My every three week Herceptin and Perjeta and my wonderful team that has resulted in my latest CT scan (Oct 4) \"no new or residual disease\" I have worked in many areas of nursing, from teaching at the university to now working only two days a week as a nurse navigator for breast cancer patients ( worked in breast health 20 years and before I started this journey) I will move mountains to make sure my patients understand their diagnosis, treatment and have the resources they need.

They likely can see mets on CT scan but it's pretty difficult to freeze your skin and stick a needle into the area of concern using CT...it would be more of a blind biopsy. They haven't perfected stereotactic CT biopsies yet as far as I know. It is sorta the same with MRI. They can't crawl into the machine and biopsy things. Until they have an ability to do it stereotacticly they are blind too. I had an ultrasound guided liver biopsy to confirm mets at diagnosis in 2015. Using the ultrasound they can watch the needle enter the area of concern. My lesions are now visible only on CT and not even contrast ultrasound (not sure it that's a good thing or not) You will do fine! Just practice holding your breath for 20sec. The pain is minimal. Good luck and hopefully the results are benign and you won't belong here 😉",

I am in my normal BMI but the 8 months before I was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer denovo, I was on the Dukan Diet. I wanted to loose a few pounds. The diet allowed you to eat as much protein (whole chicken if you wanted) and nothing else for five days (lost 8 pounds) then protein and veggies until you got where you wanted (Lost 18 pounds). It was a rather easy but unhealthy diet. I do have a horrendous family history of breast cancer (genetic testing negative) but always wonder if that unhealthy diet brought it on sooner....
