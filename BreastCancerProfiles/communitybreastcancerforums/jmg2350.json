Biopsy came back as cancer HER2positive. My question is that she used the word metastatic. Isn't that when the cancer returns in another part of the body? We cant get an appointment until the 6/29. She is so, so scared and I wonder if anyone knows why she would use that word. Thanks Log in to post a reply",
