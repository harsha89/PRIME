I've been feeling pretty well since my first chemo treatment, no nausea, just a little indigestion. Yesterday my white blood count was low. I guess it went to work. I took a Flexeril muscle relaxant and an ibuprofen. Today I'll try a Claritan. Why does an anti-histamine help?",

My ps already gave me a prescription for hydrocodone, but from experience I've found it to be useless for me. What is the best post-op pain medicine?",

I don't like to continually take hydrocondone for similar reasons. I am seeing my PS on Monday to have drains removed, and will ask his opinion. Hope you're feeling better.",
