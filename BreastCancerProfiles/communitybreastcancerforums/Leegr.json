A bone scan shortly after showed uptake in my spine, 6 weeks later after scans etc. they felt comfortable enough to tell me it was not related. And it wasn't obviously. The bone scan is extremely sensitive, it can pick up degenerative changes, infections etc. so like my doctors it seems your doctors feel the probability is very unlikely but they want to follow through to insure that is the case. When a radiologist sees you have the diagnosis of BC they always include it as a possible metasteses. I feel there is a good chance it will come out okay from my own situation. Best of luck!",
