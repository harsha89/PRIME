I did get my mammogram report it says; heterogenously dense. It says no findings and no changes compared to 2012 mammogram. I live in California so I'm not sure how the insurance works but a friend of mine also is having trouble getting the insurance to cover her ultrasound because her breasts are dense as well.",

It came back fine but 2012 something \"suspicious\" showed up which prompted an ultrasound, never did say what it was just \"probably benign\" finding. Now I have pain on that same breast no lump though. I went back to my dr. He said no further testing was needed and my insurance will not pay for an ultrasound as there is no mass, and no reason to request it. I'm so mad cause I have pain there, he said the only thing he can do is send me to a specialist for pain management. To make it worse my breast are very, very dense. My entire mammo looked white. Has anyone else experienced this? Any suggestions. Thanks! Log in to post a reply",

I would feel more comfortable having an MRI than seeing a specialist to manage pain. The Dr I am seeing is my OB/GYN. You're very right about the pain, it can be pre- menopausal but I was not aware it can happen in one breast. The weird thing is its sensitive behind the nipple. But I have felt and so did my dr. we both feel no lumps or anything. So frustrating.",
