I am in a TX fog and trying not to second guess myself. Started TX's 8/2012. Chemo (AC), left MX, ALND, chemo (taxol). Currently undergoing RADS and hormone therapy (9 yrs and 11 months to go). :) Planned a trip 11 days after my last RADS. Wanted to celebrate end of TX and BD in a warmer climate. received clearance from RO and BS for travel. Still doing my stretches. Just added more exercise, but no weights allowed. RO does not want me to do MLD until I finish with RADS. been told I don't need any compression devices for flight. I am concerned about LE, but advice I was given was to wait until end of RADS. I took the LE survey/test and scored a 16%. Still have numbness and some tingling under arm and some residual discomfort in the MX area (BS doesn't think there is much to be concerned about). Noticed slight swelling in left hand. I am a frequent flyer and only had issues after a 4+ hr. flights. This is a quick two hour flight to Miami. Just to be on the safe side, I ordered a USB medic alert bracelet and found a Hosp (Mt. Sinai) close to where I stay. Am I being paranoid? Did I cover all my bases? I refuse to let this limit my travel anymore, but I have concerns that I am pushing myself. Please advise. TY in advance. any tricks during flight is also very appreciated.
