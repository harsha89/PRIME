I have to say it came as one heck of a shock, but I am glad its been caught, I wouldn't have known otherwise. I have surgery on the 2nd September. I am told they will insert a wire and then do breast conserving surgery, and remove lymphs. At that stage I hope to know what grade and stage it is, as at the moment I am still playing the waiting game to discover exactly what I am dealing with.    Like everyone, I am more than a little worried, and not really sure what the future holds or what to expect, but its great to be in a place where everyone else understand how you feel. Best Wishes to you all Zoë x Dx 8/12/2008, IDC, ER+/PR- Log in to post a reply",
