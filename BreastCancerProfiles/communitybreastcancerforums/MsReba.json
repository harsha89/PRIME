The rest of the pains, may be due to menopausal changes.  Thanks for listening to me. Jackie",

I not only have a solid lump in each breast (left breast lump bigger than right), but the burning chest pain between my breasts (chest wall pain) has now spread down the left side of my rib cage. My breast burns, the lower part of my ribs are burning and tender. I called the doctor to try to get in to see her on Thursday or Friday, but she is booked up until Wednesday. AAAAAAHHHHH!!! Has anyone else experienced this and had it be cancer? I keep getting told that the pain is a good sign, so it's not cancer. I'm going crazy! Log in to post a reply",
