I am approaching 4 year anniversary since diagnosis with Mets \"Stage IV.\" I am feeling strong, not able to work full time but otherwise, very active. My first diagnosis was stage 1, 7.5 years ago. I have been through hormones, chemo, anti-bodies, and more. Currently on a great clinical trial at Georgetown with Ibrance or palbociclib and 5FU. It is not coming up on Clinicaltrials.org so let me know if interested. It has been a miracle for me.",

Has been a rough week. The mets in my boob area increased in size the day after the infusion, causing serious pain and a scary sized lump. Breast (reconstructed tissue) was swollen and visibly bigger than the other breast. Today the mets under my arm are very painful, even after taking an oxycodone. Good news is the breast swelling is going down and the mets on my clavicle are already much smaller than before I started. 1. Has anyone else on Kadcyla had a palpable and fast increase in size of cancerous lumps right after kadcyla treatment? What happened after that? I am hoping it is a sort of treatment flare that demonstrates a good response. 2. Is anyone else having lymph node pain or other serious pain in soft tissue after starting Kadclyca? 3. Has anyone taken fentanyl patch for pain caused by Kadcyla or other pain? How was it? Doc prescribed it but I am afraid of being so fuzzy I can't function. On other hand, pain is making it hard to function. Other side effects -- tired. No appetite. Had a fever; not sure if related. Feeling blah but I think it is because the pain is getting me down, and the stress of this progression. So glad to have a community of people who understand what I am going through. Sending love and gratitude to all of you.",

Sat 2 am woke up with severe pain in breast where I have a big lump of cancer. Took Fentanyl patch 25. Pain went away in one minute -- doc had said it would take 12 hours. But the patch made me feel woozy so I took it off after a few hours. Yuck, I hate how that patch makes me feel. 2. Slept all day Sat. Felt woozy. Took zofran. Ate breakfast then could eat nothing more. Threw up once. Not sure how much was fentanyl how much was Kadcyla. Pain was totally gone by early Sat afternoon and never came back even after removing patch. 3. Slept sat night. Sunday took zofran every 8 hours. More energy on Sunday. Low appetite. 4. Now it's Monday. No pain, just nausea. Took zofran that helped. VERY sleepy. Hard to get going! Last cycle I was tired for all three weeks, especially in evenings. Nausea all three weeks but not as bad as first few days. Some headaches but I do not know if that was Kadcyla or something else. The palpable lumps of cancer in breast, clavicle, and under arm have shrunk. Most of the shrinking was during the second week of first cycle then it stabilized. Hope next week will shrink more. Scan will be after 3 cycles. For those who have been on it for a while: 1. Do side effects diminish after a few cycles? 2. Do others get headaches from this med? 3. Did it diminish your cancer? If so, for how long? 4. Are you able to work on the Kadcyla? I am working very part time but finding it hard to keep up. 5. What do your doctors say you will try after Kadcyla? 6. How do you deal with lower energy? HTW, I think someone said was taking Advil or Fioricet. My doc said avoid everything with ibuprofen or acetaminophen because of platelets and liver issues. Please check with your doc about that. Blessings and gratitude to all, Thriver      ",

Anyone have experience with that? What else are the options after Kadcyla? The Kadcyla really was hard for me to tolerate with tiredness and nausea, but I wish it had worked nonetheless. My Her2 levels are borderline (negative on first test, positive on FISH but only about level 2+) so maybe that is why kadcyla not working. Anyone else on Kadcyla TDM1 with FISH score for HER2 under 3? Did it work for you?",
