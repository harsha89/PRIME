    "Content": "DarlaApril wrote: I just \"know\" that my 7 yr. old implant is ruptured.  I'm getting tests this week. I've decided to get the implants out and not do any more implants.  After some research, I know its important to find a surgeon who is going to do a thorough job at getting the silicone out!  Assuming if it has migrated out of pocket, etc.  I live in San Diego, but will travel to any surgeon who has extensive background in this.  Any recommendations? Thoughts? Suggestions? I'm at the beginning stage of figuring this all out and scared.  Thanks. Log in to post a reply",
