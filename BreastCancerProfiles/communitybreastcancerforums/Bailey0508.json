I was on a business trip last week and while in the shower at o'dark:30 one morning, noticed a lump under my arm. Didn't have much time to think about it, I had meetings all day, but the next morning, it was not as easy to ignore. I can't say for sure if it was bigger, or that I was just now aware of it, but I realized that it wasn't something I could ignore. Called my Dr. and set up an appointment for tomorrow morning, followed by a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. The lump is probably the size of a grape, hard, and doesn't move, it's pretty deep in there, on the lower inside area of my armpit. I did have a benign cyst removed from my left breast back in 2005, but everything has been fine since then. Big family history with multiple types of cancer, my mother had her thyroid removed due to suspected cancer (we lived in Ireland, different world medically), then she had breast cancer in 1991, had a radical mastectomy, lymph nodes removed and went thru radiation. A couple of years later she had a full hysterectomy (we don't know if she had ovarian or cervical cancer), again she did radiation and recovered. Then in March of 1998 she developed a brain tumor, they determined it was secondary from her breast cancer. They removed the tumor and she had radiation again and went into remission for a few months, before the tumor came back that December, and she ultimately passed in January of 1999. Again, all of her healthcare and treatments were in Ireland, so it's hard to get concrete facts on everything relating to her. Because of her history, and other family history, my doctor is very aggressive with me when anything comes up, like the lump in my breast in 2005, he simply removed it and then did the biopsy on it, and he did the same thing when I had an abnormal pap several years ago, I had surgery to remove the suspicious lesion, and thankfully that came back OK too. A couple of years ago I had an MRI done on my brain because I had an acute confusional migraine, in order to rule out a stroke, and they did find a small tumor, but it is not cancerous, so that's staying put for now. But I have always believed that one day it would happen, not sure when or where it will show up, but I have always believed that it would. I am hoping and praying that tomorrow is not that day!!
