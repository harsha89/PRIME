If your son knows something is up then I think you need to say something. Have you spoken about cancer to them at all?   Sometimes what they think is much worse than what you tell them.  I'm no expert that's for sure, but you may want to tell them that \"mommy is sick again\" and will probably be taking medicine that makes her lose her hair.  I don't know, JMO Good luck Kelly..... by the way the kids are gorgeous and your little puppy looks like my \"toto\" ",

I know from your posts that this is something you have been laboring over.  There's a saying that goes something like \"what do you do if there's an elephant in the room? You introduce him.\" The kids will process this information in their own way.  It sounds like you guys did a terrific job and made sure that the kids know they can ask questions anytime. They will be fine. Take care Kelly, Hugs, Maureen ",
