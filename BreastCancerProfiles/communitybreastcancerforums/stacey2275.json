I regained my full range of motion back, was active practicing yoga, walking, swimming when 3 months later I started to have pain.  I had a tissue expander in and was fully expanded.  Same side as mastectomy.  Physical therapist just diagnosed me with frozen shoulder and a possible rotator cuff tear but it seems like such a coincidence that its the same side as mastectomy and that frozen shoulder is so common but immediately after surgery.  Therapist seems to think it has nothing to do with the breast surgery..... I'm not so sure but if I can see a pattern of other people experiencing the same thing I am I might have my answer.  Please drop a line! Thanks, Stacey 4/27/10 DX DCIS Stage 0 in left breast, 5/12/10 DX DCIS Stage 0 also left breast , multi-focal lower inner quadrant, 4+ cm, BRCA negative, Unilateral mx w/ expanders 6/3 Log in to post a reply",
