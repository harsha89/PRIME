My siblings and I have gotten through the rest of this year, by having Mothers' Day dinner  and the rest of the holidays at her home with our family. No one lives there. But last  Christmas is when we really saw her going down hill. I don't know what we're going to do this holiday season. Is it macabre to have the holidays at her home? We're not ready to let go yet. Thanks ",

Was afraid(even though I snuck in) to find out about Shelli. She was very encouraging to all. I was hoping that a miracle would find her. To Shelli's family. Do not despair. She will always be with you, with that spirit she has. God bless you all and Geeta. She will never be gone from your hearts. Virginia",

But I always try to read your posts as they are so uplifting in your faith. I chime in with the others in urging you not to make such an important decision until you grieve a little. But it is a personal choice and no one can make it for you. It is between you and God. He is surely able. My prayers are with you. God bless. Virginia",
