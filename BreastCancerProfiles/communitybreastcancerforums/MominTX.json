This year when I went for my routine mammogram my doctor changed breast screening providers and now offer 3D mammograms. So I had the 3D mammogram and was called back for an ultrasound. At the ultrasound, the radiologist said she found a \"mass\" (WTH??) at 11 o'clock on the right breast not previously seen on my routine mammograms. My husband and I can't feel this mass although my breast generally feel lumpy and bumpy. I return for a biopsy on Friday (6 days). I asked how worried I should be and the radiologist said the mass has smooth edges. That's all she said. I saw the image of the mass on the ultrasound screen and it was oval in shape. I have been told in the past that my breasts are dense and have fibrocystic changes. So, how worried should I be? Thanks for listening (reading). Log in to post a reply",

I was able to watch the procedure on the ultrasound screen and it was fascinating. I watched as the needle went through the mass and extracted the tissue. A titanium marker was also placed at the spot. I decided not to the get the \"official\" ultrasound report and just spoke with the radiologist and tech. Both assured me it looked benign, but a biopsy was the only way to be sure. That eases my fears some. I spent the last 6 days reading your stories. I am humbled by your strength and courage as you battle this disease. I also spent the last few days taking a walk each morning, watching my 14 yo daughter's soccer practice instead of just dropping her off and attending my son's band concert. I also enjoyed the company of friends at our annual crawfish boil last weekend. Tonight I'm helping my son with a few more review questions before his ACT tomorrow morning. I also spent some time remembering my mother's courageous battle with stage IV lung cancer as she was diagnosed 9 years ago this month and died just 8 weeks after her diagnosis. My results should be available by Wednesday. Thank you for your prayers. You will all be in mine.",

The report will be forwarded to the radiologist for her assessment. If the radiologist agrees with the results as compared to the images, then I have mammograms every 6 months for at least a year. Ladies, it is possible to have a new fibroadenoma after age 50. (I've also read several other instances on this site.) When I brought up my age with the radiologist at the biopsy, she told me it looked like a fibroadenoma and wasn't really concerned with my age. She told me that they tend occur cyclically in young women at the beginning of their childbearing years and in older women before menopause. I wonder why the most of the resources say they occur in 20-30 year olds and are \"rare\" in 40-50 year olds. Oh well, today I'm happy to be an older woman with a fibroadenoma! Now, to schedule that colonoscopy my husband was been bugging me about... This site is an amazing resource. I'm so glad I found it. Thank you for your support.",
