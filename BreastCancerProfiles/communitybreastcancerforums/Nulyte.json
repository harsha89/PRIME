After the surgery all I took was Tylenol but after the drain removal I used a Tylenol with codeine. It definitely was not just a pulling sensation it was pain like stitches ripping. She had already clipped the stitch that held the drain in and that was nothing.I equated the pain the crowning at childbirth and I have a high pain tolerance.",
