The Celebration will be held at the River Ridge Elementary School, where Vicki spent so much time as volunteer, PTO mom and being very involved in her children's education.  Vicki is survived by her husband, Kevin, her children Cameron (13), Morgan (11), Colin (9) and Madison (7), her parents, Val and Patti Reffett, her brothers Mark Reffett and Scott Reffett. \" Vicki's Mom asked that I share this link to Vicki's Guest Book: http://www.legacy.com/gb2/default.aspx?bookid=3307254403020&eid=viewgb_80409 Madison Log in to post a reply",

I do know that there is a way of life that may be dying, i.e. the shrimp, oyster, and fishing industry. Most of our fishermen are second, third generation so therefore their \"way of life\" is dying. The Louisiana barrier islands will be damaged, or destroyed which will expose our state to direct winds from hurricanes. This will put New Orleans and our coastal cities/parishes at greater risk of destruction, so yes; some of our coastal communities could also \"die\" as a result of irreparable damage. Yes, our brown pelicans are being killed and the breeding grounds being destroyed.   I know they don't think there is any comparison between your phrase and their wording. The damage to our people and cost from the oil spill won't be known for years to come. I do feel for all of my neighbors who have lost their livelihood , their beaches, their protection from our barrier islands, etc. Yes, people can move, perhaps change jobs, etc. but at this time they aren't thinking of other options because the disaster is still unfolding.  Thesaurus states dying:   disappearing, failing, fading, vanishing, on its last legs.   I'm sorry if any comment from our area has insulted you.     Again, I really don't think anyone meant the comment as in the sense of \"death\", nor meant to hurt anyone by their choice of wording.   Sorry................",
