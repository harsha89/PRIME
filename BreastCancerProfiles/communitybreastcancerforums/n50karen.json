When that is finished I will start on tamoxifen. I am really worried about the side effects of tamoxifen and not looking forward to that at all. I am looking forward to the support of this group to get me through this journey. It is so nice to be able to share this journey with others who have been through it. Thanks!",

Got through it with minimal side effects, just some fatigue and some red and swollen skin. The Aquaphor and the XClair cream really helped. I go back to the radiation oncologist one more time in 5 weeks for a follow-up skin check and then I am totally done there. I move onto taking the tamoxifen starting tomorrow. I am really scared of the potential side effects although I know everyone responds differently to it. I know I shouldn't worry but I can't help it. I dread the thought of taking medication for 5 years but I will do what I have to do to help prevent recurrence. ",
