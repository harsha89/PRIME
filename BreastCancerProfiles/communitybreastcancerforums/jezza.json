As you know you need all the support you can get at this time...I love this site. When I was dx there were no forums, noone to chat to, or go through it with. I felt really alone. I guess thats why I tell the Aussies that there is also support nearer home. Some meet up, share info on local services...that sort of thing....but to ADD to the support here...not replace it.

I was able to put the drains in there which hid them from my kids cos the children were small then and would have found them a bit confronting. I am in Australia and you usually have to stay in hospital until the drains come out so they can keep an eye on you. I have saline implants and I'm happy with the result.

Your mum would probably only have been offered it if her tumour was over over 1cm or seemed aggressive or if she had positive nodes. From what you say about your mum following Dr's orders I'm sure she wouldn't have refused it if it had been suggested. Unfortunately it is impossible to say whether she would have had a recurrence if she had had chemo. I hope she is going OK. jezza",
