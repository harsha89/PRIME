I sat back and thought, \"why in the world did I not go and get a second opinion before starting my treatment?\" I just never considered it. I heard my oncologist say the word cure and I was like this is my girl. With that being said I was wondering for stage 3c what types of chemo everyone is doing and how many treatments? She has me on 6 cycles of TAC. This was all sparked by an article md Anderson posted on their blog today.... I knew better than to click it....
