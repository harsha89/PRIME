      "Content": "Jan 9, 2014 11:27PM - edited Jan 9, 2014 11:36PM by Kudra You are all making me feel less crazy. My onc went out of town for 2 months. During that time I had a wisdom tooth removed surgically and the mets in my spine have gotten much worse.  I've been on vicoden 5/500 for about a year now. I called his nurse and told her how bad my pain was and she said my onc doesn't really like to perscribe pain meds. Maybe when my condition became more advanced. I'm stage 4, grade three with mets in t9 and L2. I'm palliative at this point. How much more advanced would she like me to be? I was so upset and am having a hard time trusting my onc, who I will see on the 22nd. In the meantime I do have an appointment with a pain clinic within my cancer center.  I'm so sorry I went on and on but I'm facing some harsh realities and feel like my onc who I've trusted has truly let me down. Thank you for letting me know I'm not the only person on pain meds. I hope you find someone who will listen to you for any subsequent procedures. Maybe they have a pain management clinic within your network that could help be an advocate for you. Good luck to you. Thanks for letting me vent.( like I gave anyone a choice) Rebecca",

I saw a pain specialist this week who put me on MS Contin 15 twice a day, then to three times a day in 10 days with my original Vicodin for breakthrough! Pretty close to what Europa gets. I was so relieved I started crying in the office!  It's working out beautifully! My mood is better, pain is close to gone. I had a headache the first day, but that's now gone! Creed, I agree with Europa that you have to listen to your body. If you need the meds your on don't let them pressure you to back off. This has changed my life! I cooked and cleaned today without horrible pain. The woman I saw was so sweet.  Anyone who hasn't gone to pain management , please do so.  Three cheers for quality of life!!!!",

I pretty much just stopped talking to them. I went to a dentist and the nurse saw my chart with \"stage 4\" on it. She tried to save me right in the office! I went to a different dentist. ( I was already scared because I'm on xgeva.) Nel,that's almost hilarious if it weren't so inappropriate! I'd love to get to 60!!!! I'll be 55 in a week. That's so weird for a psychiatrist to say that to a cancer patient! Devine Mrs. M, I agree with everything you said. I did confront her and she did half apologize but obviously our friendship will never be the same. I give her a little extra room because she's having such a rough go of it. I refused some treatments that she agreed to. I'm sure she thinks, like Romansma's mother, that I'm not fighting hard enough. I'm doing what's right for me. So far so good. Romansma, how could your mother think you aren't fighting! I've read your treatments and you are fighting hard! I'm glad you backed her off.",

I literally can't go to a restaurant or the grocery store without running into an old customer. I'm \" that bartender from the saloon that has stage 4 cancer.\" Most of them are very sweet, but I've had several conversations like you were talking about. One, with an old customer. Her- I'm so sorry to hear what you're going through. You look pretty healthy. How are you feeling? Me- Well, ya know, I have a lot of aches and pains but I'm still here!\" Her- Well, we all have aches and pains. That's just part of getting old. Me- Yup, I hear ya. WTF? It wasn't even upsetting, but like you said, it's just exhausting.",

I didnt choose stage 4 breast cancer! Ive worked closely with my oncologist and came up with the plan that was right for my situation.

It has nothing to do with mets. I don't know which side effects come from what. I'm on Arimidex and Faslodex. I do have a lot of aches and pains but I think it's from the anti hormonals. You shouldn't have oral surgery while on Xgeva . They are usually fine with discontinuing its use if you need dental work. I hope this helps.",
