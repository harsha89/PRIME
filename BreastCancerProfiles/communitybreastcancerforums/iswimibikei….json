What I wasn't prepared for was the fact that they wrapped me in a huge bandage and I was wearing a v-neck sweater.  I didn't want to have to explain myself all day--the bandage was visible from the v-neck.  My only instructions after were to keep the bandage on for 24 hours and not pick at the steri strips.  I ony had a small bruise at the site after and I didn't even notice it unless I looked in the mirror.  The sound of the the vacuum assisted device was more intimidating, but it was just a noise.  Honestly, the 2 hours I was there included my waiting time and the time it took to fill out paperwork, do the test, have a marker put in, and everything.  I personally never felt punched in the chest (although it sounded like it).  I guess another interesting thing was that the radiologist who did the procedure is known for having his ipod playing with calming music during the procedure.  You might consider bringing your ipod.",
