I try hard to deal with the moment and not try to let my mind go beyond what facts I already have. It is not always easy but I really try and that helps. I know waiting for tests is hard, I tried to keep busy and keep my mind off it while waiting. Once you have a plan in place it gets easier.

Your anxiety seems to be following the same course mine did and I assume probably most. The first few days were the worst, followed by periods of handling it pretty well and then of course some moments when the anxiety takes over. You will feel better once you have all the results and a plan in place. I read the following and it I think it helps...Remember you are no sicker than you were the day before your diagnosis but now you are doing something about it. I will be thinking of you Wednesday and thinking positive thoughts.",

I applied the Aquaphor they gave me twice a day, after my treatment and again before bed from the very first treatment. Now towards the end 3 times a day. I showered in the morning, lukewarm water and only let the water run over my breast from behind. This way I felt it helped wash away any Aquaphor that was still on my skin from the night before. Also I was more comfortable showering right before treatment since I could not use deodorant under the treatment arm. I did not use any soap on the treatment area and did not rub the area in any way. My skin in sensitive and I am very fair skinned. I am having my last regular treatment treatment ,#28 tomorrow before my 5 boosts, 33 in all. My skin has held up, very red but no breaks or blisters so far. I hate the sticky feeling of the Aquaphor and I know there are other creams but since my skin was doing well I did not want to chance changing it up. I still wore my bra in the beginning but bought a bra extender from Joanne Fabrics so that it was nice and loose. The last two weeks I have not wore a bra at all as I found it too irritating. I wore a tank top usually with a button up shirt. I had to wear all my tank tops backwards so that you would not see my markings as some were high up. While at home I found the most comfortable thing this last two weeks is just wearing my husbands white cotton t-shirts. I took Advil for the inflammation but of course check with your doctor. I only felt fatigued the last two weeks and at the most moderate. Everyone is different and reacts differently. I wish you the best of luck. In the beginning it seems like it will never end, but after the first two weeks it started flying by. It will be behind you before you know it.",

Doing chemo first provides the ability to verify, with the shrinkage of the tumor, that the chemo drugs are working against her cancer. When given after the tumor is removed then we operate in good faith that the cancer cells that might remain behind somewhere within her body are also being destroyed by these specific chemo drugs. You can also submit a question. I did and they answered on their site in 2 days. You can find lots of information there in reading all the Q&A's. http://www.hopkinsbreastcenter.org/services/ask_expert/chemotherapy/",

Thanks for posting :) One thing I would probably go back in time to tell myself back in the day, is not to spend so much time worrying about it, because if it ever happens you will have plenty to worry about then. Do what you can to prevent it by taking the best care of yourself that you can, medically, nutritionally, physically and mentally, and then if it does happen you will know you did everything you could and you will be in the best position possible to deal with it",
