It is not often we hear from husbands on this board. I have a wonderful supportive husband also. Let me recommend a book \"breast cancer husband\" my husband read it cover to cover. It gives a mans perspective of how to deal with the diagnosis and ways to help your wife. You can pick it up at most any book store or order it on Amazon. Take care of yourself and your wife. It will get easier I promise. It's going to be an emotional rollercoaster for a while though. I am 45 I was diagnosed  in 2005. I had radiation. Let me know if I can help in any way. My email address is staceysearcy@hotmail.com Hugs to you and your wife. Stacey",

I would call your MD and ask for Xanax or Ativan. Ativan helps you fall asleep. Xanax will take the edge off a bit. It will be torture to endure this wait without taking something. I remember the sheer panic when I was waiting for my path report. I remember driving 30 miles in the wrong direction try to get to my appointment for my results. The wait is the worst, no doubt about it. But remember you havent been diagnosed with cancer and the chances are in your favor that you wont be. To my understanding 80% of breast lumps are benign. So remember healthy until PROVEN otherwise. Hugs to you. Stacey",

It's right under the nipple underneath an incision from a previous biopsy a long time ago. It appears to be the size of a nickle, it feels irregular and does not move. She is very small so it was easy to locate. I am making her appointment tomorrow. I called my sister in Tennessee but she seemed unconcerned. After all the hurt she has caused me for so many years I still love her. She is my mother and she needs me. I have a feeling it's going to be a looong week.
