I'm sure the anxiety will lessen after the first treatment. Fear of the unknown, I guess. The hair loss, I'm trying to prepare myself. Someone sent me 2 wigs, but they are really long and have to be styled. I've never been one to wear anything on my head, so this should be interesting. At least it will be cold in Chicago. Wish I could just hibernate my way thru the whole ordeal. Sorry, I don't mean to complain. It's just I already have chemo brain and I haven't even started yet. I can't focus on work at all. I try to stay positive and people think I'm so strong. But, today I called my port surgeon to ask about running and he said no. He said I should wait to walk until next week. Too bad. I didn't tell him that I adopted a puppy and have been taking brisk walks every day. I'm just off rambling now. I just wanted to say I'm scared and I appreciate your humor here.",
