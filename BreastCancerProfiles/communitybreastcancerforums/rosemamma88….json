I've found great comfort in reading your stories.  I also cried quite a bit when I found out.  My hair is looking the best and longest it has in a long time, it figures.  I like the comment that one of you made about people who say \"it's only hair,it will grow back\"  yet they're not the ones about to lose theirs!   Oh the things people say.  We should start a topic thread on things people say because if I don't laugh about it I may want to smack them.  I thought I was past this cancer thing.  Had a BMX 2/14/11 for DCIS no cancer in lymph nodes, clear margins (though I think they should have been wider).  Now I am back after finding a lump.  IBC.  ER+ HER2 Positive.  All this after I had a bilateral mastectomy for DCIS!  Anyway, that is another thread that I have explained.  But I am really scared of the chemo. I always thought how blessed I was to have avoided chemo and radiation and the drugs.  But here I am.  We all are part of that \"club\" now and it sucks.  But I know dwelling on the \"why me?\" doesn't change anything.  I am just really clueless of what to expect,  BS mentioned the port today.  Why can't they just do the IV each time?  I don't like something sticking out of my skin for all those months.  I'm sure there are reasons.  And some of you are talking about a \"cold cap\"  What is that? ",
