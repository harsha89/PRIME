My diagnosis was really scary: locally advanced breast cancer (the surgeon said IBC at first because of skin involvement,then he changed to IDC,but it doesn't matter at this point),lots of positive nodes (I had neoadjuvant chemo and no cancer could be found at the time of surgery,but the surgeon thinks I had more than 20 nodes infected), a huge 13 cm tumor,ER/PR-,HER2+++.I am still here,aproaching my 7 year mark,and still doing good.

I was diagnosed in March 2006 a little over 6 years ago with locally advanced breast cancer,ER/PR-,HER2+++, Had lots of lymph nodes involved and still doing great,cancer free. I had neoadjuvat chemo(4 AC followed by 4 Taxotere/Herceptin and continued 1 year of Herceptin),then surgery and radiation and later on DIEP reconstruction. The pathologic report showed no cancer in my breast or nodes after chemo. I had prophylactic mastectomy on my healthy breast ,bu this was only my choice. Marina",
