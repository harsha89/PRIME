Have been preparing with a focus on getting into fighting shape. so am out everyday, long hikes in the mountains with my dogs, hitting the gym, cooking up a storm, cleaning out closets and spending time with the family. Trying to stay calm and positive (hence the handle). Also have a haircut (short) and colour penciled in. Anyone out there contacted a physio with expertise in breast care prior to surgery? thought it might help to hear about anything I can do to speed up recovery, deal with whatever treatment comes my way after and generally get on with life. will be thinking of you all as surgery dates comes and go. ps I LOVE John Hiatt, last time he was in my neck of the woods I had to miss the concert cause I was 9 months pregnant! Enjoy !",

Maybe it was the long hot wonderful shower I got to have in the hospital before my last dressing change? had some nausea and vomiting from anesthesia first night but have now gone more than 24 hours without pain killers and without pain. the drains, 4 of them, are definitely a nuisance but am not having the tugging issues, just a little seepage from insert sites. I've also been instructed to wear loose shirt, no bra or loose sport bra and have found several hoodies and fleece jackets that have open top pockets on the inside where my drains neatly fit. Who knew I had a closet full of post MX clothing?!  I am doing the laundry, looking forward to a walk and pretty much look like pre mx me with my pockets overstuffed. Shared a hospital room with two wonderful women at different stages of the BC story, that was also an inspiration. Best to all in the quest for health ... my message is simple, don't fear the MX it's going to be okay.",

The shower I got to have before leaving the hospital was the idea of my nurses who said go for it, then we can give you your dressing change and send you home. It was wonderful. I have a question, am on my way to ambulatory care to get one, maybe two! drains out. Does it hurt?",
