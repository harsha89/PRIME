She had a mastectomy in feb 2011 and is now on 3 different chemo drugs and then goes for radiotherypy after. She unfortunitly can not afford Herceptin, so she is not on that. I would like to know how long you have been free of this disease, have you had a recurrence, what drugs you were on and what type of medication you had, as well as how long ago you were dianosed. I would love to know about others with the same characteristics as my mom, because the doctors dont have much hope for her- but i have heard their are many women who have this and live long! Tumor size 5cm x 4cm infiltrating ductal carcinoma grade II lypmhovascular infiltration identified tumor located at <0.5mm from resection margins adenosis fibrocystic change metastatic ductal carcinoma in 8/24 lymph nodes Please let me know as much as u can about yourself, and your experience...

Roche (company that makes this drug) says they are not allowed to lower the price, give out samples, or anything. She went for her 3rd chemo yesterday, and the doctors told her yesterday again, that her chances arent good. The thing is, why do they make such a big deal over Herceptin, when so many of our women in this country and other countries are not able to get access to this drug because they CANT AFFORD it! this is very upsetting.... Thanx anyway...",
