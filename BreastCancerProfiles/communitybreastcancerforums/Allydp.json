I'll figure it out eventually.  BikerLee - I just recently found that group and posted recently! It's awesome! Having such a supportive community makes the possible decision not to reconstruct much easier. Our journey's sound like they're very similar...triple negative, same stage, same chemo regimen\u2026I hope I follow you with the pCR! Thanks so much for your comment.

I truly appreciate it!   Lettinggo, wow, we do have very similar dx's and treatment paths! How did your PS consults go? Have you made a decision yet? You should have only 1 more chemo left, right? That is awesome! The Carbo really kicks my butt. I have 7 more weeks to go, with only 2 being Carbo since I get that as dose dense every 3 weeks. I cannot wait to be done.  I feel a little sheepish coming back here since I have decided to go forward with reconstruction. It was an excruciating decision for me and I still sometimes question if I'm making the right choice. At the end of the day, I feel like my apprehension is mostly my fight mode talking - that when the dust settles, I will regret not reconstructing. I met with a PS who has a lot of experience with radiated breasts, which also helped my decision. I am going much smaller. I'm currently a 32D and will hopefully reconstruct to a small B. I am just praying that I don't end up a statistic and run into lots of complications. If I do, I will remove the implants and be done with it. Something else that aided in my decision was I ended up joining a few flat and fabulous online groups. One of the things I kept reading is how they missed their breasts, or were self conscience when people stared. I could see myself feeling this way. I didn't want to be envious of women with breasts for the rest of my life, and I think I would be. So, for better or worse, I'm going through with it. I hope I haven't offended anyone here with my thoughts or reasons. Your feedback has been immensely helpful for me as I hashed all this out. I wish you all the very, very best! ",

I've combed these boards along with many others, trying to decide if I want reconstruction or not. I'll be having a BMX and prophylactic tube and ovary removal in the fall. I'm seriously considering not doing reconstruction. I just can't imagine opting for more surgery and running the risks. I feel like, just get me through this treatment with the least amount of surgery as possible and let me get on with my life. Plus, I'm not all that impressed with any pics I see of implant reconstruction, which is my only option. I've seen a lot of older women mention that if they were younger, say in their 30's or 40's, they would have considered getting recon and not gone flat. So I thought I'd ask the younger women specifically, do you regret your decision? Was your family supportive? My husband is very supportive no matter what I decide, but I've already had family ask, \"Will you wake up with implants? Meaning, \"You won't have to ever be flat will you?\" So this makes me nervous, even though ultimately I know I shouldn't care what they think. Mostly, I'm just wondering if you regret your decision. Thanks so much for any thoughts you could pass along.

About half way through Taxol/Carbo I started to get the fuzz\u2026but only on the back and sides. As of today, I have more fuzz on the back and sides and only a few stray hairs on the top. I've got the whole male patterned baldness thing going and it's really starting to worry me. Before chemo, my hair had been thinning on top for about 3 years, to the point where I could notice my part widening. I'm wondering if whatever was causing my thinning before is preventing the growth now. I know it's super early, as I'm only 3 weeks out from chemo, but is it normal to not have growth on top at first? When do you think the top will start filling in?  Jules - hi! I'm so sorry you're also dealing with this, but I was a little relieved to see your photos as I'm hoping this is a normal growth pattern for some of us and it will eventually come in. My head looks pretty much the same as yours. Have you seen any growth on top yet? Like you, I'm obsessed with checking. Cancer has taken so much from me\u2026my ability to have children, my peace of mind\u2026I just can't imagine it taking my hair too. ",

You mentioned once you achieve your desired thickness, you plan to drop down to the men's once a day. Does that mean you feel using the women's twice a day is more effective? I was considering starting out with the men's once a day and then dropping down long-term to the women's once a day. But if you feel it's more effective to use it twice a day, I'll go that route.

It's starting to get to an awkward stage, but I'm trying to embrace it, have fun and learn new styles. So far it's the exact same texture as before. It's darker, though, which I'm still getting used to. I plan on highlighting it my normal blonde, but I'd like to wait and let it grow out as healthy as possible first. I've only cleaned up my nape so far, but I think I'm due for a trim in the back. I'm using Rogaine and it's really worked for me.

I was pretty concerned about it and posted here a number of times asking if anyone else had experienced the same issue. I finally ended up trying Rogaine and it jump started the growth. My sides and back still grow faster and are a bit thicker, but it was like that pre-chemo as well. As others told me, just give it time. It will come back!

I started shaving it once a week during those final weeks of chemo just to feel groomed and not so unkempt. It started to officially grow back about two weeks after my final chemo, but only on the back and sides. So two weeks PFC (I'm assuming that means post final chemo\u2026I hope!), I shaved it again since I felt there was no sense in growing in just the back and sides.  Just in the last week it's started to fill in A LITTLE BIT on the top, but it's definitely no where near my normal thickness, as you can still see my scalp. I'll probably continue to shave it until my pre-chemo thickness returns. That way I can grow it out nice and evenly without any bald spots. So I guess keeping the end result in mind is where I get the courage to keep shaving it, although I'm still terrified the top will never completely fill in.  Here are some pics. The top 3 are 3 weeks PFC, just after I shaved off a whole bunch of fuzz. The bottom 3 are current, which is 6 weeks PFC. For just 3 weeks in between, it seems to be growing quickly\u2026just not as much on the top as I'd like! Oh, and once I got rid of the white fuzz, my normal color and texture returned.  ",

I'd highly recommend it. So far the color and texture is the same as before. I actually went out today without my hat for the very first time. I was extremely self conscience, but it was also liberating! ",

I haven't cut a single strand except a few buzz downs in the very beginning to get rid of the initial white fuzz, and of course a few trims in the back to prevent a mullet. Although I've recently let that part grow out a bit in order to fake more of a stacked bob. My trick to creating that stacked look is I spray hairspray on a round brush and roll the mullet portion up and out into the longer hair, throw in some backcombing, and voila! I finally added a few highlights, but even the small amount caused some damage. I'm bummed because I used to be light blonde and don't think I'll get back there. It's wavier, which I don't mind. It also seemed to be thicker for the first 6 months or so, but it's thinned out. I think the light weight and short hair strands were creating an illusion of thickness. Now that it's longer and heavier, my part is wider. My hair was thinning before chemo though, so basically it's grown back exactly the same. I have Hashimoto's, an autoimmune thyroid disease unrelated to cancer or chemo, which is the likely cause. I use a product called Toppix and dry shampoo to disguise the wide part. Regardless, it's awesome to finally have some length again and be past the pixie. And on the subject of facial hair, I had to shave my face for a few months post chemo. All is back to normal now. No more fuzz. ",

I didn't realize any of you had responded! You all have me in tears and I can't tell you how much I appreciate your comforting words. My symptoms have advanced and so the last few days have continued to be filled with worry. In addition to pain in my sternum and ribs, I now have pain and lots of pressure in and around my spine. If I sit certain ways, the pain radiates to my shoulder blades and other areas. Everything I'm reading points towards mets and not taxol, although it's hard to believe this would all come on so suddenly with mets. Coincidentally, my onc called yesterday to hold back my chemo (counts too low). I broke down crying and told her I was struggling to believe my pain was from the taxol since it's so localized and in such ominous areas. She told me based on my recent scans, she is \"100% sure it's not mets and is sure it's the taxol.\"  However, she agreed to do another bone scan for my peace of mind, which is tomorrow. If it's clear, I will just have to put this issue to rest. I can't go on worrying like this. I can't eat, sleep or concentrate. I'm so embarrassed and disappointed in myself for getting this worked up. I actually scheduled an appointment with my cancer center's social worker for tomorrow after my scan. I'm hoping she can give me some tools to work through these fears.  Does my worsening pain and pressure still sound like a taxol SE? I'm a person who tries to deal with things before they happen\u2026it's always been my way of coping. In this particular instance, I wish I could turn that coping mechanism off!   MinusTwo - yes, next week I'll be half way through chemo and will do BMX, rads and recon in the fall/winter. I hope my surgeons run the same scans as you had.  Thank you all again so much for your responses. I appreciate them more than I can say.  (((Hugs)))",

I was dx with stage IIa, grade 3, triple negative BC at the end of January. At that time, I had a CT and bone scan which were clear, however, my MRI showed a suspicious mass on my sternum. One radiologist thought it was mets, another thought it was a benign growth I was possibly born with. My BS originally wanted to biopsy the mass, but ended up consulting a team at Sloan Kettering for a second opinion. They looked at all my scans and suggested a PET instead - they said if it was cancer, there would be uptake. My PET was clear and it was officially ruled benign. I was assured up and down there was no need for the bone biopsy. Well, fast forward to today and I've developed daily sharp pains in my sternum and rib (cancer side). The pain started pretty abruptly about 3 weeks ago, just after I switched from AC to carbo/taxol. Both my BS and onc believe the pains to be a side effect of the taxol and have said there's no other scans to run since all mine were clear just 3 months ago. I'm having a very hard time accepting this. Yes, it coincides with starting the taxol, but it just seems too coincidental to be my sternum\u2026and now my rib too. The pain is always in the exact same two spots and will sometimes radiate to my shoulder blade. I notice it once in a while during the day, but mostly at night when I lay down and when I wake up in the morning. Switching positions in bed seems to set them off more. I don't know what to do, but I have to put this to rest one way or another. My thoughts are absolutely consumed with this and when the pain sets in, I go into a sheer panic. I feel like I have 3 options. Push for another scan, but which scan at this point? We know the mass will show up on MRI... Push for a biopsy? Or try and trust this is the taxol messing with me? I'm assuming they'll do more scans when I finish chemo, before surgery? Should I hold out until then? I greatly appreciate any thoughts you could pass along. ",

My onc believes that because this was clear, as well as my bone scan and CT, that there's absolutely no evidence of stage IV disease. As of now, she is saying no the MRI. I understand where she's coming from and I do believe bone mets would be very unlikely at this point. However, the fact remains that I have a mass on my sternum, a benign tumor to be exact, which only shows up on MRI. I'm having new pain in my sternum. Seems like the logical thing to do is take a peak at that tumor, especially since the pain has spread to my ribs and spine. I'm seeing her monday morning and will lay out my reasons for wanting the MRI. If nothing else, maybe she can refer me to someone who will monitor the benign tumor as a separate thing.  I desperately want to believe this is all taxol related. What's hard for me is the pain is also at times accompanied by pressure\u2026and it never goes away. Everything I read about taxol SE's, says they only last so many days and at some point let up before the next infusion. My pain comes and goes, but has never gone away. Even now, after not having chemo this week due to low counts, I still have the same amount of pain and pressure. ",

My husband and I have done two IVF's this year in hopes of conceiving our first baby. After the 2nd failed IVF cycle this past October, the lymph nodes under my arms became swollen. They would come and go and different ones under each arm would swell at different times. This lasted for 2 months. I was told by my PCP that it was either a reactivation of Epstein Barr or a reaction from all the hormone shots I'd taken (high dose FSH, estrogen and progesterone).  Shortly after my lymph nodes became swollen, around November, I noticed a hardening on the underside of my left breast. I'm 33 years old and have always had very lumpy breasts, so I decided to keep an eye on it. The holidays went by as time got away from me and just last week I decided to poke around and see if things felt any different. I was quite alarmed to feel the hardened area was now a large lump - just over an inch long I'd say. I called my obgyn and fortunately saw her the next day and went for the mammogram this morning.  The woman who performed my mammogram took many views of the mass and I had an ultrasound immediately after. The ultrasound is routine with any mass, however, I was asked to wait and then told they needed more views. I went back in for another ultrasound at which time a surgeon came in and explained that the mass I had was definitely solid and they also found two of my lymph nodes to have a thickening appearance. He asked if I could clear my schedule and do the biopsy today and of course I said yes. I'm supposed to hear results by the weekend.  So I'm home now and it's kind of sinking in that this could actually be something. The day is a blur and I wish I would've asked more questions. I see there's a rating they give to mammograms. I have no idea what mine was. No one told me size either. Looked to be about the size of a golf ball on the ultrasound, with two tiny spots around it. No one would tell me anything except it was a solid mass and I'd have to wait for pathology. The only comment I got was from a nurse who said, \"If it is something, you're in very good hands. We have a great group here.\"  Could someone please tell me what the chances are of this being malignant? Does the urgency of the biopsy speak to their suspicion? How could it grow so much in just a 3 month's time? Could the hormones I took for the IVF's in the past year feed it? The lymph nodes worry me the most. What does a \"thickening\" mean?  Thanks so much for taking the time to read and respond. I hate to play the what if game, but I'd rather brace myself now.
