The operation was in mid-September (2cm diameter). At the beginning of November I received the first dose of chemotherapy. It should take another dose for 4 days. I'm worried since last 2-3 days I have elevated temperature and last 10 days cough. Tumor markers are normal all the time, and all lymph nodes were clean after surgery. Is it possible that lung metastasis will occur in such a short time? How much are tumor markers reliable in the context of disease spreading to distant organs?",

I'm taking AC mix of chemo for now, cough started 5-7 days after first dose, and started to be a little rougher after 2 weeks, in the same time as i got 37.5 degrees temperature. After 3-4 days temperature is gone but cough is still here. They did MRI of both breasts and chest wall before surgery, everything was clean. Surgeon said tnat PET-CT is not necessary, that I should do it after chemo",

      "Content": "Dec 15, 2018 03:31PM - edited Dec 15, 2018 03:32PM by Beznaranca Hi everyone. I have some doubts about tumor biopsy findings prior to surgery, PHD findings after surgery, and PHD finding on the tumor site 2 months after surgery. Here's the finding one by one. Biopsy 2 weeks before surgery said: Size: 25mm Grade:2 ER 100%+, PR-, HER2- Vascular component - there is no In situ component - there is no KI67 - 54% PHD after my operation said: Segmenter mastectomy of block 4.5*4*3.5cm dimensions. Inferior surgical limit 1.6cm, anterior 0.3cm, posterior 1.3cm, lateral 1.5cm. Medical surgical limit 2cm distance, tumor size 2.3cm. Gradus: 3 Necrose in invasive tumor: no Peritumoral lymphatic/vascular cavity inventory: no Surgical limits: there is no tumor Tumor's nearest surgical limit: anterior 0.3cm, superior 0.6cm No metastasis in sentinel and 7 more lymph nodes Ki 67 - 61% Er - 100% Her 2 neg Pr neg We've done a revision of part of the tumor 2 months after the operation and it said: Size of a sample: 1*1 cm ER - 100% Her2 - negative PR - negative Grade: 2 Lymph - vascular invasion - yes Ki67 - 44% In situ component - no Let us know this part for the lymphatic vascular invasion and tumor grade. Who to trust? Biopsy, PHD after surgery or PHD revision? What is the lymphatic vascular invasion at all, is it despite the good sign that the tumor is not in the lymph nodes?",

I was diagnosed with 2cm large breast cancer in the lower left part of the breast that did not affect any lymph nodes. \nAfter surgery and chemotherapy six weeks ago I worked on CT and MRI scans that showed me to be clean as baby's ass.\nHowever, at the back of 3 weeks, on the opposite side of the breast (right), one third of the breast is red, painful and under the swelling of day-to-day,\n an expressively growing lump (over 2cm within 2 weeks).
