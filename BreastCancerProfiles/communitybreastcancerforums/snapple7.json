Started Tamox 12/1 and am 'fuzzy' on my face and neck and shoulders. I thought it must be Tamox but I heard from a couple of members it's more likely to be chemo. Did any of you have facial hair that started this late after chemo ended? (2-3 mo) Did it last or get worse/go away? Thank you so much! I hate to start shaving and end up with a REAL beard! Snapple",
