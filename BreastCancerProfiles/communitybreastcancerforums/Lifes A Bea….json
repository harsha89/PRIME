I went 2 yrs on a wait and watch schedule with my old doctor til I finally found a BS that would do a biopsy on the area of concern in my breast..Granted it was non-palapable so was only visible on mammo/us.. My biopsy came back benign..Remember as well that 80% of breast lumps are benign :)",

You may want to take something to calm your nerves if you don't handle procedures well, I did not take anything drove myself to and from appt.  Just make sure to wear a button up shirt (wish I would've known this) and if you have a bra that fastens in the front would be great as well. Make sure to ice the area.. Best wishes and I hope your biopsy goes smoothly!",
