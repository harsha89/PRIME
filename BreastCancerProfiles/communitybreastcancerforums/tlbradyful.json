They have promised to give me a ton of meds to counteract that in my IV on the day of chemo and said it should last for a day or two. Did they give you Emend in your IV? Triple + does give them several known ways to attack.",

I will be having TAC once every 3 weeks, 6 doses. I cut my hair really short to help adjust to seeing myself without my normal hair. So far, it's still sad. I bought a wig that I am reasonably ok with and got a free one from American Cancer. It is beautiful real human hair and it is one length so your hairdresser can cut it into your old style. I will use it for special occasions only because you have to style it like your own hair. It is donated by Pantene. I attend the Look Good Feel Better seminar and it was a helpful reminder of how bacteria spreads through makeup and showed me how to draw on eyebrows and put on a wig. It was worth it. There were lots of free samples of products I haven't tried, but found interesting. It was also nice to meet women at the same stage as I am. Well, here we go. I'm pulling for you all.",

I am amazed to hear so many of you are keeping up with your lives. I thought I would be locked in the house for 4 months. Please continue to post progress and ideas that work. I have the white board for meds and used it through my three surgeries. I also wrote the brand name and what it is for on the prescription bottles with a sharpie. That helps too. kobrien - I had my toes done this past weekend before I started. I'm proud of how well all of you that have started are doing!",

I am not healed enough from my surgery last week and am still anemic with low iron and very low B-12. I haven't even started the chemo, but am having issues. I am very excited for those of you that have started this week. I am encouraged to hear how you are able to manage the symptoms. I haven't heard about the OPI Nail Envy and soaking your nails in ice. Let me know.Â ",
