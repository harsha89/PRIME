Has anyone else out there had neoadjuvant therapy before a lumpectomy or mastectomy?",

So, they removed 17 nodes when they did the lumpectomy?  I'm assuming you also had a sentinel node biopsy before you started chemo, right?  If so, what did that show?  I am a bit confused, being new to all of  this.",
