I was dx in mid-July with IDC, stage II, 3.5 cm, triple -, and no lymph involvement, and had a dbl mast on 8/2 with reconstruction. I had my port placed on 9/2 and have already had my first dose of AC (will get 4 and then 4 of Taxol). I am doing dose dense, which is great as I will be done sooner than later. I was really surprised that it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. The AC treatment just made me feel REALLY hung over for about 3 days and then I was fine. My second tx is this Wed. and then the week following that will be when the hair goes, which I am really upset about. The surgery was easy compared to how I think I'm going to feel about the hair, isn't that weird? Anyway, I'm glad to see that I have a few people going through the same thing at the same time, which is comforting to know that I'm not alone. Hang in there everyone!",
