On the website \"Living Beyond Breast Cancer\" Their is a podcast on Her2 positive cancer done in August 2016 (and you can still access it) and one of the women had been on Herceptin for almost 19 years. I also worked with two sisters who had another sister who was diagnosed with triple positive cancer when her daughter was 14 months old. Her doctor told her to get her affairs in order. She is still alive today and her daughter (the little 14 month old) is now in college. There are no guarantees but longevity is possible. Gentle hugs to you both.",

I didn't have quite the same experience as you, but this past March when I went in for my screening mammogram at 20 months after my original diagnosis, they found new calcifications that had not been there when I had my MRI in September (nor were they there in a mammo I had done in July.) Because there were so small and so many there was no way for them to decide which of these to biopsy and the radiologist thought they were probably from the trauma of surgery and/or radiation and unlikely to be cancer. So, it was decided to wait six months and do a diagnostic mammo and my annual MRI the following September. It was like waiting for the results of your biopsy for six months. Fortunately, in September they found the calcifications to be stable and no evidence of cancer. I will go back to a screening mammogram in March. I know I will still be very nervous when March rolls around. I hope your biopsy comes back negative for cancer and you get peace of mind. You are in my thought and prayers. Sending gentle hugs your way.",
