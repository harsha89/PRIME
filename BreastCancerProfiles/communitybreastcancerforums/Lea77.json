I found another lump recently and went to see the Dr. on the 17th. He scheduled a mammo for the next day because since I have a family history of bc. They did the mammo and I expected to hear the same. That it was just a cyst but they said they needed to do a sonogram as well. They told me the lump might be a fibroadenoma but that it \"looks a little different.\" So I need a biopsy. I got the call today I go Jan. 7th for the biopsy. I noticed a couple days ago my armpit on that side was aching. It's not a sharp pain but constant so I checked it. It hurts more when touching and I found a small lump. I told the nurse today when she called me and she said to tell them when I go for the biopsy. My question is should I call them before my appointment and tell them about it or wait? I'm sorry this is so long. I haven't told anyone and I guess I just needed to. Log in to post a reply",
