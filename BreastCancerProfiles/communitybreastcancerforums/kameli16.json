I massaged her scalp as it was sore.. and we gathered all her hair in a bag.. to do exactly what you said in the spring- to put it out for the birds to make a nest!!!! Then with only a few patches left my dad buzzed it.. It was the hardest for her so far but we were all a part of it. My brother even shaved his head with her. Last night I picked her up to go to dinner and to the Feel good look good class and my dad took the pic I have as my profile pic.. I just love her sooo much=)",
