Otherwise they wouldn't take just one out for people who only have two and that happens all the time. I'm glad you find them to be \"ingenious\" \u2013 I find them to be torturous! I get why they're needed, blah, blah, blah but they just plain suck (but then again I had them for 7 weeks - yes, you read that correctly \u2013 seven. Guh!) Yvonne_M, your surgeon sounds like an ass. I'm sorry you had that experience. I can't believe they didn't give you any pre-op instructions for drains. As for measuring output on them you need to measure each side separately. Make sure you're writing down each measurement separately for each drain to take with you for your post-op appointments. I'm sure you'll be glad to be shot of the guy when this is all over. I've \"fired\" a few doctors for various reasons and a guy like that would be gone from my world in no time. For everyone who has asked about bras (sorry, so many posts to catch up on after we were impacted by the big power outage in Michigan so I can't remember all of your names) it seems that every PS does things differently. Mine puts me in a compression bra after every surgery and has me wear it 24x7 until at least 1 week post-op when he sees me. Then he leaves it up to me on what to wear. I find I like the \"security\" of the compression bra for a few weeks after surgery until the healing goes well then I wear whatever I want. For those asking about how to deal with drains in warm weather here's what I did: the drain tubes were plenty long enough to be able to wear shorts or capris with pockets, so I would just stick the drain bulbs in the pockets and wear a long blousy shirt over them. Worked like a gem. My surgery to replace my right TE post-infection is coming up this week and here are words I never thought would ever come out of my mouth: I'm so darned excited for this surgery! I've done everything within my means to ensure a successful pre-pec result and I'm REALLY looking forward to having two foobs again. At this point I don't even care what they look like - my expectations for aesthetics have gone down so darned much since I started this downward spiral nearly a year ago that it's ridiculous. I know that plastic surgeons often use the analogy of \"twins\" or \"sisters\" but at this point I'd gladly settle for two girls who get mistaken for each other from behind now and again! LOL! The ID prescribed Bactroban (nasal abx cream) for 7 days prior to surgery plus an antiseptic skin cleanser to use the day before and morning of the procedure. Surgery is Friday and then I go in for 100 gram vit C infusion on Monday post-op (already had a 50 gram IV this past Thursday in preparation.) Looking forward to now moving on an upward spiral - will hopefully have final implants by end of May so I can enjoy this year's golf season. Keep the updates coming and continued blessings for comfortable recoveries. Best of luck to everyone who has surgery coming up this week.",

Usually my PS inflates the TE with air but he didn't do that this time. Again, I'm assuming that he wants to take it nice and slow to counteract any residual damage. Still, overall, doing really well. Have taken more pain meds this time because of the additional pain and they make me pretty loopy so that's fun. (/sarcasm) The pain from having the ovaries and tubes removed is virtually nothing compared to the breast - kind of like a mildly crampy period and nothing more so that's a relief. Getting better day by day! To those asking about sleeping, I personally prefer to sleep in my La-Z-Boy but only because of the drains. Once the drains were out after my original bmx I was able to sleep on my side no problem but, then again, you have to remember that I had drains for seven weeks (I even ended up naming them!) By that time pretty much everything else was healed up. For anyone dealing with rude surgeons, I realize it's easier said than done, but please try to remember that YOU are the patient. It's absolutely uncalled for that any health professional tries to pull that kind of crap and I've fired more than one doctor in my day. They may have an unlimited supply of \"customers\" but I also have the choice, as the customer, to go elsewhere. I realize that I'm lucky in that I'm in a large urban area so I have lots of choices but it might even be worth having to drive a bit further to get the respect you especially deserve through this shit storm of breast cancer we're going through. lidabit, PS's can be so freaking stupid about \"boobs\", can't they? My PS keeps telling me I'll be \"beautiful\" when he's finished and I keep telling him to shut it - nothing was more beautiful than my own lovely breasts, thank you very much.",

I'm having reinsertion of TE on the right side on 3/17, then hopefully just a few more weeks after that to final implant exchange! I'm so ready to have final implants and TWO foobs! I'm late on answering this for Wallan but for anyone else who's wondering, I would recommend wearing yoga pants and an oversized button down shirt to the hospital. Slip on shoes would be good too. If you're allowed to shower when you get home, find something you can use as a lanyard that you can pin the drains on. I had a ribbon with a little plastic medal on it that one of my kids got as a \"trophy\" from when they were in some sport or another when they were little, so just removed the medal and the ribbon works great. Beachluv, I've always been able to get through the MRIs but I can understand why some people are freaked out by them. I have to say, they are freakin' uncomfortable, that's for sure. Cdv4251992, your BS or PS should have given you instructions on whether or not you could shower. Call them and ask \u2013 that should have been covered pre-op for sure. And definitely tell them what you told us; they'll be able to give you the right advice. 2FUN, I'd recommend planning a few meals in advance. We have a make-ahead meal place near us called Dream Dinners where you plan your meals, go in and assemble them at the store, then take them home and freeze them. Then my husband and kids could just take what they needed out of the freezer the night before and make the meals the next day. Other than that, just stock up on books or plan some binge-watching! Gardener4, I agree with Wallan. These boards have been a life- and sanity-saver for me over the last year. Vent away. We're here for you.",

It uses the encapsulation of Vitamin C by Liposomes (fat molecules) to increase absorption levels of Vitamin C, which is limited by bowel tolerance. I have been able to have 10 to 15 grams of Lipospheric Vitamin C by mouth, without diarrhea, whereas I get loose stools with around 7grams of the standard formulations of Vitamin C (Ascorbic acid/Asorbate). I space the oral dosing out over the course of the day, that way, I hope to keep my blood levels of Vitamin C elevated as high as possible throughout the day. I actually take a combination of Standard Vitamin C tablets and Lipospheric Vitamin C, because then I feel that I am covering all my bases. Hope this helps you figure out some good ways to get the best benefits of Vitamin C if you can't afford Intravenous Vitamin C. ALSO, WANT TO BRING UP ESSENTIAL OILS SUCH AS OREGANO/THYME and GOLDENSEAL have Synergistic Effects against bacteria, alone or in combination with antibiotics. I posted this info somewhere else, but copied it to here again. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4915787/ Abstract Purpose. To test whether plasma vitamin C levels, following oral doses in supplemented volunteers, are tightly controlled and subject to a maximum in the region of 220 µm L−1, as suggested by previous researchers for depleted subjects. To determine plasma levels following single, variable\u2010sized doses of standard and liposomal formulations of vitamin C and compare the effects of the different formulations. To determine whether plasma levels above ∼280 µm L−1, which have selectively killed cancer, bacteria or viruses (in laboratory experiments), can be achieved using oral doses of vitamin C. Design. This was a single blind study, measuring plasma levels in two subjects, in samples taken half\u2010hourly or hourly for 6 hours, following ingestion of vitamin C. Data were compared with published results and with data from 10 years of laboratory plasma determinations. Materials and methods. Standard 1 gram tablets of vitamin C; liposomal vitamin C. Plasma levels were analysed using the method of Butts and Mulvihill. Results. Preliminary investigations of the effects of liposomal and standard formulation ascorbate showed that blood plasma levels in excess of the previously assumed maximum of 220 µm L−1 are possible. Large oral doses of liposomal ascorbate resulted in plasma levels above 400 µm L−1. Conclusions. Since a single oral dose can produce plasma levels in excess of 400 µm L−1, pharmacokinetic theory suggests that repeated doses could sustain levels well above the formerly assumed maximum. These results have implications for the use of ascorbate, as a nutrient and as a drug. For example, a short in vitro treatment of human Burkitt's lymphoma cells with ascorbate, at 400 µm L−1, has been shown to result in ∼50% cancer cell death. Using frequent oral doses, an equivalent plasma level could be sustained indefinitely. Thus, oral vitamin C has potential for use as a non\u2010toxic, sustainable, therapeutic agent. Further research into the experimental and therapeutic aspects of high, frequent, oral doses of ascorbic acid either alone or (for cancer therapy) in combination with synergistic substances, such as alpha\u2010lipoic acid, copper or vitamin K3, is needed urgently.

I had my f/up appointment with PS today following reinsertion of TE on right after infection last year. Things are going just great. No problems except a little redness under some mesh \"glue\" stuff they used over the incision but nothing major - PS thought it might just be a mild allergic reaction. No itching or anything. He filled me with 150 CCs of saline on the way to 750 to match the left side which has a 650 cc TE filled to 750, so I'm still pretty flat on one side. No pain or feeling on the fill at all, though, so that's cool. If he does 100-150 CCs each week I'll be there in no time. He did say they couldn't fill it up much during the surgery because they had to remove a lot of scar tissue this time. The bad news is that he left in the EFFING drain. God, I hate the damn thing! I refuse to take a shower while I have it in there - trust me, once you've been hit with an infection you'll take ZERO chances on getting another one - and sponge baths get really old, really fast.

I mean, honestly..........why doesn't the universe want me to have a right breast??? Yes, that's silly, but at this point that's how I feel about it. Molly, thanks, yes, have been taking 2K of vitamin C since surgery and just started liposomal Vitamin C today. And I'm going to call my holistic healing center on Monday to see if I can get in for another Vitamin C IV infusion that afternoon (I see the PS in the morning.) Trying to look at the bright side of things in the light of day and while they're few and far between I will note that 1) the pain from the maybe-infection has taken my mind COMPLETELY off Elphaba and 2) I'm allowing myself to take a shower today. I was allowed to take them from the beginning but didn't want to risk any kind of infection but, hell............WTF at this point. Looking forward to that first glorious shower in over three weeks! Thanks to all of you for your kind words of encouragement!",

I lost an entire summer of golfing last year due to that stupid infection and I don't want to lose another one. LisbethS, I don't blame you for wanting to wait on the fill but at least go in and have them check the swelling. If it is a seroma they'll want to drain it. Forgot to say, Sitti, the site where they drained the seroma leaked just a short bit yesterday after I left the office but then closed up all on its own. Were you the one whose drain incision kept leaking also once the drains came out? Maybe your body just doesn't close those wounds as quickly.",

It's been a year since my original bmx and I still have zero feeling on the left side. I don't expect to ever regain any. Regarding side sleeping with TEs, yes, it is possible. I've had a TE on the left for a year now and can comfortably sleep on that side no problem. The right side hurts to lay on - but it always has, even without the TE in, so I don't anticipate to ever have comfort on that side. Not sure why the two sides are different but I'm sure there's some explanation. Not sure I care at this point enough to find out. I have not ever seen my BS since he stopped into my hospital room post-bmx to discharge me. lovepugs, fingers crossed the drain comes out this morning! Let us know what they say about the bruising. Had another drain/fill yesterday - they drained about 60 ccs this time then put in another 50 ccs of saline to take up the space. He said the drainage looked good but then did another culture just to be on the safe side, so I'm not sure I believe him. No pain, redness, or swelling though so I'm not going to go looking for trouble where it doesn't exist. Back again on Monday for another drain/fill go-around, I'm sure. I'm currently at 450 of 750 ccs and it's not even remotely looking like I have a foob. I expressed my concern that the two sides would not ever remotely look alike but the PS assured me that they would. My expectations on \"looking good\" have dropped so drastically through this shit storm that it's not even funny. I told the PS that as long as I looked good in clothes I'd be happy and he said \"Oh, we can do better than that.\" I'll believe it when I see it.",

As for bras, I had a TE on the left and was flat on the right for nearly a year. I bought two inexpensive Genie Bras, which come with a small pad for each side. I would take all four pads from both bras, plus a sock, and use that to pad the right side. It would give me the same proportion but the right side always rode higher, so I took to wearing blouses/tops with a lot of patterns. When you have \"weird\" boobs, confuse them with patterns! LOL! Now that I'm getting fills on the right side again I can reduce the padding as needed to retain an equal proportion. 2FUN, congrats to you and DS on high school graduation! Such an exciting time! Bluebirdgirl, yay on the ct scan result! Benign is such a beautiful word! I went back in for another drain/fill yesterday. The final pathology on the two cultures they took came back negative, so that's great news. They only drained 40 ccs this time (first three were 100, 60, 60, so at least it's going down) and they filled another 50 ccs of saline. I am now at 550 of 750 ccs and, I don't know you guys, but it just doesn't look good. You would think that with only 200 ccs to go the two sides would look closer in size by now but I'd say the right side looks like it's less than 50% of the size of the left. Plus, the skin on the right has gotten really shiny. The PS told me not to worry about it - it's caused by the stretching. But, of course, I worry about everything. I just don't see how another 200 ccs is going to get me where I need to be. My PS is off to China for a family reunion so I have to see his partner next week; maybe I'll get a different point of view. Hope everyone has a lovely week-end.",

Now, he knows that I am an avid golfer, so why on earth he would recommend something that would completely ruin my game was insulting, insensitive and maddening. I swear sometimes \"quality of life\" means nothing to these people. Tnd22, sorry I can't answer your question as I'm doing TE/implants. I believe there's a thread specifically for DIEP surgeries; you may have better luck getting an answer there. That seems like an awfully long time to wait for reconstruction, though. Oh, KimE, so sorry you're dealing with a seroma now, too. Be sure to keep the area dry and clean and call your PS to see if you can get in before Wednesday. Also, increase your Vitamin C intake if you aren't already to help prevent infection. If you can find liposomal vitamin C in addition that will be even better.

Sorry I can't give you any insight on straight to implant because my PS doesn't do that. I'm sure someone else will be able to jump in and give you more information. If you, or anyone else, is interested in learning more about pre-pectoral (over the muscle) implants, this is a great thread to follow: TE/Implant OVER pectoral Can exercise, comfortable &NO RIPPLES! Plantchild, no, my infection was hospital-acquired and unrelated to the implant - a rather rare gram-negative bacterial infection called serratia marcescens. LisbethS, every PS seems to have a different opinion on pre- and post-op antibiotics. I find it really depends on what your particular PS \"usually\" does. If you're really concerned about infection and can find a holistic center that does high dose Vitamin C infusions I highly recommend that. I'll be having infusions 4 days before and 3 days after my next surgery, and the same at time of exchange. As for your questions on what to expect post-op the thread that Sitti listed is very helpful but recovery is very different for every person. Personally, I had only slight arm movement restriction after my original bmx that went away in a couple of weeks. I slept in a La-Z-Boy for several weeks because of the amount of time I ended up with drains. My unsolicited advice to all of you is to research, research, research and be an active participant in your treatment plan. You're the one who has to live with the decisions so don't let your MO or PS or anyone else railroad you into anything you're not comfortable with. I've had to put the brakes on my PS a couple of times to get the results I want. I'm happy to say he's been very receptive to doing what I wanted.",

If he doesn't give you a good reason for not wearing a bra then I say do whatever you need to do to make yourself feel comfortable. As I mentioned, the Genie bras have been a lifesaver for me. They're inexpensive and soft so they put minimal pressure on you and you can move the pads around to even things out as needed.

Before the exchange surgery my expectations were so low for a good outcome that I told my PS I didn't even care what I looked like naked - I only wanted to look good in clothes and I didn't even get that. I realize there are many women out there who end up with good results but I'd hazard a guess that there's a much higher percentage of women who are NOT happy, like us. I don't even say I'm a breast cancer survivor anymore - I say I'm a breast reconstruction survivor. While I am thrilled at this point to be cancer- and infection-free, I feel perfectly justified in my unhappiness about having to be mutilated to get there. People who haven't been through it have a difficult time understanding that, I think. Edited to add: I am getting very good at \"smoke and mirrors\" so I do look OK in clothes now, at least.

It's only a mystery because my stupid PS didn't culture until he already put me on abx. ID doctor, of course, wants to have the replacement TE taken out again. I fought him on it, so he said he'd let me try the abx route for a while to see what happens and gave me a 14 day rx for double the dose of abx (bactrim.) I don't know what possessed me because I typically do not even mention homeopathic treatments to the MDs, but I asked him how he felt about me using essential oil of oregano and high dose Vitamin C and his exact words were \"I feel you're going to have a failed outcome, so you can do whatever you want.\" Now what the F#%$ kind of thing is that to say to an already visibly upset patient??? I wanted to punch him in the face and then he chose that moment to try to comfort me with a side hug. Get off of me, you idiot. Anyhow, hope the Cipro works for you. I was on Levaquin for many weeks which has similar side effects to Cipro - none of which I experienced, thank heaven - but I'm with 2FUN - better than a raging infection. Dafne, can't remember if I thanked you for the lotion suggestions. I'll check them out. I'm glad you were finally able to meet an MO that works for you.",

The woman who started the thread actually originally had sub-pectoral and found a surgeon who would exchange for pre-pectoral so even if you have them under right now there's a possibility for the future. (I know no one wants to think about more surgery, but it's good to be informed.) Pre-Pectoral Info And having radiation does not necessarily preclude you from getting pre-pectoral. I have one radiated and one non-radiated breast. My PS will tell you that the majority of times there are problem it is with a radiated breast but the issues I had, while they just happened to occur on the radiated side, had nothing to do with the fact that the breast was radiated - it was an infection that could have happened on either side. Once it happened my PS immediately started discussing going under the chest muscle and I fought back, insisting on fat grafting to repair the damage from the infection which has since allowed me to proceed with another pre-pectoral TE. My point, I guess, is that you always have options. Research and go with your gut. I also had NS/SS BMX. Lost some of the nipple on both sides post-op but no other skin issues until the infection. Glad to see everyone's follow-up appointments are going well and that life is slowly getting back to your new \"normal\" (driving? Yay!!)",

The physical recovery has been pretty easy for all surgeries - it's the anesthesia that kicks my butt.

Mari, hope your margins are clear now after your revision. Xtina, congrats on all the great news. Very happy for you. Bluebirdgirl, so sorry to hear about your infection. But, sadly I can relate, because\u2026.. I am, evidently, going to have to fight off another infection. Started getting pain on the right side of my incision on Wednesday night. By Thursday afternoon it was getting worse and had extended toward my armpit. Called to get in at PS's office and both he and his intern insisted everything looked fine and not to worry. I had to remind them that this was how my infection started last year \u2013 pain, no fever, and no redness or swelling until more than a full day after the pain started. Why, on earth, they don't believe me when I tell them something is wrong is beyond me because, of course, when I woke up this morning the entire breast area was (still is) red. Spoke by phone with the PS today and he is insisting, because I don't have a fever, that it's still not an infection and is something called \"red breast syndrome\" from the alloderm. Well, I was eating Tylenol like Easter candies but then the pain became so excruciating this afternoon that I finally broke down and took a Norco. Once I stopped the Tylenol, my temp went up to 101. (Despite insisting nothing was wrong, the PS did prescribe the same abx I was on for the infection last year, so at least there's that.) I am so beyond discouraged right now. Infection from a rare gram-negataive bacteria last year was what delayed my reconstruction to nearly a year after BMX and now here I am again in what appears to be the exact same boat. And now, to make matters even worse, I am \"leaking\" around my drain incision and have what appear to be mosquito-bite-like bumps on my torso under the breast. I haven't cried over this yet but I can feel a breakdown coming on. This has been such a sucky, long road. It's just all such an effing nightmare. My body went into defense mode against the pain yesterday and so I've slept 20 hours of the last 32 so now here I am, at nearly 1:00 a.m., wide awake and just contemplating what else could possibly go wrong. I am going to be so devastated if they can't clear this up and they have to remove the TE again. If I don't end up in the ER at some point over the week-end then I'm going to insist that the PS send me back to the infectious disease specialist when I seem him again on Monday. Why is this happening to me again??",

Sorry if you've already said this but have they given you any muscle relaxants? Wallan, I'm with your DH. Screen all calls. :) Bluebirdgirl, so glad you're doing better! Whew! I was thinking of you so much, hoping and praying. Glad it's improving! MariH, I'm so sorry you're faced with yet another decision. I have to admit I didn't know what AI was so had to go to the handy abbreviations guide! Sorry I can't speak to that but good luck through your decision making process. I can, however, speak to pre-pec implants and if you can find an experienced surgeon then highly recommend it. There is a pre-pec thread that I think I've linked to before here that has a growing list of surgeons across the country that are doing pre-pec implants. You might be able to find someone on that list in your area. Just search the forums for \"pre-pec\" and I'm sure you'll find it. The thread is called Te/implant over muscle can exercise and no ripples and the pinned post at the top has the entire list broken down by region. Lastly, I agree with the others \u2013 ask for recommendations from RO and MO if possible. LisbethS, thanks for the \"advice\" on the drain but I had to laugh because I did break a drain once (latex gloves + rubber line + friction = broken drain tube) and my guy, being the hard-ass he is about them, simply put it back together and left it in! Sittie, sorry you're dealing with Seromas now! That's the reason my PS is so against taking the drains out too soon. (I get that, of course, but I still hate them.) Dafne, I'm so sorry you're dealing with so much pain. It's strange to me that they won't give you anything stronger than Tylenol or Ibuprofen. I agree, the medical community seems to place such a low priority on quality of life and often send the \"Suck it up, Buttercup!\" message instead of treating the individual patient. It's nonsense and no, I don't think you should \"settle\" for a life of pain. Is switching doctors a possibility for you? As for me, the abx seem to be working and no more pain and I'm getting less tired now day by day. I went in yesterday for a 50g Vitamin C IV infusion, so hoping that will kill anything left that the abx may not be getting. The breast is no longer red but it's still dark and looks almost bruise-like but, again, still an improvement. At least things seem to be getting better while I'm patiently waiting for the culture results. Elphaba has been at 25 ccs the last two days; if it stays there again for a third day I'm going to see if I can get her removed tomorrow. I'm heading out of town to visit family for Easter and would love to not take her with me. I could use a damn break!",

I will be joining you all for a March surgery on 3/17 for re-insertion of TE on the right side subsequent to removal due to infection. My original NSBMX was done in April, 2016 and through a series of Lemony Snickett Unfortunate Events, the right TE was removed at the end of May, 2016 due to a fairly rare infection (and I do mean RARE, so please don't let my situation freak you out.) I will also be having a salpingo-oophorectomy to remove my ovaries and fallopian tubes due to a positive genetic marker for an increase risk of ovarian cancer. By my 3/17 surgery it will be over 11 months since my original surgery date so hopefully I'll be able to breeze through this re-insertion and then eventual implant replacement and have this all behind me. DiV, I'm so sorry to hear of your rare occurrence. Is there any chance that the petscan on 3/16 will show that the surgery does not need to be so extensive?? Please know you'll be in my thoughts.",

I hope and pray everything goes well for you. 2FUN, glad the thyroid issue was benign. As for me, I had my final exchange (the last of 8 surgeries and nearly 18 months after my initial BMX) on 9/19 and drains came out one week later which, if you know my history with drains, is a freaking miracle. To say I'm unhappy with the results would be an extreme understatement, but as Molly50 pointed out, at least the implants are better than the TEs. I happened to have my 8-week post-op appointment with my PS this morning as a matter of fact. During the exchange he did a lift on the left to try to get the two sides to match but I'm still ridiculously uneven. I tell people I have clown boobs \u2013 meet Bozo and Buttons! I'm currently taking pentoxyfillene both orally and topically that I had to browbeat my PS into prescribing to try to repair some of the radiation/infection damage on the right side in the hope that side will \"drop\" to more closely match the non-radiated side but it will likely take 45-60 days to start to see any kind of result from that. The PS was impressed that the redness that persisted on the right after the last potential infection has improved quite a bit since I started the meds, though, so I was able to go in there with a bit of an \"I told you so\" attitude. He said he was happy that I was able to teach him something new, so I guess there's that. Good luck to all awaiting additional surgeries and glad to hear from everyone.",

Since you specifically mentioned pain and recovery.....everyone has a different experience, of course, but for me, the post-op pain was definitely manageable and my recovery was relatively easy. Nothing on the level of, say, any kind of abdominal surgery, for example, if you've ever experienced anything like that. I was in the hospital just one night following my surgery. The BS about fell over when he walked in the next day and I was up and walking around on my own and asking if I could go home. After I got home I think I took the Norco prescribed by the PS maybe 2-3 times, then did just fine with Tylenol after that.

I had been pondering the word \"resilience\" lately and had been trying to find a quote to embody it. This works. I'd say \"love the journey\" is a bit of an overstatement, but the idea is a worthy one. \"Somewhere between what she survived, and who she was becoming, was exactly where she was meant to be. She was starting to love the journey. And find the comfort in the quiet corners of her wildest dreams. They say people don't change...Well, she wasn't always this way. Even if she didn't change the entire world, she would change her part of it. And she would affect the people she shared it with. A butterfly whose wings have been touched, can indeed still fly. Whether something was meant to be, or meant to leave, didn't matter as much anymore. She would soak up the sun, kiss the breeze, and she would fly regardless.\" ~J. Raymond For all my bc sisters out there on this journey with me - you're all fierce and beautiful. Fly on.",

I will even allow blood draws, etc. on the right side. The general consensus I've gathered from speaking to various medical personnel through this entire trip is that unless you have several nodes removed then lymphedema is not typical. And with only one the chances are extremely small, somewhere around 6% (I'm sure you can find good info if you google it.) The hospital will still make me wear the warning bracelet in an abundance of caution but I've had a couple of blood draws and IV Vitamin C on that side with no issues at all. That's not to say I'll never have a problem but at this point I have to pick my battles and worrying about something that likely won't happen isn't worth my brain effort. I'm back yet again from seeing PS today. They drained another 60 ccs and filled with another 50 ccs of saline to take up the space. All this draining is freaking me out as it's just another opportunity for infection. Why on earth my body produces so much drainage seems to be a mystery for the ages. Prelim results on culture they took last Thursday are still negative but he's putting me back on abx in an abundance of caution. I go back in again on Thursday then he leaves for a conference so it may be more than a week until I go back after that unless he wants me to see his partner while he's gone as a precaution. I'm now at 500 ccs on the way to 750. Slow and steady wins the race.",

I e-mailed my drain output for the last three days (20, 25, and 20 - I may or may not have fibbed by 5 ccs or so. Sshhhh!!!) and PS let me come in this afternoon to have it taken out. His intern asked how long it has been since surgery and it is 4 weeks tomorrow, so he let it spill that they would have \"fish or cut bait\" soon anyhow (which I believe is a phrase someone else's PS used too.) So I feel better about whining and pushing to have it out. And, even better, my culture came back negative. So it's a bit of a mystery as to what that whole episode was about last week-end. Personally, I think it may have been my body giving me a \"whoa\" warning. After 1 year since original bmx I'm so anxious to get through all this that I pushed for a 100 cc fill, followed by lifting some heavy boxes over that next subsequent week-end. My boob had had enough! LOL! I may never know what it really was but that's ok. Lesson learned. If I don't get through this until the fall that's OK - there's no race to win here.

Because it was done laparascopically I had very little pain post-op - got by perfectly fine with Tylenol. Wow on the cost! Good thing you were able to get into that research study!",

AndraLee , GrandmaV, CindyVS23 and DazzlingEagle, sorry you're having to join us here but welcome. I've also been given an anti-bacterial soap to shower with for a week before surgery but it's not the same name; used it before my last surgery as well. utjoy, thanks for the update! Glad things are going relatively well. Sorry about all the issues with your DH as well! Wow! You've got a lot on your plate but you sound like a strong, capable woman. I'm glad you're doing OK! DodgersGirl, I know I'm late to the game on this and you're already on your way to surgery, but I also had no problems with appetite after my initial BMX or any of the subsequent surgeries for that matter (six in total.) I'm lucky, though, that I am able to tolerate the anesthesia with no side effects \u2013 a lot of people experience nausea from that. I also never had a problem with constipation from the pain meds, but I was pretty much off them after only three days so I think that helps. I am shocked by all this talk of having to be moved between buildings for procedures! I hope that they take your modesty and concerns into consideration. It drives me nuts how they don't seem to have any problems just flaunting you around. I remember nine years ago when I was having radiation treatments, like all the other rads patients there I would go in and put on a gown and then sit in a little waiting room which was basically just some chairs sitting in a hallway. One morning, they were having a reception in the radiation center for all of the artists who had worked on a mural that was painted on one wall of the rads room, so all these \"lay people\" were just roaming around the hallways while those of us there for treatment are sitting there in our hospital gowns waiting for treatment. I was LIVID and refused to come out of the dressing room, then let them know in no uncertain terms how completely insensitive it was of them to assume we didn't care that all these people would be able to ogle us. I mean, it's bad enough that the hospital personnel are traipsing past you constantly, but at least they're there for a reason. My RO was extremely apologetic about it and said it would never happen again. Hopefully, it hasn't.",

Plus I'm getting very light drainage in the JPs to begin with so hopefully they'll come out at my post-op appointment with PS on Monday. Having a little more pain on the left now that all the \"good drugs\" from the surgery center have worn off. Took one Norco again last night before bed just to get some sleep which worked great. And just discovered that our Tylenol expired in February, so need to send my son to the store to pick up some more as I'm still not supposed to drive yet (which will probably only last until tomorrow because I'm a terrible patient that way.) Doh! Yes, I realize the expired Tyelenol won't hurt me but it may not help me either. Nothing like being prepared, eh? LOL! Joyseeker, glad you're doing well after surgery too! Wishing luck to DizzyGirl for today; sorry so late on the good luck wishes. DodgersGirl, the drainage can fluctuate wildly. Even after dropping down it's quite possible for the drainage to shoot back up again. Please trust me when I tell you that I COMPLETELY relate to how awful they are but try to suck it up and leave them in as long as they want you to. I can't say for sure if the two things are related but the one time I got an infection and the second time when there was a suspected infection both happened immediately after my drain was pulled. So this time I'm going to be a good girl and leave them in as long as necessary.",

I personally never found any correlation between movement/activity and drain output. I had my drains after my initial BMX last year for seven weeks. Yes, you read that correctly - 7. I had the damn things so long that I named them Flotsam and Jetsam. And when I had my right TE reinserted post-infection in March this year I had a drain for four weeks and then they only pulled it because I lied about the output. HUGE mistake. DO NOT DO THIS, no matter how sorely tempted. The fluid kept accumulating, which is already an infection risk as it sits there, so they kept having to needle aspirate me every 3-4 days which is just another avenue for possible infection. Believe me, anyone who has followed me on prior surgery boards knows that I am a BIG WHINY BABY when it comes to the drains but just suck it up as best you can and don't have them removed until they say it's OK. I learned that lesson the very hard way. Now, I have heard that there are some plastic surgeons who will remove the drains after x number of weeks regardless of output by my PS isn't one of them. DazzlingEagle, I'm so sorry about the outcome of your surgery! Your surgeon is a complete ass. I can't even tell you how pissed off it makes me when they tell me how I \"should\" feel.

Good luck on the recovery road! As for me, I'm extremely unhappy with the results of my exchange surgery. I still look like I have two foobs from two completely different women - not at all symmetrical. My only goal for this final exchange was to look good in clothes and I didn't even get that. I'm so disappointed. BUT.........I'm not giving up. If my radiated right side would just \"drop\" a little it would be a huge improvement and I have a plan for maybe making that happen. I see PS for post op appointment tomorrow so I'll post another update after that.",

The limitations on range of motion were more cumbersome than the pain.

The physical recovery from the surgery wasn't too bad but, man, even taking a bath or shower required a 2-hour nap for recovery in the first 2-3 weeks. As for emotional healing, does your hospital or surgery center have any kind of support group or counseling that you can tap into?

I'm hoping the size difference may be due to some swelling on the left but I haven't really taken a good look at anything yet to know \u2013 it always takes me a couple of days to work up the nerve. I do have a drain on each side (which I was expecting but still doesn't make me happy) and I'm having an issue with leaking from the drain incision on the right. Have a call into the PS's office to see what we can do about that. It's completely soaking through gauze pads every few hours or so. Just another avenue for infection so would like to have it fixed ASAP. Otherwise, I'm doing OK. Didn't sleep very well last night worrying about the leak but I have very little pain \u2013 more on the left side because of the lift.

This time around the drains came out at my post-op appointment a mere 6 days after the exchange surgery - a record for me! And, for the first time ever, I had some pain when the right one came out - hurt like a mother, which has never happened before.",

He asked me what I thought and, of course, I told him how unhappy I am with the results. He had me first put my bra on, then my blouse and said he can certainly see why I'm unhappy. The plan for now is for him to prescribe the pentoxyfillene and vitamin E but he says he needs to consult with a radiation oncologist to figure out dosages, etc. as he's never prescribed them before. I told him not to bother with my RO as she absolutely refused to prescribe it as it wasn't \"indicated\" and God forbid she would think outside the box for one second. He said he's glad I told him that because that's who he would have called first and he said he wasn't surprised by her response because she's very \"dogmatic\" and by the book. He's going to consult another RO from a different hospital instead. He was hesitant to prescribe the oral meds and only wanted to do the cream but I will insist on both. If he won't prescribe the orals I'll go to my family practitioner and get it from him. Failing that I'll get my naturopath to prescribe it. If those meds don't make any or enough improvement then he said our next step is to try to keep lifting the left side little by little but not for at least a year. He has to be careful because, due to the mastectomy, the breast doesn't get blood flow from below it like a regular breast would. At this point I'm glad I have a plan to try to improve the results and for now I can live with camouflaging for a year or two \u2013 there are lots of flowery/busy prints in my future. Plus, I have now had to put off getting new kitchen counter tops for two years in a row due to our out of pocket expenses piling up so in the intervening years I'm getting my darned counter tops! I'm getting my life back!",

It was never really an issue or a concern for me. I'm sorry for those of you who are struggling with ROM but it may just return over time and with healing?",

They say a good rule of thumb is to plan for one week of recovery for every one hour of anesthesia, which, until my last surgery, I found to be pretty accurate. My exchange surgery ended up taking four hours because of all the work he had to do to try to (unsuccessfully) get a symmetrical result, but for some reason it didn't wipe me out as much. I was pretty much back to normal after only two weeks. I went to a surgical center for the first time instead of the hospital, so perhaps there was a difference in the type of anesthesia being used.",
