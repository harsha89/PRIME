    "Content": "lighthouselady wrote: A little back story - I have had lumpy fibrocystic breasts which required earlier than normal mammograms (including a diagnostic mammo).  All of the past three have been clear.  11 months after my last mammo I felt a lump.  Like all of the other \"hormonal lumps\" I find, I waited through my next cycle (two weeks) to see if it changed.  It did not.  It was hard and it hurt.  I knew immediately.  Unfortunately I was 2000 miles away from home with family, and then had another commitment so it would be several weeks before I could get back to see my doctor.  Had mammogram & ultrasound immediately, and biopsy a few days later.  Told me it would be 7-10 days for results. Thankfully I didn't have to wait that long - I'd been waiting WEEKS already with this knowledge in my heart.  Got the call today.  2 IDC tumors - one around 1cm, the other 2.2cm, both grade 3.   That's all the pathology report said - ER, PR and HER2 evaluation was being sent to another lab. I'm 40 yrs old with two children, 11 and 7.  Even though I'm not surprised, I am so scared, sad, anxious, MAD.... you all know the drill. Going to fax the results to a cancer clinic in Dallas and hope to get an appointment quickly. Just wanted to sort of \"introduce\" myself. Michelle - - michellesneighborhood.blogspot...
