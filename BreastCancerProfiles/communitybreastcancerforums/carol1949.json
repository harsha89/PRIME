I also needed the financial help that insurance offered.  Unfortunately, to go totally holistic can cost a lot of money.  Having said that... check out Patrick Quillin on line.  He offers much info regarding complimentary therapy as well as alternative should one choose that. For me, the faith in God is a given no matter which path you take.  If you go for traditional therapy, yu still need to believe God that you are doing what is right for you. I have a dear friend who is 10 years cancer free who refused all traditional therapy after 2 surgeries.  She went through Cancer Treatment Centers of America after a bad experience in her local community.  When she told them she didn't want chemo.. they supported her decision and offered her many resources for alternative therapies.  It is mind body and spirit to get through this challenge.  The main thing is for you to trust that the right information will come to you. Do lots of research and trust your heart. Hugs and peace ",

I felt exactly the same way... (just get it over with... I don't care!)  However, I would encourage you to take a little time to do some research and see if you really are at peace with this decision based on all of your findings as well as opinions from your doctors. I actually am scheduled for a modified radical mastectomy with NO recon.... on Oct. 21.  First of all, my tumor is so large and we were not able to shrink it as much as hoped... so the surgeon is also saying the mastectomy is best.  Even if he had of been able to do lumpectomy... I was leaning toward the mast... since I have heard too many stories of people who did not get clear margins and were back  in for another surgery.. in a short time.. and I was not interested in that.  Both my surgeon and oncologist have suggested that I should wait at least one year before any reconstruction if I choose it anyway.... so that made me feel much better.  My surgeon said he has many women come back after the year and say, \"You know what, it isn't that bad, I am not interested in recon.\"  On the other hand, my oncologist  a woman, and personal friend, thinks I should have recon!  So,again it is very personal.  I am 58, but a very young 58 . My professionals told me to get Dr. Susan Love's breast book and I did.. but also did a lot of other research on my own. I am now at peace with the mastectomy decision, and look forward to the light at the end of the tunnel! Trust that the right information will come to you in your journey. So many of us put ourselves behind those around us in life, so just remember ...This time... it's all about you!!  It is body, mind and spirit!",

I will say, that from the steroids, I would feel very wired and not sleepy the first night of chemo, which was always a Thursday.  Sometimes, I would feel very tired on Sunday, but not always.  Never got sick not even one time!  I did get constipated one time!  That was not fun, but they prepare you for that. Healing from cancer is body, mind and spirit!  You don't have to be sick at all.  Your body is at \"dis\" ease at the moment and wants to be healthy!  You, too can heal yourself with the help of modern medicine and any other complimentary therapies you are comfortable with.  I recomment Louise Hay's You Can Heal Your Life, Why People Don't Heal and How they Can by Caroline Myss, Bernie Seigel, Deepak Chopra and also Beating Cancer With Nutrition by Dr. Patrick Quillon.",

As for preparing to lose hair... many people chose to shave their head, as it is one of the few things we can control and considered a \"Power\" thing if you will.  My radiologist suggested for me to read Susan' Love's breast book which does help prepare you for anything that may come up.  Knowledge is power! I have better results with Phytologee hair loss products and you don't have to use them the rest of your life like Nioxin.  My hair is actually better than it was prior to bc now!",

Yes, Was I sensitive to smells?  Only with the first couple of chemo treatments.  Other than that... I have not felt \"sick\" at all. IMHO, this fight takes body, mind and spirit.  One thing can not do it without the other!

Michael Joncas is a priest who has many cd's available, but the harmony in this piece is lovingly haunting. Prayers for peace to your heart.",

Also, my nurse navigator recently told me she just read his book and was most impressed and thinks he is right.  She says so many areas are behind in this realm and she welcomed the information to be able to offer to people who do want some options.

I am looking at every 2 weeks a/c then adding taxol sometime at their discretion.  I had a very large tumor which we are trying to shrink for a lumpectomy.... so am looking at surgery yet down the road and they are recommending radiation, which I will look at when the time comes! So far, the emend has helped and the other anti-nausea drugs also.  I still have kind of a lump in the throat feeling and just kind of feel a little punk.  I was a hairstylist and had just retired, so am grateful I don't have to work through this.  Wigs!?  Well, human hair are always cooler, but they are a lot of work.  You have to shampoo and blow dry them just like your own hair.  You really don't have to pay a fortune, though you can find them for reasonable prices even under $100.  Shop the internet.  Also, the synthetic ones are easy, but hot.  In the big picture of \"LIFE\"  it is just hair!  I always told my clients this and it is so true.  The hair loss is the least of my worries!  Hats, scarfs, they all work, it is just that your head gets sensitive and I find I take them off all around the house, where ever I happen to be when I have had enough! So far chemo isn't the horror that I had thought it would be.  I try to think of it like a song of I'm gonna Wash those cancer cells right out of my hair.  God Bless You all, and just remember to check out complimentary therapies as well.  They make a lot of sense!",

Beginning in the late 1990s, a number of studies found that reiki treatment significantly reduced the fatigue, pain, and anxiety, and improved the overall quality of life in cancer patients. Particularly striking was the reduction in fatigue. This is believed to be a result of the rebalancing of energy in areas of the body experiencing disease and discomfort. Reiki treatments allowed patients to better control their pain and reduce their dependence on conventional pain opiod medications Incidentally, MD Anderson, Sloan Kettering, and CCTA are all routinely making Reiki available to their patients.",

I won't try to encourage you one way or the other regarding having the 2nd breast removed, but would ask you to be thorough in your research. Strangely, my oncologist (who is a personal friend ) asked if I was considering it... assuming I was going for Reconstruction, which I ultimately decided against.  My surgeon said no medical reason to remove it and removing can give one a false sense of security, since you can still get cancer in the chest wall.  (That was my determining factor.)  I would suggest also to get Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book.  I found it very helpful.",

I highly suggest that you do tons of research including complimentary therapies.  Chemo only has a 30-65% success rate, and complimentary therapies can enhance the chemo while minimizing the s/e's.  Check out in particular Dr. Patrick Quillin formerly of a major cancer treatment center.  My oncologist approved of him and his book called Beating Cancer With Nutrition. Trust that the right information will come to you.,",

My skin did fabulously, I got like a mild sunburn, and had a special cream specifically for radiation patients  to use.  One of the physicians on the team also was in favor of alternative/complimentary therapies and said he had seen miracles when he had nothing more to offer some patients! My oncology center also had a spa which offered Reiki on site, and also since it was a Catholic Hospital, we had Nuns who would come and pray with you.  They also had a guitar player play occassionally! P.S.  No tattoos!  They just drew on me with markers.",
