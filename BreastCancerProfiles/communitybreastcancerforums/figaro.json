I want to leave my story of symptoms and diagnosis for others who might have similar problems. I'm 29 years old. I had left sided nipple discharge for about 6 months, yellow, but I usually wear dark underwear so I didn't pay too much attention to it. I noticed brown spots in my bra a couple of times. One morning I noticed a scab on my nipple, I brushed it off and then the nipple started bleeding a lot. I went to the doctor and was referred for a mammogram and ultrasound. These were both clear, and then I was referred to a breast surgeon. There was no palpable lump. The breast surgeon expressed bloody discharge from the nipple and said that I would have a ductogram and then duct excision on the same day. On the day of the ductogram, there was discharge coming out of several ducts, and they couldn't get the cannula in. The surgeon gave me the option either of her trying to get the cannula in while I was under, or wait and see. I chose wait and see. I had yellow and clear discharge in my bra every day, and occasionally some spots of blood. I went back to the surgeon about 6 weeks after my first visit. I asked her to do a cytology test. This showed \"papillary neoplasms indicative of intraductal papilloma\". The surgeon advised that these are high risk lesions and need to come out. She went on holiday and I had an MRI in the meantime. Right breast was classified as BIRADS-2, left as BIRADS-0, inconclusive. There was a lesion below the nipple, but they thought it might be because they had stuck a sticker on the nipple. I had it again. This time there was a small (around 6mm) well defined oval tumour just below the nipple. It was classified as BIRADS-4 and I was told it looked suspicious because of the contrast dynamics. I had surgery last Friday, I have not had much pain, and the wound seems to be healing well. I got the pathology report today. All it said was \"intraductal papilloma\" - no more detail than that. A papilloma is a benign tumour, but associated with cancer in some percentage of cases (some studies put that at around 25%). The surgeon said that it was embedded in the nipple, and she didn't want to cut the nipple - she said she scraped it. So there were positive margins. It may grow back but she says this is unlikely. Because it was centrally located she had to cut the central duct. She says I will probably not be able to breastfeed on that side, but I will still be able to breastfeed on the other side. I hope someone now or in the future with similar symptoms finds this helpful! Log in to post a reply",

Just one question there to answer from reader27 - if the discharge is caused by a papilloma (which is quite likely I think), it won't go away on its own. My breast surgeon said that papillomas are considered \"high risk lesions\" and it is her policy to remove them. I think there might be some disagreement about this. Because of where my papilloma was (just below the nipple) for some reason they couldn't do a biopsy, so they couldn't be sure it was a papilloma and not a cancer until I had the surgery to take it out. I healed well from the surgery and the breast looks almost totally like it did before. My only regret is that I probably won't be able to breast feed on that side. But I think it was a good idea to have the surgery. Also in my opinion an MRI is the best way to see a papilloma, since they often don't show up on mamograms or ultrasounds. They are much more likely to show up on an MRI. But a ductogram is a good alternative if the discharge is only coming out of one duct. The reason I came back on here is because the discharge seems to have started up again just in the last few days! I have a couple of tiny scabs over the ducts which was similar to what I had before the surgery. The discharge is yellow. The compilcation is that I'm now 7 months pregnant so I don't know if this is normal (nothing's leaking on the other side).  So not sure if the papilloma grew back after all or whether I'm leaking colostrum.   ",
