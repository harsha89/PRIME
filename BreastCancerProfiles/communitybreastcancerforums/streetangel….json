I had to have my implants removed in Feb. of this year and I am not handling things well. This is my 5th year as a survivor of stage IIA BC. I had the bi-lateral mastectomy because my mother just had her mastectomy, literally, the year before me. We went to the PS appointment together when I was going through the rounds pre-surgery, her to tattoo her nipel, me preparing for removal of both breasts. My grandmother, her mother, also had BC so there was no doubt in my mind, at the time, to remove both breasts. I had many problems with my implants from contracting the autoimmune disorder to multiple infections. Now, I have these scars and dog ears and I'm not thrilled with mirrors. My life is no longer a life, I don't leave the house - I work from home so I don't have to leave for work. I don't like any of my clothes anymore, and cannot get myself to go for prosthesis. I hear all these BC survivor stories and the pink cloud, for me, is not there, its just not. I'm miserable and unhappy, can't imagine being intimate which is hurting my relationship, then I wonder who would EVER want me if I didn't have this relationship. I have fear of sickness and illness all the time, will I be able to work etc. Just many many things. Anybody have similiar expieriences?    That which doesn't kill us makes us stronger Dx 12/14/2004, LCIS, 3cm, Stage IIA, 1/11 nodes, ER+/PR- Log in to post a reply",

I suppose anything is possible, and I would get a second opinion when it comes to things like that myself, smart move its your life and always go with your gut. Good luck!",
