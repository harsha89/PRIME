My first onc tried to scare me into taking the test, but a simple explanation is that this test is about YOUR tumor and not the general population.  Mine came back a 10 out of 100 and I changed oncs because it's not necessary for him to scare me into doing something.  Be strong and do your research.  I use ww5.komen.org.  This site has great information.",
