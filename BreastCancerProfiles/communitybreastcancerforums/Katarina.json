Longest period for me free of cellulitis has been 5 months. She, being a nurse, is also able to administer IV antiobiotics to herself at home so that's one reason she endured it for years. Apparently from her experience there is no real cure other than praying you don't get a recurrence, staying clear of variables that cause it (magic), changing the recon approach to DIEP, or opting out.  I do wonder if opting out (going flat) eliminates recurrences though. I have read that you can get cellulitis even if you've never had any recon. The RN thought breast cellulitis was really radiation therapy driven and if you've had your axillary lymph nodes removed as the critical risk factors. Good piece of info to know.  I'm so grateful to find support from sisters. Angels come from everywhere and unexepectantly. It's all about faith too :-) Hugs, Kat ",

It's nice to know you didn't need to have your implant removed and your occurences have stopped.  My situation is similar to yours:  1st attack immediately following radiation (6 days in the hospital) 2nd attack 2 months later (hospital/IV) 3rd attack 4 month after 2nd (hospital/IV) 4th attack 3 months after 3rd (hospital/IV)  5th attack 5 months after 4rth (hospital/IV) My last stay was the longest. I believe my body is building up a resistance to the Vancomysin and Zyosin. Would you share what IV and oral antibiotics worked for you and did you have to switch?   I am going to any length now to avoid a 6th attack. I agree with your ID doctor. 8% of us get this on a recurring basis and it's lymphatic drainage and bacterial in nature. Hugs, Kathleen ",

They can and will prescribe and treat you for these SE as they do for the more obvious chemo treatment SEs. I started Prozac and Clonazepam (anti-anxiety meds) as soon as I got my diagnosis. They are really making this so much easier for me. During my hospital stays I am administered these drugs along with whatever else I need. None of you ladies should have to suffer from these issues either.

(I'm 50 but they've thrown me over menopause into post menopause.) Oct. 20th was last day of Rads for me. I told santa I could lead his sleigh on xmas but he preferred rudolph.  Oct 28th - Went to Stanford University for a Neurocog test - Chemo Brain - the results were not good. My Onc was shocked to learn how much mental damage the chemo and Rads had wreaked havoc.   Thanksgiving - spent 5 days in the hospital with Breast Cellulitis - infection from Radiation, TE's, skin issues. Good thing my hospital is like the 4 Seasons. Have been on antibiotics since then. Dec.22nd - went ahead and got my exchange done. New 800cc silicone implants.. They look smaller than the TEs did, but feel softer and lighter. Today - Dec.27th -- got my  2 drain tubes out. Now just tired and wearing a compression bra. I want to start 2012 with my major treatments behind me. I'll be back at work fulltime instead of half time since Nov.7th.   Arimidex causes fatigue. I still nap most days.   I hope everyone here has a great 2012 with NED. We have earned it. Happy New Year to you all. Hugs, Kat ",

I may have gotten it from having my BMX drain tubes in for too long and /or port placement, etc. You never know where it comes from but it has to be managed fast and first signs are fever and vomiting. However, the body ache that kicked up at the same time was in fact the worst symptom. It was like being in labor with pain spreading throughout my body. I wish it on no one. My Onc said he thought I was reacting to the Neulasta shot but I am skeptical. I think the Neulasta shot didn't help but wasn't root cause. Jackifp - I think that you must get a tremendous amount of love and support from those children. That two boys shaved their heads just to keep you company is so incredibly endearing.

Chemo Brain - yes, I think it's stress/trauma related but also the many drugs interacting like a cocktail that just messes up your focus and ability to think straight. I take anti-depressants and anti-anxiety drugs and while I think they help me relax from stress I wonder if they contribute to the foggy brain. What works best for Heartburn and Indigestion?   I had my round yesterday and suffering from these SEs now more than anything.  NEULASTA -- they cut my shot dosage in half. I had WBC around 12,500 yesterday just before getting in the chair which is too high. The Neulasta did little last chemo round from keeping me out of the hospital with Sepsis and a WBC of 42,000. I wish my WBC were normal range or below like the rest of you. When it's higher than normal that's also a risk factor. I'm sure my ONC will get this right and I have confidence in him.  I think the extreme body pain that only Dilaudid helped with while I was in the hospital was due to Neulasta. I'm not feeling any pain yet but then just had my shot today. I'll stay hopeful. Blonde lawyer -- I'm sorry to hear your tumor is not shrinking but all the ONCs have said that knowing what protocol does work before surgery is a big part of winning the battle.

My employer considers me on medical leave and disability now so the income I'm getting does not count as income per SSDI from what they told me. Once my 18months of company disability runs out my company will give me a severance package / terminate me and then I would start SSDI assuming everything is in synch.  I however have all the best hope for beating this cancer and I want to go back to work as soon as I'm able. It's however nice to know there are options and I encourage everyone no matter what the challenges are to apply regardless. I didn't feel like I was a candidate for SSDI but it's obvious to me how fast our situations can change. All we have to do is share our diagnosis and how they change. I was told I had dense breasts and fibrocysctic disease. Not to worry. Every 6 months I had mammograms and ultrasounds. My breasts were getting harder and just not right. Long story short I was mis-diagnosed for 3 years. When I got my dx my tumor was 12.5 cm and I had grossly cancerous lymph nodes and angiolymphatic invasion. Stage IIIB. That's a major blow and so I'm preparing and ready for anything - especially the unexepected worst case situations, and where I might get financial help long term. I now plan for the worst and work and hope for the best. I also make sure my Docs are on the same page with me in this, or I go find ones who are. All the best to you all. Keep working the SSDI angle and you will succeed.  Keep sharing info too, it alleviates our stress and helps us learn how to navigate the system.",

Maybe I should expect the unexpected.  You are all strong ladies and your hanging in there. Keep the faith.  Arimidex nearly killed me. Aromisin is working much better.

I had to leave work and back on leave now. Stress can cause infections to erupt as well. We don't have enough reserves from all the chemo and radiation to fight of these infections. I'm staying positive though that Feb. was my last cellulitis round.  March 23 was my cancerversary. I'm not sure if I'm feeling better today than during treatment. Arimidex did a nasty one on me and my Onc gave me a break from it for a month. I had a neurocog test done that showed serious chemo brain.
