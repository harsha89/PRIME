At the end of the evening the women do this sexy dance I call the 'bum rub' lolz.  They turn their back on their partner and do a slow shimmy down, and then back up without actually touching the man.  It's so sensual but totally 'proper' for the culture here.  Now if I could just dance for more than 3 minutes at a time.  Maybe this week I'll graduate to 4 minutes.  I doubt I'll ever get the bum rub right though, I'm just not built for it (grin).

Online - Lymphedivas - shipped out of the US. They have a wide selection of prints and colours, I have leopard print and they look like full sleeve tats. There's instructions for measuring. She can choose what she wants online. They are a little pricey but they have a good return policy. I've been using Lymphedivas for 10+ years. Both types come in two compression strengths. I've had both light and heavy compression and because my LE is manageable the lightweight work well for me. The heavier weight ones can be a little difficult to put on if she has mobility challenges, but they work well if she has moderate to severe LE. They come separately with either a gauntlet (cut off across the bottom knuckles) or glove (half-finger). I prefer the gauntlet as they're more practical (unless she wants to carry rubber gloves around lol)",

Every thing on that list except apples and grits make me feel sick so the list is in a folder. I know we all have different things going on so different regiments call for more extreme measures I am sure to avoid complications.  There is a real sad face nurse who advocates for the BC patients where I am at who comes in to help break down what the doctors say. When I asked my MO what could I eat he said I am not restricting you right now, then I said can I still teach pole fitness he said if you feel up to it you can do what your body tells you. After he left the sad face nurse came back in and said, \"you may want to take a break from the pole for awhile, it's probably not good for you to be flipping around\".  I had to laugh.

It seems we have run the gambit on emotions and physical issues since before Thanksgiving, but that is to be expected. I am glad I got to enjoy all the food I wanted this time, I think it was more of I savored every bite this time instead of just stuffing myself. I only ate what I wanted, which was mostly starches. Today is my birthday and I am one day post #3 infusion which is usually and okay day it just with the anti nausea medicine I am so slow an sleepy. If I sit still I am out, and having to sit up 2 hours after I take it makes it hard to nap like I want but if I lay down I find I start coughing and wake myself up as if something is stuck in my throat. I also noticed yesterday during the infusion I was starting to cough a lot, not sure if it was the port or not but I finally got it under control and it went a bit faster, although I have decided I like early morning. Too many sour puss faces late afternoon. I had a 76 year old man come up to me when he was done and say \"you are the happiest face I see in here smiling, nodding at people and listening to your music while filling out Christmas cards, what a treat\". I have folks sending me gift certificates for the spa and fixing me meals and dropping them off. I don't even know if I can use the gift certificate now with the treatments and just between us, not everyone is a good cook but I don't know how to tell folks not to do. I know they just want o feel helpful anyway they can and I just try to remember that just because I am fine without all the fuss and hoop la, they may not be and that's why they keep doing. I have my consultation with the plastic surgeon tomorrow morning so one more doc to add the list of many that I now see. When the nurse was taking my blood yesterday she was saying it's rare to run across someone as healthy as me no health issues, no medications, etc. and I broke out laughing. I told her I use to be as healthy as a bowl of grits, now I tote around a black book with all my meds, doctor information, appointments and business cards for all the people I see to mention some of the diagrams the doctors have written out that is the size of a phone book (for those of you who remember a phone book). I feel anything but healthy knowing they are pumping poison into my body on a regular basis and my body knows and doesn't like it, and knowing that eventually we are cutting it out. The MO came in and checked me out and could no longer feel the lump an asked me had I felt it in two weeks, another bout of laughter from me as I pointed out to him I never felt it the first time, my husband did. So I guess the chemo is working to shrink it and may even make it non existent. I shall keep you all posted, one more round of this on December 12th, then on to the next 8 weeks of the journey. I think I may have been a bit ambitious wanting to participate in the Pole Competition in June, but we all have to look ahead at something. Better days are coming. My work partner sent me \"Dear God, They say It's Caner a companion guide for women on the breast cancer journey\" by Janet Thompson has anyone else read it?",

My poor husband is huddled under the electric blanket about to freeze while I have the ceiling fan going and covers thrown all over the bed. This has become a nightly ritual. Along with that I have a rash around my port,  and a small wire protruding from my neck in which the online nurse believes is a suture that has come through. Since none of it seems life threatening we will address it on Jan 2nd at my next doctors appointment. We will count it all good and keep pressing forward. I hope everyone is doing and feeling well and get a little reprieve for the holidays with good health. It's not how we would have planned it, but it's still good. ",

I noticed my eyebrows are very thin and appear to be getting thinner and considering I had to get them done before to keep from looking like a bush woman its kind of funny. As for the soy products, I had a nutritionist before this and when I told her about the bc and asked about food restrictions she did say to stay away from soy. Chinese is my favorite and I love sushi, but I have made small adjustments to have things prepared without but its more of a pain going out so I have fired up the wok and bamboo steamer at the house to take the edge off. Leto, I have found that a cup of coffee every morning, along with a bran cereal with extra fruit in it seems to keep me from having the stomach issues, but if I miss it like over the weekend it comes back with a vengeance. I am not a big coffee drinker but now that have found something that works with movement I will keep at it.

I got the news the end of September and that day I felt like I was gut punched when I walked out of the surgeons office after the bombarded my husband and I with so much information I couldn't see straight. I walked into the bathroom came back out and met him in the hallway and fell apart for all of 5 minutes, we just cried and held each other, after that I went to O'Charleys and had 4 straight whiskey shots and went and told my family. It took a few weeks but the calm set in, my husband and I have been growing our faith for some time now and once I realized that this is a test to strengthen it all the worry went away along with the anxiety. I spend more time trying to calm the worry of my mother and younger sisters who want me to just sit and do nothing. I have always been a planner and this was not in my plan so it has been an adjustment and those days when my energy level is not turbo like it usually is it frustrates me and the emotions are all over the board. I have always been curvy with great hair, now the things that I thought were me are being adjusted, the hair is gone, the boobs are soon to be gone and replaced it's not anything that I thought, but I guess it is to be what it is suppose to be. We just keep living, my husband and I are both in law enforcement so there are rotating shifts and call outs and trying to work some to conserve some of your sick days for when you really need them is a task but he has been at all my appointments even when he is coming off night shift. The last time he was asleep in the uncomfortable chair while I was crocheting getting my cocktail, he just wants to be there and even though I tell him I am fine to drive myself which I am and have done he insists. I know it makes him feel good and he says if he could take it away he would, but I know even if I could give it to him I would not. My chemo bag has my favorite blanket made for me by a friend, one of my pillows, crosswords, and my crochet I also have my tunes and where I go has tvs so I watch that to. I even took a little nap the first time with my ear buds in. I like to have shoes in which I can slide in and out of so I can get comfy when I let the chair back. It is a journey but so many have made it and been able to testify to it and we will too. When you feel overwhelm remember we are all here for one another.",

I was a little tired when I got there but once I started moving I felt so much better, I soaked in Epson salt and jumped up my regular time this morning for prayer and reading but I do feel a bit tired and my eyes feel dry but look watery.  I think I will try the tear stuff to see if it makes a difference. Normally I stay around the house for Thanksgiving if my husband is on  shift and just have Chinese food and watch movies but my mom seemed adament that I drive the 20 minutes to her house this year for what our family considers to be a gathering. We are such a hodge podge, family members just comes and go throughout the day fixing a plate from the buffet she sets out so it's not like we all sit down together and eat. I figured since she seems to be worried that I am not eating, I should make an appearance so she and my sisters can see that I am doing fine and looking well. I got on the scale this morning and have gained 5 pounds in two weeks, I see why the greasy food keeps me from being nauseated, it doesn't go anywhere its just sitting around making me fat. :-) But I will happily take that over being nauseated and sick so I am thankful for that and thankful for having stumbled upon this discussion board. When I was given the news and went online looking at everything I could find I was so lost. I would come to the site everyday reading what people were saying and doing afraid to join in because it would make it too real. I thought if I kept it to myself it would be so much easier, I am so glad I finally said something. Its so much easier talking with people who have an understanding of what is going on. \"..all things work together for good to those who love God..\"Romans 8:28",

I had bilat mast with DIEP for third primary, didn't get clear margins and Onc refused me further tx. Guess what happened.

You might get lucky and have nothing happen if you take estrogen. Or you might not be lucky. I'm really sorry you're suffering. I live in a constant state of \"drenched\" so believe me I do understand the misery. It's a personal decision that you have to make, and I respect whatever you decide, but please consider this ... 30% of Breast cancer patients go on to stage 4 during the course of their disease, around 6% are initially diagnosed stage 4. These are frightening statistics for all of us. Stage 4 is an entirely different world compared to the lower stages and not one of us wants to see anyone else joing the club that sux the most. Please think very carefully. For me as a stage 4suffering through the side effects is well worth staying alive.",

I find that one Tylenol pm and a light toddie with a squirt of adult beverage gives me a full 5 hours. I tried not doing it that way last night just the toddie no pill, I was up in 2 hours and tossed and turned all night which made for a trying day since I had a 3 1/2 hour drive back from the conference. I have a little peach fuzz on the back of my head, the wild thing is that at night when I have those flashes my head becomes super hot, the pillow even gets hot. I feel like Drew Barrymore in Firestarter. I was having a meeting with my partner when I got back to work today and I swear in the span of 20 mins I took off and put on my sweater 5 times just because I would go hot, cold, hot, cold, hot, cold. Last week I went in my office dead bolted the door and laid on the sofa in my underwear until I stopped sweating. I feel like I am about to jump out my own skin. I know it will pass as will the sore fingers but when you are going through it you just want to scream. Now I am reading about the scans, and us triple negatives are more prone to getting them? I wonder if that is if you are getting radiation. Since the 5 lymph nodes they took were clear although clearly in distress and I am having a double mastectomy the MO said no radiation needed especially with the tumor completely going away feeling the chemo would take care of the rest. I will be doing some additional research, as always reading the posts are always informative.",

They are right everyone reacts differently to treatment. I have been working still and am a crime scene investigator, I actually had to do the police fitness test the day after they told me I had cancer, and I had to shoot for certification a week after they took 5 lymph nodes out of my left armpit. It has been a bit uncomfortable at times and when I get too hot I tend to feel nauseous but for the most part other than being constipated and a bit dizzy I have been getting through. The ever constant headaches after the infusion were a bit much, I found that I was trying to tough it out but when they have such great medicines there is no need to be in pain when you don't have to be. I have tons of information on natural herbal remedies that a friends mother who went through this years ago used and sent to me and I have a great oncologist. I am willing to try the herbs in conjunction at this point but not as the treatment. I think it is good to have as much information as possible to decide what is best for you. The type of cancer I have responds best to chemo, that is why I went with it. Advances in medicine have made things better and more effective but then again I am looking at treatments until March. For the amount a treatments you are looking at there may be a better option, keep focusing on what you need to do for you and what gives you peace of mind.  ",

Since then it seemed like I have been in a confused state of: \"what is everyone waiting for get this crap out of me since then\", but now that lymph node testing is done and biopsies of other areas things are progressing. My first chemo session is on Friday and that is when I find out what my cocktail will be. As this type of cancer responds very well to chemo I will have the surgery after I am done then radiation. I love my oncologist, he is smart, funny and tells me like it is without making me feel sick. When I asked could I shave my arms and legs, he said yes however you will lose the hair there so you don't need to. I wanted to know when would I lose my head hair. He was not evasive he said Day 16 is when hair starts to fall out, since I wear wigs sometimes to switch it up I have plenty. I have just never worn one with no hair. So while everyone else is gearing up for trick or treat I will be in the \"infusion room\" getting drugs.",

Your husband may be exhausted and your son is having a time, but they are doing the best they can because you struggle and there is nothing they can do to take that from you. The bills are mounting, let them mount they can't get blood out of a turnip, the #1 thing is that you get better, you have people that are depending on you to get better to be there to talk to, to console to laugh. There are services out there that can help with cost, I know its hard for you without a family support system nearby but enlist your local Christian charity groups. My doctors office had payment plans for financial issues and as they told me, it will get paid one way or the other. There is always more than one way to skin a cat, it may take a bit of time and a lot of emails and phone calls but it's easier when you are at home. When you feel like crap it is easy to say I am tired and I want to be done, but this is not your fight. God fights for us all, he wants us all to be drawn closer to him and although we may never understand why this befell upon us there is a reason for it. There is someone watching and listening and taking what we say as the law because it's all they have to hold on to because they are going through the same things except they are signed on like I was and afraid to engage. We are helping and supporting more than just the one's who post a reply. There are days when I am exhausted, depressed and it hurts to touch me but I refuse to let the enemy make me think I am ready to give up. I dreamed the other night that I was Wonder Woman, the strangest dream in a while but I took that to mean I am stronger than I think and got up with a bit of renewed energy...for all of 4 hours before I needed a nap. There was a moment that I thought it would be easier to walk out in the surf and let the water engulf me when I first found out that I had this thing growing in me. I stood on that beach for a long time, my husband had gone to the store and I had no one keeping a watch over me it just seemed so easy but as I watched the water and it continued to mesmerize and relax me as it always does I had this total since of calm and peace and I heard in my head \"calm your mind and turn your worries over to me, I am here and have been here all along\" that was my turning point with worrying about the things with this. I still get anxious moments here and there when I get denial of claims from my insurance or when I see another letter coming in, but I can't worry with that and won't as I remind myself it's going to work itself out with our without me. As my husband says there is nothing else until I am better he could give a hoot about what is stacking up. I will continue to pray that you see a movement soon that restores your sense of balance physically, mentally and emotionally. \"Come to me all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give your rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart and you will find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light\" Matthew 11:28-30 \"Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be frightened, and do not be dismayed for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.\" Joshua 1:9  ",

I have number 6 treatment tomorrow so from what I see from the taxol, the SE's last all week and then I get another treatment. Becca it is good to see the humor in this, I know I do. Some of these posts have kept me sane these pass few months since getting on this merry-go-round that I didn't know I was going to ride. Sjacobs146, I hear you about the taste, the last treatments took them away but remember this too shall pass. Now I have super smell and can taste again, but last night at the Italian restaurant someone fish dish from another part of the restaurant sent me gagging to the restroom. Tomorrow will be interesting since I was told to tell the nurse that the bandage they put over my port makes me nauseous because it smells very antiseptic. I was told by the other nurse last week they can cover it with tape and gauze and not use it if it bothers me. I hate to be a bother when I go in, I just sit and go with the flow but since I would hate to lose my breakfast I think I better say something. On a lighter note I finally got into one of those Look Good Feel Better sessions that are always full around here. I actually called the 1-800 number the first of December because the one's here were booked for the past 2 months and they said that someone from the center would call me in January to ensure I got into a class. So January 20th I am there at 6pm, such good timing since I have bags under my eyes, my skin is super dry, and my eyebrows are fading into my face. Putting on powder, swiping on mascara, and lip balm is all I know how to do, drawing in eyebrows is way too advanced for me. They even help with wig styling so I am a bit excited. My wigs are super easy with a bit of frutese in a spray bottle with water I spray and style but then again I style it the same way so some variety would be nice. I have five different versions of the one I wear in case I want to change it up a little on the weekend, my husband says walking in the closet and seeing all the mannequin heads fully made up with wigs on them does take some getting use to. lol  ",

I have never slept that long. I know they said I would be tired, but I just assume just tired not exhausted. I guess it is time to cut back a bit, but I am already only teaching about every other week and just feel like with the steroids I am becoming so heavy.

I think I should feel relieved but I just feel like it's another thing that I will have to recover from. Anyway tomorrow is treatment #7 more than half way done, I should be feeling excited.

Basic DIEP info - it's usually 10+ hour surgery (mine was 12+).  You spend the first few days in ICU.  Immediately after surgery your flap is monitored every hour for 24 hours (usually involves having a hand-held Doppler radar 'listen' for blood flow) after the first 24 you're flaps are monitored every 4 hours for another 24.  You spend the first 48 hours in a 'hot' room to encourage blood flow.  The first month is considered critical for flap survival.  The abdominal incision can be problematic as well.  I was incapicated for about 3 months although I did work from my bed.  I was 8 years post tx on one side and 13 years on the other. It took 5 months to the day for the 8 year side to fully heal.  My arms were used for IV's which irritated my LE - one arm has been swollen ever since. I spent the first 2 months asking myself what the ** have I done.  I haven't had the stage 2 revision yet for shaping and nipples.  Maybe next month .... I don't think it would be unreasonable to say that it can take a year or more to fully recover from the surgery.  It obviously doesn't for everyone, but here I am 14 months later with a seroma on my belly and am still having a difficult time with fatigue and mobility. Like Laurie, if I was facing this surgery as Stage IV I would definitely not have it.  I've previously said in other threads that I'd do it again... neh changed my mind.  I wouldn't.  Sorry, I didn't mean to write a book.  All my best to you, She",
