    "Content": "Apr 13, 2008 10:23PM NewsMom wrote: My excisional biopsy was 10 days ago.  This was the 7th surgery of my life---I've had lots of minor procedures done, plus a ceasarean section and most recently, repair of a very bad ankle fracture (3 bones fractured, actually). The breast surgery was by far the easiest, least painful surgery I've ever had, and for the record, I had 2 wires, so my incision was wider than most.  The surgeon went in from the side, not the nipple.   To be honest, I'm actually having more discomfort now than I did a week ago.  The suture area is sensitive.  I NEED a little icepack. I can't wait to see the surgeon in 2 days, and get those sutures OUT! BEST advice, which I got from the core needle biopsy prep sheet, and NOT the excisional biopsy prep sheet:     SPORTS BRA.      Because that's what stops jiggling your bruised-feeling breast.  I'll keep wearing one until I can jog without noticing my breast sensitivity.  If you want even MORE compression, you might add an ace bandage.  ",
