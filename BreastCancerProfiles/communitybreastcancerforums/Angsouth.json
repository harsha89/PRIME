She is stage four with small tumors on her lung and ribs. She has been through two rounds of chemo and has handled it well. The swelling in her arm has gone down and she can know feel two of her fingers again. They did not do blood work after her second round of chemo because they said her port site looked good and the leakage was the right color. So my question is -- is that normal? Why wouldn't you do bloodwork after each treatment? I live in North Carolina and my mom lives in Maine. We talk every other day but I am worried that maybe she is not being completely honest, she is depressed.",
