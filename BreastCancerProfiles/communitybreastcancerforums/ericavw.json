      "Content": "Jan 11, 2011 07:56PM - edited Jan 11, 2011 08:08PM by ericavw Add me, ladies! I had my unilateral MX on 12/14/10 with TE put in. I'm 4 weeks post-op today. I'm 30 years old, just married a month before my MX. I'm feeling pretty good, just went back to work this week. I still get tired after doing too much (even just the past two days sitting at a desk at work). I also started physical therapy yesterday because I'm having some range of motion issues (which I was shocked I was gonna need since I'm a fairly active young person) but I have to say, it felt awesome after I was done! I'm supposed to meet with my Oncologist tomorrow, but we're having a big snowstorm now so I had to cancel. Totally bummed. She's the one person I wanted to talk to! Going to her next week instead. I also have to say... I have/had super dense boobs, size A, no family history, didn't feel any lumps, just had spontaneous bloody nipple discharge. I went to a pretty aggresive female surgeon who was highly recommended to me. She just came back from BC herself a year and a half before. She didn't do a biopsy, she just told me it had to come out cause it was bleeding. And upon her initial physical exam, she felt another small lump a little ways away that my gynecologist, mammogram, and ultrasound didn't see or feel. So she did an excisional biopsy, and a major milk duct excision. The \"other\" small lump no one so or felt but her? Ended up being DCIS. (The original culprit was right behind my nipple causing the bleeding and was the IDC). I then had a MRI that showed \"something\" between those two spots. The radiologist, surgeon, techs, no one could tell if it was pos-op changes or residual disease. Because of this and my size, I opted for the unilateral MX. Best choice ever. All that \"something\" in between? Was DCIS. Onwards!!!!  I think it's awesome that some of you ladies recovered so quickly! Xo to you all. ",

It's totally Greek to me. Although, the more I read it, the more I'm getting things. I, too, had \"extensive\" DCIS spread throughout the lower outer quadrant. (That's exactly where the problem started, so I'm glad it was at least just there) and I'm also glad I decided on the MX. I've actually felt rather crappy the past 3 days, very very stiff. It maybe be the 20 degrees it's been, who knows. I've also tried to not take the Valium anymore for the muscle spasms. I broke down last night, and took one. Instantly released my muscle a bit, and let me go back to sleep. I go for my 3rd \"fill up\" today. I was assuming my next surgery would be sometime in March cause that'll be 3 months since the MX, and that's what he said he normally does... but I guess we'll see how my body decides to react. Lol. I'm also going for a breast massage today before I see the PS. Hopefully that relieves some of the tightness. I started going to physical therapy on Monday, and that totally helped me. I felt so loose that night when I went home, I can't wait to go back to her on Monday! So nice to hear you're feeling great... everyday is something new! I went back to work this week, so for me... I'm just trying to get back into the swing of things, and I have to say... I'm exhausted! I'm trying not to push myself to much and let myself rest as needed. I can't wait to sleep in on Saturday ; )",

I'm finding it even harder for me this year because with my TE's, snowboarding this season is out of the question for me and I used to do that 4-5x a week in the winter! Summer I do usually walk quite a bit, bike ride, swim, etc. I find if I stick to the South Beach Diet (and I do let myself have treats when I need to) that I can stick to the organic whole foods thing. You do that iodine regime? I don't know much about that and have been trying to figure that out. I asked a friend who has lots of health problems about it, and she goes to a Holistic Dr (or whatever you call them) so I'm going to try to see him/her. I do take multivitamins and folic acid everyday and I drink lots of water. Barely any caffeine, a cup of tea here and there, and a soda possibly if we're out to dinner. That's all. I don't drink or smoke so that also helps!",

This week, I'm getting more feeling in my breast and armpit/drain area. Which is good... and annoying. Haha. Moreso now? It's just annoying. I keep referring to it as a giant splinter... and you don't have tweezers to remove it. It doesn't really hurt me anymore, just annoying and uncomfortable at times. But also, like I said, I had p/t yesterday so that definitely loosened up my muscle so I think that may be why I'm feeling it more now. My last saline injection only bothered for me for about a day (tightness wise_, so that was good. I'm at 240 cc's now (it's fillable up to 400 cc's) so there's a lot of give in there. I feel like that's another reason I'm feeling it so much. Almost like it's wrinkly in there cause it's not filled up all the way. It does get better!! The annoyingness is way better than pain. And guess what? It's only a few months. It's already been 3 months since your diagnosis. Time flies. I have two months left till my exchange. Very excited about that. Smile always!!",

As of my last fill, I'm not big enough of my TE side to have to put anything even resembling a prosthesis, but a small sock in my sports bra on my native side worked just fine. I'd imagine by my next fill, I'm gonna need something bigger. I have a few silicone like \"chicken cutlets\" I call them that I can use, and at the recommendation of a friend, cut out the pads in a bridesmaid dress that I had... so that should work for the next time or the injection after that.

For me there was no nipple sparing possible since in was so close to my nipple, and for me, I was ready to rip it off myself. It drove me insane after my first surgery, it was awful. Although I have to say, after my MX, when I get cold? It still feels like it's there. Very very odd. I'm new to a lot of these abbreviations. What does \"ADH\" mean? We're about the same size TE-wise right now, and a full B, small C is what I was intending on as well. I do feel pretty good. Just so very thankful. So everytime I get annoyed that I can't move my arm a certain way, or it hurts to close my car door, I read some of these awesome courageous womens posts... and I am so stinkin lucky. This just isn't going to be a part of my life. I'm plowing right through this and that's that. I cling to my mask of courage cause it makes me feel awesome.   MBW: I think a lot has to do with age and the shape you're in with \"bouncing back\". I'm 30 years old, and aside from this mess? I've had a cavity. That's it. I'm active, and live a very healthy lifestyle so I think that plays a factor. I also strongly believe that your mind has a HUGE impact on your recovery. Like I said to Megan above... BC is NOT going to become my life. I don't call it \"my breast cancer\". I don't want to \"own\" it. I think of it as my pain in the butt. I just push through each thing. Each procedure. Each appt. Just when you think you can't take another step... you do. You just DO. As for the pool. I'm 4 weeks out from my MX. I go to my plastic surgeon on Thursday, and I assume he will give me the go ahead to resume mostly normal activities. I wasn't allowed to shower for a week, so that's a factor with water there (and because you'll have drains in still) I went back to work this week, and I've been driving for over a week. Everyone is different though. I'm certain for me though... I wouldn't be able to do much of a swimming stroke on my MX side. I'm working on that in physical therapy though. The muscle is just tight and a stiff for me still. For me? The pain wasn't unbearable, and I consider myself a wuss. My first surgery of the excisional biopsy and duct excision hurt me way more. But the MX recovery is definitley longer. One day at a time! Pushing right on through. You define you. BC does not.  ArleneMarie: Thanks, chica! I ended up meeting with my Oncologist today. I'm all set with my MX side. No more treatment needed although she suggested good ol' Tomax. I'm very on the fence with that. We plan on having kids as soon as I'm healed up enough, so she told me if that was our plan to wait and then go on it after. She told me I don't need to decide this second. My pathology from my MX was pretty good. DCIS in the lower outer quadrant exactly where they did my original excisions. They couldn't spare my nipple cause mine was so close to it, but I couldn't wait to get that sucker off. It made me insaneeee. But odd enough, randomly when I get cold... I still fell like it's there. Strangest thing ever. Did you already have your transfer? If not, how long have you had your TE's in? I have to say, the past 3 days? I seriously want to claw mine out. Andddd it's 14 degrees here currently, and my MX side is NOT happy with the cold. ",

She knows we want to try for kids asap, so she when I asked her if she would be okay with me trying for a baby say starting this summer, having a baby, then going on it if I choose to.... she said yes. She obviously would like me to go on Tamox for 5 years, but I have reservations about it. You're above signature? Is the route I feel is best for me to go, with no drugs. I'm not set on that yet, but... that's the way I'm leaning. I just want to make sure I'm not messing with my hormones too much, and makes sure we have at least one baby. I actually had her do a hormone test on me this past week, to see if my hormones are out of whack as it is. I always wonder why that's not common practice before trying to block your estrogen?? ",
