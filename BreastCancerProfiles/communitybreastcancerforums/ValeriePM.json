      "Content": "ValeriePM wrote: Looking for a fashionable pocketed shelf bra for the summer?  The Valetta by Amoena is a collection of colors and supportive camisoles.    http://www.amoena.com/us/Products/Lingerie/Style/Valetta.htm Smooth and soft modal fabric makes this garment ultra comfortable to wear alone or under clothing. Integrated pocketed shelf bra features molded foam cups for shape and support of a silicone breast form. An elastic bottom band ensures security. Seperation between the cups keeps your silicone breast form in place.  Rounded neckline is positioned for modesty, yet still provides a fashionable look. Double spaghetti straps create a ready-to-wear look and feature a back adjustment for the ideal fit. Exclusive rhinestone detail on back adds feminine flair. Soft modal pockets are smooth against skin and hold a leisure form, breast form, or symmetry shaper securely in place. Log in to post a reply",
