I sometimes wonder if it's painful due to the fact I am always \"checking\" on it, poking prodding rubbing that sort of thing. I know I can not find a diagnosis here...just hoping to find someone in a similar situation or someone who possibly started where I am and indeed does have BC. I am a disabled veteran and the healthcare is CRAPTACULAR on a good day...so it's been hard to get in :(",

It has gotten bigger in size and is extremely tender and radiates pain throughout the breast region. It feels like a firm/rubber lump, and it is pretty much in the armpit but borders my breast. I've brought it up to my health care provider but he felt it was more the pectoral muscle. Beings he was a man I don't know if it made him skiddish to really dig in and look, but I don't feel as though he felt what I am feeling. I am worried this may be cancer. Anyone on here who had a suspicious lump in armpit are that turned out to be bc? Thanks so much! Log in to post a reply",

I was telling my story to a couple people in private messages...but I think I will go ahead and just post it here too. Not to be doom and gloom or pessimistic, but I have a feeling I will soon be an active member here. :( For about a year now, I have had a feeling of something being just \"not right\" or \"off\" in my left breast/armpit area...even my chest wall rib area on the left side. About 6 months ago I noticed a small lump about the size of an eraser head on a pencil. It was in my armpit and I just attributed it to a swollen lymph node. I also noticed I would have some itchiness over the left breast.Â  Over the last 6 months it has grown to the size of a grape. It is very tender to the touch, and at times the pain radiates outward. Some days I have a dull pain, some days it is so excruciating I want to tear open my skin and rip the flesh from my ribs. Today is one of those days. It almost make my arm feel weak. My primary care doctor said it wasn't anything to worry about. But something keeps egging me on to keep looking. I have cancelled at least 3 appointments with my gyn doctor...but I WILL go Friday. I know in my heart that something is not right. I have a beautiful 18 month old baby girl and an absolutely AMAZING husband from a fairy tale romance and I think the fear of losing that is going to push me to actually go this time. I'm just so scared of the uncertainty. And at the same time I know it's so STUPID! Why don't I just GO. Earlier the better right? But something just keeps stopping me...",
