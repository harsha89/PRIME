I have called everyday to see if anyone has cancelled so far no one. I have a week left of waiting,so I have put in my head one more week and I will know. I tried to talking to family but they become uncertified diagnostic doctors. You try to explain to them that your scared and they make you feel like your paranoid for nothing.",

      "Content": "Kelsklo98 wrote: Hi my name is Rosie, I'm 38 and have 3 beautiful children. I'm so happy to have found this forum where we can post our fears so here I go: Last December I was having a lot of pain on my right breast went to my general doctor and she recommended for me to get mammogram which came back that I have excess tissue(forgot what it's called) the doctor didn't tell me to go for anymore testing a so I let it go and dealt with the pain (wrong choice). About a 2 weeks ago I felt a lump under my right arm pit and was worried so last week speaking to my partner I told him I was worried because it's the same side where I have been having pain, so he told me to make an appointment which I did. While getting ready to see my obgyn since I was disappointed with my general Doctor and my OB is very thorough. I decided to do a self breast exam RED FLAG I found a lump just above my nipple it's not a perfect lump. My doctor confirmed both lumps and now I'm waiting for another mammogram and ultrasound and I'M SCARED beyond belief. I keep reading about everything. I don't know how to make my fears go down. They don't have any appointments until te 15th of his month so the wait is so nerve reckoning. I don't know if it's wise to plan for the worst just in case or just wait and take it from there. My nipple seems to be more inverted, I have lost weight (maybe from stress). Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Log in to post a reply",

My concern is that he doctor tells me it a mass and just to keep doing my self monthly check and if it gets bigger to go back. She said because I have excess tissue that it can cause some tissue to become lumps. Now my thing is why she say IF IT GETS BIGGER, like REALLY!!",

I will say I do appreciate all your kind words. Doing more research on this site I have also found out that there's a lot of woman that have developed BC with Mirena (IUD) which I had one out in in 2012. Now I start to think could it be just coincidence or am I just making myself nuts.",
