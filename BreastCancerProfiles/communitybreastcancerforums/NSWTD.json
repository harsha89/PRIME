My drains were so long that I sat on the stool and just placed them on the floor while I showered.  It worked great.   When I was wearing clothes, I just pinned them to the bottom of my camisole. With yoga pants on, I would just roll up the tubes and place the bulbs into my panties and with a big shirt over it, you could not tell a thing. To me having them hang on a string around one's neck sounds uncomfortable. But, different things work for different people.  Also, since I knew the drain and I would not be \"married\" for long, the less effort I put into them, the better.  I should think a couple of good sized safety pins should do the trick. ",
