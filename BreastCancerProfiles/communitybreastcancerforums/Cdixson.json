I cried a lot but yet made it through the wait. All of my genetic testing was negative. I was very relieved to have one less worry on my plate. As far as surgery thoughts, I was expecting a double mastectomy and possible oopherectomy. But as things have changed with my diagnosis and through chemo, a double mastectomy won't do me any good due to a lymph node under my sternum that is involved. I may still get an oophectomy. My oncologist is wanting me to try Tamoxifen first. I'm still considering the oopherectomy.",
