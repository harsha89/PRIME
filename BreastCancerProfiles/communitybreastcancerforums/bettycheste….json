I appreciate everyone's responses.  Being 39 and finding out that I have breast cancer was a shock.  I'll give you a little back ground.  It was found on a baseline mammo on April 2.  I had surgery May 20th.  The cancer was small and is ER/PR + and HER2-.  Oncotype Dx result was low. After extenisve discussuions, I don't need chemo but need radiation and tamoxifen.  I am suppose to start radiation soon and was wondering if this will delay it.  Now concering the seroma-   I have been putting warm facecloths on it and it seems better today but by the end of the day it feels worse.  Sensitive but not painful.  And the puckering seems more pronounced.  I'm just scared about everything is going on and appreciate  any advice I can get.",
