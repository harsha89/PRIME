Shaved my hair 2 days ago, I felt empowered :) . Then I had my second round of chemo, this time it was harder, fatigue, nausea and looking at myself at the mirror was strange, I can hardly recognize myself, how can it be? My friends have been supportive, loving and encouraging, they describe me as a strong women, but today I don't feel it, I just want to cry and I think I should allow myself to feel sad. Too many decision to be made, by now I know that mistakes happen, and I learned to ask for my reports and read them. I am meeting with my surgeon on the 13th, my choice to have both removed and have reconstruction done if possible in the same day, as I have condensed breast, and I don't want to go through this again. Your replies, helped me smile again, so thank you for helping through this journey. With Love",

At first I was terrified of Chemo but Now I started to see it as a healing phase, so I am not as anxious and even when I see my hair fallen I keep saying to myself, as my hair fall so is the tumor. I am trying to keep positive, and trick my mind to think I am getting rid of all the bad, old things that don't serve anymore and I welcome New Beginning. I know it is going to be a long journey but I don't have other choices but to keep grateful for what I had, what I have and what I will have. I have few moment when I am scared, but surprisingly, I am not angry, it is what it is. My battle is not to let cancer get to both my body and my soul. So here is my commitment to myself: Acknowledge the pain, aches but don't let them disable me Smile everyday Laugh everyday Love harder and stronger Hug honestly as if I mean it, my friends are asking me to stop hugging, I simply can't :) I am hoping not to lose myself to Cancer and I pledge not to and would love it if you can join me.
