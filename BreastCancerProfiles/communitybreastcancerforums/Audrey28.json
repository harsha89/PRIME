I am 39 years old and have/had IDC & DCIS, 2.5cm, Stage llA, Grade 1, 1/9 nodes, 99%ER+/99%PR+, HER2-, BRACA-, OncoType DX score of 13. I have had two lumpectomies so far and was scheduled for a third, but at the 11th hour called and cancelled. Instead had a port put in to do chemo first and a mastectomy after. I just finished my second round of chemo and am ready to quit. It sucks!!!! I don't feel that I am handling it gracefully at all and am so sick. I am scheduled to have 4 doses of A/C and 12 of Taxol. With the way that I feel right now, I'm thinking that I can maybe handle 2 more of the A/C maybe, and thinking of NOT doing theTaxol. I haven't talked to anyone about this yet and I know everyone will freak out. It was like pulling teeth to get me to agree to do it in the first place. If it wasn't for that one bloody lymph node I definately would not have done it. I guess my question is, is there anyone one out there that has stopped treaments early or had a similiar experience? If so, how'd you handle it? Any help, feedback would be much appreciated. Thanks & hope to hear from you soon, Audrey28",
