I writing in hopes that someone will respond and I will be able to sleep tonight! The issue is related to my tumor markers. I was diagnosed Stage IV right out of the box back in May with mets to bones. I've been on Letrozole (Femara) and Xgeva since diagnosis. My tumor markers (CA-15) at diagnosis were only slightly out of normal range at 30.6...normal range is 0-25.0. First blood work after starting treatment showed markers were down to 18, next blood work down to 13. I had my 3 month follow-up PET scan and it was significantly improved so I was on top of the world, feeling great. Today, I got the results of my newest blood work and the tumor marker that was at 13 is now at 13.6. I realize that is not a large increase, but I don't think I want to see ANY increase at all. Can anyone shed some light as to how much increase is something to worry about? Could the increase be related to the fact that I used a different lab? Or was perhaps dehydrated that day? Also, when the diagnosis came in, I immediately removed both my caffeine (Diet Coke) and all sweeties (chocolate, candy, cake)from my diet and moved to a plant based diet with healthy proteins. With the favorable PET scan, I must admit, I've worked a bit of chocolate back into my life. Does anyone believe there is a correlation between sugar and cancer advancing?

Was started on Femara (Letrozole) right away and have been on it this whole year. No progression, primary tumor has shrunk and the \"extensive\" bones mets are still there but, I'm told by oncologist, too small now to be picked up on PET scans. I've had no chemo, no radiation. I'm feeling pretty positive about treating it like \"a chronic disease.\" Best of luck to you!",
