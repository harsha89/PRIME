They started with there are some questions we need to ask. . . . then they asked if I was suicidal, I was floored because I had said that I was newly dx with breast ca. If I wasn't suicidal before I just might be now, thanks for putting the thought in place. I just have some anxiety issues with life. I told the nurse that I worked in a psych facility and I am not suicidal. For pete's sake what does one have to the other. I really just needed maybe 1 little pill to ground me again. I am not the type person to need someone's help or even to ask. I was having a moment and no one was trying to rescue me. Well I dealt with the stress, which before any surgery you need to be stress free. Thank God I work with the best nurses, 2 great supervisors and a DON that is really supportive. These peeps let me bounce my concerns off of them and tried to comfort me. I am really grateful for the support. Point of this is as a healthcare provider I am having my eyes opened and maybe this is where God id pointing me to go. All along I have thought of the dx as just a new adventure that God has presented me with. On with the adventure. . . . .",

The answer was expected in a way however cold. . the surgeon didn't feel comfortable giving me anything for anxiety and pretty much said I was over thinking the procedure. Im a nurse and feel very confident in dealing with life, rarely do I ask for help of any kind. my job is stressful and just plain life is stressful. Getting the dx of the big C is like a kick in the balls. Last night I was precepting a new nurse which took my mind off myself and issues, so I did get a break. But really, denying someone: that just got slammed that they are overthinking the procedure. . . .really.  Thanks the rant is over :) I really have respect for the surgeon, it's just like really.. . . .God grant me serenity!!  ",
