I was doing pretty well, no lymphedema things, movement of my arms was excellent...until about four months after surgery, when I started to experience a sharp pain where my right breast had been, a little above the scar. Also my chest muscles would freeze, if you understand what I mean. Not every day, but every so often, and usually when I was sitting down. Over time the pain was there more frequent, but never for a long time. It feels like someone is putting needles in my flesh. And pulls them out again, pain gone. Last Sunday however, it lasted much longer, and it somehow got my chest muscles in a sort of spasm. Very uncomfortable. I couldn't lift anything above my head and it hurt. Any idea what this could be? I have made an appointment with my BS, but that is in two weeks and I was wondering whether any of you had experienced something like it. It seems to be there much more frequent and it takes longer to subside. Log in to post a reply",

In 2009 I was diagnosed with Atypical Hyperplasia, got an excisional biopsy to take it out, started tamoxifen in October. I have been lucky with the side effects, hot flashes, feeling nauseous  and such, but nothing really bad. In between then and now I have had check ups every half year, another excisional biopsy, 3 other biopsies, 4 MRI's, but nothing serious showed up. Every time they did a biopsy it was my left breast, the hyperplasia breast. Last December I had an ultrasound and an MRI, and then I got a call back because there was something going on with my right breast. My good breast, my normal breast. Another ultrasound, another biopsy, and now I just came back from my breast surgeon, that there are no results yet...they sent the samples off to Yale, to check. The last time they sent the samples to Yale, it came back as atypical Hyperplasia. That was the reason I started tamoxifen...I thought that tamoxifen prevented things like this. But I feel I am basically back where I started: three options, 1. They made a mistake, nothing to worry, 2. Again atypical hyperplasia  (another excisional biopsy, and remaining in the high risk group, now for two breasts, and 3. The word we don't want to hear....somehow I feel I have been taking 4 1/2 years of tamoxifen for nothing... Log in to post a reply",

You have to lie down on your tummy, so make sure the headrest is positioned right, that makes it a lot more comfortable. I am not claustrofobic, but if you are you can get something to make you a bit calm. The only thing I felt was the dye going in, that was a bit uncomfortable. In April they did an MRI guided biopsy, that too is not too bad. It's a bit strange, going in and out the machine and having the biopsy done while you can't move a muscle, and you do feel the 'poking' a little, but it's not bad. It sounds like they have everything covered, and that's a good thing!",
