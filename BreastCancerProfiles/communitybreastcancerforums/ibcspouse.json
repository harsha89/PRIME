Early breast cancer refers to cancer that has not spread to distant sites in the body. Fortunately, following standard therapy for early breast cancer, cure rates remain high. However, a portion of patients with early breast cancer will experience a recurrence several years following therapy. Identification of factors associated with recurrences among these patients will allow for individualized therapeutic choices and/or stricter screening for recurrences. Researchers from the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center recently conducted a clinical study to explore the risks associated with recurrences several years following therapy for women with early breast cancer. The study included 2,838 patients with Stages I-III breast cancer who were treated with systemic (full-body) therapy between 1985 and 2001 and who had no sign of cancer five yearsÂ following the beginning of their therapy. At 10 years survival with no recurrences was achieved in 89% of patients, while at 15 years this rate was 80%. Five years following the completion of therapy, recurrence risks were 7% for patients with Stage I cancer; 11% for patients with St age II cancer; and 13% for patients with Stage III cancer. Patients with hormone-positive cancer (estrogen-receptor and/or progesterone-receptor positive) had an increased risk of a recurrence (13% at five years following completion of therapy) compared with those with hormone-negative cancers (7%); this difference was especially true for patients with hormone-positive breast cancer who did not receive endocrine (anti-estrogen) therapy. This study did not include measures of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status or HerceptinÂ® (trastuzumab) and did not include patients treated with aromatase inhibitors, all of which may affect outcomes. The researchers concluded: â?oBreast cancer patients have a substantial residual risk of recurrence, and selected tumor characteristics are associated with late recurrences.â?� Overall, however, the risk of late recurrences remains low for patients with early breast cancer, and improved therapies may affect these outcomes. Nonetheless, it remains important to identify factors that may increase a patientâ?Ts risk for a recurrence so that therapy and monitoring may be individualized appropriately.

D. Anderson study. The pivotal study, published in the August issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, could lead to more tailored treatments that would spare some women from the most potent chemotherapy. It could also recognize which patients need more aggressive therapy at the start of treatment, says lead author Massimo Cristofanilli, M.D., associate professor in M. D. Anderson's Department of Breast Medical Oncology. \"This is the first time that we can actually stratify metastatic breast cancer patients based on their risk,\" Cristofanilli says. \"When a physician assesses a woman with metastatic breast cancer, it is very difficult to make an accurate prediction of her prognosis. Now we may know more about what the prognosis will be, based on a simple blood test and a new technology. One day we may be able to suggest to a patient - based on personal risk - a more aggressive treatment, a less aggressive treatment, or no treatment at all.\"",

Methods In a prospective, multicenter study, we tested 177 patients with measurable metastatic breast cancer for levels of circulating tumor cells both before the patients were to start a new line of treatment and at the first follow-up visit. The progression of the disease or the response to treatment was determined with the use of standard imaging studies at the participating centers. Results Outcomes were assessed according to levels of circulating tumor cells at baseline, before the patients started a new treatment for metastatic disease. Patients in a training set with levels of circulating tumor cells equal to or higher than 5 per 7.5 ml of whole blood, as compared with the group with fewer than 5 circulating tumor cells per 7.5 ml, had a shorter median progression-free survival (2.7 months vs. 7.0 months, P<0.001) and shorter overall survival (10.1 months vs. >18 months, P<0.001). At the first follow-up visit after the initiation of therapy, this difference between the groups persisted (progression-free survival, 2.1 months vs. 7.0 months; P<0.001; overall survival, 8.2 months vs. >18 months; P<0.001), and the reduced proportion of patients (from 49 percent to 30 percent) in the group with an unfavorable prognosis suggested that there was a benefit from therapy. The multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression showed that, of all the variables in the statistical model, the levels of circulating tumor cells at baseline and at the first follow-up visit were the most significant predictors of progression-free and overall survival. http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/351/8/781",
