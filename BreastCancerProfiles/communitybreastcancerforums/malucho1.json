I have already done an EMG (?) to rule out carpal tunnel, which I don't have. In spite of the fact that I asked this neurologist a bunch of questions at my last appt, I still left without a clear sense of what this MRI might find. Except, of course, for the bone mets scenario. I still want to believe that bone/spinal cord mets is extremely unlikely. But waiting is a killer. I won't know until Jan 2 at the earliest because of all the holidays. Would really appreciate your good thoughts in the meantime. And any ideas of all the other diseases I can \"hope\" for: herniated disk, perhaps???

I will look into B-12 deficiency. I'll also ask about Tamoxifen. I have my regularly scheduled oncologist appointment on Friday. At my first appt. the neurologist did a very thorough exam and said he was 80% sure it was carpal tunnel. The next appointment he did the EMG and ruled out carpal tunnel. He said the next logical step would be to do the MRI. He didn't give me a list of things it could be or really what he expected. So here I am. Waiting. Breathe in. Breathe out.

      "Content": "Dec 29, 2007 10:16PM - edited Dec 29, 2007 10:17PM by malucho1 I have the numbness on both hands. Mostly the fingers. BTW, I had a bilateral mastectomy with sentinel node biopsy on both sides. Could it be a result of the surgery??? I first noticed the numbness about 1 month AFTER the end of my chemotherapy treatments. The first time I felt it I was in a yoga class doing \"triangle\" pose. I couldn't feel my hand up in the air. It was a very strange sensation. I wiggled it around and the feeling came back. Now, the numbness is in both hands. It comes and goes but seems to me to be slowly progressing. I notice it often. I appreciate the feedback so far! Very good info re. CTS from Tender. I'll keep that in mind. And, Donna, do you have numbness only on your lumpectomy side? That would give good evidence suggesting it may be related to surgery! My \"gut\" feeling is that mine must somehow be aggravated by/caused by the surgery or chemotherapy as I had never experienced anything similar before. However, the neurologist says that the chemo-induced neuropathy would have presented first in the feet and then moved up. Mine didn't do that. Another possibility might be Tamoxifen. As far as I know, hand numbness is not a known side effect but the timing would be exact. I started Tamoxifen about 1 month after I finished chemo and right when the numbness and tingling started. One more thing: I really hate to admit this\u2014 because it sounds a bit scary\u2014but I sometimes have numbness in my lips as well. Other than that, I'm fit as a fiddle. LOL.",
