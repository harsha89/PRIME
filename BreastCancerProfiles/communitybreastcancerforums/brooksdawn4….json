It is oval shape with smooth edges.  I have search Internet all night and just not getting the answers I'm looking for no matter how I word solid breast mass. I don't know if I can wait till biopsy.  I may have to just call my doctor and ask what is the medical term.  That will probably the only way to get a definite answer of what the heck is in my boob. and if i may have to have it taken out.  Which is another concern. To impatient to wait for biopsy wants answers now. Im sure just like the thousands of other concerned woman!",

I got a call back stating I needed another mammogram done on my left breast because it showed an area that needed further evaluation.  So I go back and they do another mam. on my breast and then told me to wait while the radiologist read results.  the next thing I know I was whisked to get an ultrasound done. of course Im looking at the monitor as the ultrasound was being done all I saw was a big black mass about the size of a silver dollar. It was solid black no gray or white in it at all.I knew it was something cause the tech must of took a dozen pictures of it. then she said the radiologist wanted to do another ultra sound herself and a breast exam she seemed puzzled that she couldn't feel it. Im puzzled too because I'm a small b cup and the MASS the term she use seem pretty big to me and solid.  She told me I need to get a sterotactic core biopsy. The only thing she said was try not to worry that it seem to have benign characteristics.  of I had to get on the Internet.trying to diagnose myself. to me it looks like a fibrodenoma  solid mass not the cyst ones .but I didnt understand why she never gave the mass a medical term. also why a core biopsy is need and not just the fine needle 1st  kind of biopsy they had listed  I'm 45 and have not  feet this in the dark before. Please help educate me. I have to wait to dec 4th to get biopsy.",
