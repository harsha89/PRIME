She had her stem cell transplant and was able to be chemo free for five mo this before the disease again appeared with a vengeance. She tried everything. Her doctors were superb and offered everything possible. Lindy never lost faith and was still fighting when she passed. She was an inspiration to everyone who met her. She loved her children more than life itself. We miss her dearly. I pray for a cure to this horrible disease and for all who are suffering its devastation. Lindy forever lives in our hearts!",
