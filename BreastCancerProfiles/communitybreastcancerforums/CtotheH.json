    "Content": "CtotheH wrote: I am 42. I have noticed nipple discharge twice this week in my right breast. When I squeeze my nipple, there is no discharge. Both times, I noticed it in my bra and on my nipple (was almost exactly what I used to see when breastfeeding...small amount, dried up discharge). Color has been dark white-ish (not super white but also not yellow and not bloody). I have also had tenderness in right breast for over a year. It's on the lower part of my right breast and I don't notice it until I push on it (in which case it's pretty painful). When I first noticed the soreness, I read as much as I could and felt reassured that breast cancer did NOT hurt. I now see on these boards that that is not necessarily true. I have always had very dense, fibrous breasts. I've had multiple mammograms, but last was almost two years ago. And I've never had any other kind of imaging on my breasts. I don't feel anything that feels like a \"pea\" but the tenderness keeps me from pushing around too hard. And because of my breast density, my breasts don't feel the same and never have so I can't really tell if the lumps and bumps I feel should concern me. I do not have any BC in my family, that I know of. I can say for certain, not mother and not grandmother. I've just requested an appointment 'scheduling call' from MD Anderson Breast Center (I'm in Houston and it's late on a Sunday). Has anyone seen these symptoms? I have a 4 and 6 y/o that I breastfed for a year each. I had multiple bouts of mastitis on the same breast with my first. I don't know if that matters, but thought worth mentioning.
