I'm dying to - but it seems between the feeling crappy on chemo, getting sick and being in the hospital for a week and hubby working every weekend, the timing just hasn't been right. We are the couple who used to have sex nearly ever night - in spite of the 18 year age difference (I'm the younger of the two) so this stuff has been devestating. I have yet to figure out if it hurts (I'll remember the lube comment) or if he's going to find me attractive without hair. I have no wigs and don't plan to get any. I guess he'll just have to find something else to wrap his fingers in. (that sounded way more perverted than I intended...) I haven't quit smoking though after a week in the hospital I should have. What I have found is most times - especially if I'm home alone all day like today - I just don't smoke. I've had two today. I wonder too why the \"c\" word didn't immediatly make me want to quit but I'll enjoy the tapering off and maybe someday soon I'll be smoke free as well. ",

Not from mouth sores - just everything but yogurt tastes like poo. Maybe I'll lose the 10 pounds I gained when I was diagnosed and went on a food vacation!! There was a work \"after work\" party - Ugly Christmas Sweater party - but I couldn't stay - after 30 minutes I realized if I didn't leave then I would be needing to take pain meds and unable to drive. Pblttt.  Giving myself the Nuelasta shot was VERY different than giving a shot to someone else. I used to be a caregiver so I figured it would be a piece of cake....Dang - injecting AND hurting - and knowing you have to keep injecting is not nearly as fun as JUST pushing the plunger oblivious to the pain you might be inflicting on the other person. I think next time I'll leave it out to \"warm to room temperature\" longer than the 30 minutes.   Keeping it short. I hope everyone is having a good Friday night. ",

I had my port removed in the hospital - but was \"awake\" for the surgery. I was in patient already because I was neurtopenic and had a fever. They sedated me but didn't put me under. I'm pretty used to surgeries in general so it didn't bother me too much, but I imagine if you were someone with phobias or fears about that sort of thing it might be a little disturbing. Feeling the pressure (not pain) while they were removing it, talking to the dr. while he was taking it out...all very surreal. I'm trying to find information about leg swelling. Last week I had 2 whole days where my swelling in both legs and feet was so bad I couldn't walk well, wear shoes, and even my toes became swollen. My oncologist told me on the 19th that the swelling should improve over time and was because of the Taxotere. However, its only gotten worse. My PCP seems to think this is lymphedema. Is that even possible? I've heard of arm lymphedema from node removal, but it seems far fetched to me that it could effect my legs (especially both legs). Has anyone heard anything like that? He bumped my dose of Lasix to 160 mg daily (was at 80) and it helped the first day (yesterday) but tonight it seems the Lasix isn't working because the swelling is coming back. I just can't seem to find any information anywhere. He's sending me to a physical therapist who specializes in Lymphedema treatment - so maybe I'll find out more then...In the meantime I just keep wondering and worrying. Ugh.  That being said - with the swelling gone for that amazing 24 hours I finally got some energy back and was able to actually clean my bedroom, do laundry and vacuume. That felt good - I've been feeling very guilty for being such a lump. ",

My poor husband is at a loss for how to help and said to me today, \"If you want to discontinue treatment, I will support you\". That NOT what I want to do, but I don't know how I will be able to handle three more rounds (its a dose every three weeks) with 8 or more \"bad days\" each time. I've heard it mentioned a few times that sometimes the dr. can adjust the chemo dosage, but event though I told my dr. yesterday about everything this week has brought, there has been no mention of adjusting dosage or frequency. Honestly I haven't been impressed with my care team - over the first few days of pain they actually questioned why I was feeling so much joint pain. My joint pain was so bad I couldn't walk and only full dose percocet around the clock (for 36 hours) even gave me slight releif. When I saw the dr. yesterday (PA actually) she said \"Cindy its just that usually these treatments don't cause that much pain so I'm not sure why you experienced that\". I feel like they are questioning my symptoms which is VERY unsettling and frustrating. She asked if I had history of joint trouble - I don't have any history and have never had pain like this in my life. I have an appointment with another cancer center on the 7th of December but I wonder if that is the right choice. I thought if I went and talked to my dr. and explained in person what I was going through that would make a difference in the approach - but now I don't feel it will. She only gave me the \"I'm sorry, but don't know what to say\" spiel. I was told yesterday my WBC is \"very\" low but am not sure if that is why I'm feeling so many side effects or not. I'm emotional. I hurt. I feel alone. I just don't know what to do about it. I am a generally positive person and this is killing me, making me feel emotionally \"weak\".",

Each run through with a brush or my fingers results in dozens of hairs falling out.   I don't think I am ready for that though I've been waiting each day for this to happen.

That we are all going through similar (yet different) journeys right now some how makes me feel at peace.  I just got out of surgery for port removal. Besides the fact it never worked right (pinched under the clavicle they say) they suspected it may have been infected. I was awake for the removal - THAT was wierd. Dr. said it didn't appear to be infected when he removed it. They will put a new one in next week some time on the opposite side, same side where the lumpectomy was. I asked if I get a discount for being a repeat customer, buy one get one half off or something. Sadly the answer was no.  I think the H1N1 came back negative, but there is still question about that. If thats the case then during this whole stay I have no idea what the heck has been wrong.  My WBC now are \"too high\" staying at 20.6 and today 19.9. I haven't talked to a doc about that so I'm hoping they will still release me. The high white count is concerning them and they don't think its from the Nuelasta shot, but maybe it is. I will leave here with more questions than answers, but leaving is the important thing.  Seems like \"stubbles\" are the topic of the day. I'm stressed about the hairless debut at work but more so my family. They haven't seen me in days....I'll let you know how it goes.  When the dr. came last night to tell me they had decided to remove the port, I was halfway through the conversation with him before I remembered I didn't have hair- so I guess I forgot to be self consious about it. :) ",

Day 4 was the worst for pain - joint pain from my hips to my toes, but on day 4 it settled mostly in my ankles and feet. Other than yesterday when I was asleep every moment I could be (including on the potty) I hadn't had much sleep - the pain was keeping me awake. I started yesterday (day 5) as being constipated, but over night ended up with the opposite problem. I hadn't taken any laxatives, just fiber and a stool softener.  I just realized what a wonderful post this is for Thanksgiving morning. Sorry. *sheepish grin* Anyway - I am supposed to bring a green bean casserole to a friend's house for a pot luck dinner. I think I should be able to manage that. I feel like I've rounded the bend to the side of this chemotherapy round that side effects start to diminish. I have to say I was expecting very little side effects, so this was a bit of a suprise. ",

Joint pain started Sunday early (like 12:30 a.m.) but today at work was bad. Hips to toes on both sides and walking at work like an old lady. However tonight (after dr. orders) I took 2 Percocet at 5p.m. and the pain came back so terrible in my ankles and feet by just after 9 p.m. I couldn't walk. Dear Husband gave me two more Percocet (max dose is 2 every 4 hours) and after about 40 minutes the thunderous roar of pain subsided enough that I could walk. I have spent the last hour soaking my lower legs in the hot water of the bathtub. I know we aren't \"doctors\" here but I hoped someone else may have suggestions, input or something that will maybe help me deal with this.  I'm grateful I don't have other symptoms right now as I don't think I could bear it, however I really need to go to work - desk job - and wanted to see if others have solutions that may enable me to actually make it there or at least have some experience to tell me how long I can possibly expect this severe of joint pain to last after the first treatment.  Thanks to each of you. Anyone else going through the same thing - you have my dearest empathy. Other that labor I can't recall ever having this much pain in my body... Thanks ladies.",

Everything helps! If your advice holds true I should be thinking about taking another dose soon. I guess I just wasn't prepared for so much pain so early after the first round. I'm an information hog and haven't been able to find much. Does anyone know \"why\" the joint pain comes on?   A co-worker who is a year out of treatment said something about receiving a shot prior to chemo to help with the joint pain - any experience from anyone in that regard? She said the joint pain comes because joints are where the red? blood cells are made....Anyone know if that is why? ",

My port worked for a while - but only when I layed back. If I stood up or was propped up at a 90 degree angle it would stop. About 3 a.m. it really started hurting - tender and the tape had come off. I called for the RN to reatach it. Instead she thought I was asking for pain meds....NO, I just need this taped back down. Instead she ended up having to take it out all together. It then took two other nurses to start a regular IV. By then I'm crying - crying because I hurt, crying because my friends and family are home snug in their beds and I can't even call, crying because I'm so frustrated with the trouble I've had with this port....But of course the nurse helping thinks I'm scared of needles - which is not the case. They got an IV started about an hour later - close to 5 a.m.Finally got pain medicine though the back pain is only mildly helped by that, my headache feels better, my throat and gums feel a little better. The nurse tells me she thinks the dr. is going to order a CT on my head to find out where the pain, pressure is coming from.  I'm going to be bored so I hope you guys don't mind frequent updates as I am sitting here. ",

They have not been able to determine the source of my infection (infection assumed because of my fever since Sunday). The latest theory is that I have H1N1. They are treating me \"as if\" though of course I won't know till the testing center at UW gives the result and that can take a week.The good news is - if I do have H1N1 - it may very well mean my extreme side effects may not have all been chemo related - so maybe next round will be easier to take!   I've been through a few stressful situations and have had a few very frank conversations with the staff in charge as a result. I feel I'm in the middle of a place that doesn't seem to know how to communicate with paitents or coordinate care in a way that the patient is taken care of without stress.  I will spare the details as I don't want to dump on a local medical facility but it has NOT been pleasant.  Add to that my husband's father passed Monday night unexpectedly.  He's dealing with trying to support me through this and now trying to deal with this death on his own - he refuses to turn to me for support for fear it will add to my stress. I've tried to get him to talk, but he hasn't. He is taking this very hard. I'm afraid with me and now the death of his father it is more than he can handle by himself but no matter how I try to talk to him - he is steadfast in his resolve to keep it to himself. He won't even turn to friends. *sigh*  I want to be there for him and I am stuck here. Him and my daughter both started presenting with fevers today, runny nose, sore throat. I made them both see the doctor. They are now being treated with Tamiflu and my daughter recevied the H1N1 vaccine. $124 later for the RX for the two of them - ouch. I'm just glad he didn't fight me (you know how they can be) about going to the doctor.  On a bright note, I had a wonderful visit from Amanda (HOPE for Robin). It was a very nice suprise to meet her and visit for a while. My husband can't come see me anymore since he is sick with flu symptoms and I pretty much have asked my friends and family to stay away as a precaution  too.  My brother has a compromised immune system already (HIV) and mom isn't a spring chicken...so its me, the staff and my lap top.  The crown of my head has just become very tender over the course of the day. Has anyone experienced this? I'm wondering if it has to do with chemo or not.  Thanks for everyones kind words of encouragement. ",

The other good thing - is the clot was really the furthest from the Doctors speculation - what he was really thinking was \"heart or kidney failure\" - which was NOT indicated with the blood tests.

It didn't work right and they feared it may have been infected. I'm not getting another one - so I'll be all IV for treatments - only 3 to go. Next TX is on the 15th of December.

From what my oncologist has told me - this is probably the minimum treatment for a breast cancer diagnosis, for which I am grateful. Other than losing my hair, I don't know what to expect. I will try to comb the thread to gleen informaiton here and look forward to my chemo-ed appointment on Wednesday.  November chemo - here I come! ",

I was re-visiting my writing from that tumultous time in my life and came across my post again. I am here to report there is life after - after all of this. It's been 3.5 years since my initial diagnosis. I can wear my hair in a pony tail. My eyebrows are mostly filled in - though not as thick as before which only saves me money on waxing! I go to work and feel like a woman. I've lost nearly 70 pounds - some of which I gained during treatment. I still struggle with fear. Every 6 months when I go for my mamogram I worry they are taking too long to tell me to get dressed and all is well. Last time I heard another woman getting what sounded like \"its not good news\" which broke my heart. It happens every day. Every day someone is faced with this challenge for the first time. I'm grateful for the network of survivors who helped me through the worst of my emotional feelings about being diagnosed with breast cancer. Thank you to every one who is reading this - YOU helped. YOU are helping.",
