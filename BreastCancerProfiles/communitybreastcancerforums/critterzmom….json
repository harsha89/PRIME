I've always been the \"strong one\" and I'm not at all good at reaching out to family and friends.",

I have undergone many diagnostic procedures (CTs, MRIs, PET scan, lumbar puncture) in an attempt to locate the primary source, with no luck, and there are no other indications of metastatic disease. I am currently on hormone therapy. Can anyone share experiences or suggest sources of information for this situation? My oncologist has been pretty patient with my questions but I still don't feel like I have enough information to make the decisions that have to be made at this point. Thanks for any help!
