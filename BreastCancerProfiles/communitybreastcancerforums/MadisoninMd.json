Leesa- I can relate with your limiting the threads you read. For the first 2 months or so after dx, I wouldn't read anything that was not clinical information.  With everything swimming around in my head, I just couldn't.  At the time, I needed to focus on the medical info related to the disease in order to make treatment decisions. Now that I'm actively in treatment, I'm more willing to seek out experiences of others, but like you, I am very careful of what I read.  Everyone's experience can be different, so I try to arm myself with information, but not freak myself out in the process. Wild- I agree that unfortunately we are not the first, and won't be the last to walk this path.  Knowing that there are thousands of women and men who have taken on the bc beast and won gives me hope. I've always given everything 105% and this current situation is no different. Like you, I have no idea why this particular challenge is part of my life plan.  I'm not sure that I'll ever be glad it happened, I just pray that someday I will understand why it did. Here's hoping for minimal se's for all of us! ",

All in all I'm feeling okay although I'm still battling fatigue and some body aches.  Today I have been incredibly thirsty for some odd reason. I've had over 100 oz of water and still feel dry as the desert.  Thanks again Taxotere!  I hope this \"gift\" passes quickly because all of the trips to the little girls room are getting old!  I guess that one way to get a little exercise in though.  I've been fighting the desire to visit the \"bitch and moan\" club today.  I'm just having one of those I'm sick of all of this crap days.  I bought a new book this afternoon so I'm headed to read for a little while and then to bed.  Wishing everyone a wonderful evening and peaceful dreams.

I can feel my taste buds on the way out - but I've been trying the olive oil trick this time so hopefully that will work a little.  I've also been really good about my water today.  I told my MO about my increased bone pain with the last cycle and admitted I slacked on the water a bit last time because it tasted so bad.  He said that T can cause that but said keeping hydrated with lots of water really does help.  Thank goodness the flavor packets help because that's the only thing that makes water appealing right now. I hope all are doing well. Madison",

Gracie - I never had a onco test done but my MO recommended TC instead of ACT because of my negative nodes.  He calls it \"chemo light\".  Not sure I would call this experience \"light\" but anyway.. He also said that he felt in my case ACT would be over treating me and he had serious ethical reservations about doing that. Bailey- Your Panera story gave me chills.  How incredible!  A reminder that God puts people in our path that we need, when we need them. Erica - Glad to hear that your first treatment went well!  I can understand the feeling of sadness that others are going through this same mess as I often feel the same.  I only hope that I can pass on my experience and knowledge gained and that it will in some way bring comfort and possibly hope to someone else. Rachel - I hope you had a fabulous birthday and treated yourself to something wonderful. I can understand about not feeling up to celebrating.  I felt the exact same over Christmas and New Year's.  I just wasn't in the mood.  Hopefully next year when all of this mess is behind us, we'll feel more celebratory. Josie - So far my brows and lashes are hanging in there.  My chemo teaching nurse told me that she didn't think I'd lose them completely, only that they might thin.  I'm not exactly sure what the reasoning was for her prediction.  I haven't noticed any thinning as of yet.  Keeping my fingers crossed they stay put!  Not brow or lashes- but I've started noticing some hair growth!  Too bad it's not on my head- but I'll take what I can get for now.  It is encouraging to see though. Heather - I think we're due for our last treatment on the same day.  Jan 30th?  It's hard to believe that we're just about a week away from our last one.  In November when this mess started- I didn't think this time would ever come.  Amazing what we, and our bodies, have been through in three short months. Wishing everyone a wonderful week! All my best, Madison",

Melrose - Welcome to the group!  This is a fabulous group of ladies!!  You will definitely find support, encouragement, and yes, even a few laughs here.  As a few others have said, chemo is absolutely doable.  Just take it one treatment/one day at a time and before you know it, they will all be in the rear view mirror!  I was glad to read you have joined a thread of other April chemo gals.  The support and camaraderie of those on the chemo train with you is invaluable.

I am less than a week away from my last of 4 treatments. I've worked full time since the beginning (including treatment days). I have never <knock on wood> felt even a twinge of nausea, no vomiting, no fingernail issues, etc.      The only things I've noticed are body aches (similar to flu aches- but just in my lower legs) that last about 3 days, drier skin than normal, the loss of taste buds for the first couple of days (like you've burnt your tongue on something too hot - but it's your whole mouth), loss of hair on my head and fatigue. My eyebrows and lashes have stayed put.  The fatigue is annoying at times- but it is also doable.  I find it is more noticeable the first week after treatment.  My treatments are on Monday and usually by Saturday afternoon I've turned the corner and feel pretty good for the next 2 weeks.  The one thing I do the weekend before treatment is make sure I've cleaned the house, caught up on laundry, ran all of those little errands etc.  That way, for the entire week, I can just relax and take care of myself.  It seems to help me knowing that there isn't dry cleaning to pick up, stamps to buy etc.  I do have friends and family that would help me out with those things, but it has been really important to me to keep things as normal as I possibly can.  Doing those little things for myself keeps that sense of normalcy in my life.  I have noticed a bit of chemo brain- but I don't think it's really noticable to anyone but me.  I've noticed that I'm a bit more forgetful and sometimes words don't come to me as quickly.  I think part of it's the drugs, but I do believe the other is just the overload my brain has been on since diagnosis.  At first I was beginning to think it would never stop spinning.  Once some of the unknowns were eliminated, things really did calm down.  I hope this helps in some way. Feel free to post (or pm me) any questions or concerns, no matter what they are.  If I can't answer, there are loads of ladies here that are always more than willing to help a fellow sister.  All my best, Madison",

The other thing that I have read on this site that has helped ladies during treatment week is to cook a few meals and freeze them.  That way on those nights that you just don't feel like cooking you can just pull something out of the freezer and warm up.   For me, being prepared for the things I can anticipate (running errands, having laundry caught up, meals in the freezer etc) before treatment allows me to mentally prepare for the things I can't anticipate should they happen.  That way if I'm not feeling up to those tasks in the few days after treatment, I don't have to worry about it.  I can just take it easy and focus on feeling better.  Hang in there and know that we are all here to support you through this!

Erica- Yuck about the fever!  Glad to hear the antibiotics are helping some.  Sending healing vibes your way.  Can't wait to see the superhero dude your friend came up with. Lisa - Glad to hear you had a quiet, and hopefully restful weekend.  It's a big milestone for you tomorrow.  Although the chemo journey doesn't quite end tomorrow (thanks again se's) it does mark a significant point in your journey.  I hope you celebrate and treat yourself to something wonderful!  I had lunch with the family and am thinking about a massage next week after the aches subside. Heather W - It's true... I've found strength throughout this journey that I didn't know I had.  I already have made plans of how I can use this strength for good once this little adventure is behind me.  Time to make some changes that are long overdue!  If I can make it through this little bit of hell~ I can handle anything!  Sending healing and positive vibes to my fellow Dec sisters! All my best, Madison",

Its nice to share and keep up with others who are on the same schedule.  If you haven't already- take a peek at the Dec or Jan threads.  There are awesome ladies there who can provide lots of guidance and support.",

I recall reading on another thread (author please forgive me- I forgot where I read it to give proper credit) that as a patient she was told by a nurse that she (the nurse) prays for each bc patient that they have a \"swift and safe journey through this hell\".  I've thought about that statement ever since I read it.  What a perfect sentiment.",

I am currently undergoing neo-adjuvant chemo.  My second of four TC treatments is scheduled for tomorrow.  Question is- does the nervousness before treatment ever go away?  Granted I'm not as terrified as I was three weeks ago, but I've still been a nervous wreck all day.   My first treatment was relatively non-eventful with only mild se's (burnt mouth, hair loss, itchiness for 2 days).  I think I'm scared that won't continue.  Any words of wisdom?
