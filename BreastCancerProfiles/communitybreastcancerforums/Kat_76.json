On Friday I learnt that they found calcifications in my right breast and needed to look at them closer. After today I know that some of the calcifications are looking suspicious and the radiologist recommended a stereotactic biopsy. I guess it was good the radiologist's room was dark, they may not have really seen life draining out of me..   I found myself in an entirely uncharted territory.. I have no clue what questions to ask. I'm waiting for a call from my primary and trying to educate myself - which seems right now like it will take me ages, there's so much information out there.. Looking through the boards I already know I should have requested a report from the imaging center, but didn't (once again, had no clue + very freaked out). So I really don't know how they're grading the suspicious calcifications, based on mammo. I'd really be grateful for any advice as to how I should talk to my primary, what questions to ask her, etc. Some background info - I do have a history of \"dense breasts\", but the only ultrasonography I had (8 years ago) didn't show anything, consult with oncologist confirmed nothing to worry about.. Last 1.5 years - went through a lot of fertility treatments with loads of hormones taken on a monthly basis (unsuccessful) - not sure if this could result in the calcifications, but could it raise reasonable doubt for the need to biopsy - vs. waiting a few months and re-checking then? Also - I asked the radiologist whether the mammo photos should be reviewed by an oncologist. She said 'no', as the oncologist would probably not even know what they're looking at.  How is that even possible? Should I still try to have an appointment scheduled with an oncologist to review the mammo shots? One thing stuck in my mind from one of the threads - is there a difference as to who does the biopsy? Can it be a radiologist, a breast cancer radiologist?  What's best? I want to make sure the biopsy is successful and there's no unnecessary bleeding - or - that the sample taken will be enough to give them a conclusive dx. Lastly - anyone from the DC metro area had a biopsy done recently and can share a recommendation?  Once again - I'd really appreciate it. (I'm sure there are more questions to come as I pester google, so so very grateful for any advice you can share). Kat Log in to post a reply",
