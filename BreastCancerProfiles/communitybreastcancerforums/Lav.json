It indicates in my report that with tamoxifen my chances of a reccurence go down to 8. So in d end u have to see what your Oncologist suggests to you. I dont know if after going thru chemo how that would affect with you wanting to have children later on .. Maybe some of the others could help you out with that. I totally understandhow you feel but go with what your hezrt and inner voice says in d end. Being positive about your choice and being in a positive state of mind is very impt inthe healing process.... Hugs n good luck...",
