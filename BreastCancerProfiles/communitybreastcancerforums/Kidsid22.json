    "Content": "Kidsid22 wrote: I have been having moderate to severe vaginal atrophy that started during chemo tx around July 2016, After completing chemo and radiation I started Tamoxifen but had to discontinue due to the severity of my symptoms. I am currently on a compound rx cream that includes low dose of Estriol. Long story short I was finally starting to feel better-until today-I lifted a bunch of heavy boxes..kind of a late spring cleaning. Now my symptoms are back in full force-even sitting is uncomfortable. I was wondering if anyone has experienced this situation? or has any advice I'm running out of hope here. any help or suggestions would be BEYOND helpful and greatly appreciated. Thank you!
