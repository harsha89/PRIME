Today was supposed to be Day26 but I am feeling so bad that I canceled my treatment today and may cancel tomorrow's treatment. Just dark reddened to dark brown skin with soreness and tightness. Also experiencing painful jabs in right irradiated breast I had been doing well with minor fatigue until two days ago. And then I got a really bad arthritis in my neck shoulder and hands with a lot of nerve pain in my hands that is debilitating. Couldn't sleep last night. I had lumpectomies in both breasts with breast reduction. ILC was in right breast.",
