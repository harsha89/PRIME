Her surgery was 5 weeks after the last treatment - she had FEC and Taxol before the surgery so she needed more recovery time. I fully expect to hear that it was likely they just couldn't feel the lump (explaining why both the surgeon or MO declared it gone) and that no other chemo treatment is called for.  I found a way to articulate it to her team - as follows: \"If you had known for certain that her lump was gone mid September (for example via an MRI) and then 5 weeks later after surgery there was a 5cm lump, would that change the current treatment plan - i.e. rads next?\"   I spoke to her surgeon's nurse today and they're going to discuss it and review all the notes from the exams......all I care about is that everything is considered at the appropriate time.  I am really grateful to have had such a caring, thoughtful response (of course we all spoke \"hypothetically\") rather than a dismissive you have no right here.  They just want the best for her too. Will report back...thanks for the comments.",

      "Content": "LizSei wrote: (also posted on Chemo board - sorry if I'm not supposed to post in two places) My friend had a 6cm x 9cm IDC lump and at least 1 positive node at diagnosis (biopsy) and the surgeon felt it was likely Inflammatory as well (that diagnosis was never absolutely confirmed and there is some debate about it amongst the oncologists - the lump grew to its size very quickly).  She went into chemo immediately (FEC-D) and the lump responded quickly and by her last chemo neither the medical oncologist or surgeon could detect it in a physical examination. She had a mastectory and axillary resection 3 weeks ago and we got the pathology results last Friday.  We were disappointed by the fact there was still a 5cm lump and 5 positive nodes.  She starts radiation in 2 weeks (chest, armpit,neck) and is taking tamoxifen.  My question is .... what if that growth happened between chemo and surgery - would that indicate the need for more chemo?  It crossed my mind briefly in the meeting with the surgeon on Friday but she was so upset I didn't want to go there until I had thought it through.  Now she has pulled herself back up over the weekend so I really don't want to raise this with her if it's not an issue. Any similar experiences here?  My plan is to call the surgeon's nurse (fortunately I am a former patient and they know me well - I think we can get around the privacy issues by having a hypothetical conversation plus they know I have been with her at every appointment and treatment and ask many questions with her permission).  I know this all leads back to the medical oncologist - just trying to sort it out in my mind.  Thanks for any information.
