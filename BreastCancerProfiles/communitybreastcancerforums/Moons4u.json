My doctor told me this past week I have breast cancer, but waiting on final pathology. Hard news to get, but with young kids and work, I am keeping my mind distracted. Long road ahead of me, but I will get there.",

I know it is invasive, just nothing more. She told me this past week and I spent the next day crying and then pulled myself together and went to work the next day. It is really hard!!! My husband has been amazing!! I am the first in my family and 38 years old. I put on a smile and continue to keep my mind busy. I have been on this website every night getting more and more information. Thank goodness for others posting information. It has been very helpful!!",
