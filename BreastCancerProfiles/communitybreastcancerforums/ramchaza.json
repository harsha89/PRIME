She's getting chemo, in clinical trials, will bave a double mastec., and a forced menopause.  She's not to the point where she's thinking about what this will do to her as a woman. I'm looking for books, maybe from a feminist point of view? about what this does to a woman's mind. There has to be something out there along these lines! How to help her deal with this as a woman. I think she probably, from the little she's said, that she feels guilty thinking about it from that point of view, she's just in the \"do what I have to to stay alive\" which is of course good, but those other thoughts about how it'll affect her as a woman will be there, too.  Hope it makes sense what I'm asking.
