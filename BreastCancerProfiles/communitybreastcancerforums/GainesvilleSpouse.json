We understand the basic diagnosis of infiltrative poorly differentiated carcinoma, compatible with primary breast cancer - that it is invasive and grade 3 - but they believe it hasn't spread yet to other organs. But can anyone help us understand other language:  Immunoperoxidase panel strongly diffusely positive. CK7 shows focal positivity in the tumor cells. ??? Surrounding ductal tissue is positive for CK7.  ??? This poorly differentiated infiltrative carcinoma has focal, small ductal features. ??? There are rare positive cells also in the mammaglobin stain. ??? Synaptophysin, chromogranin, and CK20 are negative. ??? Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "GainesvilleSpouse wrote: My wife, age 70 and in good health (but asthmatic - well-controlled), was diagnosed on May 1st and had a lumpectomy on May 14th which removed a 1.2 cm. tumor just under her nipple. The surgeon found clear margins and clear sentinel nodes. He said he felt 99% sure he got it all. He is very well-regarded and a very nice guy. BUT the pathology report showed estrogen at 93% and progesterone at 91% and Ki67 at 92% - and HER2 positive. A family member is an oncological P.A.. She recommended being aggressive with Herceptin and Taxotere and Carboplatin. When we met our oncologist, she recommended exactly the same regimen. So my wife had her first Herceptin infusion (port) last Monday and Taxotere and Carboplatin on Tuesday and Neulasta on Wed. Went as smoothly as could be expected. She felt pretty much okay until yesterday. Felt \"crappy\" - and seemed close to miserable - much of the day. Mostly read and slept. Mild nausea, some diarrhea, some achiness - including some in the big toe in the evening. Took Phenergan at bedtime and slept okay. This morning she is so-so. Feeling fairly normal. Long info buildup to our question: yesterday was no fun and she has 18 weeks ahead of chemo - followed by radiation. Do side effects come and go during the chemo cycles? Basically, what can she expect to have to deal with in the coming days/weeks/months. Any feedback from women who have gone through a similar regimen would be greatly appreciated.
