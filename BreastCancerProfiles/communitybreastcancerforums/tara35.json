The days when I have my treament that's the only day I would stay home from work.

I finish chemo like two weeks ago. and my hair on my head start growing out very quiclky.  I'm very thankful for that. I had very thick eyebrow and it only thinning. As for my eyelashes. The top have a little on both side. As for the bottom I don't have any. What is the name of the strengthener you're using on you lasehes??? Also I notice that you're triple negative. Are you plaining on using any type of medication after you finish with radiation???? I'm also triple negative, but my doctor suggested that she wants to see me in February to decide if I should use Tamoxifen. I'm really scared and worried about the side effect. I havn't decided yet what I'm going to do.  Take care hope to hear from you really soon.",
