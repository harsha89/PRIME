BUT now it seems like 6 mo went by fast, and the outcome was worth it.I am from the March group, had neoadjuvant AC T(taxol switched to abraxane after 2 doses) chemo for very aggressive HR+ ca, and sx in August with a very good outcome, so I just thought I'd share. The chemo killed the aggressive ca, post chemo MRI showed complete response, no palpable tumor and post sx only very slow growing patches of ca cells not likely to metasize left. That was removed with wide clear margins, had oncoplastic sx, so cosmetic outcome actually is great. I was 49, premenopausal, very fit, long blonde hair, losing all that and not knowing what it would turn me into was sooo hard in itself, add the terrifying cancer aspect--I was a wreck, totally in shock and depressed in the beginning. Acupuncture, exercise (every other week during AC), yoga and meditation helped greatly with my mental state. So did medication if I really needed it, I didn't feel bad since I knew it was short term. I used medical marijuana (my MO said it was fine) CBD/THC 1:1 either with vape pen or sublingual oil and it helped greatly for pain, nausea, sleep, generally feeling crappy. Vape pen was great since its fast and short acting. I would wake up at 4am feeling terrible, couldn't stomach anymore pills, few puffs and bad feeling would melt away could sleep a few more hours. I didn't worry about THC causing ER+ ca to grow because chemo works best on fast growing cells and both oncologists reassured me that because my ca was so aggressive chemo would work well (this sounded so scary at the time). Also read that the 1:1 ratio could kill it--lots of conflicting info. Bottom line, the chemo really worked as they said it would. Losing hair was huge for me! Went from bob to shaved/fun haircut to bald in one week after 2nd AC and for sure I cried. BUT its already back 9weeks pfc, (one inch of hair on my head now started growing during abraxane) and eyebrows and lashes(back to before, used latisse), hair came back everywhere thicker than before. Color started out grayish noncolor and now its back to original dark blonde.I can go wigless now but got used to them and have fun with it, people actually complement me and ask me about my hairstyles(wigs) :) I had super regular periods, did not feel like I was nearing menopause prechemo. My last one was in April seemed like it went on and off for weeks. None since. Actually feel really good without them, do not miss the extreme PMS and headaches, cramps etc. I did have pretty extreme night sweats (totally drenched clothes, sheets) that started during AC and continued through taxol/abraxane. I think this was chemo/menopause combo. Those are much better now, I would call them mild hot flashes, feels like nothing after chemo. For sure my journey is not over and that is the hard part--its so long, I have to start rads (very scary for me) and tamoxifen afterwards. But what seemed like the worst is already fading to distant memory and all effects of chemo seem to be disappearing. I still have my bad moments where depression and anxiety briefly take over, how could I not ? However, its not controlling my life and not determining any outcomes. Acupuncturist always reminds me that you can't do anything about the past and you don't know about the future, its an unknown, the unknown can be something good. I got really frustrated with weakness and limitations and would complain, I felt like I couldn't do anything. Response I got was you are doing something, its called healing. The present is all you can really control, and you just do the best you can. We are all dealing with this disease that affects so many aspects of our lives and there is unfortunately no easy way out. I realize my experience doesn't dictate anyone else's, but this site has helped me a lot and I hope this post helps someone. Wishing you all the best in a very challenging time ",

I have done 13/15 whole breast (i'm doing the higher dose, shorter course), and my skin has stayed almost the same as after the first few tx (slightly pink at the end of the day)! 2 days ago I started getting a small itchy rash on upper chest area and the RO said normal sweat gland reaction but to use hydrocortisone if it bothers me. I did that and it didn't seem to help much, then I also slathered a lot of the emu oil on before bed and this morning rash was gone! I'm also still using my girls about 3x/day, combo seems to be working. I chose these 2 products based on users experience with them on this site. i also take advil and claritin every night as anti-inflammatories since I'm still dealing with myalgia from chemo, and this seems to control the tenderness/pain in breast that i'm getting from radiation as well. I notice a big difference when I don't take them. In addition I am very diet conscious, making sure I get enough hydration, protein, and certain vitamins from foods since I am not allowed to take supplements (other than the b vitamins). My RO and RN never recommended specific products proactively, rather they seem to wait until you have a problem. Also, I didn't see them until 10 days after starting rads (other than initial consult). This seems to be normal in larger high volume centers like where I am at. It is an NCI center using the newest technology which is mainly why I chose to go there. Their machine also is able to deliver extremely accurate dosing without any tattoos or marks on skin (red light system, they said cost the facility like 1/2 mil $, and will not work if breast has significant increase in size due to swelling). My point is, even though they don't seem to advise me much, due to their use of newest rads technology machine, IMRT, and hypo fractionated dosing, they assured me this would not be like the horror stories I read and they generally have good outcomes, so I feel good going there. That said, I know it is still likely to get worse since the effects are cumulative even after tx is over. Also, I was told there are always some individuals who react badly, but its usually due to other chronic illnesses or inflammatory processes in the body. I was very anxious of rads and therefore maybe going a little overboard. ugh, just writing about all this makes me feel like I've been overly proactive and paranoid, but I figure it can't hurt and if it worked for others then I want to try and do the same. Hope this helps some of you starting out, hang in there everyone, and enjoy the weekend (I also go in on sun) :)",

They acted like it couldn't be from radiation, said I shouldn't be showing any effects so soon in treatment--- I was kind of freaking out about it. They seemed to think it was due to irritation of tissues from lying in that position with arms up over my head for tx and that some women get that initially. I felt like it was more than that, I even felt like the breast was heavier and swollen feeling after first week. I took ibuprofen daily in the evening and using all the topical stuff (my girls and emu oil) and it did not get worse for a while, the achiness and heaviness actually improved. It was always pinker and achier in the evening and then back to normal in the am. Also felt like my energy levels dove and generally felt crappy by the end of each week. Weekends really helped to recover. Things suddenly seemed quite a bit worse after the last 2 tx, I'm glad I asked for an extra day off this week even though I have 4 days off for thanksgiving. Tomorrow is my last whole breast 15/21, then just boosts left... Its nice to hear from everyone because the medical team sometimes makes me feel like I'm overreacting Wishing you all well :)",

I am glad to hear you are doing better, my skin also seems to be having more tanned than burning look. Always slightly pink for a few hours each day but overall getting darker tan rather then red. Positive since I am blonde and fair though I do tan pretty dark if i am in the sun a lot. Lucyred--- I try to go topless for a bit to let lotions and oil absorb before I put a top on, and I'm using oil at night, put on light loose cotton tank under my other tops. It seems to be working cause in the am breast is still slightly oily. I don't use anything super thick like aquaphor though. I take shower in am before rads. They told me ibuprofen ok, ice not. I would be careful with plastic wrap since you don't want to trap too much moisture on the skin either (sweating can make it worse) as that can cause a moisture related breakdown ( I am an RN and have done a lot of wound care). Sometimes moisture is good like if you have a wound already, just ask your team to make sure... I am actually doing better than the first week! I started using emu oil (ok'd by RO and has anti-inflammatory properties) at night over the weekend, in the am breast is always calmed down again. Also using \"my girls like 3x/day and making sure to wear a bra when I am active. I think having the weekend off definitely helped too, but this week my breast is not significantly pinker or more irritated. They also reassured me I could have extra days off if I really need it (even emotionally). I just don't want inflammatory process to get out of control since that is often what causes tissue damage. They have had to really convince me to go through with this rads, I really didn't want it, and so they seem to be pretty accommodating to make sure I finish total tx plan. I was told couple extra days off here and there won't affect outcome. Now more than halfway done with whole breast rads, so far so good :)",

So, the last week of treatment seems to have culminated in some more unpleasant and lasting effects. I guess i am at that point now where I'm no longer going to recover completely in between tx and maybe continue to worsen after these last 2 whole breast are over :(--basically what I was told to expect. So, Friday evening the breast was super sensitive painful, burning, itching, although you couldn't see too much (slight pink square on chest). Also I felt generally very crappy, extremely fatigued, cold, achy, rt arm sore, flulike--just took medication went to bed early. Yesterday I was better again since no rads, but slight pink square is there this am--which makes me think its going to gradually worsen a bit still even after these 2 tx. Oh well, still better than what I initially expected. I have tomorrow off per my request, just because I really wanted it, and then only go tues and wed this week, then 4 days off thankfully! so this week I will be done with whole breast and have first of 6 boosts, they are not supposed to affect the entire chest area as far as SE's go. pebbles and spoonie-- your furry companions are so adorable! I can feel your positive attitudes through your posts and I really appreciate it. Its now been almost 8 months since I started treatment and beginning to feel really worn down and frustrated with all the changes in my life. A couple of weeks ago I got myself a Stan poodle puppy, i always wanted one and I am calling him my emotional support dog for going through all of this--he seems very tuned in to me already and always wants to please even though he is only 12 weeks. My kids as well as my other dog (2yr pit mix rescue) are having lots of fun with him as well, he lightens everything up for us! ",

This was a huge milestone for me, I had so many fears about rads and am so relieved that all went well with pretty minimal SE's (compared to my expectations), reassuring in respect to long term SE's. Also, finally finished the long course of my treatment that started in March (admittedly shorter than yours Linda--- Sept '17, WOW, you are so strong!). So thankful for everything including this forum! I really appreciated coming here daily to read the supportive posts and other's experiences. I'm currently trying to find a support group to go to because its just so hard for regular people to relate, even close friends and family, after all this time I think they are tired of it... Dwisley I had the dermatitis rash too and I was told by RO is response of the sweat glands and therefore concentrated more on the area of chest where we sweat more. Mine gradually got worse until about 4-5 days after the last whole breast and has since improved. The boosts were nothing, and I already feel somewhat recovered now 9 days after whole breast ended. Hardly any breast pain anymore, rash and fatigue are going away. Also found that using the emu oil and taking benadryl at night really helped, it always seemed to recover a bit by morning. Pebbles thanks for posting all the adorable domino photos, they are so uplifting. I feel like I can finally move forward with my life again now, will probably start tamoxifen in next week or two though--so there is that, but seems like not such a big deal now after everything else.

Was your tumor/margins close to the skin? I guess I would continue to watch your skin and report effects as well as the numbness to your provider. Also I am taking ibuprofen and antihistamines daily for pain and anti inflammatory effects.

I will have 21 total 16 plus 5 boosts--its the hypo fractionated (so higher dose but shorter duration, less days). Also its IMRT, supposed to conform better to body shape, even though I have larger breasts, i had a lift with lumpectomy so I don't have to do it prone. My breast already feels irritated, it felt tighter and more painful and my right arm hurt to move more. They assured me today that it was from lying in that position with arm stretched overhead yesterday for longer period when they were setting up the machine--that I basically overstretched it and that it can't be the rads, makes sense. Now after today's tx it feels heavier and slightly swollen, also didn't wear a bra today for first time in a while, so maybe that irritated it too. I had pretty extensive oncoplastic sx at end of august and it was just starting to recover. Its been pretty sensitive to increase in activity wearing/not wearing bras etc. and will get sore and swell with fluid at times. PS said takes many months to fully recover. So IDK, scary if its already rads effects after 2 days! Skin doesn't seem affected though. Ok this kind of came out like a long vent, sorry. I just really didn't want to do rads after I read more about it, but was recommended to me by 4 docs, and no other good options. Did anyone else who started feel anything after the first tx? Wishing everyone well, glad to be here on this thread",

You are strong for going through it that way, I think I really need these says off to recover or I might be tempted to quit if the SE's get too bad. I already went through a lot with the chemo and have chronic pain issues now (from the taxanes I got) that are only improving very slowly. I don't think I can handle another major negative impact on my body--not sure how I can even go back to work in Jan and do a 12 hr shift at this point(I'm an RN). CarolAnnie Hi, my last day of tx is 11/29, same as yours! Mine is accelerated (hypo fractionated), so 21 total. already have experienced the aching around incisions this first week. Did the aching lesson now over time? are you doing any special stretches or exercises to minimize fluid retention? It's nice to hear you are finding it not so bad.",

MWlimelite- I'm so glad to hear your skin is holding up so well and you heard good things about the my girls cream. Do you wash your skin before tx to make sure there is no cream left on it---or how many hours after you use it do you typically go for treatment? From my understanding having anything on the skin during tx can worsen skin effects. Sidalee and Spoonie-- thanks for your support, I know this will probably be more difficult for me emotionally/mentally than chemo (I wanted the neoadj chemo ASAP to keep it from spreading and I didn't know my lymph node status then). Sort of felt rads was only to prevent recurrence. I was so dead set on not doing it for fear of possible long term side effects that I considered a mastectomy after my oncoplastic sx. However all 4 of my doctors were against it in my situation and thought going forward with rads was best option. So, here I am now, starting tomorrow, the thing that i did not want to expose my body to after all the aggressive chemo. Fortunately I really like my RO and feel very good about his plan and the fact its through NCI designated center. Its scary though, the thought of lying under that machine and hoping all the calculations and settings are as they should be, hoping my body responds well... thankful I can come here to everyone who understands",

I'm sorry to hear sounds like some of you are having a really rough time with it. I don't know yet how I will handle even more pain (still recovering from sx and what the taxane drugs did to my body) and just general crappy stuff in my life from this seemingly never ending tx! You are all strong to be getting through it! I have been very afraid of rads/possible SE's and tried to find a way to not have to do it to no avail. I'm doing hypo fractionated IMRT so I have the higher dose per day but only 15 days with possibly some boosts after, I didn't get the results yet from the CT planning. I'm going to start using the \"my girls\" cream as soon as it arrives. Supposedly has helped people greatly even if they started using it after being burned when other products did not. It contains calendula, vitamins B and E among other plant based oils (I was told vitamin E was ok on skin and in foods just not supplements). Are any of you already using this product or doing hypo fractionated rads? At least it will be over faster, nervous but still trying to be hopeful at this point. wishing you all a nice break from your tx this weekend",

I wish they would use mepitel where I'm at, its really supposed to prevent the moist desquamation well. Also wish I was less hungry at times, trying not to react to my cravings for sweets. I know its difficult once the appetite is gone but to try to eat enough protein and vitamin rich foods as I'm sure you're probably aware it can help protect healthy tissue from rads. I've always been pretty healthy eater-- I made it my mission during chemo not to eat empty calorie foods except on occasion and of course sometimes I could only tolerate certain foods. So I'm going to make eating healthy sort of my job during rads and after. They said no supplements but as long as I eat a balanced diet vitamin e and c rich foods along with other antioxidants would be ok. I wonder if the tx is affecting your appetite? I feel like its also hard to make yourself drink a lot of water when the appetite is poor. Hydration was a challenge for me during chemo, will see how this goes... wishing you wellness",
