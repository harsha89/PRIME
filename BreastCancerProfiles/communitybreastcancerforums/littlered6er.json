    "Content": "littlered6er wrote: hi I am a 34 yr old mom of two(6and 3yr old) I have had been breastfeeding my first since birth till 3yrs off and on and my youngest since birth till now (mostly naps) Well about two weeks ago I noticed in my right breast I would feel let downs which were painful and he has avoided nursing off this side for roughly few months. Now I am feeling a strange pinch or shock in this breast numerous times a day there is a very tender spot bottom part of breast also my areolea has dark spots looks like scabs. I am thinking it is my ducts inflamed from lack of nursing on that side, but am unsure and my gut is saying something is wrong. I do not know family history my mother passed at 38 along with my father at 42 from AIDS. My mothers side and fathers side I do not know I am sort of like a orphan not knowing my family past and guessing what my medical future holds. Should I ask for a mammogram or ultrasound or something? I do not want to be dismissed because I am breastfeeding. Also now I am thinking about it I do get random lymph nodes in my armpit that hurt and itch they pop up for a few days then go away. Also right before I have this red rash that started on my chest and was down my right breast that itched. I am sorry for the long post and all overness of my writing. Thank you for helping and reading . I am going to make a apt on Monday, but want to go in with a little bit of advise and not feel so lost and alone. Log in to post a reply",
