      "Content": "rodalb wrote: Hello, I had surgery 9 days ago to remove all the ducts in my right breast due to a discharge. The surgery went well, the scar is minimal and I had no pain at all. I don't have sensation yet, but I think that will come back. Now I'm dealing with the results. Everything was benign (whew) but they did find several conditions which put me at high risk (30%). They found an intraductal papilloma, typical hyperplasia, fibrocystic changes, apocrine metaplasia, a fibroadenomatous lesion and focal microcalcification. I'm glad they took all the ducts out because there was a wider area to test. I have to go for an MRI in June and then yearly, along with mamos and sonos. I was just settling into that news, then today I had a follow-up with my hemotologist (I have a blood disease) who is also and oncologist, and he wants me to start taking Tamoxifen as a preventative measure! I really don't want to take it. I'm not in menopause yet and don't want to increase my risk of uterine cancer or start losing bone. Anyone using Tamoxifen as a preventative measure? It's been hard adjusting to it all, when just a few months ago I didn't have to worry about any of this. I guess I should count my blessings though. Log in to post a reply",

When I finally saw a breast doctor they recommended removing all my ducts. I had that done 2 weeks ago. They found an intraductal papilloma, typical hyperpasia, a fibroadenaoma and some other things. All of these are benign right now, but up my cancer risk to 30%. My doctors are taking this very seriously and have told me I need annual MRIs with contrast plus recommend I take Tamoxifen to prevent cancer. Seems like they should be doing something about pain and discharge in your case. Btw, all my tests--mamo, sono and culture of the discharge--were normal.",

I'm 48 and don't want to hasten menopause, but I also don't want to get cancer! I'm also worried because I have endometriosis and don't know if that will make me more prone to developing endometrial cancer on Tamoxifen. Lastly, I had two serious bouts of clinical depression when I was in my 20s and certainly don't want to go there again! Anyone experience depression on Tamoxifen? As for my diagnosis, the hyperplasia was \"without atypia\" but I guess that can eventually turn to atypia. My surgeon said that just having nipple discharge made me 20% higher risk and now with these diagnoses I'm at 30% -- but I know its not an exact science. The fact that I now qualify for insurance coverage for an MRI though is a little scary! I might wait to see if anything odd comes up in my MRI in June and then make the decision about Tamoxifen. I'm also not thrilled about having to get annual MRI with IV contrast -- mainly because I have very small veins and they always have trouble putting IVs in. A silly reason, I know, but it really causes me a lot of anxiety and dread. I guess I'll get used to it eventually. Again, better than dealing with cancer!  Carla",
