I didn't have a recliner, and I honestly didn't have too hard a time getting out of bed. I had a much harder time getting back into bed. I didn't have silk pjs but I can see how they would have been helpful. I found sleeping on the couch to be more comfortable than the bed at first because it was easier to prop up. If you have TEs, keep a sweater with you when out running errands. I live in TX (it was 106 today) but when I go to stores, especially the grocery store, I get cold and the pecs contract and the TEs fight back. Very uncomfortable! Also, once I started getting feeling back, all clothes, bras to be irritating. Once I got rid of the drains, I stopped wearing bras or camis. Target has some really soft comfortable t-shirts on sale right now. They are very light and thin so I bought some colorful summer scarves (also on sale at Target and Old Navy right now). I wrap them around to cover my chest. The people who know about the surgery will know why and the people who don't will just think I'm in a fashion rut! Soma pajamas are about the best thing In the world as far as their softness. My sister gave me some in the hospital and I bought another set because I love them so much. Good luck to all! (and thank for letting me sneak in here once in awhile.)",

So glad I did. The TEs suck. I'm not going to lie. They are weird. I call mine spongebob squareboobs. I was filled with 100ccs during surgery and I go for my next fill on Monday. At first, sleeping on my back wasn't a problem because of the pain meds, but even with the drains out, I still can't sleep on my side because of my pointy TEs. The worst part for me was the pain from the \"pocket\" they built to hold the TEs. It still feels bruised. Even with that, I've still been able to function to some extent. I'm 3 1/2 weeks out and feeling better. I'm driving now. I haven't worked out yet, mostly because I'm lazy. I'll let you know how the fills go. It's not all bad though. Even they they are weird looking, with just the 100 Ccs, I can tell I'm going to have some cute perky boobs. I was always really small, not even a full A and I'm probably already close to that now. I even have cleavage (which I never had before without a pushup bra)",

The best I could do was grab and extra pillow, turn it long ways and lean against it starting at the lowest part of my back. I also have a triangle pillow that I place under my knees and that seems to help with the pressure on my back. Last night was the worst so far. I wanted so badly to shift to my side to sleep. Since I have TEs I doubt I will be able to for quite some time. I did tilt slightly to one side, but I still miss sleeping on my side.",

I was just uncomfortable from laying on the table. However, with the excisional they inserted 2 wires and both hurt like mad. (even though I was \"numbed\"). I'm usually not too much of a baby when it comes to pain but the nurse thought I was going to dislocate my thumb because I was clenching my fist so hard. I suspect that the pain was mostly from going through the previous biopsy site. Also the 2nd wire went under the nipple so I'm sure that didn't help. Good idea to make it known going forward to use an alternative anesthesia in the event you have to go through it again. Since I'm having a BMX next month, I guess I wont have to worry about it anymore. Best of luck to both of you.",
