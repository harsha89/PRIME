Enjoy the rest of your weekend ladies... Fammy  ",

Finally bought my first wig and it looks pretty cute   My husband and kids loved it.  Once the hair starts falling out, i'll buzz it.  Welcome to all the newbies on the list! Hopefully we'll all get through this together.  We'll have our bad and good days, but it'll all pass! bourscheid, I love the new pic! How's school and the kids??

I hope everyone is doing well today.. bluedasher:  I'm so sorry to hear about your port episode.  One positive way to look at it is that it's over now, and you can rest at home.  The worst part of all of this is the anticipation and waiting for everything to be over with.  jill... it's crazy how each and every oncologist has a different perspective.  my tumor was about 1.5cm, and one positive lymph node.. so the first oncologist i went to said only four rounds of A/C, then tamoxifen for five years.  The oncologist i'm with now (i felt more comfortable with him and i loved the facility.. very clean and organized)... he said that I should do four rounds of A/C, then four rounds of Taxol, and every six months go in for one shot of something to stop my periods.  Thank God i have three kids, so i'm not upset about not getting my periods any longer.  I am Her2 negative, so I guess that's why the Herceptin isn't needed.  I'm just happy that i'm halfway done with A/C.  Today is day 2, and i'm feeling ok... a little nauseated, and weak, but other then that, i'm ok.. the Emend really made a world of a difference.  I can't believe how bad it was my first time around.

I was supposed to go in yesterday, but the oncologist told me that my body can't handle A/C every two weeks, so he moved me to every three weeks.  So my next tx is on the 13th of this month (next thursday).  Kinda stinks but I'd rather have a week of feeling \"normal\" than not having any days at all.  He also said that he doesn't think the neulasta shot is working for me cuz I collapsed days 7 and 8 both times... this last time I got a bad gum infection with several mouth sores ... it's been real rough.  He put me on more antibiotics and two mouthwashes.. they helped thank God.. The antibiotics were real strong and I wasn't eating anything because of my mouth sores.. so the vomiting was pretty bad early this week.  To be honest, i'm a little disappointed in myself for not being stronger, but it's not in my hands.  I was hoping i'd get this over with sooner, but I guess this is better for my system.  Next time I go in, I have to tell my onc that i'm not willing to go through what i've been through and it's his responsibility to help me get through this a bit easier than what i've been going through... am I asking for too much?? I'm finally eating.  I've been living on liquids the past week.  I still have a sore on my tongue (??).  It hurts, but it's healing thank God.  i'm going to make the best out of this coming week before my next round on thursday.  thanks for listening, Fammy",

I've been extremely busy the past few weeks.. my kids were off from school all of last week so it was a mad house here .. at least I was feeling well enough to spend all my time with them and take them out! My last A/C is tomorrow!! I don't know whether to be happy about it or dread all the side effects.  Three weeks after that is Taxol! Even though I don't post a lot, i'm constantly reading all the msgs on here and thinking about you ladies all the time!  Hopefully all this will be over soon! Please don't forget me in your prayers tomorrow and as soon as i'm able to, i'll be here again :) Good luck to all of you having treatments any time soon!",

Have a great day everyone.  I need a nap :) unique... as soon as I find out when my next round is, i'll let you know.  I think it'll be on December 10, but not sure!",

My whole family came over for thanksgiving and it was one of the best thanksgivings i've ever had.  I really wanted to feel well this thanksgiving and enjoy time with my family and thank God my prayers were answered.  Even though I crashed on wednesday and wasn't feeling well at all, I felt completely \"myself\" yesterday and enjoyed every minute of it.  I hope everyone's thanksgiving was a good one.  We all have a lot to be grateful for! hugs to all, fammy",

It took me a while to catch up to all your posts... but i've read each and every one of them.  Welcome aboard to all the new heroes.  Yes, we are heroes.  Not anyone can go through what we're going through.  God is testing our patience, and we will pass.   I had my second round of AC on the 23rd.  Took Emend this time around, and it does in fact do miracles.  I was fine the first two days with no SE's.  Then it hit me saturday and sunday.  Very weak, and sleeping all day.  Went to work on Mon., Tues., Wed., and Thurs.  Thursday I started collapsing.  I almost fainted in school, and I had a horrible toothache (what I thought).  Went to the dentist and said that I have an infection and need to pull out my wisdom tooth! (do i really need this now?) .. Of course have to get the approval of the oncologist.  Went straight to his office and he said \"you're not touching that tooth\" ... my WBC count was extremely low.  He didn't even think it was my tooth.  He said it's a bad gum infection.  Of course at that point,  I couldn't eat, drink, sleep, or talk.  He put me on another set of antibiotics, several mouthwashes, and of course pain killers and told me that there's no way I can handle another AC this coming thursday.  He's moving me to once every three weeks.  I'm glad I only have two more AC to deal with.  So my next one is on November 13th.  Unique- you've done a fabulous job with our schedule.  Keep it up, we all definitely appreciate your time and effort! I finally buzzed my hair (felt so free afterwards).  Been wearing cute hats and wigs my sisters have bought me.  Can't wait till this is all over! Thanks for listening ladies.. you're a great support!  Good luck to everyone going in this week.  I pray that you have an easy week with no SE's... Fammy",

I was supposed to get my 3rd tx on thursday! When my oncol. saw me, he said that my gum infection didn't heal 100% and wanted me to take another week off !  I don't know if that's good or bad anymore.  It's been more than 3 weeks since my 2nd tx, and i'm starting to panic.  My oncol. said that it won't affect anything, it'll just give me more time to feel better.  So HOPEFULLY i'll go in on wednesday and get my 3rd tx over with!  He also suggests that instead of taking dose dense taxol every other week four times, he wants to lessen the dosage and give me taxol every week for 12 weeks.  He's concerned that I won't react well since I haven't reacted well with the A/C.  I don't know what to do.  Any suggestions?  Everyone in previous groups have said that taxol is much easier to tolerate than A/C.  I want to get this all over with, yet at the same time, if it's going to be easier to deal with the side effects with a lower dosage, then i'll do it.  I want to go back to work and return to my \"normal\" life again asap.  Thanks for listening. Good luck to all having chemo this week.",

I intentionally came to this group because I see that you fine ladies started a while ago.. and i'm hearing that the first chemo is the easiest, the second is harder, the third gets harder and the fourth is the hardest...  is this a common issue? and what do people mean by harder?? the nausea?? the fatigue?? what exactly?? and how bad is this neulasta shot?? the september group is great... but they just started ... i'm wondering how you ladies are holding up after starting back in may...   i'm 32 and a mother of 3.. have a full time job and am praying to God that I can still be able to work while taking the chemo... any feedback would be greatly appreciated.. and once again, i apologize for intruding.. thanks...",
