So sorry about your migraine...that sucks. I love Excedrin tension headache. I can't tolerate aspirin well, and that one is aspirin free. It gets rid of the worst pain.  I've had a little post nasal drip since chemo. My sense of smell is so heightened right now as well. Lots of food smells make me queasy.  Hang in there!! Marietta ",

I have my next tx in one week and just can't even think about it. I went to a support group meeting at the breast cancer resource center we have here in Santa Barbara, CA. The other women there reasurred me that the 2nd time will go much better...so I am hanging on to that. I'm originally from Maryland and my dad used to hunt, it was interesting reading your posts about hunting, reminded me of when I was a little girl. Take care! Marietta ",

I feel so bad when I hear how badly people are getting burned as I have done really well so far. Since having a 3 day weekend and now doing the boost (which is a much smaller area) my rash is starting to dry up and clear up...still itchy though. Yesterday I asked my rad tech if I could start using regular deoderant on the left side now since the radiation doesn't hit my pit anymore and she said \"yes, please...\" we both cracked up laughing. I just love my techs, they are really fun and sweet. Mary JO I love your pics. I wish I could figure out to upload some of mine. Pax mentioned a way to do it a while back, but I really am not that techie, soooo...it never happened. Hang in there, Pax! You'll be done with this soon. I know you must be frustrated. I start my new job today...a little nervous!! Check in with you all later. Marietta ",

I will start radiation on the 14th as long as my labs look good at my doctors appt on January 10th. I have my radiation mapping appt this Monday which includes a ct scan. You really sound like you are in good spirits despite the lopsided boob and big decisions ahead of you, good luck. What kind of cookies did you make? :) Mary Jo I can relate to not wanting to go back to the cancer center...I would love to blow off the last treatment...my husband is sick of hearing me say I don't need to go for the last one...OMG I had the worst UTI this week. I never get them, and I have been drinking cranberry juice all through chemo and we ran out and I stopped drinking it for one week and well...it was really bad. I got on antibiotics right away and it was gone the next morning, but I sure was in pain. Also, as for the night sweats...I found a homeopathic remedy that does not have any soy or promote estrogen and seems to work. It's called lachesis mutus. It's actually made from a snake. If you got bit by a snake you would have a hot flash. By taking this remedy it blocks hot flashes. I took it before bed the other night and did not wake up. My best night in a long time. I forgot last night...woke with a sweaty head at 2:30am... it's worth a try. I haven't really come up with a celebration idea yet...but I think we will probably celebrate at our friends New Years party that we go to every year. I like the scarf burning idea... Only 3 more days till my mom and dad get here, yay!! Have a great night all. Marietta ",

I'm guessing, worst case scenario would be Herceptin for a year...which is extremely tolerable as far as tx goes.  When do you see your onc again? I'm sending good vibes your way... Mary Jo, I gave up on the a-d's...my onc's nurse suggested talking to my primary care physician, which is actually good advice, he probably has more experience in that area. But I started thinking about it and I don't want to put anymore drugs into my system. I have been taking 1/2 an ativan at bedtime and that is really helping me sleep. So maybe after radiation is over I will take St. John's wort or some other natural happy pill... My friend with lung cancer is in the hospital again. Her lung keeps collapsing, it is so scary. We are actually entertaining tonight. It feels good to plan a nice dinner for friends. Have a good one everybody.  ",

That dehyradtion is killer! The biggest change we are going to make is adding Emend prior to treatment. Honestly, I can't rememember everything else my Onc said, he showed up before my husband got there, so my second set of ears was not there. Onc said they dose the tx based on age (I'm 43, considered young) and liver function, blah blah blah.  Prevously I had the ativan and compizene to begin with, then they added zofran after the first night when I sick every 30 minutes. I had decadron at the begining as well.  I've really learned that I can handle just about anything, except nausea. it is really debilitating.  Being so constipated seems to add to the nausea, so now I have to take senokot every night, that should hopefully make a difference.  Yesterday was a really good day. I ate and enjoyed my food. I am so thankful for that. I really thought I would never feel normal again. Thanks to Karyll for good wishes as well. I do not know what a Muga scan is, let us know what it is and how it goes. Please don't let our posts scare you about chemo either. Everyone is different.

Will the weight start to actually come off a month after? Two months? Will I start to look like a bodybuilder? :) just kidding.... I've just been wearing a basball cap to the gym now. I've caught a few people staring, and occaisionally I will get the sad smile from someone who just knows...It doesn't even bother me anymore.  I met with the radiation oncologist yesterday and he was just the sweetest loveliest man. I'm having a scan in a few weeks and I think he said that is when they tatoo my breast. I will start rads in January. 33 treatments. I have my 5th chemo tomorrow and have the usual anxiety/sadness that I feel before...I'm tryng to stay positive, I only have one more tx after tomorrow...that is keeping me going right now...almost done. Some days I just miss my hair. Very interesting pictures Paxton, what are the things above your head in the first pic?  Are they some sort of yin and yang? The 2nd pic really looks like your bf (good that you posted his pic before:)) Really nice work, did you go to art school? Better go get my little guy ready for school. Hang in there ladies.

Do you guys know about a program for breast cancer survivors called \"Casting for Recovery\"? My chemo angel is involved in it. They have fly fishing 2 1/2 day retreats for us survivors and it's free. They have them in different parts of the country.  I think it would be interesting to try fly fishing. If anyone would like to check it out the website is www.castingforrecovery.org.  Have a great day all, Marietta ",

Toward the end I noticed a little growth again. I just started using a system called Nutri-ox, I got it at Sally's. I think it's a knock-off of Nioxin. It's for thinning hair. We'll see what happens. I think the chemo will not be out of my system for another week or so. Next week I go for blood work, consult with onc and my first solo herceptin. My onc will look at labs and officially clear me for rads as long as wbc is high enough.  One of the other moms from my son's school and I have been planning a \"Mother/Son\" event for next Saturday. It's a flag football and tailgate extravaganza. I'm so excited. We're doing it at the local high school and the marching band has agreed to come and play. There will be games and food. I think it's going to be really fun and has been a great distraction.  Should we start a birthday pool for when MaryJo's grandbaby is going to be born? Any guesses? Do we know if it is a boy or girl? Have a good one! Marietta ",

Quite a few women are reporting that on the rads thread... Trigeek I'm sorry you haven't resolved your dilemma, go with your gut and you can't make a wrong decision. Better safe than sorry sounds like a good plan. Pax you're not alone in the crying department. Lots of water works here. I'm not sure why I'm so emotional...I'm happy to be in the next phase of tx, but I left my first session and started to cry. Then I picked up my wig from being reconditioned (apparently you're supposed to do that once in a while and I haven't been doing that) and they really screwed up my bangs. I tried and tried to redo them...seriously, they made my wig look like an old lady helmut wig.  I just took it and left and didn't say anything and my husband made me take it back and they are fixing it.... Ok, having a serious hot flash right now!! Anyway, sorry to go on about my wig, but it totally wigged me out, hee hee! Mary JO, that was a funny story about your hubby...wish we could all get together and party and laugh and roll on the floor! Have a great night, Marietta ",

I have itching due to the rash, the rest is really ok, very pink though...I'm on a prescription cream for the rash and use aquaphor for the rest. Over all very greasy and messy. I don't bother with bras, I use camisoles with shelf bra built in. They are much softer. My herceptin is every 3 weeks, fitting in ok with my schedule, but it seems like I have to move it every time, something better always is happening and I am not going to miss out like I did during chemo. We're actually not opening a store (well, not at first, maybe eventually) but we want to be the US distributor for a line of kids shoes out of Spain. We will likely have a website once it gets going and of course I will let you know what that is, because little Mr. Mason will need these cute shoes!!  You should totally take you dad for luck on your first day of rads, then take him out for pancakes or something!! Did I tell you I took my son, Chris, to radiation with me one day last week? The techs were so nice and showed him the equipment and how it works...he thought the sound reminded him of star wars, so that of course was very cool. The nurses gave him so much attention, and a soda, so he was in hog heaven.  It was a great experience for him and I am glad I took him with me. Chris is off this whole week for winter break, so I've got to keep him busy. Plus his birthday is Monday, so on Sunday we will take him and 12 other boys to the movies, heavan help me!! Have a great day all! Marietta  p.s.Mj I love the blonde wig!! Tri, loved the family photo, your family looks awesome! ",

I hope you are taking things easy today and healing quickly! MaryJo, I have a second interview today. But I'm pretty sure I've got the job. My friend is on the board of the ice rink assocation here (we don't actually have an ice rink, they are trying to raise money to build one) and she recommended me for one of two paid positions, Campaign administrator. I met with the campaign coordinator and that went really well. I'm meeting one of the other board members today...but it's just a formality. I have 12 years experience in the non-profit sector and am good at raising money so it's a great fit. I would be working 20 hours a week and can do most of it from home. So I'm very excited about that, especially since I don't want have to put Chris in daycare and camps all summer when school is out. They are really supportive of my BC situation too, so that helps. I will say a prayer for your co-worker, that is so sad! Pax I sure hope your car is getting fixed right now!!",

If it goes like my last tx I will be happy with that. The steriods have me so bulky right now. I'm not used to my face being so puffy. I've been reading this really good book, The Glass Castle, and have misplaced it! Chemo brain!!! so I'm bummed because I was going to take it with me today. Anybody reading any good books? I can recommend some, I love to read. Urbie I hope you find a way to shave your head today, I remember when I realized it was time. I just wanted it off, I couldn't even shampoo it because it was coming out so fast and my scalp hurt so much. Once you do get it buzzed you may want to find someone to take shaving cream and a bic razor to it... It is strange, my hair is already starting to grow back, it is baby fine and white! I asked my onc nurse about it yesterday when I went in for my blood draw and she said that is not unusual and it may stop for a while after this tx or even fall out again.

Also, you mentioned self tanner. My friend gave me a bronzer by bobbi brown and I mix some into my sunscreen and it gives me a little color, but not too much. It's kinda pricey but a little goes a long way and gives you enough color for a healthy glow. I don't think it would look like shoe polish on your head :) I woke up at 4am...It is so strange, I have woken up at 4am before every tx. I was laying there thinking maybe it's due to the decadron.  Paxton, sorry you're feeling so snappy...I have my days too, I just have to be so careful around my son, he can be sensitive, he keeps me in check.  I love how Karyll tells it like it is ...you go girl!  I feel so bad when I hear about you all and your cold weather. It actually is only 40 degrees here right now, but we will probably get into the 60's or low 70's for a few hours during the day. It's been an unusually warm fall here.

Oh newbie, the big tummy sucks...I have been buying sweaters in the men's dept lately, which is good for me anyway because I am very tall and I like my shirts and sweaters to cover part of my butt. A woman at my sons school asked me if I lost weight recently, I'm all no I'm just buying bigger longer sweaters! :) Mary Jo I have not had any of those scans or echo's. Not sure why but my insurance sucks and sometimes I feel like maybe I'm getting a little less care because of it. I could be wrong...but maybe there are other determining factors. I will ask my onc next time. The Rads onc said I will have 33 tx which works out to about 6.5 weeks. I have a ct scan for rads planning on the 17th of Dec.  I feel badly because I wanted to take my son skiing during the winter break his school takes in February...it's the week before he turns 8 and I will not be done with rads and I don't think they will give me a pass... I had to go through all my medical bills this morning, so depressing. My insurance company is not covering things correctly and it is really scary every time I open a bill. I so regret ever going off my HMO, It was expensive and we were always so healthy....ah well, hindsight is 20/20. I hope everyone is having a great day, Marietta ",

I hate chemo. Tri- I too have eaten everything that has not moved, especially yesterday. The hunger sensation I have is overwhelming and I feel like if I don't eat I'm going to pass out.  Today is better, I was able to drive Chris to school. Maryjo-yesterday I felt like that lady you were describing at chemo...I was telling my husband that I am not doing round 6, now way, now how. I wanted to call my doctor and ask if I could skip it.  All my hubby can do is shake his head and say \"yeah right honey.\".. I really have been a basket case this time around...I'm guessing it is the cumulative effects combined with my period finally stopping chemopause kicking in...I'm pretty much insane PMS woman right now!!! yikes!!

It was such a long day. My shoulder was still bothering me from the port so my surgeon wanted me to have an MRI, so that put my chemo off by a few hours and I was wreck. Oddly enough, once the meds went through the port it felt so much better and I have very little pin in my shoulder now. So thats good. Thursday night was really rough for me, I will spare the details. The anti-nauseua meds had to be changed and things are better now. I survived my first chemo. I will be thinking of you on Monday and sending you postive thoughts. I took all of this great stuff to keep me occupied at chemo but was so tired (from not sleeping the night before) that I just wanted to close my eyes and relax. Let me know how things go. You can always send a private message as well, ok? Good luck!! Marietta  Marietta ",

Don't know why, but my guess is that since I have to continue to go back every 3 weeks for herceptin it's really not over for me. I start rads on Monday and my girlfriend who just had lung cancer surgery will be across the street starting her chemo. She has four tx's. I told my hubby about the danskin tri...it's a possibilty! Is it an ocean swim or lake? Do you wear a wetsuit? Here in Santa Barbara the water is so freaking cold, even in the summer, I have to wear a full body wet suit. I think it actually helps me during the tri's though because I am not greatest swimmer :) My hubby bought me one of those rebounder mini trampolines. It's really great. If you look up rebounding on the internet there are so many benefits beside cardio that you can get from using it. One example is that it helps drain your lymphatic system...kind of neat. Well my little guy was home from school today with a low fever. He never ever gets sick, so I feel bad because I thought for sure he was trying to call in slick...a few hours later, a fever...ah well. Tomorrow is the big Mother/son flag football event that I have been helping organize for 6 months and just hope he can go. He seems much better now so there is hope.  Have a great night everyone!

I went on there one night and ended up feeling a little freaked out. I avoid that topic even on this website. I hope you're feeling better soon. When do you finish taxol? The only real side effect that I am having from solo herceptin is a runny nose and a little body ache. At my support group I asked if anyone else experienced the runny nose and everyone gave me an emphatic \"oh Yeah!!\"...so I'm not alone or crazy...:) I have my 7th rad tx today, so far feeling great! The water weight is coming off finally...still have chpmunk cheeks though...lol  Have a good day all! Marietta p.s.

MJ I've had two solo herceptins so far. Doing great with that. So glad it only takes 1/2 an hour or so. I'm glad you get some shopping trips out of it, I love to shop, even when I can't buy anything. The good wine and choclates you mentioned sound great!! Tri the entertaining went great, except....I was checking on dinner and stuck my head too far into the oven and well...that sizzling sound was my wig! That's right, I singed it really badly...like abused barbie doll hair bad! That's ok, so it was my fave...it was starting to look a little ratty anyway, so when I went the wig store and they gave me 25% off a new one, so it's all good. Have a great night all! Marietta ",

I hope you are feeling well enough to check in with us soon.  Pax you sound so frustrated. I hope your car situation is resolved soon and that you don't get totally dumped on by the snow.

I had my first boost today and I got the achey boob feeling I got when I first started rads...so that was weird. They showed me how deep the electrons go and how my heart is protected, so that is pretty cool. Tri, sorry things didn't go as expected in your surgery, that sucks. What is your next step besides your breast being radiated? -35 degrees? No way, I could not handle that. I don't know how you do it Pax.  Brrr that makes me want to take a hot bath...

I don't remember if she said to lube up ahead of time, but she runs my support group and we have a meeting this morning so I will ask. Baking powder? oh my, that wouldn't do jack for me! One of my closest girlfriends went through all of this 5 years ago and she said she could not wear a bra 1/2 way through rads. She bought tank tops with a shelf bra and it was much softer on her skin. Paxton I had gone back and re-read your post and was like, duh of course she doesn't know when she starts, she hasn't had her consult yet...chemo brain at it's finest! good luck Monday, can't wait to hear what kind of deodorant/soap you can use, whether or not you can shave, what cream to use for burns...etc...Will be interesting to see how your information compares with all of ours!

I take fish oil as well and don't want to give that one up. My brain needs all the help it can get. Chemo brain is so bad at times, I just can't find simple words. Sometimes I feel like I'm on Password or the $25,000 pyramid (small hairy thing that barks....)...It's interesting. Thanks again for the info.",

The older people we are training with are just adorable, and it is fun to talk to them and encourage them. One man in our group is probably in his 70's and I assume had throat cancer. He has one of those voice microphones that you hold up to your throat to speak. He is pretty frail, but very handsome and always smiling. I am so inspired by him... Trish you should have a trainer show you a workout routine with the weights. You would be surprised how easy it is. We aren't using free weights, we use the machines.   Donna (gardengirl) I loved your comment about \"drop the cookie and get on the treadmill\"...cracked me up. Have a great day all! Marietta ",

Paxton maybe you're holding on to water. My friend in my support group and weight training group was having the same problem and I told her about the HCTZ pills my onc prescribed for me...her onc prescribed them for her and she saw the scale move almost right away. She couldn't get her wedding rings on before and now she can. She was very excited... Barbie I hope everything turns out great, try not to worry.

Also, we live in a small town, and I was very open about it. My hope is that everyone that finds out goes and gets a mammogram. But I think if I interviewed for a job under different circumstances I would not say anything, especially at an opening interview. Maybe if I was being offered the job I would bring it up, but only because I still have herceptin until September and need time to go and do that. I agree with Shrink, employers have no right to ask. Just as much as they shouldn't ask if you have diabetes or high blood pressure or toe nail fungus ....I would play it by ear in any situation, that's just me.
