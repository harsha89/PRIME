Had sore mouth once but that was due to me trying to eat spicy food, not very smart, but biotene cleared it up quickly. Tomorrow is my last chemo treatment which is the F booster, thank you Lord. Now, when will I be rid of black nails both hands and feet, motley looking hand and feet, I want hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes, most of all I just want to feel better and not be so tired all the time. I start radiation next month, not really complaining but I really do think I see a light at the end of this tunnel, and it is not a train :). I love life...",

She said \"oh you poor thing, that is too bad, I am sorry this happen to you\" , not one word of encouragement. But I have to say that most of the people that I have decided to tell are very encouraging, most say \"you can beat this, I am praying for you\" that is really uplifting. Some people just don't known what to said or how to react. Thank you ladies for all the information and encouragement. My first Taxon treatment is Monday at 5:30 pm. I need to shop for my chemotherapy bag, a list I found on this site. A social worker at MDA told me that most people work through Taxol, I'm retired and did work part-time, currently on leave, we will see what all this brings.",

Could not eat or drink anything before fasting blood specimen at 12:45 today at the hospital. Took fruit, nuts, and oat bar and juice to eat after blood is taken. Had bone density test no pain at all 1:30pm, one of the easiest test. Visited with my MO 4pm, discussed the port. I really have only one good vein and they have had to stick me twice each time to put the IV in, he said that was not good so we are talking about the port sooner than later. Came home sneezing and with a runny nose, around 4:30 pm after sitting in a cold waiting room, and oh so tired again, all my energy is GONE, used up in the waiting room of the hospital. I am hoping for energy in the morning, I want to go grocery shopping, so my DH will not have to, even though he doesn't mind at all, but I like to grocery shop sometimes, it's been almost 2 months since I got to grocery shop all on my own. I am ready for bed can hardly keep my eyes open, don't want to go to bed too early, because I will probably wake up in the wee wee hours of the morning and can't go back to sleep. Have a good night every one.",
