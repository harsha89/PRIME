    "Content": "SanFranKitty wrote: I recently was diagnosed with dcis in situ. I had a double mastectomy and expanders put in on April 26th. I feel like a cry baby and am having a a pretty tough time. The first 6 days was very difficult because of the drains, pain was terrible. I got the drains out yesterday and was able to shower this morning which was pretty awesome. But generally I am just super uncomfortable and weak. I'm not very hungry and I find myself crying very easily. I feel very alone. My mother who lives in the area comes to see me briefly during the day. I'm married with a kid and I see my husband and darling daughter in the evenings. I miss being able to do things with my daughter so much right now. Most days I just lay here with my cats wanting to feel pain free again. I'm still taking pain pills at night, wish I wasn't. Will I ever feel better!
