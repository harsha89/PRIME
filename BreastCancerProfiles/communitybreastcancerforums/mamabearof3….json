I go to the dermatologist on Friday and I will call my doc tomorrow to see what breast surgeon he recommends. I appreciate all the feedback ladies...thank you!!",

The rash continued to grow up/down and out toward my armpit...sometimes I feel like I am leaking clear fluid from my nipple and have actually seen it. I brought it to the attention of my ob/gyn and my gp and they both were like that is weird I have no idea. I've been on antihistamines, antibiotics, hydrocortisone cream, aquafor, Vaseline and other hypoallergenic creams to calm down the itching and nothing has worked. My mammogram came back normal and I am not sure if I let this go or pursue it harder. My mom and dads side of the family are both full of people with breast cancer. Any opinions? Anyone see this kinda rash? Thanks in advance for any advice you can give. Log in to post a reply",

I have always been mindful that I have a family history of breast and ovarian cancer and I have already had a hysterectomy due to abnormal cells and if fibroid tumors. I hope this is nothing but I never want to say never. Totallyblessed thank you for your thoughts and hugs I will keep you updated on my status",
