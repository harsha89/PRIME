I was initially scared but I didn't have insurance and convinced myself that I was ok. Well, this year I discovered a second lump this time axilla. I still didn't have insurance and tried to talk myself in to believing I was ok. I had to complete a physical for school and mentioned the lump to the NP that was performing the exam, He inquired why I waited so long and I confessed to him about not having insurance and how I convinced myself that I was ok. The NP was kind enough to refer me for a US free of charge. The US report came back BIRAD 4 and the lump on the breast was documented 10MM. My local hospital offers a health plan that I qualified for based on my income. I have since had a 3D mammogram and an bilateral ultrasound. Well no one bother to discussed the finding with me. I was just told I need to have a MRI done, when I asked why I was told the Dr wants to have a better view of the breast tissues. Today I pulled up my report and ultrasound states There is a 5 cm irregular mass with an irregular margin in the left breast central to the nipple anterior depth. This irregular mass is hypoechoic with posterior acoustic shadowing. This correlates as palpated and with mammography findings. There also is a 2 cm oval lymph node with a microlobulated margin in the left axillary tail. This oval lymph node is hypoechoic. This correlates as palpated and with mammography findings. No abnormalities were seen sonographically in the right breast. IMPRESSION: HIGHLY SUGGESTIVE OF MALIGNANCY BIRAD 5 - FOLLOW-UP RECOMMENDED The 5 cm irregular mass in the left breast central to the nipple anterior depth is highly suggestive of malignancy. An ultrasound guided biopsy is recommended. The 2 cm oval lymph node in the left axillary tail is highly suggestive of malignancy. An ultrasound guided biopsy is recommended. MRI is recommended prior to biopsy 3D Mammogram result: There are scattered fibroglandular elements in both breasts that could obscure a lesion on mammography. Current study was also evaluated with a Computer Aided Detection (CAD) system. There is a 5 cm irregular mass with a spiculated margin in the left breast central to the nipple anterior depth. This correlates as palpated and with ultrasound findings. There is nipple retraction associated with the mass. There also is a 2 cm oval lymph node in the left breast posterior depth superior region seen on the mediolateral oblique view only. This correlates as palpated and with ultrasound findings. No other dominant masses, regions of architectural distortion, or suspicious clusters of microcalcifications are seen. IMPRESSION: HIGHLY SUGGESTIVE OF MALIGNANCY BIRAD 5 The 5 cm irregular mass in the left breast central to the nipple anterior depth is highly suggestive of malignancy. An ultrasound guided biopsy is recommended. The 2 cm oval lymph node in the left breast posterior depth superior region seen on the mediolateral oblique view only is highly suggestive of malignancy. I know nothing is conclusive with out a biopsy confirmation, but I'm also realistic, it dosnt look good. I know breast cancer is not a death sentence but with everything else that I have had to deal with in my life I really don't think I can go threw this. I wanna lean on my faith and God but I find that hard to do right now. What terrifies me the most is going through this all by myself. Log in to post a reply",
