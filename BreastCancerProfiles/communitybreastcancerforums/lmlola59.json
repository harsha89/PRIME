So my hair has pretty much filled in but much more white then I care to admit and where it is not white came in black.This I found odd because I was born blond and I thought it was a mousy brown every time I covered my roots so I am a bit surprised.Have I read from you ladies that it will change as it grows (the black Of course)? I decided I need to give the white some color as it doesn't look as full where it is white so I sent away for some Lustrous Henna.I am trying this  because I haven't decided if I am ever going to use the chemicals on myself again.I feel that my hair has no product on it now and might be the best time to experiment with this process.Also only go topless around the house so if the color isn't quite right I can hide it till it gradually fades away.I am wondering if anyone has ever tried this product and if so your thoughts on it and tips on usage.  Thanks again to all you great ladies for making me laugh and inspiration to keep moving on ",

For all those that don't think its time to date I say go for it especially if you are already going topless they already know what you look like right?.As we all on this thread know life is to short and it ain't no dress rehearsal.You all deserve to go out and have fun and as  someone here put it this does separate the men from the boys and hope they are smart enough to realize it is only temporary.I have a harder time remembering that then the people around me.  Kjiberty I used the generic Lattisse for about a year before this all happened was on maintenance stage then ramped up again and started treating my brows during Chemo and they  both thinned but never lost enough to be noticed by others. In fact went to see the RO 3 weeks PFC and he commented on how good  my brows looked They are now filling back in but if I remember correctly for me it took about 3 months when I first started using it to see the full effects so not sure if your own will be full enough by then on there own or not. I also think that it depends on how they were before this all started.But the ones I did lose didn't start coming in for me till 10 weeks PFC so if I had lost them all I think I would have been devastated and I also think that since they are not all coming in at once I will hopefully not have to worry about them all being on the same cycle.We will see.",

I read some where when I was looking to buy my wig that it isn't a law in every state yet that insurance has to pay for at least a partial portion of hair prosthesis.But more and more states are jumping on board I was lucky enough that MA has joined and I got with my insurance I think 90% of cost up to $300. I also recommend going to a wig salon not only because it is really important to try it because once its on your head it is way bulkier than it looks on the head form.Also I had to have mine made smaller since I apparently have a really small head,and what you may see on line or in a catalog has been shaped and styled some (they don't mention this) and  depends on the model wearing it how long her neck is ETC and won't necessarily look the same.As an example I got one that looks like a bob on line coming only down to middle of the neck on the model on line and  in the shop  on me it is actually layered and comes down about 3 or 4 inches below the bottom of my neck.I never would have ordered it from what I saw on line but absolutely love it.I went with the heat resistant 30%/70% also so I can style and surprisingly the hair is really soft which I was surprised at as the synthetic to me are stiff and scratchy.I then brought it to my hair dresser to give me bangs and shape more.It also is mono and has a lace front so it is cooler. .I have to tell you I  have worn this with my husband 5 siblings,spouses,children etc that I haven't told and no one even looked at me funny or questioned me.So it has to look like my old hair.It did cost me $550 going through the salon and would have been cheaper on line but wouldn't have fit,I never would have been what I would have ordered and would never have been able to pick the correct color.They ordered 3 for me in different color combos and I was able with there help to  decide what was best for me.They also threw in the head stand and shampoo,conditioner and hair spray.But I would never have been able to deal without it not brave enough to go out topless though I am getting closer.  Tpolychron I did buy lashes but never needed them and to tell you the truth not sure if I could have dealt with putting them on.As Jillejo said if you use black liner and go close to the lash line and a bit thicker its really hard to tell if there are lashes or not. ",

I guess I am figuring that when it comes to this point I may just fess up since I am no longer in treatment and won't get the same pity that I would if I were going through treatment.Maybe I will get lucky and be one of the few that doesn't get the chemo curls.Also have never in my life had a short hair cut so this will be sure to raise a few eyebrows. ",

MizMarie I think that is a very ggod description \"ripples\",so sigh might get the curls yet.I will start looking into the Brazilian Tech just in case.Is this something that has to be ordered on line or did you find it in Sally or someplace else?

Have to address the Latisse question.I had been using the generic form ( no prescription mail order) Bimatoprost Ophthalmic Solution Careprost about 2 yrs before BC and was at the maintenance stage of 3 X a week  working down to 2X.Once diagnosed I started using it daily again and also on my brows.I have only thus far lost small amount inner corner  on the top lashes of right eye and left eye thinned on the outside of top and lower lashes.But the ones that remained are really long so no one would notice.I also stopped using mascara unless I was going somewhere special to baby them some,as I thought it may dry them and add extra stress.Seems the side that the Chemo was given has lost the most. Brows thinned some but hanging in enough that I can still hide it pretty easily .I see that some of you kept most till later after more weeks PFC so I am holding my breath. Also on the nails I did ice and fingers and toes and they look great.Only thing is I didn't do the toes first round and the big toe got some vertical ridges so I then started to ice that never progressed.So I think that it is worth trying   I can't tell you how many times I have headed for the store and put the Monoxidil in my cart but end up putting it back before I walk out.I keep thinking I just need to give it a chance and see that by time it would start to work I will probably see enough anyways.Everything else seems to be returning back to normal so this should to.But like you I can't stop looking every time I am near a mirror.Definitely starting but some is dark and some is light ,well I guess white so it's there but can't see unless close up. Again thanks for all the great tips ",
