Apparently it was a cyst. Can't they tell the difference between a cyst and a lymph node on an ultrasound? apparently not? They did tell us it was an abnormally shaped lymph node that was round which was actually a cyst. They said the cyst was attached to a small normal lymph node so the enlargement on the ultrasound was all cyst.  So we wait for the pathology results, the surgeon said it didn't look concerning but that certain conditions can cause malignant cysts so they sent the cyst tissue and a few lymph nodes around it to pathology and we wait and see in 3 days. Anyone have a cyst deep under their arm before? We were told it's a rare place to pop up. So hopefully good news awaits us in 3 days!",

I'm still in disbelief that they can't tell the difference between a lymph node and a cyst on an ultrasound. My mom's cyst was 1.7 cm huge but under the arm, not in the breast. Thanks so much for sharing your experience",

I can only hope that means they had benign findings. So worried though, just went through 3 years of my father with lymphoma cancer treatments so the whole lymph node thing frightens me. ",

They can't find anything.  We don't know what the initial size 6 months ago was and my mom was too scared to go and ask. Now that it has been 6 months, they want to fine needle biopsy the one lymph node as it is deep under her arm and persisted for 6 months. They can't fit her in for a biopsy for almost a month!  Shes had chest xrays, full body physicals/blood tests and also had an abdominal ultrasound as a baseline and everything turns up normal. Anyone ever had this situation to biopsy a lymph node? And is 1.7 cm alarming? I'm so worried, I have not slept for a week since we found out about the biopsy. Is there a chance this could be benign?

      "Content": "Apr 2, 2014 09:16AM - edited Apr 2, 2014 09:18AM by wondering22 Hi everyone, so my mom had a fine needle (FNA) biopsy of her one enlarged lymph node. They took two samples and were negative for cancer cells. However, I'm not sure I understood the doctor correctly.  The doctor said no tissue was obtained for a definite diagnosis, is tissue normally grabbed with a fine needle? The doctor said they only grabbed fat with the needle biopsy. Do fine needle biopsies normally grab tissue?  So her results was negative for cancer, however due to only grabbing two samples of fat, they want to take the entire node out. Still nothing seen in her breasts on mammogram or ultrasound. Theres also conflicting reports, the latest was her node was 1.4 cm not 1.7 cm. So now we see a breast surgeon to talk about getting the entire node out.",
