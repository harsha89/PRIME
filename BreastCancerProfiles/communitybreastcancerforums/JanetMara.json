I am thinking right now that God is directing you to a more compassionate and better one who really deals with your situation and understand what youre going thru. I had stage 3a measuring 9.7 on L breast IDC,HER 2 +,GRADE 3,with 5 axillary lymph node involvement, I started taking supplement(a detoxifier and alkalinizer) 2 months before the 1st chemo and I felt better,I took 2 chemo treatments 1 in november and 1 in february but because of the severe side effects,I decided to stop chemo and continue my supplement along with my soursop leaves tea.,my surgeon kept telling me to continue chemo before she can perform L mastectomy but I didn't go for chemo anymore. Came May,she scheduled me for ultrasoundand they couldnt believe that the tumor has shrunk and they could not find the lymph node involvement,so she ordered MRI of both breasts with and without contrast and the results were no more lymph node involvement and just a 2.7 L breast mass,so she decided to schedule me for surgery (mastectomy with axillary Lymph node dissection) and I told her,the lymph node involvement is resolved but she insisted(I shouldnt have agreed with Lymph node dissection).Right now i am on my 3rd month post mastectomy and unable to raise my left arm fully and going for Physical Therapy due to neck pain,shooting pain on my left arm and lymphedema treatment. After surgery the surgeon advised me to go see my oncologist and schedule for radiation.Eventually,radiation causes cardiomyopathy and lung disease,I'd rather continue my supplement and my soursop leaves tea than suffer with consequences of chemo again and radiation with no quality of life.Thank god I am doing well and planning to go back to work. The herbals that help shrink cancer are:kale,ginger,turmeric and soursop leaves. God bless you and take care. ",

This is not to scare you but it is a reality and just get ready.Also,expect to loose hair on the 3rd to 4th week after 1st chemo, there are stores for hats and turbans, make sure you get those before chemo, fall and winter are coming and it's too cold for your head,I don't know where you are in California,I live here in south orange county,there's transitions for women at SADDLEBACK hospital)my chemo agents were very strong, just make sure you hydrate yourself before and after chemo (they will give you a loading dose--a little high dose) but they base from your height and weight,you're likely to feel the effects as in weakness by the 3rd to 4th day, some drugs cause you diarrhea,make sure you are not dehydrated.Prepare for soft foods (easily digested nutritious foods).I also used soursop leaves tea which i think helped shrink the tumor tremendously,i didn't take it 2-3 days before and after chemo. I'd been there and i am so sorry that you have it too. Take care.",

And if he/she gives you Chemo,could be perjeta or carboplatin which are a lot milder than what I had(TAXOTERE--caused hair loss and my nails were about to fall,they all turned black: and Herceptin for HER2+).Get ready for wigs also(but ask your onco if the chemo she/he gives you causes you to loose hair, and if so,start looking for wigs,because when you start loosing hair,it comes fast. Other harsh side effects of chemo are low platelets,w/c will cause you to bleed(nosebleeding and gum bleeding esp. when you brush your teeth,use soft bristles to brush your teeth, red beets and pomegranate are good for platelet buid up,if you start having sores on your lips,make sure your PCP or onco gives you something for oral sores,also watch for any one sided rashes and blisters as these may be herpes or shingles, make sure you tell your doctor right away bec. if it is not treated right away,it might affect your nerve and shingles pain lasts a lifetime).Also,buy some antidiarrhea pills.If you develop fever,its called febrile neutropenia,make sure you tell your oncologist or go to urgent care or ER (I had a temperature of 104 despite taking tylenol and motrin),deep breath a lot to prevent pneumonia as flu season is coming).you can also PM me,if you like. be strong and take care.
