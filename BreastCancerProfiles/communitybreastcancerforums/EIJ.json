This is my 2nd biopsy in slightly more than a year as my doctor found increased calcification during my annual mammogram and ultra-sound. The first was was just a normal core needle biopsy which came back as benign. Will I get the same good results this time?? This biopsy this time was rather \"unpleasant\"; caused more pain than the last one and it didn't help that they did it in conjunction with a mammogram. Has anyone else had a vacuum-assisted biopsy done before? Wishing everyone healing and health Log in to post a reply",

When will you get your results back? I am praying for good news for you! Please do let me know ok. Waiting is hard and all my family and friends will tell you that I am terrible at it. Just do whatever you can and do not ever feel like you need to be strong. Hang in there! Hugs hugs and more hugs, EIJ",

I had my biopsy done about 3 hours ago and should get my results on Monday - the waiting feels horrible. Everyone says I should feel positive but I am afraid to feel positive. Does this sound crazy?? It will be so much harder to take if my results are not good. I admire the grace and strength with which you've accepted your diagnosis and I pray for the same. Wishing you all the very best!",

The wait is always the hardest so don't be too tough on yourself. Do small little activities that will help take your mind off diagnosis even if it's just for a little while.Do whatever you feel like doing and don't feel like you need to keep a strong facade....your family and friends will understand. Best wishes abd praying for good news for you",
