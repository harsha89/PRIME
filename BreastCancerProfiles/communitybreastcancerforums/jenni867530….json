I was actualy ready to come home because they bug you all night for vitals so I did not sleep much there. They sent me home with prescriptions for norco and tramadol. They both helped a ton , but I started to get nausea on day 3 and the doctors think I wasn't getting enough in my stomach prior to taking the doses. I really would recommend having a basket of snacks by your bed or in reach prior to taking them so you don't create a new problem. I did have to call my bs this morning and she added zofrin for the nausea. Then the nausea made me nervous and anxious so I had to up my dose of xanax. I guess my point is to make sure you eat, drink tons of water, and call your doc( even if it is on the weekend) if you need anything. I am so glad I did because it would have been a long weekend if I would have waited til Monday. Good luck on your upcoming surgery..you will be in my thoughts and prayers.",

I had a double lumpectomy for the most worrisome calcifications and the pathology cam back as more Adh and alh. I had my pathology slides from the lumpectomy re-read at MD Anderson and they said it was not Adh and alh, but grade 3 DCIS and LCIS and dirty margins. My heart sank as I had waited about 4 months to have the slides re-read and then had to wait another month to been talk to the breast surgeon. Since I had a \" busy breast\" full of calcifications and the pathology now coming back as of DCIS my only option was a uni-mastectomy, which I decided to do both because of my young age and living in fear that the good side would get it. I had the BMX Nov 30 th and have no regrets. The months leading up to it and the worry, anxiety, and sleepless nights were worse then the recovery. I have tissue expanders in now which are not comfortable, but at least the ticking time bombs are gone. I am glad I did have my slides re-read by a cancer institute because if I had not I would have been sitting here doing nothing letting the DCIS possibly turn invasive.",

I just had a BMX on Wed Nov 30 th and now can personally say that so far (2 days out) that the recovery process is going much much better than I ever could have imagined. I am so relieved to have reached this point in the journey because it is a fork in a rather bumpy 7 month road that was filled with a lot of tears and fears. It started with a questionable mammogram(calcifications in 2 quadrants which resulted in 2 lumpectomies.) Then, after having my slides re-read my original diagnosis changed from Adh to grade 3 DCIS. The point I wanted to get out to everyone tonight that is facing this is that I am doing better and feeling mentally in a better state now than at any point since this all started in April. I know I have the recovery to work through, but there are no regrets on the decisions I made that have gotten us to this point. This site and forum have been an unbelievable support source through it all. Through reading about all of the girls who had surgery before it has helped me so much and for that I am forever grateful! I am praying for everyone who has upcoming surgeries.",
