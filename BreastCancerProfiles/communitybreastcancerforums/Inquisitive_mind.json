    "Content": "Inquisitive_mind wrote: I recently found a lump. I'm 30/female and have been on HRT for 14 yrs. My gyno is four hours away (I moved) and she told me to see a physician where I'm currently living or go to an Urgent care and have my breast checked there. Well it was a Thursday. I called my primary and they couldn't see me until Monday. Being that I'm a slight hypochondriac I couldn't wait (made the appointment for Monday anyway) and went to the Urgent care. While seen there I answered yes to a few \"red flags\"... Yes, I have had nipple discharge. Yes, I can feel a lump. Yes, I have had night sweats (not sure why that matters) but no, it's not painful. Weird thing is, is its not painful but I have a weird numbing sensation where it's located. Anyone experiencing that? Well, they sent me to have an US. Tech could feel the lump, but could not find it on the US, weird right? She told me she is \"assuming it's dense breast tissue.\" Not good enough for me. Went to the appointment on Monday they are sending to to a BS. I go Monday. My gut tells me it's nothing to ignore. I just need them to see it...anyone similar?
