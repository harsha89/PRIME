    "Content": "standbyher wrote: I have had four women in my life go through breast cancer- my wife, mom, sister, and mom's best friend. There are hundreds of thousands of  men out there whose wives, moms, sister, daughters, friends, and coworkers have just been diagnosed, and they don't have a clue what to do for her, or for themselves.  Up until now, there really wasn't anywhere for them to turn. So I decided to write a book for them called Stand by Her: A Breast Cancer Guide for Men (published last October)  as well as create  ta website for men going through all this with their loved ones-  www.standbyher.org. I've also made myself available personally to talk with men who are going through it with their loved ones. My wife has helped over  100 women who've been diagnosed by talking with them about what's coming up, yet not one of the men in their lives has ever called me for help. That's a big problem! So I think it is up to those women who've  just been diagnosed with breast cancer, to tell their husbands, sons, brothers, and dads that they need to step up, for them, and get help, now, so that they can be much better caregivers.  I also firmly believe that doctors and cancer centers to need step up, in a big way as well,  to provide greater education to men as caregivers.
