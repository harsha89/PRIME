      "Content": "dancingdiva wrote: Hi, My story. I'm 42. 2 small kids. I had a mammo and US done in Nov 2013. there were 2 abnormal fibroadenomas in each breast. I was refered to a surgeon who looked me over for 30 seconds and said everything looked fine and to follow up in 6 months. I had breast pain in my left breast. I've always had chest breast shoulder pain on the left for years so I didn't associate even if there is an association at this point.Â The pain got worse in April so I went for an early US. No changes from the Nov one but I was concerned so they suggested a biopsy.Â 2 wks later went to surgeon,Â my nipple started to hurt. He looked me over for another 30 seconds, brushed me offÂ that theÂ nipple thing was probably a skin thing and pain is not associated to BC. Ordered the biopsies. 2 wks later, I shouldÂ say I'm in Canada,Â MOntreal, the hospital still didn't call so I called and told them how the nipple is really hurting,Â puffy and starting to invert. Got the biopsy the next day only on my left side and lymph node since it was hurting even there. I totally forgot about the right side from the US report.Â 1 wk later low and behold, I have IDC. Surgeon tells me I was right, but it's not Inflammatory BC or Paget. They will have to take out nipple and it's spread to lymph node. Surgery scheduled in 2wks. SoÂ after a few days of freaking out, I remember the US report, go get copy and I'm like wtf,Â the description on my right breast is the same as my left breast so why wasn'tÂ a biopsyÂ done on my right breast too?? because I wasn't bitching about the pain like the left one?Â call surgeon....i have biopsy in 2 days. I'm atÂ the Jewish GeneralÂ hospital,Â the best hospital in the city, my surgeon is supposedÂ to be goodÂ but I can't help but feel I have fallen through the cracks here. Why didn't I get the biopsy from Nov...because I'm young and there was no tumor looking thing on US??? Why am I the one to notice the right brest result?? I'm so upset because everybody who has been through this has told me that I need to have faith in my medical team but I feel that I just don't. The surgery is now just a Lumpectomy and the nodes and after that they see results and I get PET scan to see where it spread. Do they know the grade, stage, whether you are ER PR, etc just from the biopsy or do they figure it out after surgery? Are PET scans only after surgery? why don't they want to see if where it spread before surgery?? I trust no one. This sucks.

Sent to surgeon who looked me over in 5 sec, claimed pain was not sign of bc and sent me home. Hey, I was happy. Must be the exercise. Follow up in 6 mths. 4 months later, pain is getting worse under arm and chest, nipple starts hurting, go for US. No change. Surgeon repeats himself about pain, feels nothing wierd. But was referred for biopsy. Was not being called for one though be cuz I wasn't rush. 2 wks later nipple is inverting so called hospital, biopsy next day, 2 wks later IDC diagnosis. When I had surgery, surgeon took out the dense part i had pain at as well. all Bc. So I had a huge tumor that wasn't even seen by US. I had a lumpectomy bcuz they were only taking out what they saw in US. After chemo these babies are coming out. I should have been told to have MRI, but no one did. Now this is the law in the UStates? That is great. I'm in canada. So,yes i am angry and yes I'm pessimistic...OMG we could all be sisters!!!

Just got up to have yogurt after daughter knocked me with hand in my face and woke me up. We did some meditation b4 bed and she crashed in mine.Â  I asked the MO how do we know if thus working. He doesn't't. We just hope for the best. I guess getting PET scans for the whole body if we could afford it would be the thing to do? I had an MRI for just an arm and breast and it cost me $1300.

I find the more I do, the more energy I have. The heaps of snow and frigid weather does not help. I have ventured out for doc appts and is hate it out there. Want warmer weather!! I can't handle people complaining about their ailments. Even my 80 yr old mom. I really feel bad for feeling that way, but in my head I'm thinking, look at ur age!! It's expected!! What am I supposed to say?! I used to get a lot of chills that accompanied the hot flashes when I was on chemo. The flashes have subsided mostly but the chills are increasing. I have no fever.
