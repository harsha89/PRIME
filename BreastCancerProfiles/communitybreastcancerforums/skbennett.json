Back then I guess they did not do fine needle biopsies (scars around nipple to prove it). In 2004 I had a needle biopsy in the left breast after an Ultra Sound found a cyst that I could not feel. Thankfully all came out fine. I just had my most recent Mammogram in March and it showed numerous cysts in both breasts and a couple of swollen lymph nodes, even though I cannot feel them. I am religious about doing monthly exams. I received a letter three weeks after the Mammogram asking me to come back in for a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. I guess I did not call fast enough because today I recieved a Certified Letter from them. Strangely enough, I called today to make my follow up appointment. From what I understand from the Tech and my Doctor's nurse, they do not seem worried, but they feel that the left breast cysts are undetermined. Should I Freak or just accept that this is my destiny having dense breast and cysts? I am truly trying to stay calm, but I have to admit I am scared. No history of breast cancer in family. Sometimes I just wish I could have them removed and be done with the worry. I am I alone on this? Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "skbennett wrote: This might sound cheesy to you - but last night I watched Dr. 90210. For those of you who are not familiar, this show is a reality show based on Plastic Surgeons. Sadly, a young lady had lost her mother in high school due to breast cancer. Every female on her mother's side had died of breast and or ovarian cancer. At the age of 18, she willingly chose to have a double mastectomy with reconstruction. She truly feels this is her only option to live past 30 years of age. If given the option, would this be something you would choose? Me personally, I freak every year at Mammogram time. As some of you may be aware, I am scheduled next week for a follow up because of an undetermined mammogram. I feel for all women and especially young women who have a history of this disease. Would you have gone to the extremes that this young woman did at such a young age because of your family history? Log in to post a reply",
