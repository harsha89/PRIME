Don't get me wrong I love my family and all the well wishers but I feel I can't breathe or look sideways.  Is it selfish to just want some time to  yourself to get all of what is happening in your head or just go shopping cause you feel like it? I was independant before and now I feel I can't move or do anything with out some one there. Dx 1/13/2009 Log in to post a reply",
