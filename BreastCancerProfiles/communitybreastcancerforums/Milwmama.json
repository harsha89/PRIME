This 2nd round I did not get mouth sores. My fatigue is just never ending. My loss of appetite is still going strong. I do have hair loss, near 80%. Does seem to be coming back now, but slowly. I must add that i did start Keytruda as well after 2 injections of Halaven. That brought a torso rash that was near unbearable. I have been on my break and go back tomorrow for my 3rd round starting with Halaven/Keytruda. Gee, just cant wait to see whats next. Hopefully nothing as my body is getting use to the chemical assault. Summer is coming and I sure would like to feel \"good\". ",
