I also had a double mastectomy in September after I finished with chemo.  Glad to hear that you are tolerating chemo well, as I did too. Although I was very thankful that it wasn't difficult, I must admit I felt sort of guilty because I know there are plenty that don't tolerate it at all. I'm still getting Herceptin treatments every 3 weeks, and I'm about half-way done with rads. Going okay so far. Skin seems to be fine, and I'm only a little more tired than usual. (Like I should probably just go to bed when we put our kids to bed instead of staying up for an hour or two). I just started having some symptoms that I'm not sure are related to rads or maybe even from chemo.  My blood pressure has been high and I'm having some problems with acid reflux (to the point that I was having trouble swallowing). My rad onc says that neither of these are from rads so who knows. I'm on a great med for the reflux now, so hopefully I will feel much better for Christmas.  Big, big hugs to you....it's hard going through this at such a young age. :)",

I had a BMX with TE's and axillary dissection on the right on the 6th of September and came home the next day with five drains in place.  At my post-op a week later they were able to pull three of the drains.  Since then, the drainage output from the other two has remained fairly consistent, with no end in sight!! :( We've got the okay to have my hubby pull them when the drainage gets low enough. However, I started noticing that both arms are pretty \"fat\" and I've had numb/tingly toes for the last week or so. After examining them tonight, they too looked chubby. Is this normal to retain fluid after surgery??  I have a MUGA this Thursday, but my last two were just fine. Anyone else experience this?
