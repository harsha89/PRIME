Her daughter had the gene, her son did not. My daughter did not have the gene and my sons have not been tested. We have two cousins who have the gene and have not had cancer. My mother died from br ca as did three of her sisters. We know the gene came from her side of the family. We have also had many cases of prostate ca in the males 7 out of 8 males even thought I am not sure it is related to chek2. I believe it is. I want to reassure you because I am 67 and have not had cancer. I go to the MD Anderson breast cancer prevention clinic twice a year. I have a mammogram and a breast scan so that if I do get it, I can treat it right away. With Chek2 your chance is 25% which is pretty high but not terrible. You must be diligent in your screening. Good luck",
