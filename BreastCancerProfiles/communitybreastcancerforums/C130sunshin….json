I started my rad treatments on the 4th of Nov.  I will be getting a total of 33 treatments (last five will be boosts).  I have two tattoos, but like most of you I feel like I can play connect the dots on my chest with all the sharpie marks.  I have my treatment first thing in the morning....this way I don;t have to worry about leaving work and then having to return. For cream....I was given Sween 24....it is very thick.  I have not seen it in stores, but I know you can get it on line.  This biggest thing about cream is to make sure it does not have any alcohol or metals in it.  I have had only three treatments so far but I am applying the cream at least twice a day. I opted no to wear a bra....instead I am wearing a 100% cotton shirt. I am actually wearing a men's sleeveless undershirt.  I bought them in various sizes....depending how sore I get.  They tend to be lighter (I wanted something light due to the hot flashes) and cheaper (so I don't care if they get ruined) than a women's camisole.  My radiology nurses said to wear 100% cotton....it is more comfortable. I did not realize how many soaps have metals in them.  I was told to use baby shampoo (with nothing added...like lavender, etc) as a body wash. Sherri - I am being followed in the lymphedema clinic.  I have very slight symptoms....like you.  I did not have noticeable swelling in my arm...just soreness.  I really did not think too much of it (I only had 4 nodes removed) until I noticed the cording and I could not lift my arm too high without pain.  My LE therapist gave me four exercises to do...they have really helped.  I also got two compression sleeves to wear when I fly.  She said the changed in pressure can cause fluid retention in the arm.  The only problem I have had so far is that the treatment room is sooooo cold.  It is hard to be still when I have shivering.  My heart and prayers go out to those that have to travel so far. kim",

Mina....I am so sorry.  Don't give up!!!!!  Tell us what happens when you call NY-Presbyterian Cornell.  Are there any other Cancer Centers in NY you can call? ",

I have just finished number 14 of 33 rad treatments.  I am started to have fatigue.  I don't know if it sue to the rad treatments or the lack of sleep due to extreme hot flashes.  I have been having problems with hot flashes followed by extreme cold.  I have tried everything I could think of (plus what my NP could think of to do).  Since I am ER/PR + I was told not use soy.  Anyone else having this issue?  I have not started Tamoxifen yet.....which will make them worse (Oh Great!!!!!!).  I was just put on Effexor for the hot flashes.  Both my oncologist and rad provider uses this for hot flashes.  I tend to be a light wait when it comes to meds that cause drowsiness so taking this med scares me. kim",

To answer your question:  At first the deployments crossed my mind but I really don't think they were a factor.  So far I am the only one that has breast cancer.  I am more leaning to being on birth control for over 19 years (mine was ER/PR +)....but as they say most of the time you really never know what caused it. kim",

I had my treatments in the morning then went to work.  The hospital I work at took me out of patient care while I went through chemo and then radiation.  I was able to work most days full time (Fridays were the hardest).  Like Shirlann I did not do anything at night but \"veg\" on the couch.  The best advice I could tell you is to have a positive attitude, laugh at least once a day (or do something very silly) and just take each day as it comes.  Only you can determine how much you can do.  kim",
