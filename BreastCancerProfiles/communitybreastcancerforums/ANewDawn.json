I have had a very quick progression from my welcome to your 40 year old mammogram on 1/28/13, a core needle biopsy 2/7/13 to diagnosis of extensive DCIS grade 2 on 2/16/13 to a nipple sparing right masectomy with immediate TEs on March 2nd. MY BS felt due to the extensiveness of the DCIS I should not wait for a later surgery date since he had very small chance of getting clear margins with a lumpectomy because DCIS was all over the top half of my right breast so it was decided  My final path report upgraded my DCIS to stage 3 and also found IDC 0.4 mm to the right of the DCIS but thankfully no invasion of nodes or mets. I am currently 12 days post-op, feeling great (despite some discomfort of my now rock hard chest lump and one JP drain insertion site), my nipple is looking good and it appears it will live to see its new breast.  I was mostly pain free for the first 9 days but day 10 started to feel more discomfort when laying down and overall right chest wall achiness that seems increase as my activity increases. I have been trying to stay active, walking for 20-30 mins every other day which I started on day 3. Taking only Advil when needed and waiting somewhat impatiently to get my drain out so I can get back to increasing activity and back to work.    I can relate to the anxiety and fear related to the unknown of surgery. I experienced the worst fear of my life the night before my surgery date but as soon as I met my pre-op nurse I felt instantly relaxed and comfortable and knew I was making the right decision. For those of you who are still waiting for your surgeries, know that you are not alone and you too will get through this next step in this journey. For all of our fellow post surgical sisters, I hope you are all recovering well both physically and emotionally!!  Sending positiveness out to you all!!  Thank you for including me in this discussion.  ",
