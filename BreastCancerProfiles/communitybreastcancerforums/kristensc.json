This is terrifying (I never thought at 32 I would be dealing with this)Â and I am tryiing my best to keep calm so that my family is ok and not too upset. I decided to go to Cancer Treatment Centers of America in Illinois for my treatment. I love the way that they approach this whole process and feel very comfortable with them. Has anyone else gone there? Also, I have an 8 year old son that I am thus far keeping this from him as best as I can. He knows that I have to go see some doctors and go to the hospital but has anyone else had small children during this? How did ya'll handle it?",

My surgeon has set up abdominal CT, bone scans, genetics testing (because of age and lack of family history) and a PET scan. After that she suggests a radical mastectomy, then chemotherapy and radiation. So far my preliminary pathology report says Grade 3, aggressive and that is all. Can anyone tell me what I can expect from this point as far as how you feel after the mastectomy and going into treatment? Is there also a better place to go for treatment like Cancer Centers of America? kristensc Log in to post a reply",
