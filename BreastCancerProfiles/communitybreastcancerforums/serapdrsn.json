    "Content": "serapdrsn wrote: Hello everyone, I am currently taking Doxorubicin and Cytoxan as a dose-dense treatment every 2 weeks for my invasive ductal carcinoma. I have read some articles on the internet saying that dose-dense treatment produces better overall survival and lower recurrence rates than standard treatment which is every 3 weeks. I had my 2nd cycle today and i will take the 3rd two weeks later but i am currently overthinking about this dose-dense articles on internet, because after my 1st cycle , my doctor delayed the 2nd cycle for one week, because of a national holiday. My other treatments will be on time, but i really felt down because i read there are dramatical changes between 2 week and 3 week cycles. What do you think, will it affect my prognosis, or pCR probability maybe? Sorry for my bad English, i hope every one of you gets well and cured soon. .
