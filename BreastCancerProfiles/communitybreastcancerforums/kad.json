I don't know if I want to travel so far away, but for who I am, it might be the only choice I can make.. I looked into Mayo also.. They have some new non-invasive procedures.  I don't know of right now if I would be a good candidate yet.. I am sure I would like to be one of those that fit the new procedure for needle guided removable.. Some balloon procedure follows that of inserting some pill that kills that area is also on the innovative.. I might sound a bit futuristic, but that is me.. As time unveils maybe I'll see things differently.. I eventually will vent all my feelings on you all... I am more frighten then I even know right now.. kad",

I just went to Lacks cancer center today for my 5 panel doctor suggestions... Not real hip on the surgeon. Kind of this is the way I do it.. He has no intrest in any new procedures.. Just cut it out blindly.... Then check to see if I did get it or I missed it.. Is there a mri guided procedure? Is there a altrsound guided procedure?  I have heard other women talking about such ways of removal.. I am having a lumpectocy and it sound very large and the surgeon told me he didn't even know if it wasn't removed by the biopsy.. He didn't care, just 2 cm more of whatever area he thinks might be the problem (cancer) guess.. He gave me the I don't know if I got the area until I see the biopsy and clear margins.. I have heard about the clear margins, it is the idea that he has no clue and he isn't ordering anything new, just a mammo before procedure.. Is this the way it goes... Kad",
