    "Content": "Nwkgoldfinch wrote: Hi everyone, I keep moving to the next board appropriate for my situation. I'm 33 and was just diagnosed (as of now) stage 2, 4.5 cm on the left breast. No lymph node involvement. But, the doctor is doing a bone and cat scan next week and I'm so terribly scared about what it might reveal. He already said given how young I am he expects the complete pathology to reveal an aggressive form, so that makes me even more frightened it could be somewhere else. I feel *so so stupid* for not finding it sooner. How could I be so oblivious? Also, we asked him about fertility, and while he deferred specifics to that specialist, said that the process of harvesting eggs would delay treatment. They want to start neoadjuvant chemo the week after next. To me it's a no brainer: it's game time. But still, it's a lot to absorb - the prospect of early menopause and never bearing a kid. I've really been keeping it calm and together and it hasn't even been that hard, but I woke feeling so afraid and sad, it's hard to describe. I'm so afraid of the next round of tests. But I know it's out of my hands so I try to enjoy my day for what it is right now. Maybe I'll feel better after I have my coffee. :) Thanks in advance for any words of support. Diagnosed at 33; Functionally triple negative. Dx 3/23/2016, Left, 4cm, Stage IIB, Grade 3, ER-/PR-, HER2- Chemotherapy 4/29/2016 AC + T (Taxol) Log in to post a reply",
