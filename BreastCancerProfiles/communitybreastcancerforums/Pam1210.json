I had a biopsy done in Oct. and they said it was a papilloma about 7mm but B9 and to come back in 6 months so I was good with that then got a call from my Dr 3 weeks later he said that they want to take it out (so then I start worrying again) went to the surgeon and he reasurred me that it was nothing but with my age (52) they like to take them out so they don't turn into anything so I went ahead and had it done and it was B9 and I am glad I did it but I would like to know if anybody knows can you get more of them and how soon?",
