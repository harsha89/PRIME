There might be a bacteria or fungus living in the folds of the skin that takes any opportunity given to create havoc. Not only stress, but high humidity and heat can aslo provide a good environment for it. Try athlete foot cream next time it appears. I used to use it on my intermittent nipple itching and it provided relief. Also see if you can get your doctor to prescribe you vitamin D blood test. If you live in northern hemisphere and spend too much time indoor might not have appropriate levels of vitamin D even if you are young. Make sure your levels are in the middle of the normal range. The lack of Vitamin D does both lower the immune system function and can give you muscle pain. If the doctor doesn't want to test you for vitamin D, then take some over the counter supplements (vitamin D3, 2000 ui) for one month and see if it makes a difference. I give this to my son ( also 19) during winter months. Edited to add that I posted by mistake the same thing twice so I deleted the second post.",

I had skin infections too, likely due to the poorly functioning immune system. During this time of pain, my hormones were in the normal range, but my antibodies to thyroid proteins were high. This, and a slight elevation (just above the normal) in some inflamatory markers were the only measurable clinical signs of my widespread symptoms. Looking back, I think it was my body reacting to the breast cancer and not knowing what to do. So you are right to pursue investigations for both type of cancers. It is very likely something is going on. It could be that your body will be able to keep it in check at the expense of your quality of life. If not, at least your quality of life will improve after treatment, should the cancer be cured. There is now research supporting the idea that autoimmune diseases are caused by incipient cancer.",

Some refer to this person as a miracle. He calls himself just lucky...no lifestyle changes, no particular healthy food, no naturist doctors. And there are also these spontaneous remission cases, reported in literature, where cancer disapears without any apparent reason. It's only a matter of turning on the immune system. Once it has the ability to recognize the defective cell, cancer doesn't stand a chance. This understanding is well accepted. What exactly turns on the immune system, that's the million dollar question. So maybe it's the medicine, or the medicine plus one or multiple lifestyle changes, or just the surgery, or an unrelated illness (this seems to be often the case for spontaneous remissions)... no one is able to tell now. Also, the hormone positive and hormone negative cancers tend to behave differently, although exceptions exist. No one knows why, but hormone negative tends to recur quickly, while hormone positive can stay dormant for many years and then come back. So a stage four hormone positive patient will likely stay on the medication throughout life, but is not that clear the same is needed for a hormone negative patient. Especially since the medicine, Herceptin, it appears to be working by stimulating the immune system -that's why it is called immunotherapy. Of course, since Herceptin is relatively new, there aren't studies to confirm or infirm yet that lifelong treatment is needed.",

But, a cancer caught early and responding well to treatment has its positives as well: people in this situation live a long and healthy life to a very old age. I've read some studies about this effect some time back; researchers attribute it to the patient implementing healthy life style changes after cancer diagnosis. But, after talking to a couple of people in this situation, who told me they didn't change their life style a bit after cancer diagnosis, I tend to believe that is just the fact that the immune system gets a good training during cancer treatment, and becomes more alert after that. One of the big surprises after my diagnosis was to find out how many people I knew had cancer. These were people I interacted with for many years, yet I could never guessed they had cancer! Funny thing, some of these people, now in their old age, with a big family of many grandkids, I admire a lot, and I often wished to have a life just like theirs. Sure enough I've got my wish! After your mom finds out the type of cancer she has (hormone and her2 status), the stage, the lymph node status, you should come back here and disclose it and discuss about treatment with other women having the same type of cancer and going through similar treatment. Treatment can be hard, but here you will find a lot of support. So far, it sounds like your mom is having mastectomy and radiation, which suggests she has a less aggressive cancer caught in very early stage. Here, in US, most doctors prescribe a bone scan and a CT scan before any treatment begins to make sure there isn't any distant metastasis, and also to have something for comparison in the future. Best wishes to your mom and your family and stay strong for her!",

Moreover, since December 2017 perjeta has been approved by FDA to continue with Herceptin for the reminder of the year (all 18 infusions), as it has been shown that the two together have a stronger effect in decreasing the recurrence/metastasis. I think most of us with TCHP report decent side effects, unless there is an alergic reaction (after which the treatment must be changed). I did work during the chemo. For me the worst side effect was fatigue, especially days 4 to 6. I also had and continue to have chest pain (landed me in ER where I was checked for heart attack/ blood clots). Finally, heart burn became terrible as time went on. The taste was nasty, too. Another terrible side effect was bone pain from neulesta, the shot that keeps the wbc up. I had to change to neupogen, and the pain was gone for me.Some take claritin to prevent the pain from neulesta (check this site for more info on this), but I didn't dare to try a second neulesta shot. Neither diarrhea nor constipation were a big Issues for me, but for some were. My hair started to fell later, after the third infusion, but typically falls about two weeks after the first infusion. For most of us the scalp becomes slightly painful when this happens. I suggest to donate it now, there is no reason to wait. You may also try cold caps (or penguin caps) in an attempt to keep it. Be aware that taxotere has potential for permanent hair loss (happens in a few percent of us), although it' s cousin does not. Good luck all of you! Time flies and before you know it you will be done.",

When used together, they somehow have a better effect (perhaps the cancer cell becomes more obvious to the immune system). Namely, studies show that when used together, there is a slight increase in being cancer free for longer term. In US, FDA has approved perjeta to be used along with Herceptin for all 18 infusions. Neither Herceptin nor perjeta have significant side effects, unless one is in the small group where the heart function is impaired (reversible). Also, with TCHP chemo the side effects are minimal, unless one has allergy to one of the drugs, which manifests right at the beginning. Being so young, I suspect you will be little affected. Most young users on this site report very minimal side effects from TCHP. Some don't even experience a change in appetite. If indeed you are given TCHP (taxotere and carboplatin), search for the threads with TCHP in the title to find more info about this regime and side effects. Being so young also puts you at higher risk so I think your onc should want to treat you more aggressively not less. Perhaps you may want to go for a second opinion. For instance Dana Farber Institute in Boston (one of the top cancer centers in the world) offers the opportunity for second opinion by online consult (very convenient). God bless you!",

Basically all food intake was between noon to 4 or 5 pm. The diet was plant based: vegetable soup, brocoli, mushrooms, cabbage etc. all cooked daily by my guardian angel (mom). I never had nausea or vomiting, nor constipation or diarrhea. However, I did have acid reflux. And I was fatigued and my hair and period was gone. But other than this I had no side effects from chemo. Neulesta instead gave me horrendous bone pain, and I had to change to Neupogen. However, my wbc were below normal, and I had to be on antibiotics to prevent infections several times. Actually, I believe the acid reflux was due more to antibiotics than chemo, as it started as I finished my first round of antibiotics. Also, I didn't take any prescription for nausea. I did take some pills after coming home after the first infusion because I was scared about what could happen. But then I became more courageous and decided to wait and see. After that, the only pills I took during chemo were the steroids.",

Cancer can hurt ocasionally, but most often it doesn't. Secondly, even if it is breast cancer she will be treated and will be all right. Finally, perhaps the reason she doesn't want to discuss it with you is because she knows you and does not want to see you upset. Perhaps you could gather some strength and discuss the subject frankly with her, telling her that she could fully count on you in the eventuality something is wrong. If she will end up having cancer, what she needs the most is to see that her beloved daughter is a strong and determined adult able to succeed in life in any circumstances. Best wishes!",

I do have osteoporosis, 70% bone density in my spine. So the question I keep asking myself is to scan or not to scan? It is reassuring some of you had similar pain and it turned out to be nothing. Also, if these are mets, and they developed while on treatment, then I guess there is not much left to do for me. Thus, I cannot see a clear benefit in scanning.   In addition to tailbone pain, I have sternum pain. This goes back to chemo time, when it first showed up. It is annoying because I have to be careful if I want to hug people. I am pretty sure it is the bone which is painful when I press on it. In addition, the whole radiated area is painful, perhaps there is some mild LE going on, but that is a separate feeling from the one I get when I press on the sternum.  ",
