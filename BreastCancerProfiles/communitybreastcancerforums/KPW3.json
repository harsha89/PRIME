They are decreasing the steriods, but will take 6 weeks! They are negatively affecting my sleeping, so now I have to take something for that. But I was very happy to get the Halaven dose at a reduced dose. It's not clear whether I'll ever get the Keytruda/Pembo. The kidneys were a grade 2 injury, for the trial you aren't allowed to receive it again if you have a grade 3. So, we haven't totally ruled it out, but if I have a similar response in the future it may damage my kidneys worse the next time. If I don't get the Keytruda for >12 weeks I think I'm technically off trial. I really want to stay on it, or see what the next scan shows in Oct.",

I had a colonoscopy done yesterday which did show a very small area of colitis and the villi in the start of the small intestine were blunted. So, it is being recommended that with 3 autoimmune toxicities (thyroid, nephritis-resolved and now colitis) to stop the Keytruda trial. I have 8 weeks to stay on the trial before being kicked off due to stopping the pembro....the tentative plan is to stay on trial for the Halavan and depending on scan results go from there. My MO's opinion (and those he has consulted with) is that it might be dangerous to try more at this time, I could potentially have a far more serious autoimmune toxicity. I think he is, unfortunately, correct. He has not ruled out using a different immunotherapy in the future since it appears to be VERY effective in my case. I'm disappointed, but don't want anymore potential toxicities. Scans next week... susan_02143, how are you?",

First break was Aug. with acute kidney injury that responded very quickly with high dose steriods. When I was able to get the prednisone down to under 10mg (10 weeks) I was able to restart the trial (after seeing super specialist at Dana Farber). Then I was on until Dec. and developed grade 2 colitis, which again quickly resolved with steriods. An earlier CT in Aug. showed liver met resolving and no others. At this point while off in OCT, I had a CT and they found \"soft tissue mets\" in abd and chest. Found one lymph node that was removed for biospy on my upper medial arm, within 2-3 weeks saw it grow from slight questionable area to ~1 cm. Was taken off trial and am now getting Gem/Carb and other lymph nodes I could feel growing have now almost disappeared. This treatment is harder than the keytruda and halaven! Will cross post.",

Their study, published May 25 in Science, was led by researchers in the Center for Cancer Research (CCR) at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). It showed that bacteria found in the gut of mice affect the liver's antitumor immune function. The findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms that lead to liver cancer and for therapeutic approaches to treat them.

They are decreasing the steriods, but will take 6 weeks! They are negatively affecting my sleeping, so now I have to take something for that. But I was very happy to get the Halaven dose at a reduced dose. It's not clear whether I'll ever get the Keytruda/Pembo. The kidneys were a grade 2 injury, for the trial you aren't allowed to receive it again if you have a grade 3. So, we haven't totally ruled it out, but if I have a similar response in the future it may damage my kidneys worse the next time. If I don't get the Keytruda for >12 weeks I think I'm technically off trial. I really want to stay on it, or see what the next scan shows in Oct.",

I think having issues in the liver is enough to cause the ascities....but it's no guarantee, I think abd mets would have shown up on CT or MRI, unless you are ILC.

I also don't think I can be considered to have a \"hyper-progression\" Well, I've bee so discouraged I haven't been able to post for a while (or don't recall posting). I was on Keytruda and Halaven from June-Dec. with several months off due to autoimmune toxicities. First break was Aug. with acute kidney injury that responded very quickly with high dose steriods. When I was able to get the prednisone down to under 10mg (10 weeks) I was able to restart the trial (after seeing super specialist at Dana Farber). Then I was on until Dec. and developed grade 2 colitis, which again quickly resolved with steriods. An earlier CT in Aug. showed liver met resolving and no others. At this point while off in OCT, I had a CT and they found \"soft tissue mets\" in abd and chest., unusual for IDC. Found one lymph node that was removed for biospy on my upper medial arm, within 2-3 weeks saw it grow from slight questionable area to ~1 cm. Was taken off trial and am now getting Gem/Carb and other lymph nodes I could feel growing have now almost disappeared. This treatment is harder than the keytruda and halaven!",
