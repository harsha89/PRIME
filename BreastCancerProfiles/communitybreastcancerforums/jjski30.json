It hit me hard and I am really scared to go through it again so soon. If my chemo doc can get my score down by to 5 or 6 percent I will do the chemo. If it is only going to go down by 1 or 2 per cent then I don't think it will be worth it for me. I am waiting to hear what my onc suggests!",

I had a hysterectomy and have come off my hrt so am going through menopause. I am fine with radiation but am not sure about chemo. I went through chemo last year for a different type of cancer and would rather not do it again. My onco score gives me a 13 per cent chance of recurrence. Does anyone know if this will become lower with radiation and arimedex?",

After the onco score your doctor will plug some more info in and then let you know how much lower your recurrence percentage rate will be with chemo, radiation and tamox and such. I am wishing you a very low score and quick recovery!Â ",
