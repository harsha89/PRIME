I am about to complete #17 today, and noticing a bit of \"firmness\" these days on my right side. Still just slightly pink skin so far. I am trying to lotion more often now just in case. I have to look into the \"green tea prep\" everybody is mentioning. I've been having slight hot flashes since chemo, and I feel like I'm getting them a bit more often these days but don't know if that's just coincidence. I managed to keep a good portion of my hair during chemo by using a cold capping system. I've got a lot of new growth on the top of my head now, where I had lost the most, and I'm not tempted to shave the rest of my head to match it which seems crazy. However the straggly hair I have left just annoys me at times, even though it looks mostly normal. HOPE you are feeling better! ",

I'll probably get more schooling on this today when I meet with my oncologist. I'm still pre-menopausal (or at least was before I started the whole chemo/radiation process) so my options may vary a bit perhaps. I know I've had the discussion before with my onco, but back then it was such a future thought since all I could focus on with him was chemotherapy. I have ER/PR+ (highly ER+ but not as high PR+) so I know hormone treatments are next for me. I'm not looking forward to it of course, but not like I was looking forward to ANY of this stuff! **** So in a few hours I'll be talking to my oncologist about \"what next\" for me, which I know is hormone treatments but the question is what kind and when we will start them. I'm planning on delaying starting them at least until I get back from vacation (which is next week) so as to not have to worry about any side effects. I also have an appointment with another oncologist just as a second opinion, but that's not until January unfortunately. I'm not sure he'll be happy with me delaying for THAT long but we'll see what happens. ",

I've read that if you have really bad hot flashes then the chances of cancer returning are actually LESS...for whatever that is worth. Mine aren't horrible. I'm also so tempted to do the same with my hair, which seems a shame after the money I spent to try to keep so much of it! The new growth is very soft and fuzzy so I may wait until it is about an inch or so before I consider cutting the rest of my hair to match it. @Mandeola: I feel like I'm getting a little bit of itching going on myself right now...we'll see what happens after I resume treatments this week though. @sweetsmilefh: Wow that is a pretty crazy experience...and scary! @DodgersGirl: Thanks for the green tea information...I was wondering about that also. I'm gonna hold off for now. You also pretty much gave a rundown of exactly how my treatments go every day, except I don't have a ladies only waiting room. Most of the time it's just me in there anyway, but occasionally there is a guy there who must be on the same schedule as me, either finishing up or waiting. Last week we were waiting at the same time to be taken back, but I went back first. It is pretty quick and easy though, which most people are surprised to hear and you really don't feel anything at all. @pink_is_my_colour: Here's to reaching the halfway point soon! I'm just over that hump myself, so hope I can coast through the last 13 treatments! @PauletteK: Good look to you next month! @MCOlivia: Thanks for your kind words. Yeah I can't even begin to explain this year to anybody, though most people I know IRL are aware of it. I've been to 6 funerals since Feburary (mom, MIL, good friend's father, best friend's father, uncle, and grand uncle) and am navigation new territory not only with my diagnosis but also dealing with my father who started dating somebody about two months after my mother's death. Definitely has changed me in many ways. ********** So I've been lotioning and oiling a lot this weekend since my skin is definitely becoming more tender. I'm sure once this week completes it will probably get more tender. I see my rad oncologist every Tuesday after treatment, so we'll see what she says this week. Last time I saw her was actually last Monday, and she was already mentioning the use of cold compresses for me even though I hadn't been complaining at all. I guess she knew it was coming. Ready to get this week done!   ",

Yesterday they gave me some gel pads I can keep in the frig and use when needed, and the RO recommended ibuprofen for pain. So far I'm not to that point yet though. I may have to look into the miaderm everyone has recommended. I have 6 more whole breast rads, and the last 5 will be targeted at the area where the cancer was located. I finish up the Wednesday before Thanksgiving and yes RO mentioned it would probably be the worst about a week after treatment was done, and then should start healing. So sounds like I'll be healing right about the time I go on vacation in early December at least. Take care everybody and hang in there! ",

      "Content": "Nov 1, 2017 02:10PM - edited Nov 1, 2017 02:21PM by catlady72 My intro here...newby:  I lost my mom to cancer in February of this year before being diagnosed myself in April. She had breast cancer in 2005, but had treatment for it and was almost all clear for about 5 years. In 2011 or 2012 she was diagnosed with early stage lung cancer (she was a lifetime non-smoker and didn't have much exposure to it) and battled that for another 5+ years after surgery to remove it was unsuccessful. Her passing was difficult, she went downhill quickly after being diagnosed with brain tumors in November, that were also treated with radiation. During this same time, for the last 3 years my MIL was also battling kidney cancer. We lost her in July of this year as well. So it's been a tough year for us. After reading things on this board since April, I'm finally going to try to be a little more active in case I need the support. So diagnosed in April, surgery May, chemo June through August and just started radiation last month. Today will be #15 out of 30 with no S/Es so far other than redness. My radio oncologist, who I see every week, seemed to indicate I can expect more pain soon so now I'm looking into ways I can minimize any S/Es that happen. Right now I've only been using Adamia lotion every morning but haven't been in the habit of putting something on right after radiation which I do each day (M-F) at 3pm after work and then go home. Today I feel like fatigue is setting in a bit, as I got plenty of sleep last night and I'm dragging a bit now. Good luck to everybody here going through this stuff now and I'll try to check in often to provide any support...and in case I need any myself! ",

I am wondering about the hot flashes and how they relate to radiation as well. I'm 45 and pre-menopausal but my body has been through a lot this year and no cycle since I had my IUD removed in July (which was also during chemo). I had my port removed as soon as I was down with chemo and BEFORE starting radiation, so 3 surgeries so far this year. Honestly chemo wasn't horrible for me either, I had 4 cycles as shown in my siggy. Everybody else enjoy our 2 days off from radiation!

I will say yesterday, even while waiting on the table for my treatment, I think I dozed off a few times for seconds at a time. They had me in a new room with some new techs and it took a while to get my lined up properly. Then I came home and napped, which usually has me good for the evening...but even at night I dozed off again. Crazy! Hopefully I'll be good with cooking too. I also refuse to let it stop me from doing things. I've played tennis throughout all of my treatments (surgery, chemo, radiation) but I do feel like I must take a break now because of the open wound under my right arm, my tennis playing arm, that made it uncomfortable while playing over the weekend.

I'm not familiar with the Femara and Zometa infusion treatments you speak about. So much to learn about how everybody has different treatments. @silver2000: Good luck to you on starting your treatments later this week. Glad that you get to at least skip out on chemo, though I didn't find that to be horrible. I think rads were worse for me for sure. @LoJo100: So great to read such a positive report from you. My skin also is finally starting to heal in some spots, but still very raw in others. I gave up on my normal tennis playing for now, because using my right arm when I have raw skin under that area would be painful. I'm so glad you were able to get out and be active and I look forward to that for myself, HOPEFULLY next week?? Good luck starting Tamoxifen. I speak to my oncologist tomorrow to talk about the next steps for me. I'm hoping to delay any medications for another few weeks so I can have a little break from treatments. @sweetsmilefh: That is horrible about that sensitivity...and a bit scary! So sorry you are going through that. As for the sharp stabbing pains...YEAH I've got those today, now only 5 days from my final boost. My cancer was aslo right above my nipple, and right now that already looks so raw and open and I'm using the burn cream on it. However the pains are hitting me frequently today so I just took some ibuprofen to see if that helps. @DodgersGirl: I'm so sorry to hear about your issues, even if you don't want to go into details. I think I mentioned before that my raw and open skin under my breast was especially painful, to the point that one day I was just in TEARS because it was like pins and needles when I even tried to move. I was miserable. My RO did offer pain meds but I declined and figured I'd get through it, and now it is a week past what was probably the most painful time for me and I am starting to heal and that area under my breast is almost healed thank goodness. I do have a new and smaller open wound under my arm near my scar for node removal but hopefully that will clear up soon enough. I'm so glad to be on this side of at least some of that pain. I see my RO this week as a follow-up also for her to check my healing, so I'm glad to know she should be happy once she sees it now compared to last week. Hang in there! ************* So it's going to be strange not doing my daily drive to the office for my treatments for sure, but I have 3 follow-up appointments this week with various doctors to keep my busy. Tomorrow I talk to my oncologist about my next steps in treatment and see when that will begin.",

I think the best we can all do is try as much as possible not to think about those odds that might be against us, as hard as it may be sometimes. I do the same thing all of the time. I'm not triple negative, but even reading about the odds of my particular cancer returning I can't help but wonder not *IF* it will happen but really *WHEN* I'll have another recurrance, even though I know that's not a good thing to think about. After all, when I got my diagnosis it wasn't that I was surprised at all to have cancer...I've always been sure I was going to get something because it runs strong on both sides of my family, I was only surprised that it happened to me so early in life since most of the people I know on my side who have had it were diagnosed later in life. *************** Not going to sugar coat it people, the weekend and this week were rough. I made it to work and to treatment yesterday afternoon...only TWO more to go out of my 30! I keep seeing the end in sight and that motivates me to keep going despite the pain I'm in a lot of the time. I came home and just laid down on my couch, shirt off and let everything air out but when I got up about 2 hours (and a nap or so) later, and wanted to move around, I was in so much pain I finally broke down in tears. Just having to support this extremely raw and painful breast is hard enough. I'm fine once I get it into a bra and slathered in Silvadene though so instead of airing it out last night during bed, because every time I roll over or get up it is excruciating, I just used the silvadene and bought some gauze dressings for it, put on a bra and slept that way. I'm sorry but it just makes things easier. When I got in the shower this morning though, there was a lot more wincing and pain. It takes me SO long to get ready any more in the mornings but I still make myself get up and go to work right now. I just need to get through these two days. And some of you are scaring me a bit, as I swear my RO said the skin would be worse for a WEEK after radiation and then get better, but now I am reading TWO weeks from some of you. Please say that isn't so! I was already counting down my week (next week) and then hoping by the two week mark, when I'm on vacation, I'd be doing better. I know I'll be taking treatment stuff with me on vacation already. Time to start looking for travel containers to put all my creams into I guess!   ",

Your attitude in this post particularly is the same way I feel: I have to say the last few days have had me teetering on some kind of anxiety that hopefully will stay away. My mom suffered from depression throughout her cancer years and I am hoping to not go through what she went through because it was so difficult to watch. Like many of you here, it's definitely strange to seem somewhat done with the every day appointments right now, though I still have plenty on the horizon. This week I saw my oncologist Tuesday, RO Wednesday (who is leaving the practice and going out of state...very sad but happy for her new opportunity), and breast surgeon yesterday. I also met with another person at the hospital yesterday doing a study on people going through clinical studies and we had a nice chat, but it had some emotional moments as I told my story to her. She was very sweet though. My surgeon didn't feel a need to do too much poking around my breast since it still looks a bit \"angry\" but she said it was expected based on my treatment and she felt it was fine. It's weird that I have treatment from so many different doctors but so far they all seem to be good about providing reports to each other so when I see one of them, despite being associated with different hospital systems and practices, the others seem to have updates. The only downside is that I can't view all of my records online at one place because there are 3 different online medical records systems to view. I'm going to try to find the new thread DodgersGirl so we can all keep track of each other. That sounds great! For those still going through treatment, hang in there. It really does get better and quickly. Even though I still have a pretty extensive morning routine of many lotions and oils to keep my skin going in the right direction, it really hasn't taken that long for me to be so much better despite some severe pain at one point. I'm even planning to hit the tennis courts Sunday morning! ",

Finally saw my RO yesterday, who was rather upset I hadn't contacted her sooner once she saw my raw and peeled skin. I told her it really hadn't gotten that bad until the weekend, and then I figured I'd see her Tuesday anyway...but of course didn't know I'd end up waiting until Wednesday. She did a quick analysis of my next phase, and since the treatment area for the targeted radiation is well outside of the current raw area, she is okay with me continuing on schedule. If the targeted area had fallen in the range of my current raw area, she would have advised me taking a break from radiation to let it heal. Anyway, the first thing the nurse said to me when she checked me out was that they would be calling in a script for silvadene, which is what my friend (the nurse) told me I should ask for and so I picked that up last night. OH MY GOSH...I couldn't believe that even putting it into the open and raw skin didn't even HURT! It was amazing. I've got that stuff slathered on heavy now, and I took some advil last night and this morning for pain and swelling. Whole new world. Plus I am using a gel pad today on the slathered area as extra protection and cooling. Whew! My DH is giving me a hard time about not calling the RO earlier, but honestly I just thought I'd be okay until I saw her. The good news is that I am doing better now and treatment will go on as planned. I am finding that every day when I get home after radiation I need a nap, a longer one than I used to take, but it could be that I come home and curl up on the couch with a blanket and a cat and it's just easy to nap there. Supposed to play a tennis match tomorrow night and I think I'm going to try and see how I do with it. Even though it's my right side and my right arm I use, I think I'll be okay as I was playing this weekend. Oh and another bonus: they told me when the current stickers fall off not to worry, they don't need those any longer. They advised probably not to try to remove at least the ones on my raw skin, but the others if they come off it's no big deal. Yay! Hope all is well with everybody else!",

I was very close to having to take a medical break but right now I'm planning to get these last 3 treatments knocked out this week so I can be done! Hello all...I'm in the home stretch with my last 3 treatments (27 of 30 today) this week...Mon, Tue, Wed all targeted. Sure the techs will hate me as they keep drawing on me but I put so much lotion on this weekend to relieve my itching and pain that most of those marks are all gone! I'm really, really torn up right now. Underneath my breast is a HUGE area that is open and seeping and bleeding at times, and though the Silvadene relieves the burn, it really doesn't seem to be healing. I also now have a space under my arm that is broken up and raw. It's really, really bad and again with being a full-breasted person it's just painful to move at time and I NEED a support bra or it's worse! I just need to get through these 3 days, and will at least spend my time after treatment today at home, bra off, and let the wounds air out as much as possible. Hopefully my family understands when I avoid them. Between the itching and burning, I honestly can't sympathize more with real burn victims. I cannot imagine how miserable that must be to have larger areas in this condition. My DH wanted me to stay home from work today and just air things out like I did last night for a while, but I am determined to get through my work week. Hope everybody else is doing better!  ",

My RO did say yesterday my open wound looks good and she could see no signs of infection and it is starting to heal in places, so that's good. @DodgersGirl: I am with you on the pain meds...it's just uncomfortable when I move which is what I told my RO yesterday. She was offering stronger pain meds, but I told her I still had room to increase my ibuprofen dosage which I haven't tried yet. MOST of the time, when I'm confined, my pain level is fine. However when at night when I am letting myself air out and sleeping braless...when I roll over that pain level is EASILY a 10 and even after my surgeries and c-sections for all 3 kids, I've NEVER had pain like this. I just work through it. ********* So yesterday was treatment #29 of #30 and I actually saw my RO before that treatment, which is unusual, but I had to wait for a free machine anyway so that was suggested. She looked at my new open wound under my arm...and I could tell she was really debating if I should take a break. She checked the lines to see what the current treatment would be in terms of affecting that new area, and she saw it might be right at the edge. However she said she could tell I was just anxious to be DONE so she would let me finish my last two treatments. She suggested writing a script for more pain meds...but I declined for now. Even though, as I said above, my pain is a TEN easily at times, that's still rare and I get through it. It frustrates my DH to no end to see how miserable I am and yet I refuse to just stay home and rest. Once I am up and get things treated for the day I am fine, so no need to give up on life right now. He thinks I'm crazy to not take more pain meds and/or stay home. Oh well. In any event, was able to move my appointment for today up to 6:30am from 7am and so as of TODAY I am DONE with RADIATION!!! #30 is in the books, I got my certificate and rang the bell to a bit of fanfare surrounded by many of my great nursing team. It was very nice. From here on out, it's all about healing and getting back to somewhat of a normal life as much as possible. I already have THREE follow-up appointments scheduled for next week: my primary oncologist, my RO (to do a checkup on my healing skin) and my surgeon from my lumpectomy in May. Hang in there ladies and enjoy Thanksgiving for all who celebrate!   ",

I watched my mom go five years clear...and then WHAM! Another cancer! So of course I can't help but think about that. So glad you could remove those clear markers. I'm well aware that this treatment breast will never be the same, and this week I'm questioning if I shouldn't have just had it removed! Also love that you had some cat time. I love mine...all FOUR of them...all different colors but we have one all black one. ********** Ok so today is treatment #25 of 30, and the last FULL breast treatment. I am just focusing on this getting close to the end because right now...the pain is getting bad. I have an area under my breast which is raw with peeled away skin. I'm not sure what to do about that yet, as my RO left early yesterday so I couldn't see her as planned. ANYBODY had to treat raw, peeled skin because I tried some cortizone gel after reading about that online yesterday, dabbed a little bit in that are this morning and HOLY COW that HURT so I had to stop. I will ask today for SURE. Sleeping is painful, as anytime I try to roll over it feels like hundreds of needles poking my skin because I'm not a small breasted person so there is so much moving each time. As I said above, I really question my decision to radiate over just removing it completely. Of course, who knows if down the road I won't be removing it anyway. Sorry I have a hard time thinking positively about all of this but I do my best to put on a brave face in real life. Best of luck to everybody still going through this.",
