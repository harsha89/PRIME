This is a pretty sad note -- I am glad to hear there are more women like me with breast cancer that has recurred.  I say I am glad because I was feeling so alone.  I know so many terrific, brave women who have been treated for breast cancer once with no recurrence.  I am very happy for them but I think I am different in that my cancer recurred and was found in my liver, dispersed throughout my bones and in one lung.  I was first diagnosed in May 2002 and was told that the cancer would not likely recur.  In May of 2006 it did recur.  I received Taxoterre for six months and stayed with the Xeloda for about 18 months.  Since I discontinued the taxoterre, my tumor markers have continued to climb.  My scans look great and show that the cancer is stabilized.  I saw my oncologist last Friday and he is concerned that there is cellular activity and wants to start me back on treatment before any symptoms occur.  Sounds like a good plan.  I will be going on Abraxane.  Does anyone have any experience with this drug?  Also, I am feeling anxious again and think it may be because I am confronting my disease again.  I enjoyed a chemo break for a while and felt terrific.  I welcome responses particularly tips on handling the emotional side of all of this.  Here's wishing you good health.    Log in to post a reply",
