And thanks for the description of the back pain. It's not constant, and more of a deep throbbing underneath my shoulder blade. Much like a pulled muscle, but intermittent for months. The gyno called me back just now, and I was pleasantly surprised to hear the response was \"Could be nothing, but we don't mess around with breast issues. Come in tomorrow morning.\" Thanks again, I really appreciate you!",

The finding of the fiberous tissue was at the same appt when I got the Mirena inserted, so it wasn't the cause. But I don't think the extra hormones helped anything, and it caused other side effects that were difficult to deal with (ocular migraines = terrifying). ",

      "Content": "WorriedOne wrote: Hello all! First off, this is a wonderful resource. I've learned so much from you guys while perusing these message boards. On to my issue: I'm 36, 2 kids, no family history of bc. In October of 2013, my midwife found a thickening on my breast. Due to the fact I was breastfeeding my child, she scheduled me for an U/S, which came back negative. During that appt with her, I had a Mirena IUD inserted. Mirena immediately started causing weird symptoms (migraines, eye problems), I was told to let my body adjust. One symptom I was having was bad upper back pain directly behind the area of concern. Although I don't know that it was related to the IUD, it seemed like I should go ahead and get it removed; I've always been hormone-sensitive (Dr had assured me mirena was low-dose). During this time, my GP ordered a baseline Mammo, which came back clear, though the tech noted lumpy breast tissue in the same spot as the other lump. I was told I have dense tissue. GP dismissed the back pain as \"pulled muscles\". I mentioned I'd read upper back pain could be a sign of cancer, and she didn't take that seriously at all. Back pain continued, I had Mirena removed Feb. 1. Period returned yesterday, and last night I woke up in pain in the same spot where the original thickening of tissue was (the thickening never subsided, and now seems worse). Today it's painful to the touch, to the point I can't even think of working out or putting on a tight bra. I have a call in to my gyno, and I expect her to tell me it's related to period hormones. That might be, but why there, why now? I've never had anything like this before, and the back pain is concerning to me (but seemingly not to my Drs). How pushy should I be about this? Is this a \"wait and see\" kind of thing or a \"demand testing\" kind of thing? Thank you for any advice. Sorry for the novel. Log in to post a reply",
