If the cells are not cancer then will they eventually turn into cancer with time? 2) Family doctor says the general surgeon will cut the area and do more analysis to determine if the atypitcal cells are cancer, should we request a breast surgeon or at this stage a general surgeon is fine? 3) If the surgeon performed the surgery and does more analysis and confirms that she has breast cancer, will she get further surgery or she will go directly to radiotherapy/chemotherapy? The reason I am asking is if this is an one time surgery then maybe a breast specific is better option? 4) Anyone had Dr. Neil Woolfson as the surgeon in Mississauga's Credit Valley Hospital? Is he good? Thanks a lot! Log in to post a reply",
