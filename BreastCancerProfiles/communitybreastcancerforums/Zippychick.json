My feet are so calloused and thick skinned that I believe my slight pain comes from the pressure of being on my feet.  I think if we walked around on our hands we would experience this same sensation.  In other words I think there are two different types of pain associated with the hand/foot syndrome. zippychick ",

I am on my first cycle of xeloda, in fact this is my first week off.  I take 4-500 mg in the am and 4-500 mg in the pm, two weeks on and one week off. This is the maximum dosage for my height and weight.  The only changes that I have noticed so far is a slight pinkness on my feet and hands and a slight tenderness when I walk around in my sockfeet.  So I make it a point to wear my cushy house slippers. I have been using the udderly smooth cream from the get go, as my skin is very dry from my previous chemo Taxol/Gemzar. I can't do socks at night because my feet get hot and I understand that we don't want heat on our hands and feet.  I also take Vitamin B6 (150 mg daily).  I make it a point to have 12 hours pass before my evening dose. This is sometimes hard to do, but I was told by other xelodians that this seems to decrease side effects.  I'm holding my breath to see what is going to happen after several cycles, but I understand that when side effects begin to worsen that your Onc. can lower your dosage and the xeloda can be just as effective. Good luck on this drug.  I have heard of many women having years on this drug and even obtaining the status of NED or stable.",

My feet are red and hot but no peeling or cracking yet.  My hands are just slightly red and it seems to come and go with my hands.  I seldom hear of people being on as high of a dosage as we are but I am hoping that my Oncologist is just using it as a starting dose and that he will decrease the dosage when/if I get too uncomfortable. Let me know how it continues for you. zip ",
