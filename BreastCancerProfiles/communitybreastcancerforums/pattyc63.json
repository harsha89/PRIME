He did. That was about all the good stuff I had for yesterday except for being on the road to knowing! As for the wine, it is a no no for me as I have been on Methotrexate pills for a couple months now due to my myositis.  I am feeling better today as I read more and see that it does look like cancer. I too can deal with this. It is not what I wanted but if it is, it is and I have to move forward on this ride and just get rid of it.. I am ready to face what ever this turns out to be head on. And IF its not cancer, then I have gotten a new respect for all the wonderful people here dealing with it and living with it and fighting it! I strive to be as strong as you all seem to be. I will survive no matter what this is. I just want to get past this stage of the unknown and on the page of knowing and doing something about it. Hugs and prayers for each of you. Patty P.S. Annie, I have been following your journey and I keep you in my prayers that you get good news as soon as you get home.",

My grand was placed with me when she was just 4 months old so she is mine very much so. Such a wonderful blessing I have. I have myositis and scleroderma so the worry about cancer now is getting to be a bit overwhelming for me and my family. about 6 months ago I found a lump under my right arm and when I had my mammo, Doc didn't think it was anything to worry about but did spot something in my left breast that I needed to go back for another mammo/us in 6 months. Well I went back and nothing in left but he did say in his report something to the fact of get it checked by Dr and have it removed. Long story short I had it removed today. My surgeon said afterwards that it was nodes the size of kidney beans (or was it Lima beans.... humm guess its all about the same)and that they were matted together. He said he wont know more until the path report comes back in about a week. Has anyone else had anything that sounds like this and if so was it b9 or cancer? I know we are all different but a small heads up would not hurt. I had to wait a week for the surgery and now another week to know if its cancer. All this waiting is crazy.... Thanks for any info anyone can give me on this. Hugs, Patty Challenges are what make life interesting; overcoming them is what makes life meaningful. by Joshua J. Marine Log in to post a reply",

I was told by my surgeon that I was having the same meds to knock me out that I had today but after the knock out doc checked out my lump, he said thinks I will have to  go under general because of the size. I was 99% ok about this thinking no way is it cancer but now I am getting more worried. Does the size of the lump of the nodes matter when it comes to BC? Today the doc said its about the size of a quarter. Maybe I am just getting worried nothing because surgery date is in less then 2 days. Any insight will be more then welcomed!!

Last week I noticed I was a bit tender under my arm again and there it was, another lump. A bit of history about me. I have Dermatomyositis and Scleroderma. The DM puts me at a higher risk for cancer so even though the last lump was B9, I cant help but worry again. I mean how lucky can one person get when it comes to this? I had a skin biopsy about 12 days ago to check my DM and when I went in today to get my stitch removed and get results of that biopsy, I showed my Dr the lump. He looked concerned and agreed that with my health issues I needed to have this new lump removed. He is going to be away for the next 2 weeks so I do not have surgery until the 6th of next month. ughhhhhhhhh another long wait!! I know I will get through this waiting period but the wait makes ones mind go to dark places!  thanks for letting me post yet again!  Hugs, Patty Challenges are what make life interesting; overcoming them is what makes life meaningful. by Joshua J.

As far as the type of cancer I am at risk for it is many.this is taken from TMA ( The Myositis Association):\" More data are still required to determine individual cancer risks, although it appears that ovarian and lung cancer are associated with dermatomyositis while lung cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are associated with polymyositis. There is evidence that amyopathic dermatomyositis (DM without the muscle symptoms) also entails a higher-than-normal cancer risk.\" I have also read on that site that breast cancer is in the list of cancers for DM but because I am looking for it, I can not find it, go figure huh. I will look again and see where it said that because that is what is causing many of my fears! Hugs, Patty",

I went for a mamo 6 months ago and and while there I had them check a lump under my arm. Long story short I went back 2 weeks ago for a 6 month followup. There is something about my under nodes that when I saw my rhumey Tuesday, he suggested that I get them removed. I saw my surgen today and he also said they should come out so I am going in the 14th. My question is can you have cancer just in the nodes under your arm? Also because of my myositis I have to get lots of blood work every month and I am a very hard draw. The best spot is on the same side I am having surgery on. I have already had a nurse ask me if my Dr would suggest I get a port..... thats how hard I am. 45 minutes for my last IV to get in and it was done by a person that gets called for hard sticks. I have read that after this type of surgery that you should not  get blood work done on that side or have your BP done, things like that.  Is there anything else I need to know? But mostly I want to kow if you can have cancer just there. Thanks in advance for any answers you can give to me. Hugs, Patty P.S. I see in the topic I said lodes instead of nodes.
