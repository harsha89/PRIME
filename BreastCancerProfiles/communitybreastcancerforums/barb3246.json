I am so glad that I took the advice of a lot of ladies on this forum and got my results over the phone instead of waiting for my follow-up appt. with my breast surgeon on the 17th!!  Today is my birthday, and it was the best birthday present I ever got! I am just so relieved, and I want to thank everyone for their kind words and best wishes - you are a great group of women!! The lump in my left breast was a fibroadenoma, and the right was a papilloma (I think he said there were a couple of them), which was causing the discharge that started this whole mess. The radiologist wants me to come back for a follow-up MRI in 3-6 months - is this typical for benign results? He also said that my breast surgeon may want to remove more tissue around the biopsy sites, so I guess I'll find out about that on the 17th. I'm hoping she won't suggest more surgery, but I will do whatever needs to be done. Do surgeons usually remove more tissue around benign tumors? My breast surgeon had told me that her hospital would do a pathology review of the biopsies since they were done at a different hospital. Could the results be read very differently by 2 pathologists? I sure hope not, I don't want any surprises on the 17th....  Barb Barb Log in to post a reply",

I have been seeing her for 10 years since I started high-risk screening at 35. I started getting breast MRIs 2 years ago, and have since had 5 or 6, and a total of 6 B9 biopsies. I have been getting the MRIs, however, at a different hospital, St. Elizabeth's, because at the time I needed my 1st biopsy 2 years ago, Tufts was not equipped to perform MRI-guided biopsies, so I was sent to St. Elizabeth's for them. Since then I have had several MRIs and 2 MRI-guided biopsies at St. E's, all done by the same radiologist, who I really like. She is very personable and reassuring, and has no problem answering my many questions. After my latest biopsy (excisional at Tufts), my breast surgeon suggested that I now get my MRIs at Tufts, since they have hired a new radiologist who specializes in breast MRIs and MRI-guided biopsies. She explained that it would be easier to have all of my films and reports in 1 location, instead of having to have the reports and CDs copied and sent from St. E's to Tufts each time. It would also be easier for her having the radiologist at the same hospital instead of having to talk over the phone. I haven't met this new radiologist, but my BS said that she is very good at what she does, and will explain procedures and answer patient questions. I was somewhat hesitant, especially when she also added that the downside was that there could be some slight variations when using different MRI machines, as well as a different radiologist interpreting the results. The radiologist at St. E's is following some \"enhancements\" in both breasts, and I need to have my next MRI in July. My breast surgeon told me that it was my decision as to where to have it done. I'm not sure if I should stick with the radiologist at St. E's since I like her, she is familiar with my past MRIs, and the machine will be the same. Or should have them done at Tufts where at least all of my reports, films and doctors will be in one place and available to all of my doctor's there, but where some questions may arise due to the change in MRI equipment and radiologist interpretation. What would you ladies do? It is really stressing me out to have to decide, and I want to make the right decision. Barb Log in to post a reply",

I think I'm a little scared that the new machine might make the MRI look different from prior ones, setting me up for yet another biopsy :(    But a second set of eyes can't hurt. Anne - The consistency of having everything at 1 facility is mainly why I am leaning towards that option. Yes, if I choose to have my MRIs at the same hospital as my mammos/breast exams, I will definitely need to have all my prior MRI films sent from the other hospital. I assume CD copies of the films are adequate? Barbe1958 - You are definitely right about the mental anguish. Sometimes I felt like I was having a nervous breakdown, and I feel like I've aged 10 years in the past 2 years. Stress will definitely take a toll. I swear I have post traumatic stress disorder from all of this.  I have considered going to an entirely new facility (such as Mass General) but I am just nervous about starting all over with a new team that is not familiar with my complicated history. Your comment about being screened better.... what would you suggest ? I have never been given an ultrasound (not sure why), but I am currently getting alternating mammos and MRIs, and breast exams. My BS said I could stop the MRIs if I wanted to since I've had so many B9 biopsies, but I think I'd be more nervous doing that, since all of my mammos have never shown anything. Barb",

      "Content": "barb3246 wrote: I had a ultrasound-guided core-needle biopsy last Oct because I had been having a clear spontaneous discharge from my right nipple. The radiologist took several samples and placed a clip in the area. The biopsy came back negative - papilloma with no atypical cells. There was residual enhancement in the area after this biopsy in Oct (birads 3 on post-biopsy MRI), so I had a 3 month followup MRI in January. That MRI just noted the biopsy clip and said that the hematoma at the biopsy site had greatly diminished. This MRI was given a BIRADS rating of 3A, and I was told to come back for another followup MRI in 6 months. I have since been experiencing some occasional clear discharge from that nipple, but much less than before the biopsy. I had the 6-month followup MRI last week, and I just got a call from my breast surgeon. She said that the radiologist is still seeing abnormal enhancement in the area (BIRADS 4), and she now wants to do an MRI-guided biopsy. She said that the area may not have been \"adequately sampled\" during the last biopsy. I am so worried and upset, I can barely function. I'm at work, and I really can't concentrate on anything, and I jump every time the phone rings. I'm very scared that they missed something bad back in Oct. and it has been growing there ever since. What are the chances that the radiologist who did the first biopsy missed an invasive cancer?? Could there possibly be more papillomas growing in the area that were missed and that's whats enhancing? Do I still have an 80% chance of this being benign? My mother passed away from breast cancer, so its very difficult for me to not think the worst.  Any words of advice or reassurance? Barb Log in to post a reply",

I mentioned my anxiety about the wait to the radiologist, but he just said he really couldn't help.  I'm torn though - I want to know as soon as possible if its B9, but if not, maybe its better to hear it from the breast surgeon in person ???  Even in person, I think I would collapse if I got bad news. I really don't think I could deal with it. I'm not a strong person, and I'm a pessimist by nature,so I'm sure I'd just fall apart and not be able to fight this terrible disease or get on with my life without living in constant fear.",

It was over quick though - the whole thing took less than 45 minutes.  I saw the images after they scanned the biopsy cores, and the radiologist thinks he got all the calcifications, so that's good.  After the mammo, he had told me that the calcs were round, but today on the screen they looked very irregular shaped to me, so that has me more worried. He just said we'd have to wait for the pathology to know anything for sure. So now I have to wait until next Tuesday for the results.    I don't know how I'm going to get thru the next 5 days without ending up in a looney bin!!  Time to go rest and start icing down the boob....

The radiologist who did this biopsy told me that she thinks the radiologist who did the first biopsy may have missed most of the area that is enhancing. She said it looks about the same as it did before the biopsy last Oct., and she said that there is always the possibility of \"sampling errors\" with a core biopsy. Has anybody ever experienced this?? Now I am frantic with worry that they missed an invasive cancer back in Oct and it has been growing in there ever since. I'm so scared that I feel sick. How could something like this happen? I followed all of the doctor's recommendations, and now this. I don't know how I will get thru the waiting until I get my results. My husband thinks I'm over-reacting and doesn't seem to want to hear about my fears. Sorry for being a downer, but I feel so terrified and alone right now.",
