I had a lumectomy on March 27th(dirty margins), another lumpectomy on April 24th (dirty margins) and finally I decided on a mastectomy on May 13th.  The best decision that I could have made because I had DCIS throughout my left breast, but now I wonder about my right because I only had a unilateral mast.  I had lymph node involvement so I have to have radiation after I am done healing from this last surgery.",

My surgeon says that I really should not worry about it because she believes that the other lymph nodes that were involved when I was first diagnosed were likely destroyed by the cancer and the chemotherapy and just do not appear to look like lymph nodes anymore.  I was just wondering if anyone has had similar experiences with only one lymph node being found in a complete dissection...Thank you Dx 10/12/2007, IDC, 5cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, 3/4 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

Just stay positive and don't let the maybes get the best of you.",
