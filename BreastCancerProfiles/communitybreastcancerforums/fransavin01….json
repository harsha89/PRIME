At the age of 61- I went in for a routine mammo- I found out that I had DCIS in the 3 different areas of my left breast- so I had a mastectomy- andso far I am okay- having dense breasts only means that you should be alert for lumps and such. I too have dense breasts- and If you go to a top notch breast facility- they will read your mammos with out any problems- sometimes they will ask you to come back for a second= doesn't mean they saw anything but they probably didn't get a good image of your breast  ",

There is an area of concern near the sternal angle- it could be aging process or cancer- so my oncologist order a chest ct scan to make sure. She said she is pretty sure it isn't cancer because I had DCIS and that type of cancer doesn't metacize but she is concerned because I am a high risk patient due to the type of DCIS I had- and she said some times small invasive cells can slipped to the blood stream- I did have a sentinal lymph node tested when I had my mastectomy and it was negative but my surgeon and oncologist says that is only about 95 % sure it didn't spread- do I really need to worry or what Log in to post a reply",

I had to call back to the office to get a copy of the report and asked if it was seen before- my daughter told me to ask. Also I found out that I have an aberrant right subclavian artery -I called my cardiologist and she is seeing me on Tues- it can be very serious problem depending on my symptoms and also is rare- it seems like many people have this and don't know about it until they die from it. It doesn't show up an chest x-ray and not always on the chest ultra sound.",

Make sure you let your doctor know about the rib pain, He may order a bone scan or an xray. You may have bruised your rib. There are many reasons for microcalcifations on your breasts. It could be nothing- just think good thoughts- I just got back my mammo results- very dense right breast and numerous cysts- go back in 6 months for a repeat mammo- this is usually a benign condition but because I already was diagnose with breast cancer and had a mastectomy- my oncologist is more cautious- if I didn't have cancer- then I would not have another mammo for another year.",

I was diagnose with DCIS with my routine mammo 2 years ago- no lump or nothing-I have very dense breasts and doing mammo's aren't that accurate on me. I have lots of cysts- but no cancer in my remaining right breast- I have an mri every year- and a mammo every year- my schedule is a mri in jan and mammo in june- this way my oncologist and breast surgeon can see if there are any changes. 27years ago- when I was 36- my ob found a huge lump on my right breast- he told me it felt like it was a malignant type- sent me to a breast surgeon who performed the breast biopsy- he was stunned it turned out not to be cancer-but very grateful for me. This was all going on in Feb -while we were planning my daughter's bat- mitzvah in April, I have Lupus and Crohns too- I have had these over 32 years",
