I want you to tell me about your side effects from treatment so that we can document in the study how common they are. Also anything that help deal with them. Thanks! Join the HOW study now so that we can start collecting all the standard data to help us figure out whether there are clues as to who will get what side effects as well as what lifestyle things help people. We welcome you to let us know if there are specific areas of metastatic disease that you want us to ask. One of the things I am looking forward to determining is why with the kind of breast cancer some recur and others don't. It could of course be the tumor and things we don't know how to test for but it also could be something about their lifestyle, heredity, exposure to carcinogens etc that we don't know and would all benefit knowing. We need your input and ideas!  We are looking for women with metastatic disease to join the HOW study and also send us the questions they think should be asked regarding the collateral damage of treatment. However the only way we could figure to call out to everyone who has had cancer was to use the survivor word as you can see below. And the new study we are recruiting for in the AOW which is specific for women with metastatic disease also uses that word.

Word of caution-you must stay hydrated while in the sauna or your lymphedema prone areas will start to hurt so stay hydrated and you will be fine. Since starting last Thursday, I have cut back on ibuprofen and pain meds due to this heat therapy, i have also increased my energy level so no more cat naps!  8/8/2011 IDC, 5 cm, Stage 3C, ER+PR+Her- grade 2, 11/19 Pos nodes; 1 Adriamycin-allergic,no more chemo; 32 Rad's; Tamo&Lupron failed, Hyster May 2012, Arimidex june-aug,Sept 2012, small mets L1/L4,May 2013 5mm tumor on left lobe of liver Dx 8/8/2011, IDC, 5cm, Stage IIIC, Grade 2, 11/19 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
