My tumor was around your size as well. I was diagnosed about six months ago, and I'm doing really well - just a bit tired after finishing the radiation, but making plans now for a big party to celebrate the end of my treatment and going off to Europe in a month. I was worried about the whole thing taking a couple of weeks, and my doctor told me that the cancer takes years to grow, so even though we might feel the wait is so frightening and intolerable, it won't affect how you do. And I also felt like the cancer must be everywhere! I noticed every little ache and pain! My surgeon told me that everyone feels that way, but it's just fear. I know it's scary, but really, I bet you will be surprised, like I was, at how far medicine has come and how much they can do for you. I do a lot of things to help my mood as well - I go to yoga a few days a week and I have a great therapist. It might help you to see a therapist, if you haven't thought about that already? Mine is so kind and he was so reassuring when I found out about my cancer. And he knows a lot of people who have been through cancer so he was able to give me the heads up about how different it is now, with all these improved treatments.",
