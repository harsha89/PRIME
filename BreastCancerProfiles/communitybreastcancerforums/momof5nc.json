I couldn't understand why I was so scared. I totally agree with writinghelps, I was very \"tender, emotionally and physically, and so very gun shy at this point\".  The setups for radiation were also surprisingly hard for me, I think that was because the medical professionals I've encountered so far have been very caring and patient (with lots of hugs) where my radiation techs have been very technical and not very nurturing. After my second setup with them, I got to my car and cried for a long time, which was the first time I've really cried during this journey.  I considered changing hospitals but I like the radiation oncologist and her staff at this hospital.  So I'm just going to tough it out, 5 sessions down 16 sessions to go.",

I did mention to my doc how I was having a hard time and she was great and asked if I wanted to talk to the cancer center counselor. I did and they had her come right in. After confiding in her, she helped me with coping strategies.  Truly thanks again :)",
