Remember some of us were talking about how we should be breathing when we get rad, one of us said that she heard that if you have big boobs they can get in the way of rads...Talked to my RO yesterday...Said as far as breathing goes, just breath normally...No deep breaths, or holding breaths...As far as having big boobs in the way of rads, he had no answer to that....Even got to look at my field pics...My rad goes no where near the heart, thank God, and only a very small part of lung, which of course will scar....There is no way to avoid the lung...It all depends upon where the cancer is located in the breast.... I also see some of you talking about creams to use and such, also talking about being moist under the breast...A good solution to that is corn starch...Don't use baby powder, it clumps to much...Corn starch won't...Hope that helps someone, although I think most of us know about using corn starch...Hope all of you are doing well...Take care, and bless you all",

Thanks....Even though I don't write offen, I read your threads and will continue to read them...For all of you fighting this bad weather, I wish you well...I live in Florida now, but I have not forgotten how bad traveling in snow and ice can be, as if you all don't have enough to think about...Hug to all ",

It sounds to spicey and if your mouth hurts forget it...I did try Wendys chili and it tasted pretty normal, why I don't know...Now things like eggs, toast, even butter don't tast good...My last day of Chemo was the day before Thanksgiving,,,I had a lot of company, made a hugh meal as I always do, but when it came time to eat I could not taste a dam thing...It was very hard and frustrating to watch everyone enjoying the meal I made and I couldn't...Of course I didn't make a fuss, just pretented to eat, nobody noticed thank God...I want people to enjoy themselves when they come for dinner...Just take one day at a time like I do and maybe if we are lucky it will all come back...Good luck to you..Let me know how you do...If this note is kind of mispelled just ignore it...another side effect I got from the chemo was watery eyes which makes it hard to write...Stephanie.",

It means a lot that you did...Sorry you had to go through this, and hope you are now doing well...You do sound wonderful...To answer your question about sleeping, fortunatly I sleep well, so no problem there...I forgot to mention that when I first complained about the dizziness the doctor sent me for an MRI of the head, and that came back good...You are right to say to get another pair of eyes sort to speak...I will go to my primary and see what she has to say...Besides, I have not seen her in a very long time and she may have some advice as to what to do...Thanks again and God Bless",
