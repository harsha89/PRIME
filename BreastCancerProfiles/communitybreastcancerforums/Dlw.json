I went to the doctor yesterday for some knee pain, and casually mentioned that I had found a lump in my right breast and needed to go get it checked out. The doctor offered to go ahead and do a clinical exam. When he located the lump that is concerning me, he looked a little worried (which, of course, freaked me out). He placed the lump between two fingers and was trying to move it. It did not move. It is about the size of a pebble, or a bean. He has scheduled a mammogram and ultrasound for Monday, and said that we \"may need to do an MRI\". He was very insistant that I have it looked at as soon as possible. My concern is that cancer runs in my family - My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer when she was 38 (she is doing well and is very healthy! She also beat skin cancer -melanoma- three times), and my maternal grandmother was diagnosed with breast cancer within the past month (she just had a lumpectomy, and her recovery is going well). My maternal grandfather was recently diagnosed with esophagus cancer. The lump in my breast is hard and does not move, but is right near (almost under) my areola. I have never had a mammogram and am very nervous. How long does it take for them to tell you what is going on? Will I know on Monday? Does it hurt? How rare is it for someone my age to get breast cancer? Why would they want to do a mammogram and an ultrasound? I'm sorry for all of the questions, but I am a bit of a nervous wreck. Thank you in advance for any replies and/or advice that you can give me!  (Sorry it's such a long-winded post!) Log in to post a reply",
