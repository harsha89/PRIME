    "Content": "Momtoboys wrote: I had a diagnostic ultrasound and mammogram last Wednesday and was told I needed a biopsy. I just requested my ultrasound report and it\u2019s a Birads 4 - no subgrading like a, b, c. Report says: Serpiginous .9 cm hypoechoic area with a central hyperechoic component in the subareolar region of the left breast demonstrating vascular flow on Doppler examination. My biopsy isn\u2019t for 3 more weeks and I can\u2019t make heads or tails of this. Serpiginous?? I looked it up and it said having a wavy margin. Is that good or bad? The radiologist just told me that bc it had vascularity they recommend a biopsy, but the wait is killing me. If it\u2019s cancerous I\u2019d rather just know now then wait. I get yearly mammograms so I know that if it\u2019s anything they caught it early and it\u2019s small, so I feel \u201cgood\u201d about that. Has anyone had a similar diagnosis? What were your biopsy results? Log in to post a reply",
