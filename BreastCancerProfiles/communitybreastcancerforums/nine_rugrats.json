My hips, my legs, my ribs in my back and now right in the middle of my chest.  Well, i was thinking about what to do and i have some magnesium oil and decided to rub that on before bed.  Cause people use that for arthritis.  When i woke up today the only pain i had was my chest...kinda behind my breast.  But this was the first time i have gotten up and walked normal since the pain started!  So i am gonna try it again tonight. The dr called me in some lortabs so i will pick them up later too.  But right now i am feeling really good :) And 4 kids are at camp all week...my 21 and 16 yr olds are at work so its just me and my baby (who is 5) all week.  It is so nice and peaceful.  i know i may sound bad, but i really really needed the break from kids.  Of course i am spending it cleaning and getting laundry done and i need to build and pen for my billy goats.  But at least it is quiet :) Dx 5/18/2010, IDC, Stage IV, Grade 3, 19/19 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
