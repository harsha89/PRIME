Babette54 - is prone radiation an option?  I think they offer that at my hospital so I'll find out Friday if I qualify.  It's when you lie on your stomach and there's a hole - I guess - in the table for your breast so they zap your breast while the rest of you is safely on the other side of the table.  I've also read that CoQ10 is great to take to help protect the heart during treatments. Oh and next week I'm getting a massage from a woman who specializes in breast cancer massage.  She's written a book about breast care called Phluff the Girls and she developed a cream for radation.  I will buy it next week and start using it in preparation.  Here's the link to it:  http://www.cherylchapman.com/herbal_touch.html  :-) Grace",

Onvacation, I bought an herbal cream from a former oncologist nurse that she developed for radiation.  She said to definitely start using it before treatments.  It contains arnica, calendula, comfrey and a few other herbs but it's all natural. I'm not even asking the rad people about using it.  She said people would come to her with so much side effects and start using the cream and get better and still their docs would tell them to only use X, Y, or Z products.  If it's an all natural product that other women have succesfully used during rads I figure I can't go wrong.",

I told him about using the cold tea bags and he said that was good.  They're especially good tucked into the crease beneath my breast.  He said he had a patient that would use a cabbage leaf.  He said you take the leaf and boil it just briefly until it's not firm anymore and then you cool it off in the fridge.  Then you can use the entire leaf to encompass and soothe the breast.  Sounds like a good idea so I thought I'd pass it along. They said the setup for the boosts would take about 10 minutes and they'd be drawing on me with sharpies again and taking some pictures.  So I guess the setup time varies for everyone depending on I suppose original tumor location, size, etc. Hope everyone's having a radiant day",

Mini, the nurse told me Wednesday that I can expect skin changes to continue for several weeks after treatment is complete.  I hope it clears up for you soon! Babette, I start the boosts on Monday and they told me that it would take 10 minutes to do the setup.  I'll let you know Monday how long it actually takes!  Though I have to say, they have been really amazing.  I never wait for my treatment.  Once I waited 10 minutes and everyone was apologizing.  And even every Wednesday when I see the doctor, I never wait for him either.  They are running like a well-oiled machine!  So glad you will be done before school starts! Julz that's a funny story.  At my hospital, there are no doors - just curtains you pull like in a dressing room so I always half expect someone to walk in on me but it hasn't happened yet.  I hope you start feeling better soon! Happy Friday everyone!",

Does anyone know if you can swim (either lake, pool, or ocean) while gettings rads?  I know you have to keep the area covered and away from the sun but wasn't sure if immersion, esp in chlorine was an issue.  I'll ask the doc tomorrow too. Thanks! Grace",

I was hoping to start on Monday so I could finish the day before I am supposed to go on vacation but that doesn't look like it's going to be possible.  They want me to drive up from the beach (2 hrs away) to finish the last few treatments.  If it's that or cancel the week, then I guess I'll be driving.  You'd think I could just have 28 sessions instead of 30 but 30 is the magic number apparently.

Guess it depends on how flexible the doc is and how important he thinks that number is and when I actually am able to start. Happy 4th to everyone.  I am going to finish reading my cancer books and put together an affirmation that I can say before and after each radiation treatment.  If anyone else is using any affirmations that they want to share, I'd love to hear them!  I also bought Belleruth Naparstek's guided imagery CD for radiation which I have yet to listen to and she may have some good ones on there.

Kara, typically they will give 25 treatments to the breast and then 5 boosts targeted just to the tumor area.  The number of sessions can vary but that's the standard.  I don't know anything about old school or electrons. #9 down, 21 to go.  A little red, a little sore but doc said it looked great, so I guess it's all par for the course.  He suggested advil which I keep forgetting to take.  getting up now to take some . . .

Onvacation and Kjiberty, how was the start of your treatments?! Healing Dreams - yay! I am sure everyone loved the brownies!  I still don't know what I am going to do for my techs.  First I thought it was just 2 but then there have been others when one is on vacation or something.  I still have 3 weeks to figure it out!
