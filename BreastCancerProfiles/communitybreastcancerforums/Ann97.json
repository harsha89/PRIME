I guess as it grows it is deciding to stick straight up. When I run out of the Fiber wax I'm going to try regular hair gel again and see if there is any difference. Thanks, Ruth! Stlcardsfan, I would not mind at all having wavy hair. I would even say I'd be thrilled with wavy hair.

But my brows came back really fast. It is 5 months pfc and I have not had to tweeze/wax the eyebrows and I find that pretty odd, but I don't care. I hated not having eyebrows.

I want them due to the positive margin after surgery.

He showed me a picture of the large area that was radiated and said that they followed the flow of the lymph node and that is why they did so much of my side. I feel much better.

Lady, glad you are feeling back to normal pretty much.  I met with my onc yesterday and took my first tamoxifen today. He did have my blood drawn and there is some kind of test they do on it that has to do with a reocurrence. So even with no scans, they are still really watching us. I think I mentioned that my RO put me on antibiotics and an anti-inflammatory since I was still red after 3 weeks post rads.  Today is my last day on both and it seems to be getting better. Not sure if it is due to the meds or just time. My fingers in the hand on the side of the cancer have been going numb for the past 3 weeks or so. I thought it was a side effect of the chemo but apparently it is from the radiation and something to do with the nerves in my shoulder/neck. It will go away eventually and I said no to any meds since the onc. said that they come with their own set of side effects. It really isn't that bothersome. It normally just bothers me when I'm sleeping and wakes me up a couple of times a night.",

Has your treatment changed your \"normal\" running schedule? The 1/2 marathon I signed up for is about 28 days after my last treatment so other than not being able to really train for it, I might be okay for running without many (hopefully) chemo SE  by then.

Was it just this last week of rads? Sue: I have had 11 of 28 rads. I feel really, really good. I so prefer the rads over the chemo. My skin did start reacting early. I turned pink after day 3. From what I've read, most people turn pink after day 10. My onc prescribed a lotion and since I work from home I go braless and apply lotions every couple of hours. My skin has an odd feel to it right now. A dry skin kind of feel but very odd. So far I'm not more tired than normal. I'm concerned though that I'm going to have skin problems. My rads onc said \"You are going to have a reaction\" and that we may need to stop and take a break at the halfway point. This Fri is the halfway point and I'd like to keep going. Tamoxifen: I too am afraid. Has anyone considered a hysterectomy instead? I did for a little bit and then decided I can't deal with more surgery. I am avoiding reading about the SE of Tamoxifen. I'm going to listen to my onc and then just take it and see what happens and not read. I obsessed over chemo and I don't want to obsess anymore. About the foobs ... I hate, hate, hate, hate mine. I kind of wish I had decided to be breastless. But I guess eventually I'll be happy. I just was not made to be large chested and my PS is stretching me (or has stretched me I guess) to 1 cup size larger than I want to be in the end. They get in my way! By the way though, Lizzy, my onc told me I'll still have mammos because they leave a thin layer of breast tissue behind with the mx. On exercising: I started running about 1 week post my final chemo tx. Man has it been super duper hard! And I hurt so badly afterwards (still do). Amazing what a 3 month break from running will do. But I can run 2.5 miles now. I just go a tiny bit further each time I run. And I tell myself that this is one thing I will NOT let bc take away from me. I WILL get back into shape eventually. It will take a long time but I get stronger each day.",

Yes, I've been drawn on with a sharpie a whole lot, but I did not have to have the tatoos and I prefer to be drawn on than tatoos so I've been okay with the drawing. My PS said I'd see him in January and would have the TE replaced with implants in Feb, but since my skin is looking so good I'm hoping he'll let me have the surgery in Jan. The TE drive me insane and I want them out yesterday. I was inspired by Lisa and had my portraits done. :) She is a local photographer and when I told her what I wanted to do, she did not charge me a dime for the photos. And she even took a bunch of my daughers too!",

My eyelashes thinned, but I did not wear mascara for 3 mos and was happy when chemo was over and I still had enough that with mascara my eyelashes looked nice. About the time my hair started growing in, my eyebrows fell out - around 5 wks pfc. Thankfully they grew back in quickly and they are starting to look a bit out of control now but I'm going to let them be for a bit. In the last couple of weeks I've lost all of my bottom lashes and many of the upper ones. I can see some of them growing back in, but they no longer look so nice. I was reading on the hair thread that some people lost their eyelashes 3 times. Something about how they are synched - normally eyelashes fall out every 28 days, but not all of them at the same time. But ours are doing that and it takes time to get them off this pattern of all falling out at the same time. I had forgotten about this until I was remembering how I lost my eyebrows. I was picking a friend up at the airport around the time they had all fallen out when some guy asked me for my phone number. It was crazy. He could not find someone with hair/eyebrows to ask? I think he was on drugs - seriously, I could hardly understand him when he was asking me all those questions and had to keep asking him to repeat what he had said.",

About Neulasta - My onc will give it to me my last tx. He mentioned that last time. But he did reduce the amount I get since that is what I complain the most about. He reduced it from 6 to 4. So maybe if your onc insists you need the last one, you can suggest reducing the quantity. He did that last time for me and I felt equally bad on Thursday, but the bone aches were over quicker and I was much better on Friday. He told me that if reducing it didn't help, that then he'd say \"Well, you've only got one left\". = I get one this time too. About being fed up and ready for this to be gone from my life. Feeling like you can't go one more day like this - absolutely :( About work - I have to say that my work situation has been phenomenal. I work from home which helps in some ways (I don't have to face my co-workers looking like this), is hard in others (I never close the door and walk out of \"work\"). But my employers have also told me to do whatever I need to do to get well. I took 3.5 weeks of sick leave after surgery and for now I've been taking the day of chemo off and usually one other day that week. Work helps to distract me and gives me something else to think about, people to talk to. But I've also found myself getting really angry at people. I have no patience. I hold it in though and don't let it show. I have my last tx tomorrow. I know I still have a long road ahead of me, but I am extremely anxious to get this part over with. Has anyone been told they've become anemic? My levels dropped to where I was close to needing a transfusion. I'm hoping I can make it through this next time without that happening. My arm is so sore from being poked. I had been eating anything high in iron like crazy, but then the nurse told me that might not even help because the chemo is just too strong.",

We came home and took a dip in the pool and I was extremely silly dancing and singing that song in the pool.  :)  That was a nice day for me.  Weight and exercise:  I know I should have kept exercising during chemo but I did not.  I took that hour as my extra rest time since I've not stopped working and I also have elementary aged children.  3 months of no running.  And now AGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.  It is so hard to start it up again.  But I'm determined to get back to my old self and I will be patient.  I'm able to run 1 mile without stopping now :)  and then I run/walk 2 more.  But the scale is NOT budging.  I'm okay with that for now.  I think my body is nervous since it has been through so much lately and it does not want to let go of any pounds.  I just need the Florida weather to get colder so I can wear sweats all the time since my other clothes DO NOT FIT.  I would like to think it is water, but when you normally run 5 miles a day and stop for 3 months and when you can't eat anything for a week and then allow yourself to eat whatever you want for the next 2 weeks ... well, it has to be more than just water. I'm officially a radical now.  Treatment #1 of #28 today.  It was really fast and uneventful.  My tissue expanders feel tight today but I think that is just psychological.  The rads don't go near my left foob and it is feeling just as tight as the right.  I absolutely hate the TE.  Had a dream last night that I had the plastic surgery done and was feeling so good to not have TE anymore.  Good wishes to all of you with a treatment this week.  And feeling better wishes for all of you with SE right now.",

Advice that's been given to me is to get it out asap (which my surgeon does not seem to believe is necessary, he seems very laid back). Other advice has been to get a 2nd opinion.  But that contradicts the other advice to get it out asap because it would prolong the process. Someone told my husband that she had a friend who got a 2nd opinion and found out she did not have BC after all.  How does that happen?  It can not be something that happens often.  Is that from a 2nd biopsy?  I really do not want to go backwards and do that over again at this point. I am also looking for advice on another topic.  I have 2 daughters, ages 7 and 9.  I was supposed to become a girl scout leader for the 7 year old's troop.  I'm thinking that maybe it would not be a good idea now.  But I also have mommy guilt about not following thru when she is so excited that I'm doing that for her.  I appreciate your advice.

JSW: I'm sorry to hear about the hair. L Texas: Yay for no more chemo! I'll explain a little about why I have this feeling that maybe they didn't get all the cancer. I feel like the chemo did its job. I feel good about that. But with my bmx, they did not get clean margins, hence the 25 days of radiation. They only radiated an oval shape and not the whole breast. I can remember where the tumor was. I can put my finger there and it was within the oval shape that was radiated. But after I was done, I started to think. My RO held up an image of my MRI when he marked me. But with my surgery, with the nipple removed and the skin stretched to sew it up, and then the TE in there and all the fills, I am not confident that the spot was hit with radiation. Who knows where that spot ended up after surgery and fills. I won't go into the details about why they did not radiate the whole breast - I'm not even sure I completely understand why, but I do remember the RO saying he prefers to do the whole breast. I will ask him about this when I see him next, but I have a feeling he is going to tell me that he is not certain we got the spot either. And according to my onc, there is reduced blood flow to the area after a mx so they cannot count on chemo getting anything that may have been left behind after surgery.",

My oncologist didn't mention that I needed any scans. I did have the Pet scan before surgery. I love the virtual New Years Eve party idea :) I'll be done with chemo by then and hopefully also radiation. It depends on if there is a wait period between the two. Focusing on a completion date helps me. As soon as I got the start date I got out the calendar to have an idea of when all will be over. Calamtykel, I know what you mean about the \"what the heck am I doing here\" moments. Sometimes I think I'm still in denial. I went wig shopping today with a friend, my Mom, and my two daughters. I let my daughters, 7 and 9, choose, although they liked the one I liked best also. It is important to them that I look as much like myself as possible. I think I'll end up wearing a hat or scarf more often than the wig. I work from home and am planning on working through treatment. I'm a little nervous about that, but I do have quite a bit of sick leave accumulated so I can take the days as I need them. I start back at work on the 16th (my birthday), one week and one day before I start on chemo. Janice",
