At our initial meeting, he was talking about surgery first and then for some reason at our last meeting, he suggested chemo first. I asked why and he said it might then be possible to have a lumpectomy. I did say that I didn\u2019t care, that I wanted a mastectomy and wanted to go ahead, but he set up an appointment with the oncologist anyway. I\u2019m just keeping my fingers crossed that he says I can go ahead with surgery. The size of this thing is really scaring me and I think I\u2019ll feel better once it\u2019s out, even if I have to do chemo afterwards",

I have felt like all of this stuff is happening to me with me having no contro, and as much as I trust my surgeon and oncologist, I did feel at my appointment two weeks ago that my surgeon was not really hearing me. Anyway, I was unequivocal about my preference yesterday and my surgery is happening May 2. I feel so relieved that all the tests are done and that this thing willl be out soon.",

      "Content": "Apr 15, 2019 09:26PM - edited Apr 15, 2019 09:32PM by Mumoftwo416 So glad I found this forum. I had what I thought was a 5cm tumor. The surgeon freaked me out at my consult about the possibility of it having spread given the size. Just got the results of the bone scan and CT scan. All clear. I had an MRI done which puts the tumor size at 7.2cm. I had psyched myself up for surgery, but now it looks like I might have to have chemo first to shrink the tumor. I don't know why, but this has totally freaked me out. For those of you who had large tumors, did you have to have chemo first?",

The look on her face when she felt it was very alarming. I went in for a mammogram and ultrasound the next day (she said to call her if I couldn\u2019t get an appointment the next day). The radiologist said she was \u201cvery worried\u201d and said I would get a call from the breast clinic for a biopsy. So now I\u2019m waiting and terrified. Everything I\u2019ve read suggests that the bigger the lump the wore the prognosis and mine is 5cm. The radiologist and technician asked when I first noticed it and now I\u2019m beating myself up for not having noticed it earlier. So grateful to have found this forum.
