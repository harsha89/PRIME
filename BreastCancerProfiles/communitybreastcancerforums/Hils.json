I was originally diagnosed with DCIS but they always were suspicious that some IDC was hiding in amongst it. Following a lumpectomy and SNB they found the margins were not clear, it was decided a MRI should be done. The MRI showed a larger lump than the previous of 6cm of DCIS plus a small IDC tumor. A UMX was scheduled and the 6x3mm of IDC was found. Hence I went from stage 0 to stage 1. It was agreed that no additional treatment was required even though I was 90%+ ER/PR+. So I am currently undergoing reconstruction of my new bionic boob. As for tests, no additional tests will be carried out for me. I will have a mamogram once a year and will be seen by the Breast Clinic at the same time. After five years if nothing untowards happens I will be removed from their books and will have a mamogram as dictated by the breast screening programme which will be once every two years.",

It is great to have a place to be able to just hang out, vent occasionally and share our thoughts and feelings. Following the last eight months of nuttiness I found I was beginning to lose the plot and depression was knocking on my door. I could have gone down the tablet route but decided instead to get some counselling. This is really beginning to sort my head out, so that is real bonus. This is a strange old roller coaster ride, will be very happy to get off",
