The bruise was breaking up but now is coming back and it's stinging and uncomfortable. There is a bit of skin breakdown near the incision. I know I should just call the doc but I feel like maybe I'm over-reacting. I just thought this was going to be less of an ordeal overall. I'm a mover, I love to work, clean, go to the gym, run around with my kids, I feel like a slug. I can't move that much or it seems to get worse. I think these new issues might have been from sweeping/mopping but it's been a week! Anyone else experience this? I feel horrible complaining because I was very lucky to have my tumor come back benign, and I know this could be so much worse. I just didn't think over a week out I'd still be so out of commission. It's also hard to imagine that this scar will be little, it's huge to me. Again, I apologize for complaining.",

I'm contemplating returning but I have the feeling it just needs to heal more. Mine is sore, bruised lightly, and uncomfortable. I only take my sports bra off to shower quickly then put it back on or else it hurts more.",
