I am a little nervous for the needle core tomorrow but I mostly just want this thing out of me. The waiting for the biopsy has driven me crazy so I can only imagine what it will be like waiting for the path to come in.",

      "Content": "STP127 wrote: Hi, About two weeks ago my left breast felt very sore and I couldn't figure out what was wrong. Finally last Thursday I found a moveable oval lump in my left breast. I have a family history of breast cancer with my mother dying of breast cancer in 2006 at 47 and a paternal grandmother beating it about 30 years ago. I made a gyn appointment for last Tuesday and the doctor said he was 99.99% sure it was a cyst but sent me to get an ultrasound to be sure especially because I am only 26. I was able to get an appointment in between work on Tuesday and after what felt like an eternity with the tech the radiologist came in to chat with me. He told me it seemed benign but they needed to do a biopsy because \"there is definitely something there.\" I spoke to my gyn yesterday after he received the ultrasound results and he still believes it is a cyst and it is under 2cm. He reassured me everything would be ok and not to worry but I am still extremely nervous. I am fine with the biopsy process (needle core) but I know how bad cancer can be and I am absolutely terrified. Everyone keeps telling me I am young and I will be fine but I know that's not necessarily true. Log in to post a reply",
