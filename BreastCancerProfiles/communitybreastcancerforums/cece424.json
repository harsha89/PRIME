I'm still at the stage...what do I do next based on additional tests. I dont know how to verbalize my fears or concerns but I would like to know anyone's feelings about radiation versus mastectomy. If you had one and wished you had the other? Is the recovery for one a little easier? I'm just throwing out questions that come to mind. I would appreciate ANY input you can give me. I have read the \"official\" information, I would like to hear from real women who have been impacted by this... Log in to post a reply",
