Good to let it out. I was so bugged out but then started reading these postings and became brave enough to post some of my feelings. Things really go better after that. So from one sister to another - find a group and let it hang out.",

Called back for additional mammogram with small paddle. Ended up having a stereotatic while still having everyone tell me it was just a precaution and I only had calcium deposits. Got the call Friday that it was DCIS 0 breast cancer. I don't care what they say, you fall apart. Had a lumpectomy with 3 ccm removed and 3 weeks off from work. The margins were clear (got that report on Valentines Day) and then 30 radiation treatments. It was estrogen positive breast cancer so off everything with estrogen in it, even soy. Refused the tomoxifin. The biggest thing was the fatigue during radiation. Also, try not to get exposed to illness (like we can do that) as it seems to hit harder when you are down. My last radiation was April 16th and I had a sinus infection that did not want to leave. But right now I am having a hard time trying to figure out where I fit in. Although it was breast cancer, it was 0 and when you read other blogs you feel ashamed, blessed, weird about all of it. My dr says I don't fit in with the support groups at the hospital because of the type of cancer that I had. Is anyone else having those feeling?",

I will and do talk to anyone about this experience to encourage others to get their checkups. The only way mine was found was through a mammogram and a very astute radiologist who insisted I have it checked out. The facility where I had everything done plus the staff were and are great. They really supported me (except for the security guard who did not think I should be allowed to park in the cancer parking spots). There are lots of funny stories about things that happened to me but also the fustration from co-workers who don't understand why you are not at work or can only work an 8 hour day instead of overtime. In my case I just don't look sick or like the typical person with breast cancer, except during the radiation when the fatigue was terrible and I had these great black bags under my eyes. But, yes, I am a survivor and talking to you guys will help. Thanks and have a great week.",

Hopefully it will continue to improve and breast cancer will be caught at DCIS stage 0 for all. I remember telling the doctor that it couldn't be breast cancer, I was going to get colin cancer (due to family history). He replyed \"Not up there!\" These postings have really helped me so thanks to all. Wish I had found this one earlier. But I have great support with family and friends and a husband that is constantly a surprise to me since this all started. So that is a great positive.",
