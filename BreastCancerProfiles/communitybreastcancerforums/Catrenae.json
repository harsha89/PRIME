My Dr. told me to get over the counter \"lotrimin\" cream, or the generic, and use Gold Bond powder. It cleared up in a matter of days.... I love everyone's description of their wig and the references to dead aninmals... I actually did buy a week after TX#3 but have yet to wear it.

I bought false eyelashes online, but didnt get the glue to go with them, so I haven't tried them yet. I'll get some this weekend. To be honest, I think losing my eyelashes was almost as bad as losing my hair. I guess because I always notice people's eyes, I think everyone is zeroing in on the \"thin brows, no eye-lash\" lady! I bought a nice wig after tx #3 and have yet to wear it. It's cute, but I just can't bring myself to wear it. I guess for me its easier to wear the berets, scarves, caps etc. I feel so phony in the wig if that makes sense? (At least with the head covers everyone knows I don't have any hair.) I don't know maybe I'll try it this weekend. Is it better to wear in front of strangers at first or would it be better in front of you friends? I'm with you on the smell issue.

My taste buds haven't changed too terribly, at least not where \"tastes\" are concerned. I'm still able to drink pretty much anything. (non-alchoholic) Tea and cranberry-grape juice have worked well for me, along with chocolate milk! For me, it's been more of a \"texture\" thing. I went to a Christmas party this weekend and stuff I normally love tasted like \"mush\" or \"gritty.\" (Mini quiches and crab cakes were awful...didn't even touch the stuffed mushrooms. My friends have used the same caterers for years, so I know it had to be me!) As for other SEs, I had been feeling great since Wednesday, but Saturday afternoon started feeling \"blah\" and tired again. Now, I'm starting to get light headed at times. I got extremely dizzy almost everytime I stood up yesterday. Anyone else with that happening?  Oh and I agree about my hair feeling like \"straw.\" Normally my hair is baby fine and very soft, but lately it feels coarse and is not \"acting right.\" (Sticks up where it didn't before, etc.... ) Today is day 11 so I guess by Thursday the hair should be going, going, gone... I hope everyone had as enjoyable a Monday as possible. Cat",

I've been reading all the posts and I see that a lot of us are experiencing some really bad side effects. I hope that it all will end soon. I've been doing ok for the most part, mainly just feeling really tired and dizzy.  Except now I've developed some type of lovely rash under my left boob. I've had it for about a week and it seems to be getting worse rather than better. I've been using Caladryl on it and it seems to help, but it hasn't gone away yet. Also my forehead, face and neck have been really itchy and I'm breaking out... wondering if it has something to do with the caps/do-rags I've been wearing? I have my 3rd round of chemo tomorrow and will see my Doc. so hopefully will get some answers.  Oh on a completely different note. We woke up this morning to no water. We did have a light freeze last night but it shouldn't have been enough to freeze up our well. (We live in the country and have our own well.) Hopefully it'll be something relatively simple/minor and not that the pump/motor went out. It's not like we don't have enough to deal with as it is! Wishing everyone a happy and WARM Wednesday. Cat",

At least we have each other to complain, whine, moan and groan to and we all know exactly what the other one means! Although all my friends/coworkers are very supportive, I know they don't really \"get it\" when I try to tell them how nothing tastes the same and my scalp in on FIRE! This is completely off topic but I have a question. I should be through with chemo at the end of April, then I will have my surgery - a double mast. How long should I expect to be off work? (assuming everything goes \"normally\")  I work in an office, so no strenuous lifting or physical labor would be required. Also, my mom will be staying with me after the surgery. Do you think I'll need her more than a week? I know these questions are a little premature but I'm just trying to calculate my sick time versus how much vacation time I will need to take. I'd love to have enough time at the end of 09 to take a VACATION!  Thanks, Cat  ",
