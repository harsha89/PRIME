I went because of a concern of a lump on my left breast but to my surprise they found a mass on my right breast. I am told it is about an inch long and it is solid. When I was in the dressing room I could hear the technician speaking with the doctor about me, all I could really hear him say it \"That's not good, that's not good\" so the technician came back and took me for a few more mammogram screenings and went back to the doctor where I could still hear him, \"That's really bad\" so just that alone set my stress level high. They took me back to do the breast ultrasound and the technician said she had to go get the doctor, he came in and did further ultrasounds on my right breast. He showed me what the concern was and suggested an immediate core biopsy. I agreed that I would wait and get it done right away, while I was waiting I met with a patient advocate so I knew things were slightly serious with how everything was moving so fast. The doctor came back in and explained the procedure to me. I asked him if it would be painful and he said that it shouldn't be and that he would administer local anesthesia which he did. I understand that there are different ways to do this, I was on my back with a wedge under my right shoulder and he used the ultra sound for guidance. He made a small incision and inserted the needle, he told me I would hear a loud clicking sound when he was taking the sample. Well when he clicked it the first time it was the worst possible pain I had ever had in my life, I do have a high tolerance for pain but this was so intense. I instantly was crying and let out a small scream. He gave me some more local anesthesia and took a second sample, again it was the most intense pain I had ever had. The doctor was apologizing the entire time and I was telling him to please just finish and I would be as brave as possible. On the third sample he just took it without giving me any warning, I think he thought I would do better but it was just as bad. He then told me he had just one more to go, again he didn't tell me before he did it. The fourth one, the last one didn't hurt one bit, not at all!!! He told me mine most likely hurt because it was so deep in the breast, (I am big breasted) and that it was completely solid, he also said that the first three most likely hurt because he took it from the center of the mass and the last one he took from the edge. If I ever have to do that again, I will take some support with me and I will see if there is any thing else they can give me for the pain. I had never heard of a biopsy being so painful and I wasn't expecting it. The doctor also told me it didn't help that everything happened so fast, all I expected was a routine mammogram. Right now I am taking Tylenol for the pain and I have an ice pack on. I had a very hard time driving home, my car is a standard car. As I said, I have a high tolerance for pain, I have had three completely natural child births and was in a car accident resulting in a broken arm, none of that compares to what I went though today, I never want to do that again. I wanted to post this because I feel all alone with this (how bad it hurt). Since I came home I had been reading from other sites and the consensus is that it doens't hurt to get a biopsy. I will get my results next Tuesday and I am not scared or nervous at all, my sister was a breast cancer survivor so I am very optimistic that I will be too.  ",
