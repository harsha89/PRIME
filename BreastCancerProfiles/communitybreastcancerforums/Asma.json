She gave me an option of waiting three months and coming back and compare the two results or do biopsy today. I did the biopsy because I couldn't imagine waiting three months. I am still over overly stressed but it has cause a red flag to be raised in my mind. It was small n black. I saw what she was pointing to. I don't feel anything. So I guess I'll be here for two weeks waiting with everyone. I was also disappointed my husband wasn't more concerned. Nor my family. They were just saying....ok let's wait n see. It is all ok I'm sure. So now I feel like why express my worry to them. Log in to post a reply",

I have a 10 month old, 2 yr old ,12 yr and a 20 year old. I'm busy lol That two year old is pure madness with thinking he's my ruler and I'm on earth to see to his every tantrum! lol Thanks a lot for replying. It is thoughtful",
