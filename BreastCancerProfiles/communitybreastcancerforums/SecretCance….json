I am 42 years old, single, no kids.  Both of my older sisters died of the disease, diagnosed at 35 and 37 years old.  My oldest sister had inflammatory, the worst kind, and lived 4 years from diagnosis...died at 42.  My other sister lived 10 years...she died at 45. Both had lymph nodes involved.  As you can imagine, I'm a bundle of nervous.  Two weeks ago, I was stressing about not having a pair of red peep toe pumps..now I spend every waking moment googling \"breast cancer\".  You're not alone.  I will pray for you.",

As soon as she was finished, she put my wig on.  I wore it to work the next day and aside with it feeling a little wierd, I'm ok with it now.  I've accepted that this is something that I must go through and as awful as it is -- it IS temporary. You will be in my thoughts and prayers.  It is amazing how time allows us to accept things and move forward.  When this journey started, I had already made up my mind that I would NEVER do chemo, no matter what the pathology report said after having my lump removed.  I watched both my older sisters live with and die from this disease.  I had every intention of ignoring what my surgeon and oncologist recommended.  I was planning on pretending this wasn't happening....going on with life as usual after the lumpectomy and just taking my chances that my cancer wouldn't come back.  And now here I am, one treatment in and no hair.   I know that I made the right decision to fight this thing - but it's not easy.  I hope that you find comfort in these boards. I know that I do.  If you ever need to talk, just send me a PM.  I wish you the best of luck with treatment #1.  Kim",

The company also sells a product called Li Brow. Anyway...  I just purchased the Jan Marini eyelash product.  Don't know what to expect, but I'll keep you posted about how it performs.  I'm 2 weeks out from last TC.  Eyebrows are thin but there -- same with lashes. ",

Clearly, there are other gene mutations out there that have not been identified.  Since your sister got bc at such an early age, I am inclined to think that it is genetic.   Ki,",
