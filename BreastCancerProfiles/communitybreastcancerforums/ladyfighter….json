But knowing 8 weeks past is not good. If you say it's ok to be late than never then I feel a little better. Yes the mo definitely will have to get me started ASAP after I see him monday! Thank you!

How long is too long ?? Lots of miscommunication at my new oncology office. I finally going to see my oncologist Monday but that is way past 2 months of my lumpectomy surgery. I had all tests done bone scan, X-ray, cat scan, sonograms all cleared, lymph nodes all clear , clear margins too. But that was 2 months ago . What do you think? Sometimes I feel so alone that no one understands because not one person in both side of my mom and dad family have breast cancer. I'm the first one. Thank you for reading .
