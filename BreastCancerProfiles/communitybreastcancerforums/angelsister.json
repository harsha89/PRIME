No one ever referred to my sisters bc as occult but hers was diagnosed from bc cells in her bone marrow biopsy. She'd had mammo and mri and no one could see anything. I read that ILC doesnt always 'set up camp in the breast but marches out single file' which is a scarey thought. I was just wondering if this is how you can get node involvement and not find a primary? I hope you're treatment is underway and that others are along soon who can give you more info. Best wishes x",

She also had an intravenous radiation treatment which was trult terrible in terms of delayed se's.

I dont know what your bone mets are like but hers were spread so that before she ever had any chemo they had to give her blood transfusions and platelets and fluid some times every week. As for beong hard to control? Not necessarily, cyn didn't have a progression for over two years. Hope you get your chemistry sorted out soonand start to feel stronger. Best of wishes x",

And it seems like bone pain is a se of every drug they throw at you. Every ones body responds differently to these drugs and i doubt its to do with age and certainly not about how tough you are. So many times it seemed my sister was getting worse on treatments and then as her body started to recover she would start to feel a bit better and her disease would have slowed or stablised. The only drug she refused was xeloda as she simply couldn't get out of bed when she took that. Yet others find it very doable. I can tell you that when she got pain meds and stomach meds sorted out to help with the se's she managed a lot better. She also had to stop a chemo called gemzar which is supposed to be gentle as her se's were unbearable. Hang in there naniam, and talk to your onc about the se's. Im hoping you get some relief soon.

And i so understand why you say 'we' when you talk about what she and you had to endure. There is truth in the idea that unless you go through it yourself that you don't understand. But i understznd that you were there with her, experienced fear and pain because of wgat was happening. Were there times that you would have done snything to take it off her just for a while if you could? I truly hope that you are zble to find peace and thonk about her with smiles and pride very soon. My cyn i think is at a similar stage. She stayed off her pain meds today so we could talk. She wants us to know that she doesn't feel well enough to do more. She has had very few side effects from the chemo via lumbar puncture. Her head feels better and she was full of chat afterwards maybe because of the steroids. I am so incredibly proud of her and know that things will get tougher but i hope i will be up to the task of staying strong for her. Thanks again for your message. My sincerest best wishes and kindest thoughts. Steph x",

Hospice at home where i live implies nursing care. My recent experience in the states was more like an equipment provision. So that o2 was delivered, drugs by fed ex, equipment like commode etc. But...nursing input consisted of a weekly visit to sort out meds and an emergency contact as you are no longer to call 911 and the offer of care/ aide to help with hygiene twice a week. I was shocked to be told no we can't come and put up iv morphine for instance you have to be inpatient for that. Please just check what is available. Best wishes xx",

      "Content": "Dec 7, 2011 12:08PM angelsister wrote: Yey! That really is good news... It worked that way for my sister as its ONLY chemo that has kept her going for the last 3 years plus. She was diagnosed with bc which presented as a systemic illness. She was tested for malaria (as she'dbeen working in india) and was under the care of a haematologist with hgb of 7 and platelets of 1000. (wbc were normal tho). She was finally sent for bone marrow biopsy as leukemia was suspected. She was sent to her onc who suspected mbc. They reviewed all the mammos and couldnt find a mass but 1 radiologist identified a tiny mark. They couldnt do a biopsy as her platelets were so low. A bone scan showed ' widespread and diffuse' bone mets, no 'hot spots' just what cyn called speckles. So...they started chemo, no surgery - nothing to cut. No rads - nothing to radiate. Her onc told her they would do 6 arimidex (i think) and blood and platelet transfusions until her platelets could stay at 45000 on their own and then they'd add xeloda. I'll never forget the look on her face after 5 cycles and her onc did a little tap dance waving her counts as the blasted platelets had gotten to 27000 with no transfusion. Cyn was able to work in her yard, go to the store, visit friends etc. She was gutted when they said they wanted to do 3 more and add thr xeloda but she felt better than she had in a long time so she persevered. Anyway, she's done 4 other types of chemo since and they are only successful for a limited time for her but the efficacy was always measured in lowered tumour markers, better blood counts, rediced pain and feeling Better. She has had her fair share of side effects but she does not regret the last three years which she has had because of chemo....as no other treatments were indicated. We did our best to get her to eat right but she's pretty stubborn! She did drink a lot of water tho.",
