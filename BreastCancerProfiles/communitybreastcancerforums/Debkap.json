You may have to order on their website but they are incredibly soft and wireless and seem like they would be very comfortable. My PS has not recommended anything but a camisole. Yesterday my swelling and pain really spikef. My daughter pointed out that the pectoral blocks probably wore off. It was day 4 which would be about right. I was also up a lot more and the doctor said the fluids spread differently. So I'm staying up for shorter periods since laying in bed semi upright seems to provide some relief. Still my chest feels like boulders, heavy and hard) , my armpits are so swollen I can't keep my arms at my side comfortably, and just to make this more fun I think I have a yeast infection from the antibiotics. Awesome.",

Even if they just came for 30 min. or an hour, you could have help with dressings/drains and maybe some personal care?",

Feeling positive one minute, and sobbing the next, angry and feeling sorry for myself moments later. Tim trying to allow myself to feel it all and let it ride. Each mood passes, some not quickly enough! I can only offer empathy, as we can all honestly say that we truly understand what we\u2019re all going through. Work, kids, it all helps distract us and I\u2019m thankful for those daily distractions. I am so thankful for all of you posting about your emotional and physical experiences through each step of this. It really helps to hear what you are saying and get firsthand information about what you\u2019re going through now. Everyone I\u2019ve spoken to so far that has been through this has been very helpful, but it\u2019s all history, which is wonderful and gives me hope that for me this will one day be a blurry, bad memory. Your stories are current, and relevant to me today and tomorrow, and specially next Wednesday when it\u2019s my turn. Thank you all for sharing.",

Boogirl, you can do this, we're all here for you. I actually had some great news. Pathology cane back from my BMX and everything is clear! No more surgery, no radiation, no hormones... I'm so relieved. I even got 1 drain out today (1 week out). I did get a little ahead of myself and cut the pain meds too fast. Suffered most of the day until I got ahead of it again but I feel so lucky, and admittedly a little guilty. It seems so unfair that some of us suffer such a long road to recovery while others seen to have such a relatively easy time of it. I mean, none of this is pleasant and the really lucky ones never hear the words cancer in the first place but I do know you are all my heroes. I can't believe how strong and honest and real this group of women who share this horrible thing is. I looked at my chest today for the first time. I didn't feel lucky or brave or thankful. I felt horrified and angry and sad. I'm having reconstruction and of course it will get better but I've spent some \"quality\" time wallowing in self pity. But tonight I opened this conversation between us November ladies and I felt less alone, less angry and in awe of the strength I hear in your words Thank you everyone. ",

I'm nauseous from meds, I hurt, I'm so tired and frustrated. After getting my PS on the phone today his nurse told me exactly what to do, cashed in refills as necessary, and we're basically starting over with meds trying to get the pain under control (with some phenergan fur nausea). I hope this works. I'm 10 days out and feel like I've lost precious healing time by not getting good instructions and probably taking too long to muddle through on my own. My sister leaves Saturday and I'm nervous that I still need so much help and won't have it.",

I\u2019m scared of regretting my decision to do the BMX, but more scared of the future possibilities if I don\u2019t. My latest freak out is the loss of my nipples. I never really thought about how important they are visually. I know reconstruction can include some nipple options but that seems like so far out from next week. Trying to take this a step at a time and not worry so much but it seems like I\u2019m more emotional and scared of the mental adjustment than the physical. Maybe I\u2019m just displacing my fears, but I\u2019m not particularly scared of the surgery itself or the pain/discomfort. However I\u2019m increasingly terrified of how I will feel afterwards about the loss of my Breasts, including the nipples. I\u2019m committed to my decision, but nervous nonetheless.",
