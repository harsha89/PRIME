    "Content": "blorene wrote: I had stage 1 aggressive breast cancer in 2009. I had a lumpectomy and had mama site radiation. In Sept. 2009 I started taking Anastosol because I am post menepausal. I have taken this medicine for 3 and 1/2 years. For the last year I have been having joint pain, mostly in the wrists. Also stiff body and am on depression medicine. All of this has been since taking this medicine. Does anyone know what the side effects will be if I quit taking this medicine? I am suppose to take it for 5 years. Any help would be appreciated.
