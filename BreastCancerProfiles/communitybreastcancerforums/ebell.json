As well as being a little beam of light for her. @CLC, my mom also has a very conscious diet and will need help with food on the hospital and on the go.  That is something she will definitely appreciate having. @peggy_i, Helping with cleaning- its little things like this I wouldn't have thought of right away. @mgd, the button down pajamas & shirts are wonderful idea. Alos, prepared family foods are an important, even if she isn't hungry. @Elizabeth 1889,  we are making sure someone is with her at every appointment. Although I want to be there for every visit, she has a sister & a close friend as well as her husband who are accompanying her.  I am trying not to be too pushy,  but still want to help her think of questions she has for the doctors about the proceedures and what to anticipate as well as thoughts like are we covering all the bases?  Should she be seeing an oncologist as well as her surgen now? Does that come after? My older sister who does not live close is not  sharing any emotion with me right now. I was hoping to cry over the phone and be that support for eachother but I am only receiving anxiousness and a very business-like response to my moms diagnosis.  I know she feels bad about being far away, and she wants me to follow through with questions and resposnibility.  I just really hoped we would be eachothers emotional support.  Does anyone have a list of questions they wished they had discussed with their doctors before treatment began? Things you had to discover the hard way that you wished you were prepared for? Questions you have now that you're in the midst of or done with treatment? Thank you again for your time & posotive reinforcement.  I heard a great quote the other day: Women are like tea, you don't know their strength until they're in hot water. Thank you for being here for me & for my mom. Peace, erin",
