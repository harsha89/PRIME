Absolutely the pet(s) can stay ... all their fur and stuff - your body is used to it. I live alone and had no choice but to deal with the litter box. As folks have said - a mask helps and wash your hands, wash your hands, wash your hands. My oncologist had absolutely no issue with my 2 cats ... they are good buddies and were a constant in my crazy world of appointments, meds and feeling tired. In fact, I think they enjoyed their \"mom\" being home with them more often !! They got extra spoiled and loved it !! They also seemed to know when I needed them to be more lovey ... animals have an amazing ability to know when their humans need some attention. so - grab their ball ... keep their treats stocked ... absolutely, the furry people stay !!!

I too am on Warfrin (Cummadin) ... blood tests to check my INR twice per week while I continue chemo. It's a real pain and my veins look like a bad drug user - especially since they can only use my one arm. Yes, my oncologist has said that the Warfrin will be a reality for at LEAST the six month period and over the coming year she will attempt to get it gone ... but ... the clot is a reality and cannot monkey with it. At the end of my chemo (luckily, this month) she will try to get the blood tests down to weekly and then increase the timeframe as long as the INR is okay. And yes - I do bruise more easily and chemo has destroyed those lovely nose hairs so, nose bleeds are also something you'll need to watch if you're doing chemo. She explained that blood clots do not reabsorb or go away ... they can become smaller should small bits break away but to think of it as a sponge that we are trying to put pencil holes into. We want the pencil holes because then the blood flows easily and will not be a problem. We do not want the sponge to be full because then the risk of breakage and moving into the lungs (for example) is real ... and that can be lethal. So ... continue on with Warfrin and INR rates ...another gift of cancer .... Take care - that's my experience. Looking forward to being wiened off ... Laura in Victoria",

While I had a different cocktail then you - I am in my 5th of 6 chemo treatments. In general ... I'm good for the first few days and then oh, about day 4-7 I'm a tad crappy ... meaning more tired, inability to focus ... have what my friends refer to as \"that starried eyed look\". I have been fortunate - limited nausea (nothing that some deep breathing and the meds couldn't deal with - ha !). Like others have said - do not suffer in silence - let folks know what's going on - most times, it can be addressed and/or others of us have been there and can chime in on what we might have done. Yes, I too had the heartburn - oh my. I got put on Nexium - was a blessing, wish I had spoken earlier. And you are on the right track with the water ... my body just seemed to scream for more water - it is important to flush your system of the chemo and push it through ... so, keep on drinking, it's great for you. The other thing is protein - eggs and such. Got to keep your body strong and the white cells strong. I was told that between day 10 and day 18 is the lowest white cell count so be especially cognizant not to be around folks who may be fighting any viruses or such - your body may be more vulnerable. Your best guide is you .. your body will tell you - rest, drink or whatever. Let your oncologist know of any \"glitches\" and do as they tell you ... Chemo is, in my experience, not the stuff of the nightmares we may have imagined. It is do'able and I have every faith that you too can do it ... we're in this together and it can be done ... we will do it. Laura in Victoria",

I don't find things taste bad particularly, they simply have no taste - kinda like eating cardboard. The only things that have taste are spicy and they hurt / burn my mouth. I didn't have taxotere - I'm on something called docetaxol. I think all the chemo cocktails have similar side effects. I've done the mouthwashes and such - no impact on food being any more tasty and thus, any more desirable. Let's see if anyone with more experience has some good ideas. Laura in Victoria",

Everyone makes their own decisions and have multiple reasons why .... I am only sharing that at this point anyways - no desire to have more surgery or more thinking about feeling for lumps.  OOOO - excuse me while I do not have to adjust straps or elastic - hahaha.",

I'm sure each chemo cocktail is different but geez - give us some hair back !! I even really miss my nose hair - I'm tired of being such close buddies with the Kleenex company. I too have no eyelashes and no eyebrows. My head hair is maybe best described as dryer lint. So, basically - I'm still bald. My hair is so very fine, and very light .. you cannot see anything. I'd like my leg and armpit hair to stay away permanently though!!! Now - that would be nice. Let's hope that it returns wavy, dark and thick !! On my head I mean !!! Ha ... Laura in Victoria",

I'm not really a reader ... but there was a book that hit all the buttons for me.  It is called \"Dancing in Limbo - Making Sense of Life After Cancer.\"  It is by Glenna Halvorson-Boyd and Lisa K. Hunter, both of whom are cancer survivors.  It is written in \"real\" language and tells all those stories that girlfriends share.  Anyways, your local library will have it ... it's easy reading and I just couldn't put it down.  In fact - I got it out for the 2nd time not long ago. So ... one foot infront of the other.  Crazy?  well ... I don't know you well enough - ha ha, but if you're in this group - we are all crazy and that's what's got us through it !!! Celebrate crazy - way less pressure !!!",
