      "Content": "LastChild wrote: Hi, everyone. I was finally diagnosed with stage 2 IDC on Jan. 30, 2018, after a month's worth of testing. I have an ultrasound of my heart scheduled for in the morning, port placement next week and first chemo treatment the day after that. The complicating factor is that I have had Type 1 Diabetes for 40 years, next month. Top that several other chronic ilnesses (I'm sure I'm not the only one in this boat), and I am a bit overwhelmed and angry. Still, I have this to do, and must say I am more scared of the chemo than I am the cancer. Being told to eat whatever I want during treatment was a bonus, though. Anyway, I just wanted to introduce myself and say hi. I am 50, married and have 2 grown kids. No grandbabies, yet. Blessings to all. Log in to post a reply",
