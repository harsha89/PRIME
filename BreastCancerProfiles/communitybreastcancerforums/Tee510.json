The results stated spots to numerous to count and Mets on upper and lower spine, left rib, and hip/ pelvic area. I have never had a bone biopsy. That put me in doubt for a while because I also have hyperthyroid which also causes different bone problems. Boy do I wish that was the truth for me. Shame on them for treating you like that. Just because you are stable doesn't mean you don't feel like crap from side affects from all the meds. Before I started treatment I felt fine and worked. Now I'm on treatment and barely want to get off the couch.",
