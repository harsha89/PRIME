Â  Likely you will be prescribed Tamoxifen or an AI depending on whether you are in menopause or not which is the same treatment you would likely have been prescribed if it had not gotten to your other lymph nodes.Â  There are many people on this board that have been stage IV or had mets for a 10 years or more.

Hansaim:Â  The only thing I can suggest other than Ensure and Boost is one of the protein shakes that weight lifters use.Â  There are a few that have a fair amount of calories, a great deal of protein, and aren't that sweet.Â  I hope the Ibrance works for you more quickly than it did for lalady.Â  I didn't really have a choice of not moving, there is the dog, the cat, and I live on the second floor.Â  To update your profile, you go to your profile and edit the information there.Â  If for instance you are changing a treatment, just redo the wholeÂ treatment shown adding the additional information. saidiessservant:Â  Ibrance has been approved in Canada, but I don't know if it has been approved for use with faslodex as it has here in the states.Â  Did Femara quit working for you?

My mets are sclerotic rather than lytic, but I don't know if that is why. Xgeva has a slight advantage over Zometa especially for spine mets according to the literature, which I'm sure is why my insurance company is allowing it over Zometa, because of the ACA which requires palliative care. I've had no side effects except maybe a slightly runny nose which also could be allergies. I actually felt really energetic after my first shot, but that could be because of the magnesium I'm taking to counteract the constipation of the calcium I'm taking for the Xgeva. Who knows?",

If you get Bestbirds MBC guide, it covers the old tricyclic anti-depressants as well as the newer reuptake inhibitors. Wellbutrin (buepropian) actually is a sdri (selective dopamine reuptake inhibitor). Effexor is a snri (selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor), while Cymbalta is both an snri and ssri (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor). Buspar affects GABA. There is also an old tricyclic that works on amitriptyline, another of the neurotransmitters. That is why so many different things work well for some and not others who do better with something else. It depends on which neurotransmitter rings your bell. ",

I assumed when I found out that they were left for the RO to find the exact spots that needed to be zapped (he did an x-ray before my \"tattoos\". I found out about them when I had an x-ray to figure out why I was wheezing and had trouble breathing. Although all the paperwork I've filled out with my drs has specifically stated I'd been treated for BC, it was the note by the radiologist that I had them that seem to get the attention of my pulmonologist that I'd previously had BC and led to the diagnosis of lung mets. The mets were on the opposite side from the surgery so they had nothing to do with that",
