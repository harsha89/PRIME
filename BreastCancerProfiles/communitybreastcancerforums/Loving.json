I'm 45 and this decision was my hardest in my journey. I chosed lumpectomy because my biopsy pathology indicated a small tumor and grade 1. Do you know the grade? Grade one is slow growing and grade 3 is aggressive. My surgeon highly suggested not performing surgery until the MRI and the genetic test results were available as either may have changed the surgery type. My insurance paid for the genetic test as they pay for anyone under 45. After surgery, the oncotype test was completed to determine my treatment plan. Hope this helps.",

There is a thread for winter rads that I have been following through my rad journey. This group is very inspiring and definitely warriors as chemo sounds much harder than rads. This has been my rad journey...35 treatments-27 full breast and 8 boost which is where they just eradicate your surgery area. You start off with your first appointment with them taking X-rays for positioning and getting tattoos. I got 5 - 3 down my breast bone on 1 on each side of stomach area. They don't hurt and seriously very small. They are smaller than freckles and sometimes I wonder how they see them as I don't notice them at all. The RO and the physicist use the X-rays to figure out the angles of the rads and set the computer. The machine won't turn on if you are not exact on the machine. I have 2 angles that are radiated. It takes less than a minute on each angle. The massiveness of the machine moving on top of me bothers me the most. You don't feel anything and it doesn't hurt. It took about 11 treatments for me to notice a skin reaction. I used pure aloe Vera (I bought mine at Whole Foods but others found it at Walmart) until my skin was worse. Then I switched to radiogel and biotine that was prescribed by my doctor. My underarm, nipple and underneath my breast are my most sensitive. My RO switched me to my boosts at 20 treatments to give these areas a break and then I will finish with the full breast rad. I see the doctor every week and they monitor the skin very closely. If it is between doctor visits, you just have a let them know that it is uncomfortable and they will give you a break on Friday or Monday to give you a longer weekend to heal. Also, the techs have this tape you can put on your bad areas that protect it better. I do get tired about 45 minutes after treatment. I go at the end of the day so I don't feel tired at work. I was able to choose my time and they were quite a few options. if you time isn't available, they will let you switch when it opens up. the techs are extremely compassionate and nice to you! It isn't a sleepy tired just more exhaustion. I'm sure it isn't like chemo tired. The daily treatments get boring but I live close to the treatment center so the drive isn't bad. It is annoying not to shave my underarm. My hair has not fallen out. This is probably a chemo benefit as you won't have to deal with this. You can't wear deordorant as it has aluminum in it. They give you a salt crystal but It doesn't work very well. I have chosen to just deal with it and I smell everyday :( I only have 7 to go. Hopefully, my skin will hold up then I start tamoxifen. My oncologist didn't want to start until after rads so that if there were se we would know if it was the rads or tamoxifen. Some people are doing both at the same time. I hope this helps and good luck with your journeys! Laura",
