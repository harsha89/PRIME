I was allowed to put my loose top back on without bra careful not to move wire. I walked myself to same day surgery where I was prepped for surgery and to surgery I went. My 2nd one started out the same but when I got to the check-in at same day surgery, they were out of beds and I was sent back to the waiting room until they had a bed opened. I waited in the waiting room for close to 3 hours before they finally called my name. I was just getting into bed and the nurses tried to put in my IV when the doctor came by to see how I was doing and he was ready for me. I wasn't quite preped completly but the nurses finished up quickly and I was in the OR in no time. (I do like my doctor, before any procedure he would come by the same day surgery area and ask if I or my family had any questions about what was going on, and when surgery was complete, he would personally go and talk to my family).",

There is no ovarian/breast cancer in my fathers side of the family so I am not doing the genetic testing. My gyn and surgeon both recommend yearly transvaginal ultrasounds to keep watch on my ovaries as well as the blood test (CA125 I think) every other year for OC. Unless I start having major problems with my ovaries, they want me to keep them in.

Binney will post the sites that give specific info about preventing LE if she sees your request here. I know off hand that you don't want any blood pressure/blood draws/iv in the side where your surgery was performed. For those of us with bilateral, they must do this on our legs/feet. watch any cuts/scrapes/bug bites/sunburns on the affected side. If you have a cut/scrape etc. treat it like any wound, wash the affected area and use a clean dressing with antibacterial ointment. Use rubber gloves to wash dishes to keep hands out of the hot water. keep hands and arms moisturized drink plenty of water That is all I can think of now but Binney should be on soon to answer your questions better. Sheila edited to add: I found the site Binney always recommends http://www.lymphnet.org/ they have position papers that describe in detail what to do to protect yourself from lymphedema.",

I had my first biopsy at age 44 on the left breast in feb 2005 showing ADH, my surgeon put me on 6 month mammo and cbe with him. He suggested tamox because of all the risk factors. I did not want to take it so he did not force the issue. 18 months later I had a 2nd biopsy but in the right breast for ADH, this time he said that I had to take the tamox and consider pbm, I could let him know if I decided to go with the surgery at my next appointment. I had severe night sweats/hot flashes and mood swings while on tamox (I could not take birth control pills earlier because of the mood swings) April 07 (6 months after starting tamox) I had my third abnormal mammo resulting in another biopsy of the right breast, this time it was early DCIS. Because of the vigilance of my doctor it was found before it had invaded the breast tissue (outside the duct). I am not saying that the tamox did not work, but as my doctor said the odds caught up with me. my hubby and I had decided that if I had to have another biopsy, I would do the pbm no matter what the results were. Because it was found early, I did not need chemo or rads but the last year of surgeries for recon have not been easy. It was a very hard decision to make but for me it was the best, I am not trying to tell you what to do but just giving my story to think about. Sheila",

She did not realize it was lymphedema. The nurse facilitator suggested that she go to the local lymph clinic for an evaluation. She has not been back to any meetings since then so I don't know how she is doing. The Lymph clinic is listed on the registry that you alway recommend people go to in order to find one.

He said that we needed to do the biopsy before scheduling the surgery. The biopsy the next week showed DCIS in the right breast and I did the bilat mast with recon June 07. I have not regretted my decision but am glad that the surgery took care of the cancer and did not have to have chemo or rads. The final path report showed more ADH in the right and hyperplaysic ductal cells in the left. My doctor said that I had made the right decision for me. It is a hard decision to make but like you, I wanted off the rollercoaster of 6 month mammos and biopsies. Make sure that you check out on the surgery forum the topic on shopping before and after surgery.  There are a lot of great ideas to help you recover from this surgery. Sheila",

After the first 2 stero biopsies which showed Atypical Ductal Hyperplaysia (benign), I did have excisional surgery (lumpectomy) to remove the area surrounding the ADH. The last stero biopsy showed DCIS and I had bilateral mastectomy done because of the previous problems I had. The statics show that 80% of the biopsies performed are benign. Hope that this helps answer your questions. Sheila",

Sorry you had to join the 'club nobody want's to join'.  The dx of DCIS is actually a good one to get if there is such a thing.  I was DX with DCIS earlier this year and because of earlier problems I had involving both breasts and strong family history, I opted for bilateral mastectomies. My surgery is the only treatment I needed.  I am not taking chemo or radiation. Make sure that you get copies of all reports, that will make it easier to do your research on what your treatment options will be. We will all be here when you have any questions or rants. Sheila",

The last 2, the same surgeon did them and he prescribed 2 valium to take at the hospital after I signed the paperwork. I was more relaxed during those, 1) the valium helped and 2) I knew what to expect. Just try to relax while you are on the table and take a few deep cleansing breaths before they start and focus on your 'happy place' while they are doing the procedure. at the last one I even joked with the radiologist techs and the doctor about looking for Bill Murray to walk through the door and 'I got you Babe' to play on the radio (aka - Groundhog Day).

You can check with you ps when you go for your pre-op appointment and clarify any questions you might have or even call and ask to speak with his assistant.

It will help keep all the appointments organized so you don't end up with 2 appointments at two different offices booked at the same time. My mom is 8 yrs out from her dx and still keeps a calendar just for doctor appointments for herself and my father. Sheila",

He though does prescribe valium to take after you get to the clinic where it is done, just to relieve the nerves while laying on the table, so if you get the valium, you will need somebody to drive you home. After the biopsy is removed (he takes 3 or 4 samples) they take an x-ray of the samples to make sure that the calcifications are there and another mammo of the breast to make sure that the correct area was tested. 2 of the 3 times I had ADH (pre-cancer) but the last time it was DCIS. They do the excisional biopsy afterwards if there is ADH or LCIS to make sure that there is nothing else lurking in the area that was missed by the stero biopsy. I hope that this helped you. Sheila",

Make sure that you get copies of your path report from the surgeon and make a folder. It helps in making your decisions. Sheila",

He said that I was the first to do that to him and it actually embarrased him the first time I did it. When I went in to mark for the nipples, I used stick on rinestone earings (like little girls wear) to mark where I wanted the nipples. He agreed that I had them in good locations.

My stero biopsies were usually performed within 2 weeks of the abnormal mammos, and my wire guided excisions usually 2 to 3 weeks after the stero. I have a strong family history and after the 2nd biopsy (the first two were each in a different breast) my surgeon put me on Tamox and suggested bilat mast. The last one confirmed the decision to have them both removed. Because I decided to have recon done at the same time, we had to work in an appointment with the PS and get the two doctors in the OR at the same time, the stero biopsy was performed April 25, 2007 and my surgery was June 1, 2008.

It however did not set a president for other women under going recon and they will be deciding it on a case by case basis.  My PS has used alloderm for over 5 yrs and he said that I was the first case that was denied in his practice but since then all of them had been under review by BCBS.

My insurance initally denied the bill for AlloDerm because they considered it investigational for reconstruction but my ps and I filed all the appeals and after 6 months the insurance company did finally pay that part of the bill.

My ps said that he gets better placement of the implant with the alloderm because the muscle will not cover 100% of the implant. Without the alloderm, the implant may migrate to the outer quadrant of the chest. I am 47 and don't find a lot of change in my range of motion but the 'foobs' do flex when I move my shoulders certain ways. I did take it easy all last summer while I let myself heal from the surgery. I don't think that my ps actually cut the muscle but sewed the alloderm to the bottom and outside part of the muscle to create the pocket. I had lymph nodes removed from each side so I am careful when lifting things to prevent lymphedema. Sheila",

The wire insertion is done the day of any needed excisional biopsies/lumpectomies. I had the wire sticking out of my breast the day of my excisional lumpectomy(ies) for a couple of hours. For the wire insertion they numbed the area and took mammo to determine where the clip was and inserted the wire into that area.  I had my first stero biopsy (left breast) done Feb 14, 2005, my lumpectomy April 1, 2005.

My surgeon asked me to consider preventative bilat mast after the 2nd dx of ADH but to let him know at my next appointment in 6 months. I went for that next mammo and it was abnormal again so my decision was made for me. I knew what my mom looked like after her single mast in 2001 without recon and I went with her to the local support group and made a lot of great friends there. They were willing to share their stories (just like on this board) as well as take me into an empty room and show me their battle scars so I would know what I would look like after surgery. I opted for recon with implants (not enough fat to create 2 nice sized boobs). My husband told me from the beginning that he didn't care what I did regarding my surgery/recon, he would rather have me here without my boobs than the alternative and he loves me regardless of my scars.

My experience is I had lumpectomies both times to remove the area around the ADH, suggested tamox after the first, insisted tamox after the second. I was also put on a 6 month regiment of mammos followed by clinical breast exams by the surgeon. I also had a family history of BC/OC that increased my risk factors. I hope that I have not scared you any but good luck on staying b9. Sheila",

The delay in the biopsy scheduling should not affect much. I have waited as long as 3 weeks for a stero biopsy. (I have had 3 in 2.5 years) It just happened that this past April, he had an opening the next week for my stero biopsy. When you see the new surgeon, ask for valium to take prior to the stero biopsy, I have had one without and 2 with and the proceedure is much more tollerable with the valium to relax you. Good luck with your new surgeon. Sheila",

Any questions that you have, make sure that you write them down before you go to the surgeons office. Ask for copies of all reports, from the mammo and ultrasound to the pathology report from the biopsy and make your own file at home. This will insure that you have all reports in one place.

I took him off everything I could (In order of reactions shrimp (high), Soy (high), peanuts (high), milk (mild), yeast/mold (mild), chicken (mild), eggs (mild)) for 2 weeks, but when we went to McDonalds he ate a container of French Fries and had an allergic reaction (blood shot eyes) from the oil they fried the fries in before we left the restraunt. I started doing extensive research about what this boy could eat. I found out that Tuna packed in water can have 'vegetable protein' added (soy). Now they do list soy as the vegetable protein but then it was a try and see if he had a reaction. I was using Fleschmann's margarine because then it was 100% corn oil, about 1.5 yrs after his allergery alert, they changed the formula and added soy to their margarine. I then had to change to regular butter even with the milk allergy, it was less of a reaction than the soy margarines. Fortunately he has outgrown the allergy or has a milder reaction (he is now 23) and eats peanuts without any problem but has still avoided shrimp. Sheila",

Mammos are not that bad, the tech will start compressing and will ask if it hurts. they will stop when you say it is hurting. I was only bruised once and that was when they were doing a cone-compression with the old style machine. The digital mammos are much easier than the old style mammos in my opinion. The number of pictures will depend on what they are trying to see. Normally they do 3-4 on each side and they compress it less than 30 seconds for each pict. At the clinic I go to, after they take the picts, they escort you to the private waiting area in your drape while the radiologist checks the views. Sometimes they want additional shots if they did not come out clear enough. You could take some tylenol or asprin prior but I never found it necessary. Sheila",

He put me on the Tamox, but 6 months later I had another abnormal mammo and the biopsy that time showed DCIS in the right. I did the bilat mast last June and did the expander/implant recon. I am very happy with my decision. I made a list of pros and cons prior to the surgery and the pro surgery list was longer than the no surgery. There are several conversations in the surgery thread with suggestions for surgery and recovery. you might want to check these conversations out to get a feel of what to expect. If you have any questions, I will try to answer them as being one who's 'been there...done that'. After I posted, I realized that I was a page behind in the conversation but not too far behind. sheila",

The first two times it was ADH (pre-cancer) the last time DCIS. Here is my answers to your questions. What do I do about the lump? I would get the mammo done. How do I know the lump is still 'normal'? you don't know the lump is normal until the pathologist gets a sample (biopsy) of the lump and looks at it under the microscope. Why did the lump become a lump? don't know Why didn't the surgeon want the lump removed? Don't know but I would have insisted on further testing (mammo or MRI) and possible biopsy. When do I stop worring? For those of us who have heard the word 'cancer' the worry never completly goes away. Sheila",

About a month after my surgery, I was waiting in my PS office for a fill and a woman walked out with pillows under her arms. I asked her if she had the surgery and she said yes.

I was somewhat prepared for what I would look like because a woman at my support group took me to an empty room and showed me her bilat scars 2 weeks before my surgery.

I was put on a 6 month mammo schedule with follow-up appointments with him. 18 months later I was dx with ADH in the right breast. This time my doctor said that tamox was no longer optional and I started it on my 46th birthday. He suggested that I consider a PBLM and to talk it over with my family and let him know my decision at my next 6 month appointment. We decided that if I had any more abnormal mammo's I would go with the PBLM At that mammo I had suspicious spots again on my 6 month mammo I told my doctor that I wanted the PBLM but he couldn't do the blm until I had a biopsy because of the abnormal mammo. The biopsy showed was DCIS. I have had 3 stero biopsies and I agree that it is a torture device. Although taking some valium prior to the procedure makes it more berable. Sheila",

The more abnormal the nucleus the higher the grade. Grade 1 is low nuclear grade where grade 3 is the highest nuclear grade meaning more aggressive. The node is at the point of our mast/lumpectomies the doctor does a Sentinental lymph node test where they take a few of the nodes from the armpit that drain the breast area and test it to see if any cancer cells have escaped from the breast area. My node 0/7 means that they took 7 nodes and 0 nodes had cancer so my DCIS was confined. If you have any node positive you may need chemo. My mom had a single mast in 2001 for invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) I am not sure what her grade was but she had 15 nodes removed and 7 of them cancerious. But as I said earlier, she is doing great even with that many nodes showing cancer. Cathi said that she had a CA (cancer) dx in 06 in the left breast but had other lesions biopsied as b9 microcalcifications. I know these terms are confusing and you think you need to know everything at once. Remember we have been dealing with this for several years and have had plenty of time to learn the lingo.

My doctor said that each time I was dx with ADH my risk factors increased. My history includes my maternal aunt dying with ovarian cancer at age 37 (1978), and my mom dx in 2001 at age 57 with invasive lobular breast cancer. When I had the firs dx of ADH in the left breast my doctor suggested I take tamoxiphen but I did not want the side effects that occur with that medicine. My surgeon put me on a 6 month mammo schedule and seeing him the week after my mammos to watch for any other changes. 18 months after my first dx, I had calcifications in the right breast which was the 2nd dx of ADH, he insisted that I take tamox and suggested I consider preventative bilat mast because of the family history it wasn't a matter of if I developed bc but when. 8 months after the 2nd dx, I had my 3rd abnormal mammo with calcifications, this time the biopsy showed DCIS in the right breast. My options were lumpectomy of the area with DCIS followed by radiation or the bilat mast and no rads. It was a hard decision but because I had the previous abnormal biopsies in both breasts I opted for bilat mast with implant reconstruction. that surgery was June 2007 and I am doing great. He even took me off the tamox because he said I had minimal breast tissue left and the benefit vs the side effects did not weigh heavily on the benefit side and I was having hard side effects from the tamox. My mom did a single mast, chemo and radiation for her cancer and is cancer free (dancing with NED) at this time. Make sure that you have someone with you to drive you home from the biopsy tomorrow, I couldn't walk straight from the valium when I got off the table. Sheila",

At least when they insert the wire, they numb the area. I have had 2 wire localization limpectomies over the past 2 years and the wire is like the smallest string on a guitar. After they inserted the wire on me, they coiled the end up and taped it to my breast and covered it with a 4x4 gauze pad. Sheila",

I had double mast with recon June 1 and the left side has regained most of the feeling but the right side is still numb on the back side of my upper arm. I hope that this answers your question.

The radiologist looked at the new films and compared them to the one done in April and sent the tech back to mom to say that it looked like it did earlier. Mom showed her the area and said that it wasn't there in April. They took more diagnostic picts and found the cancer. If mom had not been forceful and accepted the results that it was the same, she wouldn't have found it. It was invasive but she is doing well now. Have you had a biopsy to indicate that it is cancer.

The providers have agreements with the insurance companies that will discount the price to the 'allowable' price or agreed upon discount the insurance will be billed. Also most insurance plans have an 80/20 after you meet the deductible (insurance pays 80% you pay 20). Since the biggest part of the medical goods are paid for by insurance companies, the providers can charge a higher price to get a bigger profit. The woman in my area who sells mastectomy products will accept what insurance pays and writes off the difference, but if you are just into your new year, you have to pay 100%. I got a mast bra from her this spring for $50.00 since I hadn't met my deductible. Sheila",

After you empty the drains, they are squeezed as flat as you can get them to create a vacuum to pull the fluid out so they are not very big. I emptied mine 3 or 4 times a day and they were never more than half way full when I emptied them so they were not real big.

No one can give me a straight answer if that radiation I received those years could have effected my body and caused the abnormal mammo/biopsies I had prior to my bilat mast last June.

That will help reduce some of the swelling and discomfort with the procedure. Ice packs will be your friend to also help with the swelling. and don't be surprised if your boob turns multi-colored after wards due to bruising.",

He evaluated both arms to get the differences between the arms, he evaluated my gripping strength, force I could squeeze my fingers and thumbs together, hand/eye coordination to see how well my fingers could pick up pegs and put them in a peg board, he did range of motion testing on arms/shoulders, measured my hands/arms at points up each arm and compared the measurements. We talked about what I could and shouldn't be doing and set goals up for me to accomplish during my treatments, the first one being to reduce the swelling, 2nd to increase my exercise time, 3rd to increase my bicep strength. We decided to try the iscentoner glove for a week to see how much reduction we saw with little compression. My following appointments didn't take as long, mostly checking measurements to check progress. The wrapping isn't that bad.

I had 1 biopsy for suspicious microcalcifications on each breast 18 months apart starting at age 44 that showed pre-cancer ADH. After the 2nd biopsy and lumpectomy my surgeon suggested PBM for me because (his words) it wasn't a matter of if I developed bc, but a matter of when. I thought about it for 6 months and at my next mammo it again showed calcifications. This time the biopsy showed DCIS. I did the bilat mast and recon in 2007. I too struggle with low self-esteem. I frequently ask my hubby for reasurrance that he still loves me even with the major scars across my chest. Fortunately I came through all my surgeries without any complications. I think that we need to get some psychological assistance while we are going through this because our image is changing rapidly and emotionally it can be a challenge. It is a big thing for me to not have the feeling in my breasts also. My final path report indicated that I did make the right decision, it showed additional ADH in both breasts that didn't show up on my mammos. In the section of newly diagnosed (I think) there is a thread that has alot of the common abbreviations that we use when talking about our cancer. Sheila",

As wish said last year we had terrible spam problems that would tie up the boards for hours at a time with unwanted spam (100s of postings a minute from each spammer). Because of the terrible spam attacks (some of the postings were personal and said we are doing this because we can) they instituted the limit on postings in a 24 hour period. I think someone said that when you get to 40 or 45 posts your limit of 5 per day is lifted. Melissa, I had 3 mammos in 3 yrs that there were suspicious microcalcifications that required further testing - no Birad number. I had a sterotactic biopsy (core needle with mammo directed) each time because they can't tell with just the mammo what the calcifications are. The first two times was b-9 the last time was early DCIS. Good luck on your biopsy. Sheila",

They did a sterotactic biopsy (needle with mammo assist) to get samples of the calcifications. When they showed up as ADH, my surgeon recommended a surgical 'lumpectomy' to remove the area surounding the calcifications to make sure that there was nothing else lurking in the area. I was then put on 6 month mammos and recommended taking tamoxifen. I have a strong family history of ovarian and breast cancer in first and 2nd degree relatives. After the 2nd biopsy in 18 months, my surgeon suggested thinking about preventative bilat mast and insisted that I take tamox. 6 months later my mammo was abnormal again and the biopsy showed DCIS still confined to the duct. I had bilat mast with recon June 1, 2007 and am glad that I did. my final path report showed additional ADH in the right side (pre-cancer) and pre-ADH in the left. I did not request my first path or mammo report but after my DCIS dx I have gotten copies of all reports and have a large expanding file that I am keeping them all in for future reference. Looking back I should have gotten reports from all earlier procedures to help me make the decision that I made. Sheila",

I had 2 lumpectomies to remove the area surrounding the ADH. At that point my surgeon (who was also my mom's surgeon in 2001) suggested I consider preventative bilat mast. When I went back 6 months later with abnormal mammo on the right again and the biopsy showed DCIS grade 1. My surgeon wouldn't do anything until after the biopsy, and he asked me if I wanted the lumpectomy (again) with rads this time or bilat mast. I went straight for the bilat mast. I was tired of going to my mammos not knowing what would be found and there was only so much breast tissue that they could remove one piece at a time. I opted to go the way of the 2% or less chances bilat vs the 25%+ chances of lump with rads. CO1214 said that she had the lump and was ready to go to rads and decided on the mast and I have read other women on the board who have had the lumpectomy first and had chemo but before started rads, decided to forgo the rads and do the mast. I know that the decision is a hard one but you need to do what you personally can live with. We can only give you our opinions of what we did and why we made the decisions we made. Sheila",

The width of the fabric 60 inches is not quite long enough for folding up to create the pockets. So . . . purchase 14-18 inches of the fleece instead of the 1/4 yard of fleece. trim off the selvage edges. fold the fabric in half to make a scarf 7-9 inches wide and sew across the end and up the side to the depth of the pocket you want on each end. You won't have to sew up the entire length of the scarf, just up to create the pocket. When you put on the scarf, keep it folded and put it on with the fold against your neck and the ends will fall approximately where your pockets are on your coat and your hands will slide into the pockets you have created without losing any of the length of the scarf. sheila",

I told her that I had BMX with nodes removed on both sides and with LE on the left side I didn't want to risk LE on the right side. I walked her through the steps to take BP with my cuff on the leg after laying flat for 5 minutes. My bp was relatitive high (due to waiting 2 hours after my appointment time before being called in to see the dr) and she said the dr would want to retake my bp since it was high. I continued to lay flat and when he came in with a manual bp cuff he asked what I was doing with the cuff on my leg. I told him bilat mast with nodes removed on both sides. He had me take my bp again with my machine and the bp was still elevated. He had me sit up and said he needed (insisted) to take my bp on the arm to make sure that my cuff was reading correctly. He totally ignored my pink wrist bands and my bp was still high. (was it high because of the pressure he put on me to take it the 'normal' way ) My colonoscopy is Wed. Monday when doing the pre-op I will tell them that will not have any IV or BP on my arms, if they can't guarantee this should I cancel the procedure?

My history is 2 previous dx of Atypical Ductal hyperplaysia (once in each side) within 18 months and 6 months after the last dx of ADH, dx of DCIS. My surgeon suggested the bilateral mast last September after the 2nd dx of ADH. My mom is a 6 yr survivor of invasive BC and her sister died in 1978 of ovarian cancer.

My surgeon did not order MRI after my 3 failed mammo. I did not have any lumps only suspicious microcalcifications. I had sterotactic needle biopsies for each of them and they were not all on the same side. The first two times showed pre-cancer ADH but the last showed early DCIS. After my DCIS dx last april, my options were 1. MRI to see what was there before any further decisions were made or 2. mastectomy. If I chose single mast, he would have probably done the MRI to see if anything else was in the other breast to help make my decision, but I chose bilat mast. He then said that the MRI was a moot point because I had already decided to remove them both. I also had problems with my insurance denying part of my reconstruction, My PS and I appealed the denial for 6 months before it went to the independent PS review where it was deemed a common practice for the proceedure he used in the recon.

My surgeon put me on a 6 month mammo schedule along with seeing him at the same time for cbe. 18 months after the first ADH dx in the left breast, I had ADH dx in the right breast. my surgeon put me on tamox and suggested bi-lat mast. I took the tamox for 6 months and at my next mammo it was abnormal again on the right. The biopsy showed DCIS and I opted for the bilat mast June 07 and have not looked back. I am now 47 yrs old, my boy is 23. My biopsies were sterotactic biopsies, easier and cheaper to do than excisional biopsies until they found out what they were then I had excisional biopsies/lumpectomies to remove the area surrounding the calcifications.

I will also talk to the cancer support nurse to see if she can 'help' educate the doctors so in the future no one will have to jump through as many hoops as I am having to.

My mom talked to the genetic counselor and got the test covered by her insurance, her test showed no mutation. I, too, went through numerious mammo call backs for additional views since I turned 38 or 39. In Jan 2005 I had my annual mammo and had what I thought was going to be the usual call back showing cysts but this time it required a biopsy. I was 44 at the time and the biopsy showed ADH (pre-cancer) on the left breast. I had surgery to remove the area surrounding the ADH and was put on a 6 month mammo schedule. July 2006, I had my 2nd abnormal mammo requiring a biopsy, again it was ADH but in the right breast. Once again I went to the OR and had the area surgically removed. My surgeon suggested that I consider prof bilat mast because 'it isn't a matter of if but when it develops into breast cancer'. He gave me some information on the surgery and to think about it for 6 months and let him know at that appointment. The month before my appointment Oprah had Renee Seiler on her show and she discussed her preventative bilat mast due to numerious biopsies for ADH. That show helped me make my decision. BUT at my next mammo, more suspicious calcifications showed up on the right breast for the 2nd time and my decision was made. My doctor said since there were calcifications he had to do a biopsy again and the biopsy showed DCIS. I know this is long but wanted to share my story of why I did bilat mast. The final path report on the breast tissue removed at the mast showed more adh in both breasts that didn't show up on the mammo. Sheila",

You said that you were told not to put the actual questionnaire on the site, but who made that statement to you. If the moderators approved your research project, they would have posted the request themselves and instructed anyone interested to contact them for more information. Right now we just have your word that this is approved by the moderators. I saw where you posted this same question on the DCIS forum. If you knew anything about types of cancer ant the treatment plans, you would know that DCIS is non invasive and doesn't require chemo as part of the treatment. This thread is in the not diagnosed but worried forum, are you trying to get research from people who don't even know that they have cancer? Sheila",

Everyone has their own reasons for chosing the procedure that they go through with. In my case, my aunt was dx at age 38 with ovarian cancer and my mom at age 60 with BC. I had problems since 2005 when I was 44 with abnormal mammos resulting in sterotactic biopsies, first on the left breast in Feb 2005, second on the right breast in Aug 2006, each time showing ADH (pre-cancer cells). After my 2nd dx of ADH, my surgeon suggested I consider PBM and to let him know at my 6 month follow-up appointment. April 2007 at age 46 I had my 6 month mammo and it was abnormal again, the biopsy showed DCIS in the right breast. For me the bilateral mast was the only reasonable thing I could do. I was tired of going on the roller-coaster ride of abnormal mammo and biopsies and I was ready to get off the ride. Do I miss my natural breasts? you bet I do. Do I regret having the surgery last June? No because it reduced my risk on both sides to less than 1 % of developing into an invasive cancer. I was not going to give the cancer another chance to form and possibly not find it before it had invaded. After my mother's dx she had the genetic testing done and was found to be BRCA negative. I hope that this answers your questions as to why I chose the mast rather than another lumpectomy. Sheila",

When you visit the doctor take a notebook with questions that you have thought about and ask them.

Seven days after my bilat surgery last June, my father-in-law passed away from liver cancer. My sister came over and washed my hair in the kitchen sink several times while I still had the drains in. I attended the funeral (on day 9) with 2 drains still in, wearing a bright floral shirt and blue slacks (drains hidden under the clothing). Sure I was in a drug induced not feeling any pain (oxycodone) and ready to get back to bed afterwards but I got out. I only hoped that my Mother-in-law would understand me not wearing a dress. I did not have a dress that I could comfortably wear with the drains intact. Let your friends help you. My hubby is a long haul trucker and only home on weekends, so I was completly by myself during the week while recovering. My mom came by daily to make sure that I was ok and fixed me lunches. My sister called daily and either brought supper or took me to her house for supper 2 or 3 times a week. Friends from work called and brought meals to me and asked if they could help in any way. They wanted to be part of the recovery process. Sheila",

I laughed at her because I also was a small b cup and had to have mammos every 6 months since 2005. Good luck on the MRI. sheila",

I had 4 drains to start out with and 2 were pulled on day 7 and the other 2 on day 11. Since I had bilat done I did not have to worry about matching one side to the other, so I wore the camisoles with the shelf bra to work while I was expanding. I did not have much discomfort with the expanding process. Good luck on your surgery. Sheila",

I continued to lay flat and when he came in with a manual bp cuff he asked what I was doing with the cuff on my leg. I told him bilat mast with nodes removed on both sides. He had me take my bp again with my machine and the bp was still elevated. He had me sit up and said he needed (insisted) to take my bp on the arm to make sure that my cuff was reading correctly. He totally ignored my pink wrist bands and my bp was still high. (was it high because of the pressure he put on me to take it the 'normal' way ) My colonoscopy is Wed.

After my first biopsy my surgeon had me doing mammos every 6 months and the breast imaging center needed orders from the surgeon to do the 6 month mammos.

At least you had zanax, my first one was done without any tranquil meds, but the last 2 I had valium to take at the hospital after I signed the release forms. By my third one, I was expecting to see Bill Murray come in the room (aka groundhog day). Cindi and Teeko, the first 2 stero biopisies showed ADH (once in each breast 18 months apart). I was already a high risk due to mother with BC and aunt with OC. I had the surgical excision for each area after each biopsy. The first biopsy put me at a higher risk level and my surgeon suggested I take tamox in addition to 6 month mammo/follw ups with him. I declined the tamox since I was just 44 and I didn't want the menopausal symptoms. My 2nd biopsy 18 months later, the surgeon said that tamox was no longer optional so I was dealing with the hot flashes and night sweats. He suggested I think about preventative bilat mast and let him know on my next visit because in his opinion it was not a matter of if i developed BC but when. Unfortunately my next mammo was abnormal again, the thrid biopsy showed DCIS. I did the bilat and the entire section of DCIS was removed in the stero biopsy but I had additional ADH in both breasts that did not show up on the mammos. Good luck on all your tests and surgeries.

I have a family history of pre-menopausal ovarian cancer in my aunt and post menopausal breast cancer in my mom (but she was on hrt). I had to put this into my equasion for deciding to remove my breasts. The wire guided lumpectomies are not that bad, I had 2 of them. My wires were put in at the radiology dept. They do a mammo to determine where the ADH is and the radiologist numbs the area and uses the picts to see where the needle (like IV needle) needs to go and inserts it into the area, they take another mammo to see if the needle is in the right location before sliding the small gauge wire into the needle. After that, they removed the needle and took another pict to make sure that the wire was still in the correct area. The excess wire was looped and taped to my chest under a gauze pad and took me to the same day surgery unit where I was preped for surgery. Sheila",

I cut the cuff off and sewed the cuff end and placket shut. If the top of the sleeve is too wide, you can sew the seam up a little bit to make it look more like a long straight tube and trim the cap of the sleeve off to make it straight across that end. Turn it right side out and stuff it with fiberfill to the firmness you like and sew the end up. You can even take the other sleeve and make a 'pillowcase' out of it so if it gets dirty, it is easier to wash than the whole pillow. I didn't make a cover for my first one made out of a white dress shirt and it has gotten dirty. I think I will try another and just move the stuffing from one to the other . Sheila",

The fleece is usually 60 inches wide, just purchase fabric the width you want your scarf to be (1/4 yd would make it 9 inches wide), trim off the selvage edge and fold up the ends 8 inches or how ever deep you want the pockets and sew up the sides, it can be sewn on the machine or with a decorative hand stitch and embroidery floss. You don't even need to hem the ends or sides. In most cases the scarf is long enough to wrap around your neck and still put your hands in the pockets. the 'mitts' that Binney suggested can also be made out of polar fleece with a little bit of sewing skills. Right now is a good time to get the fleece, the Hancock Fabric stores are running a big sale on fleece right now.",

My mom was dx with breast cancer in 2001 (age 60) had genetic test done and was BRCA negative. I started having abnormal mammos in my early 40's, first one that required biopsy age 44, showed ADH in the left breast. I saw the same surgeon that my mother saw, he put me on close watch mammo schedule every 6 months, suggested tamox at that point. I declined the prescription. 18 months later abnormal mammo on the right with biopsy showing ADH. Doctor insisted taking tamox and consider PBM but to think about it for 6 months. I went on tamox on my 46 birthday. I had what I would consider severe side effects (mood swings). On my next 6 month mammo, it was abnormal again on the right side. I opted for the PBM and my doctor took me off the tamox. My final path report showed more ADH in both the right and the left breast that didn't show up on the mammo. I am not saying that this is a normal scenario. Not all ADH will develop into DCIS or invasive cancer. I personally was tired of the rollercoaster of emotions regarding all the mammo/biopsies that I went through in just over 2 yrs. Sheila",

The second excisional was done on the other breast but that was on the out side of the other breast and I had a small (about 2 in) scar but it too faded in time. You will be able to do this. Just take everything one step at a time. Make sure that you follow the post surgery instructions, If you think you will have pain, take the pain meds before you start hurting, it is better to stay ahead of the pain than try to catch up with it. Also get copies of your path report - even if benign - and start a file with them. I did and I have reports from 2005, 2006, and my final surgery in 2007. It helps to track what is going on and helps with the decision making later on. Sheila",

He said that my biggest threat was my mom even though she tested negative for the BRCA gene, they don't know all the genes that cause BC. My surgeon likes to do excisional biopsies after a dx of adh from the stero biopsy because the stero biopsy just gets a sample of the area and there may be something else lurking in that same area. I didn't ask him what the chances were that they would find anything else during the excisional. I had 6 months to think about doing the bilat after it was suggested to me before I had to make the hard decision. I am doing great, it took about 9 months to a year to complete the reconstruction process with implants and I am very happy with the outcome. Because I didn't have any invasive component and no lymph node involvment, I didn't need chemo or rads. Sheila",

If your doctor writes a prescription for the mastectomy products and since you have had breast surgery, the insurance should cover the costs. To find where to purchase them you can ask other BC survivors in your area where they purchase theirs. The products are usually available at medical supply stores or in larger cities there are speciality stores that deal with mastectomy patients and are excellent at fitting. you can look in the yellow pages under mastectomy apparel for stores in your area.",

It fills my needs, I can do what I want during the week and weekends are with him, except when he tells his momma 'yes momma, we will be over Saturday to help cover the swimming pool'. The job that should have taken about an hour ended up as a 4 hour job, she didn't have the chemicals needed to winterize the pool on hand and they had to circulate in the pool for 1 - 2 hours each before they could cover the pool. We had a spaghetti dinner fund raiser at the church Saturday afternoon. I was supposed to be at the church to help cook the noodles at 2:30 but we were just leaving Donald's mom's at 2 and I needed a shower before I could even think about going to the church. I finally got there at 3:15. I don't remember who questioned how long I would have the calendars. I will have them for a couple of months. If I run out I can get more from Katheryn. Nancy, I got your check Saturday and I will get it in the mail this week. Donald had an interesting drive last evening going to Sandusky. Around Wooster OH, there were trees and power lines down and he had to take some strange detours through neighborhoods he normally wouldn't go. He even said he was watching a power line jumping alongside the road when he had gotten directions through the neighborhood and felt the power line hit the trailor, no damage done to the trailor. After they unload him this morning, he will be traveling to Youngstown then back south to Columbia SC to deliver in the morning. He does keep on the go. Ulla, you asked about a good diet. I have lost weight on the American Diabetic Diet, where you have a certain number of meat, carbohydrates, fruits/vegetables, fats, milk that you can eat on a daily basis as well as regular exercising. This is the baisis of the First Place diet I spoke of earlier. You don't have to completly give up everything but everything in moderation. I will try and find the exchange list system as well as the amount of each food item on a per day baisis and post it for you. edit: here is a pdf of the exchange list for diabetic diet http://www.uaex.edu/Other_Areas/publications/PDF/FSHED-86.pdf I have the diet plan at home and will post it later.

Our support group had a nutritionist at the meeting this week and she said that soy in food should not affect our pr+ but to avoid taking mega dose supplements. When my son was in the 5th grade he was dx with severe allergies to shrimp, peanuts, and soy so I actually had to rid my kitchen of soy products and I still find myself reading labels for no-soy, even though my son in 23 and not living at home. I may have to start eating a little bit more to try easing my 'vacations in Hawaii' Sheila",

She let me get up off the table and look in the full length mirror in the room and it didn't look that bad, just still red because it was not healed yet. After the ps came in and checked out the way it was healing, she just put large gauze pads over the incisions and let the sports bra I brought in hold the bandages in place, no more tape!

After my first lumpectomy which left me obviously lopsided (a cup/c cup), my surgeon gave me the script for mastectomy products. I called BCBS and they wanted to know the codes that it would be filed under before they could answer my questions. Of course I didn't know the filing codes. Fortunately, the woman who fits in this area (over 20 yrs) knows the various insurance companies and what they will and won't pay for and gets you the maximum number of bras she can. Also, if you have met your deductible, she accepts what the insurance pays as 100% of the bill. She managed to get me 6 bras (2 leisure/sport bras, 4 various other styles of bras) and 2 prost so I had a spare one. She said normally they allow only 4 but she knows how to file to get the leisure bras too. I am donating my prost to her for her boob closet for uninsured women. I wonder what she would have said if you called about a 'cranial prosthesis' which we know as a wig? But I won't go into the denial by the insurance of the use of AlloDerm in my recon, they paid for the actual AlloDerm on the hospital bill (3,500) but refused to pay the PS fee for putting the AlloDerm in (1000). Of course we appealed it for 6 months before they approved the bill. Sheila",

Sue, Please have someone check out your headaches.  And I am with the others, your bosses are just taking advantage of you. Just start checking out other job opportunities before you quit. I don't have time to comment on all posts (or the memory to know who said what! and I didn't even have chemo). I want to say I hope all have a happy and healthy new year. Check out www.throughhealingeyes.org and look at the calendar pages for 2009 calendar. You will be surprised at what you see. (note, don't use the tab on the left side of the page to see 2009. Use the Calendar button at the top of the page, then click on the front cover of 2009. Check out November. Sheila",

If so that link is not working but go to the top of the page where it says calendars and click on that tab and you can see the fronts of all the calendars and the 2009 calendar is at the bottom of that page. After opening up the 2009 calendar you will see additional pages on the right. Mine is the November page. I have notified Katheryn that the link on the front page of the site is not working. I just noticed that if you go to other pages on that site, the bar at the top of each page has other pictures from the 2009 calendar, they just are not identified as such. It is hard to say 'HAPPY NEW YEAR' because of all the sadness that has occured in 2008, but my wish for all is that 2009 will be healthier, better and happier than this past year has been.

There was some concern about his kidneys, he sees a renal specalist after his hip surgery, his kidneys didn't want to 'wake up' and had to have a dialysis to filter out the anestesia to wake them up.

I called him wed night to find out why he did not mow, his boss called him it to work because somebody else laid out, and he said that he would be by before Saturday to mow.  I am tired of the tall grass around the door and the run where I tie Penelope out.

I will let everyone know when I have them and how much to send to me so I can mail them out to you. I only have a minute to answer, I quickly read all the posts. This week the office is 'offically closed for vacation' but my boss has asked me to pop in for a couple of hours a day to enter the orders that are received via fax. I will get paid extra for this and since I live less than a mile from the office I am not burning that much liquid gold in the car coming to work for a couple of hours. so if I don't post much this week that is the reason, When I am at work I will be entering orders only, not waiting on the blooming phone to ring - it's unplugged!

I was so focused on him, I didn't realize that my foot hurt for about 5 minutes then it started throbbing. I looked down to see blood ozzing from around the toenail. Needless to say, I did not go to church. I was doctoring my toe and keeping it elevated. I had the same toenail torn of in almost the same place when I was in high schoot so I knew what to do. elevate and ice. I almost had to wear my flip-flops to work today because I couldn't get any shoes on over the bandage my dh put on yesterday. this morning, I took the bandage off and put a smaller gauze pad on the toenail and tape all over the toe to hold it in place.

I fix it where it melts in your mouth but he loved livermush, he never connected the fact that it was both liver - one beef and one pork. After I married my current hubby, he told John that he would eat what I fixed for  the family, none of this fixing something special for him and he then would eat the beef liver. After John first moved to  HI we tried to send him a care package in a styrofoam container with dry ice in it but it melted before he got it. I should have sent it overnight priority instead of priority and it would have gotten there safe. I think that there are only about 5 companies that make livermush. When my hubby's uncle (legally blind) would send us to get his groceries he only wanted 'Hunters' livermush. One time I couldn't find Hunters and got him Neese's Livermush and he gave it to me and refused to eat it. Anne, hope you get the bear problem straightned out before you head East. Sheila",

I also go to a yoga class once a week. After the yoga class last night I walked 10 minutes and this morning before it got so hot walked again for 20 minutes (I added another loop to last night) then came back to the house and did some yoga stretches to cool down.

Sue, I know that the periods are a PIA but as the others said, it shows that we are still young (my niece's husband didn't believe that I will be 48 in October). We need to just enjoy our youth. My surgeon brought up removing my ovaries because of the ovarian cancer in the family but he felt it best if I keep my ovaries for my bone strenght and if I have any problems removing them at that time.

He does like to ski and from my house the ski area is about 45 minutes north, but with his bad knee, I don't know if he will be able to ski without pain. Here we get 2 or 3 snows a year, we are far enough down the mountains that it doesn't stay long, and it is enough for me to enjoy. I used to live in Ohio and we were lucky if we saw the ground from Jan-Mar. Donald said he gives John 1 winter to want to come back south.

If I had seen this before I went to Lunch, I would have brought the memory card today. I am working on a baby quilt now for a friend at work, he and his wife are expecting their first child in August and I took a class recently on a quick-n-easy quilt. I can have a baby quilt cut and sewn up in about 8 hours with most of it machine work and very little hand work. I had to wait until I lost the hand wraps before I could finish up that quilt. I actually have 2 of them nearly finished, one is more of a toddler size for my great nephew's 1st birthday the end of May and the other is for the guy I work with. Now the wall hangings I do for my office are different, I do sew them together by machine (most of the time) but do the quilting by hand. as you can tell, Lisa, I am also bored at work today!

The top one I pinned the block for my grandmother to my valentine quilted wall hanging, I haven't taken it down yet .  All the hankies in Grandma's block belonged to her mother and sister in-law from the 1930's. I hand appliqued each piece of hankie on a base fabric, then hand quilted around each block. I found a scroll heart quilt design to quilt in the border. I embellished the block with vintage buttons from Aunt Alice's button box. Donald came up with the idea for the lace edging on the block. Some of the white ones don't show the white embroidery on them in the photo but they are all beautiful. The C in the middle is for Cora Reeder (my great grandmother) but my grandmother's name is Coral. I plan on making a larger version for my office wall. Sheila",

She hasn't seen it yet. I will be giving it to her next week (Saturday) at her Birthday party. I started on this wall art in Feburary and finished it in May so it wasn't too long in the works. What takes longer is the bigger pieces and more extensive hand quilting. I do have to thank her for my love of sewing and quilting. She had me sewing at a Tredle sewing machine when i was about 8 or 9 making stuffed rag dolls and clothes to put on them. I only hope to get as good with my quilting stitches as she has done in the past. Due to her age, arthritis and macular degeneration, she doesn't sew any more. Also, to be in my quilt guild you have to have more than 5 projects in the ufo stage . Sheila",

We had about 55 people there for the party, 33-35 came in from out of state. Grandma's (younger) brother had flown in from CA to OH to see their other brother who planned to attend but a medical procedure done last week prevented him from traveling, so their nephew (son of the third brother) drove down with D from OH. We had 2 minor injuries on the playground, skinned knee and bumped head, that was good considering there were 13 children under 15 yr old running around on the playground. Everyone enjoyed the KFC buffet that we had catered. Mom paid upfront but had everyone pay her a set amount to cover the expenses. We finally left the church picnic shelter at 9:00 pm dog tired.

She had corrective back surgery at age 11, ended an abusive marriage in her 20's, faced precancerous lumps twice in 2 years in her 40's. Then when the third lump was tested and came back as cancer, she was strong enough to choose bi-lateral mastectomy, with reconstruction. This battle has made her stronger. She has reached out to others and encourages them in their fight. So when someone says, \u2018she is built like a brick house\" think of the strong women who fight, and to live, against cancer This is all a journey and if we can help others going through this it eases the load that each of us must carry.

I got a letter this weekend from the doctor's office, all my blood work was boringly normal. Although the FSH test wasn't mentioned in the letter and I will call today about that test. My hubby didn't make it home again this weekend but he was going to be 120 miles away Saturday night and he was running out of his blood pressure med, so Saturday afternoon I took a road trip and met him at a hotel next to the truck stop. His load didn't deliver until this morning so we had plenty of time to be together and relax. We managed a late nite run to Walmart to get his supplies for this week in the truck and got his laundry done in the truck stop laundromat ($2.00 to wash and $2.00 to dry). I forgot to tell John that I wasn't going to be home Saturday night and he called at 12:30 asking where was I. He was just getting in from Buffalo Wild Wings and was worried about me. He thought I was just driving up and back - not spending the night. Judi I can't look at facebook but I know that you are proud of your son's accomplishments. I do need to get back to work. Sheila",

Mom and her brother met Thursday with the social worker from Hospice and she was going to get an RN 2 days a week and an assistant 2 other days a week. Well, Saturday morning the CNA at the nursing home had gotten grandma up, dressed and into her wheelchair. She left and said that she would be back with Grandma's breakfast tray. When she came back into the room several minutes later (maybe 10), grandma was slumped over in her wheelchair. They called Hospice and my mother. She and Dad went to the home and sat with Grandma. Hospice sent the nurse and the social worker again and they monitored Grandma's condition. She peacefully went to sleep about 2:30 pm. We are preparing to leave tomorrow (monday) to Ohio after dad has his doctors appointment at 9:00 am. I am going with my parents because mom can't drive yet with her broken foot. The funeral will be Thursday morning. I will be on in the morning but not any the rest of the week. Sheila",

Grandma had lost strength in her left side due to a stroke a couple of months ago and they were taking good care of her. She could move some by herself in her chair but because of the oxygen she was on, couldn't leave the room. The women who was grandma's room mate in the room she was moved from a month ago told mom that she cried when they moved Ms Coral to the other hall. Mom went over to tell her that grandma wasn't doing well and she wanted to come over to that hall and see her. Ms Willemena offered the most beautiful prayer for Grandma and the family. Several people (residents and staff) made comments that when Ms Coral came in the room, her smile brightened up the room. That is what I am going to miss is her smile.",

Dave was married twice, first wife was killed in a head on auto accident 1 mile from my grandmother's house, they didn't have any children, both were teachers at the high school.  He would come over and spend time with us. His second wife had children from her first marriage and they didn't have any together. After Dave retired from teaching, he and his wife would occasionally travel from OH to Myrtle Beach, SC to golf and they would stop off here and have a meal with our family. My DH's job is steady, he drove almost 3000 miles in 5 days, left out Monday morning at 4:00 am and got home at 6:00 pm Friday. He is averaging around 2600 miles a week. I am still working, my 'official date' is June 25, but my boss said that I may be working into July. I have the thinking that I will work until they tell me to leave. Last night my DH and DS took me to the 9:50 show of 'IronMan 2' for Mother's Day, the thing is after 11 I am likely to fall asleep where ever I am. I missed about 20 minutes of the movie taking a power nap, and the 20 minutes I missed was the big fight scene close to the end. I guess I will have to wait for it to come out on DVD to see what I missed . Happy mother's day to all and may your children treat you to something special that you really want to do. Sheila",

Just think of it this way, with Ella and Landon going to the center during the day, you will be more rested up to do more with them when they are with you. More quality time not quantity time. Also remember you are dealing with the effects of breast cancer wearing you down as well. And as you said, if Amanda had done things the right way - you wouldn't be facing this tough decision now by yourself. Sheila",

You are not nosey, I just want to help anyone I can.  One month after my surgery, I was going into my PS office and saw a woman walking with two pillows under each arm coming out and I asked her in the parking lot if she had bilat. She got this strange look on her face and I told her that I had it done June 1. She then asked me if it got easier, her drains were just removed that day. I told her that if her drains were out, she was on the road to recovery. I have not seen her since but felt good to lift her up. Sheila",

I asked a man who was walking into the post office if he would help me carry the boxes in to mail them. I did not even need to use the cancer card, he carried in more boxes than I expected him to, I was going to carry 2 but he said stack four boxes in his arms so I only carried 1.

My mom also grew up raising chickens, beef, and pigs and talks about slaughtering them for the dinner table. Talking about unusual foods. My dad would hunt on the farm where we lived in OH and we would have pheasant or rabbit occasionally. One time we had a visiting pastor and our regular pastor and his family over for dinner and mom served ham and rabbit. Our pastor's wife decided she would try the rabbit and as she was chewing the small bite, her husband started talking about the pet rabbit that they used to have behind their house and the big brown eyes . . .  she had to spit out the bite because she could not swallow it. Several years ago, my DH was out of work and his cousin gave us all the venison (deer) that we wanted, he loves to hunt but his wife does not like to cook it. It kept meat on the table. I learned how to cook venison several ways and when we have pot-luck dinners at church several people ask which dish is mine and if it is venison. I have a great venison BBQ recipe that my DH helped me to refine, as well as stew and roast. If you did not know it was venison, you would not know it. The cousin still tells me to come and get meat out of his freezer when it starts getting full. AE - great timing on the biopsy, hoping for b-9 Judie, don't slink back into the hole, you have all of us to brighten you up. Sheila",

I usually have to sit there and rub her and tell her that she will be ok when there is a storm or somebody is setting off fireworks in the neighborhood. We have had 3 weekends of rain on Saturdays, great news for the drought. we now can wash our cars 2 saturdays a month and water our grass 1 day a week (not that I water my grass), but the boy who mows my grass can only do it on Saturdays and Penelope won't go in the grass that is now taller than she is.

I did not put on weight but then I did not lose any either. After my mastectomy last summer, they took me off the tamox but are watching my ovaries for problems. I physically can't carry another child but I need the hormones to help my bone strength. You can also check on the hormone section and see what others are saying about tamox. sometimes I wonder about these doctors, they don't know what is going on in your head and if you need the antidepressants, they should give them to you, even for a short time to get you through this traumatic situation. I also have an answer to weighing yourself, I was part of a 'First Place' weight group and they said to weigh yourself every day at the same time, don't obsess with gains or losses day by day, but make a chart and write it down every day and once a week take the weigh-ins and average them for the previous 7 days to get your average weight. This takes into account the daily fluctuations for hormone changes and you get a more accurate weight. Sheila",

I guess he planned ahead. The temps here on Friday morning were in the 60's. Today we got in the 70's and sunny. yesterday it was 60's and cloudy. I thought you were going to try and come in before the temps and humidity got unberable? Can't wait to meet you in August! Suebee, let us know how your surgery went. Back many years ago, I stripped a spindle bedframe of layers of white paint and the dresser. The Donald broke one of the spindles out from the footboard so we got rid of the bed but my sister is turning the bedframe into a daybed with the footboard cut in half and bolted to the headboard to make the arms of the daybed. It was the bed that we had when we were growing up. I kept the dresser. I don't know if I will be stripping anything else, those groves in the spindles were hard to strip. I need to get back to work.

At Crossville TN there is a Vanity Fair Outlet mall. I got 2 pair of Levi's - one pair jeans and one pair dress pants on clearance for 8.00 each. I went to the Liz Claiborne store and their 'mini' pocket books were on sale. Suggested retail price was $38 each, their regular price is $20 each but they were having a memorial day sale at $10.00 each. Of course I bought 2. I never buy 2 pocket books at a time. That was one time when I was by myself over the weekend. we went to the mall and said that we would meet at a specific time at the car. When I came back with bags, one very large with both pocketbooks in it, they could not believe the sales that I got. I did not go into some stores because we have similar ones close to Hudson. AE, I just checked up on the pinkstock page to see what was going on but I will not be able to go, it is too far from NC for me to go by myself. I did read all the pages but can't remember everything. I am glad that someone is always here to help one of our sisters when she is in the dark place. We are all here to help lift each other up and it is good because we all know what each other is going through. I need to go home and help my sister cut out a new set of sheets for her grandson tonight. He will be getting a new little brother this week and she wanted to take something special for his new 'big boy' bed. Sheila",

I wanted the ralox because of the lessened risk of uterine cancer and blood clots than tamox. edited to say: I just looked up the star study http://www.cancer.gov/STAR and it did say it was done on post meno women at higher risk of BC and when he suggested it to me I was pre-BC.

Ulla, glad to see you, sorry the doctors don't take the whole person approach (mental and physical) Love all the picts. I went to a quilt show over the weekend and forgot my new digital camera so I didn't get any wonderful picts of the quilts that I saw   and boy was I inspired. There was one done with new embroidered hankies in a crazy quilt design. My mom went to her aunt's estate auction last week and got me some of the original embroidered hankies as well as dresser scarves. I have not seen them yet but the 'new hankies' quilt gave me an idea for doing them in a hanging for my office. Sheila",

The swelling has been reduced a total of 4 cm (over 4 sites on my hand and arm) but until the gauntlet gets here, I have to keep my hand wrapped.

Yesterday Ian unwrapped what I did on Sunday and said that it looked good, I had the wraps where I needed them and in the proper sequence. He send more home with me yesterday so I could rewrap it again tomorrow. Jane, sorry to hear about your mother not doing well, my grandmother will be 95 on the 22nd, she is still going strong, although not as agile as she has been in the past.

When I went for my therapy at the rehab section of Quest 4 Life I used my medical spending card (WW) to pay for my therapy. the first bill for evaluation was $162 dollars, then they had me pay different amounts each visit to get up to my $400 deductible (2 @ 100, 1 @ 38). The company who administers the medical spending card has rejected the $162 charge but has approved all other charges. I misplaced the receipt from Q4L and they faxed me a copy of the receipt which shows the account number, date and amount charged. I in turn faxed it with the required verification form to WW on Friday. Yesterday I get an email stating that the receipt was denied by WW. I called WW and they said that I need a detailed receipt showing what was on that charge. I called Q4L and she said that their usual fee for evaluation was $162 and if I needed a detailed receipt, I needed to call the billing dept at the hospital. It took me 3 tries for someone to pick up the phone (I let the phone ring at least 10 times before hanging up), They are mailing me a detailed receipt to fax back to WW to get this charge approved. I have to get it approved before they suspend my card privledges, I have over $1000 left to spend before the end of the year and I am going to get my new glasses in 2 weeks. And Cathi, 3 of my 4 ceiling fans have quit on me and I don't know how to fix them other than replace them and boy do I miss them! Fortunately yesterday and today the humidity is lower here than it was over the weekend. Money is tight everywhere. Donald got an 'incident' put on his record at his trucking company (not on his license) where he backed into another semi in a truck stop and busted the front fender (fiberglass) of the other truck and he has to pay his company $500 to cover the damages. Fortunately they do have payroll deductions. they are taking $50 for the next 10 weeks.",

When I left my first husband with a 3 month old I moved back in with my parents, I already had him in a private day-care center.  I took him with me when going to the store or running errands. When he started kindergarten, she would take him to school in the morning and pick him up in the afternoons, along with my niece and nephew (single parent as well). After I moved out (he was 2nd grade), I put him in the 'wrap-a-round center' at the school so Mom didn't have to take him to and from school. When I started going to college to get out of the factory, my whole family helped watching John in the evenings while I was in school. When I started dating my current husband, John was old enough (10) and he went along on our 'dates' when we went out, but mostly our dates consisted of Donald coming over after work and sitting at the house. I may have taken advantage of my mom but she said that she enjoyed the time she has spent with all of her grandchildren and she was trying to help a financially strapped single parent. She now babysits her great grandchildren 1 night a week during school while their mother gives 3 oboe lessons. If my sister isn't working her 2nd job, she will watch the 2 boys and give my parents the afternoon off. And about the bassett hound, that choice of dog was my husband's idea, and yes she got me up at 5:30 this morning again. Sheila",

He has not had much contact with either because he and his bbro were separated when they were small and adopted to different families in different parts of the state.

His half bro lives in GA and we just found out about him after finding Don's mom 12 yrs ago and he is married with 2 children. Poppy good to hear about the fluid going down.

John loved to pick up the rocks and carry them around the house. When it was winter, we had a 6 sided baby play yard (no bottom and flexible to shape) that we put around the wood stove to keep John from getting too close to the hot stove and playing with the rocks. The sides were short enough for my dad reach over to stoke the stove but high enough to keep John away from the danger. That was one thing we could't keep him away from when it was hot. There are a few areas that do need to be baby-proofed but not every area, they just need to know their limits. Sheila",

Another doctor I have to train. We had the Komen Luncheon this past weekend and it was fabulous. The cancer coordinator started out the luncheon in her welcome by saying that this luncheon was all about all the ways we get support: support from our families, support from our house of worship, support from local support groups, and even support from a good bra (that got a laugh). The survivors had name tags in the shape of a bra with a pink ribbon between the cups and their guests wore pink hearts. The entertainment part of the program just said 'Glitz and Glamour fashion show'. We kept it a secret that the fashion show was 'art bras' modeled by young women in black t-shirts. You should have seen the audiences reaction when the first model came out with her pink sequined bra on struting to the tune 'Diamonds are a girl's best friend'. Everyone embraced the fashion show and we received many comments about how fun the afternoon was. I will let you know when the photos are up on the wig bank site.",

Dawn, good to see you back. Ann, I loved your description of 9-11 as well as Ulla's description of what happened to her when she voiced her opinion. Nancy hope you have a great birthday. Sue hope you enjoyed your day off yesterday. remembrances of 9-11. I had come into work at the usual time of 7:00 am (it was before I was on the switchboard) and I was in my office in the corner and the radio said something about problems at the wtc. The guys in my dept also heard something about it but the program that they listened to always did practical jokes and they thought that it was a joke. I went on the net and saw the picts. the receptionist had a small b&w tv but she had terrible reception, she let me take the tv to my office since I was close to the outside wall and had an outside door right next to my office. I turned on the tv and had several people at the door watching what was going on. I then heard about the pentagon and I have a 2nd cousin who works there. I called my mom and she was trying to get intouch with his family to see if he was alright. Later that evening we did finally get info about the cousin, He worked on another wing of the Pentagon, he had not gotten to work yet, he was 1 train stop from the Pentagon when the train stopped and they were sent back the other way. That evening we had a prayer service at the church for those who had lost their lives as well as the families and friends and those involved in the rescue/recovery process. I think that is when John decided to join the service and finally settled on the Navy. He had tried to get an appointment to one of the military academies but had not gotten all the paper work filled out to the proper requirements so he decided to enlist instead. He sent me an email with an attachment with a deployment summary including the number of nautical miles traveled, gallons of fuel used, and food consumed while out for 6 months. You would not believe the quantity of food that they ate. Sheila",

Books, that is another thing, I enjoy reading historical novels. There is one author I enjoy reading, Inglis Fletcher. She wrote about North Carolina during the time when we were ruled by Brittain and the revolution. Some of her books are out of print but I have a signed hard bound copy I got at a yard sale about 30 yrs ago for a couple of dollars. The book was published in the 50's and I still have the paper jacket on the book. What would antiques Road show say about that. I also enjoy reading the authors Bodie and Brock Thoene. They also write historical novels. The main sets I like from them are about post WWI in the US (Shiloh Chronicles), another set about pre WWII in Europe/Holy Land surrounding the treatment of the Jews (Zion covenent), another set about the creation of the country of Isarel (Zion Legacy). You can tell I am a history buff. These books are based in fact with a little creative plot lines that run through out all 3 sets. I have collected the complete set of the Shiloh Chronicles (3 books) and most of the Zion covenent, but borrowed the other books from the Library. In all honesty, When I found these books at the library, I looked to see which was written first (zion Legacy), second (Zion Covenent) and last Shiloh Chronicles. so the first time I read them, I read them backwards.

My mom came by every day to help me around the house cleaning and taking me to appointments. If you follow the suggestions on the surgery threads, you will do fine. I found out the hard way to get the non-child proof caps. fortunately my mom had a collection of non-child proof medicine bottles at her house and brought several to my house and we were able to peel the labels off my bottles and put them on the new bottles to identify the medicines. btw, I sent you a pm about after surgery camisoles. I am off this week but my hubby is driving, he should be home tonight and be here tomorrow for the fourth. Saturday we are going to his biological father's house for a cookout and fireworks. I could have traveled with him this week but we would have had to put Penelope in the kennels at the vets, and since she was there once this year already ($130 for 5 nights) we could not afford to board her again and I would not have had the chance to earn a little extra income. I saw Earleen Tuesday about my tattoos, she is great. She said that they weren't really that bad, just bad techique. she did some touch up to try and correct the color problem (orange tinge) and the dark ring around the edges. Anne, she said that when you come in if we have a chance she would like to go for lunch in Asheville with us and discuss your options. Need to get to work now. Sheila",

This week I have made 24 luggage ID tags out of colorful fabrics. They make your luggage stand out on the carousal at the airports. I can make 5 or six in a few hours. Earleen started the adjustments to my tattoos Tuesday. She has changed the color drastically according to Donald, before they were dark brown with an orange tinge, last night he said that they were a lighter brown and more on the pink side which is what I wanted in the first place. She also has softened the ring on the outside. She will blend the colors a little more when I go back in August. We will be going to my mother-in-laws today for lunch and time around the pool (no swimming for me - no soaking the tattoos for 2 weeks) and Donald's birth father's house tomorrow evening for a cookout and fireworks. We thought about taking Penelope with us tomorrow but she is frightened with fireworks. About 4 yrs ago Donald wanted to take her to the local fireworks display, we had her on the leash and when the first one boomed, she started shaking and tried to get away. we ended up putting her in the car so she wouldn't pull against us.

Sim's BBQ is by far the best as far as atmosphere as well as all-you-care-to eat BBQ, slaw, pickles, cowboy beans, and corn fritters with strawberry jelly (home made) and molasses. They have on Thursday night BBQ Chicken in addition to the Beef and pork. The owner comes around and makes sure that you are getting all you want, and he has a guest book that any new people there sign and you just might hear your name and hometown announced from the bandstand as well as birthday annoucments and anniversary announcements. They have a bleacher area beside the band stand so when you are finished eating you can sit there and watch the dancing (clogging) on the dance floor. They have impromptu square dancing with people who don't know what they are doing but all is fun. Sometimes they have a 'broom dance' - couples start dancing with one person dancing with a broom, when the broom drops, everybody changes partners and the odd person out picks up the broom to dance a little bit then they drop the broom and change partners again. They will get all the kids up for a great big line/circle dance. I have not been in a while but it is great fun. It is really an informal restraunt that started in a barn and we have watched it grow (expand) since we were taken to it the first time in 1978. The first time we went I didn't know where we were going, it is about 5 miles off the beaten path in the country. They have a campground next to the stream that goes through the farm and every August they have the Molasses festival where you can see them processing the sorgum cane into molasses. Sheila",

(I was put on tamox after my 2nd dx of ADH (pre-cancer) - 6 months before my dx of DCIS and doctor took me off of tamox after my surgery.) fumi, the calendar is created locally by a woman who had breast cancer and her friend is a professional photographer. It was started when Katheryn wanted pictures taken of her journey through breast cancer and it became an organization called 'Through Healing Eyes\". 2009 will be their 5th calendar and they ask local breast cancer survivors to be models in each calendar. They asked my mom and myself if we would pose together for the 2009 calendar and of course we said yes. My mom was dx in 2001 with ILC and went through the single mast, chemo and rads and is doing great. Their website to see samples of previous calendars is www.throughhealingeyes.org Lisa it is going to be a great year for Olivia. I remember how excited John was when he started his senior year. unfortunately, my hubby was laid off part of that year and John had to pay for alot of the expenses himself from his part time job at the grocery store. I wish I could have done more for him that year. Sbout me channeling this thread, my dh is more intune to things like that than I am. The story from his biological dad is one of his distant grandmothers was somewhat of a spiritualist and he has some of her talents. He can tell when somebody is not telling the full truth or trying to put on airs. If people ask he will tell them what he senses that they are feeling but he doesn't go around announcing his talent. He has surprised me many times with his talent. I need to get to work! I will check in later. Sheila",

My nephew did and his mom said the same thing - beats tattoos or piercing. But you should see him now, he has a wooden leg tattoo on his leg, several other tattoos as well as a few piercings. He is about 28 now. Good luck Anne on your cook out. Last night we got hit hard with the remnants of TS Fay and there was major flooding in Charlotte. It has stopped raining today but calling for more before the end of the week. but it is helping with the drought conditions. Did you hear about the 21 yr old woman from Hannah's BBQ in Lenoir who was missing for 5 days? She left work last Wednesday about 10 pm, stopped at Wal Mart to get some dog food and a few other groceries, stopped to get gas in Valmead and never made it home at Buffalo Cove. They found her truck Monday night off hwy 321 and she survived until then. She is now in Charlotte recovering from surgery on her broken leg(s) and dehydradation. She couldn't get to the stuff she bought at WalMart - it was in the bed of the truck. They don't know how she survived 5 days without any water source. It was on GMA and the Today show this morning. John took mechanical drafting classes at the high school but it was a college class. He is thinking of picking it back up when he gets discharged from the military. He also was in the video productions class for 4 yrs, produced the local school news program for 4 yrs and videotaped the football games for 2. He lettered in both soccer and football but never put on a football uniform. Great Wednesday to all. Sheila",

Each step has its time frame before moving on to the next step. My PS said that he needs at least 8 months to create a good boob, my 8 months was up the first of Feb.

The HR person said that there were only 3 or 4 votes between each of the three, the warehouse guys didn't even send in their votes, I guess because they didn't have anyone dressed up this year to vote for. The other two women (ghost bride and 1920's flapper) both said that they voted for me because they knew how much work I had in making my costume.  The ghost bride had a white skirt and top she bought from Goodwill, a tulle drape over that (gathered at the neck and waist), long black wig, a grey lace veil and fishnet stockings pulled on her arms as gloves. The Flapper had a black fringe cocktail dress she borrowed from a friend, fish net stockings and a feather boa. After lunch they both put on jeans, I stayed in costume, except for my braid, I couldn't stand it pulling my hair any longer so I took it out. I had to leave the hat on to cover where I had a ponytail to hook the braid to.  Here is the link to the pattern I used with a few modifications, I put a full circle skirt over the slacks and a veil to the hat. http://www.simplicity.com/p-1946-costumes.aspx Sheila",

He asked for a little of my history and I told him about the BC 2 yrs ago and no periods since July 2009. He said he would add the hormone blood test to the list for the lab and he asked me when I had my last mammo. I had told him that I had bilat with implants but it didn't sink in so I told him my ps said no mammos with the implants. He then asked if I was following up with the oncologist, I told him that my cancer was stage 0 and I wasn't sent to an oncologist. I did try drinking plenty of water yesterday to prepare for the blood draw but the lab still couldn't find a vein (after sticking me once in each foot and 3 times in my right arm - against my better judgment). they gave me the option of drinking more water today and coming back tomorrow morning to their office or write up orders for me to go to the hospital lab to try and draw the blood. I told the girls there, you had your chance, I will try the hospital tomorrow. I have filled my 32 oz mug up 2 times since 10:00 am with ice and water and will fill it up again at least 2 more times tonight before I go to bed.

He lived in Ohio and mom wasn't able to travel there for the funeral yesterday. She got several calls from family friends who missed seeing her and dad at the funeral home.

They won't guess how much this weekend yet but I am sure that they will make guesses by Thursday. Monday night I got home and my neighbor's friend was helping her by shoveling out her driveway, but he parked his truck directly opposite my driveway (he was shoveling some of the snow into the back of his truck to give him more weight/traction). He could have parked his truck on the other side of her drive and not blocked anyone. My driveway is an uphill grade that is narrow with a block wall on the right side of the drive and a grass bank on the other side. After the road is plowed, I get the usual 'hump' of road scrape at the bottom. If my wheels aren't almost straight when I hit the 'hump', I can't make it up the driveway. I attempted to go up my drive but with my wheels still turned, slid the front passenger side corner of my bumper into the block wall. I managed to back up into the street (without hitting his truck) and made another run up the drive and made it.  No major damage to my car, just need the bumper sanded off and repainted but boy was I upset. I walked back down the drive and asked him nicely to move his truck. Don hasn't seen the damage yet but he was more interested in my safety than the front bumper. Sheila",

They are mailing me a copy of the report so I can research what is going on (they wouldn't fax it ). What I have seen so far is if it is low-grade dysplasia they will keep repeating the test every 6 months until they get 2 that are normal. Should I be freaking out about this test result?

It takes me about 2 hours to make one and as I said I buy the yarn whenever it is on sale or at the 'dollar tree' or 'Big (Odd) Lots' stores.

I mentioned that I had a period last June and November and started spotting yesterday. I may start seeing him for my paps rather than my PCP since he didn't know squat how to read the path report or explain it to me other than saying it was abnormal. Sheila",

The pulmonary doctor he saw almost a year ago did some tests but didn't pursue anything. They thought it was his blood pressure and heart causing the dizziness.

Last week he was doing worse, he couldn't walk from the living room to the bathroom without stopping to catch his breath. He went to the urgent care and they sent him straight to the ER with pnumomia, his O2 level was below 80. The hospital admitted him last Friday night and dx him with possible COPD.  He was released Wednesday with an O2 tank and a concentrator at home. But the doctors are sending him back to the pulmonary doctor he saw last year since he is the only pulmonary doctor in the county. Mom is going with him and ask the dr point blank, why did he not discover this last year and ask to be sent to another specalist in Hickory. My dad is a retired machinist, his job involved grinding metal that threw up dust that he breathed. We feel that this has alot to do with the COPD.",

Last night I tried to clip her nails and she thought I was playing with her until she saw the clippers then she ran from me and would not come near.

After my 2nd biopsy in 18 months (once in each breast) for ADH (pre-cancer) my surgeon suggested the bilat as a prevention because of the strong family history as well as the 2 abnormal biopsies. You just wonder what the person who said not to do that would do if they had the same dx. It is a very personal decision and you are the one who has to live with that decision, not the person who is telling you not to do it. You need to follow your heart in this.

Sue, I hope you are feeling better and have a great day at work. Cathi, I too had the emotional roller coaster after I made my decision to remove both breasts. I was second-guessing my decision up to the night before surgery. We all go through the what if I made the wrong decision thinking. One day I would say I am fine with losing my breasts and then a few minutes later I was saying what in the world was I thinking! Why do I want to remove my breasts! At least the doctor had suggested I consider preventative bilat mast at my 2nd abnormal (ADH) biopsy and I had 6 months to think about making that decision before I was forced into the decision. for me it was a good decision, the final path report showed more ADH in the cancer breast and Hyperplaysic Ductal cells in the other breast. If I had gone with the lumpectomy/rads I probably would have been facing a 2nd dx later and who knows . . . it might have been invasive at that time and not found in the early stage again. Sheila",

The rumor has it that next year, our unused sick time will be lost at the end of the year. Now any unused sick time is a bonus check at the end of the year that helps out with Christmas.

I am a volunteer at the wig bank and there was a call for desserts for the Christmas party for the local survivors of all cancer in the county, so I did my duty and made a strawberry cake last night. It was a new recipe (from Betty Crocker Ultimate Cake mix cookbook) and it smelled good last night when I was baking it. I don't know if I will get a piece of it tonight or not. I hoped that when John came in last night he wouldn't cut a piece out of it before he went to bed and he didn't. Cathi, before you know it 6 months will have passed then a year. It has been 18 months for me as of the 1st of December. Saturday will be my 12 yr anniversary being married to Donald and that has really flown by. Sheila",

When I was recovering from my surgeries we decided to replace my kitchen facuet. The flexible supply lines from the cut-off valve to the faucet were old and when we tried to remove them to replace the sink, they started leaking also, so we had to make another trip back to Lowes Hardware for new supply lines. We did eventually get the job done, what should have been a 30 minute job turned out to take almost 2 hours. Then last year, I came home from work to smell something overheating and found water on the floor under my water heater, it had sprung a leak, so I turned off the power to the water heater and cut the water supply to the heater. I remembered where all the valves were . Unfortunately it was Tuesday afternoon and my hubby was on the road so I had to deal with getting the water heater replaced on my own. I called his cousin, who does home repairs, and he was able to replace the heater on Thursday. I too don't know when to stop trying to do things on my own if it needs to get done, who else will do it. I got home yesterday and all the rain that we have been having was showing the leak in the porch again and I found another piece of a shingle in the driveway from the winds. Can't wait to get the tax check back to replace the roof. Sheila",

Donald called me after he got his trailer emptied in Greensboro NC and drove back to Statesville (130 miles)to tell me that the company in Greensboro had a policy to take a key to the truck while they are unloading it and give the key back as you pick up the paperwork showing where you emptied. He gave them the key ring that had the truck, house, car, etc, keys on it and when he went in to pick up the paperwork, his dispatcher was giving him a hard time (arguing with him) about getting some repairs done on the trailer that Donald said needed to be done on the air lines, needless to say, he didn't get his key ring back. Now his dispatcher is upset with him having to drive back to Greensboro to get the keys then to Salisbury where he will be picking up in the morning. He will not get paid for the extra miles since it is not a dispatched load. He keeps a spare key in the truck ignition and uses the key on his main key ring to lock and unlock the door, that is why he didn't miss it until he went to get in his personal car and come home for the evening. I had to talk him down from being upset. Sheila",

My dr suggested after the 2nd one that I might want to consider bilat as a prevention. Before I had the chance to tell him I wanted the bilat I was dx with DCIS. Don't second guess your original decision of treatment. You did what you and your doctor felt best for you. Judi. Glad it is normal pain not infection. They should have warned you that this surgery was more painful. Since I had recon at the same time I had no idea what the pain level should be with just one procedure over the other. this crazy weather. We got just a dusting of snow here but the higher elevations got 6-10 inches with temps in the single digits. Donald calls me when he is in the Northeast telling me how much he hates the snow. I thought his load delivered today in Monroe township NJ but it doesn't deliver until tomorrow. He could't drive that many miles in one day. He stopped last night in Abbington Virgina and the temp there was 13 degrees. Nets, glad you found this wonderful group of ladies. We laugh and rejoice over the craziest things and worry over the least little possible setback. If you have the 'bad' cancer I guess I had the 'good' cancer. Mine was contained in the duct and since I did bilat mast I didn't need any additional treatment. I too felt like I wanted this alien thing out of me, I called it my 'ticking time boobs'.  But my mom had ILC in 2001, single mast, chemo and rads, so she did the scarf/wig/hat thing after her dx.

He spent a few minutes in with his mom and we went to talk to the oldest sister to see what the doctor had to say yesterday afternoon. She said that he didn't come by when she was there and they don't know what the plans are for mil treatments next. I don't know if they are going to stay today until they see the doctor or what is going on. Fran said weakly last night, that if she wasn't doing any better today, she wanted to be transfered to a larger hospital about 20 miles away today. Her hands were so swelled up with fluid it is pathetic. We asked sil about how were her kidneys functioning and she said she is putting out so they were working. My feelings are that they may be functioning but not at 100% and if they do a dialysis to pull some of the fluid off, she will start to improve. About the cinderella story, his mom also treats him like the step-mother. She will call him mid week and ask if he can do something for her when he comes in on the weekend, then before the weekend gets here, she gets one of the daughters to do it and not bother to call him and let him know that the job has been done until we show up ready to assist her. That has pissed me off so much in the 12 yrs we have been together, I just try to overlook it but there is no excuse for their behavior.

I told her that I went through it the first of June and was getting my fills. She got a look of relief on her face and asked if it got any better, she just had her drains removed. I told her that since she got her drains out, she was on the road to recovery. I was glad that we just happened to be there that day at the same time so I could encourage her. Lisa, I had short term disability with my company $300 every two weeks. It was not much but it did cover all the insurance that I have taken out.

My doctor did it in the OR on Thursday and I went to work on Friday, I had some pain meds but did not take any. I kept them bandaged for 2 days before showering. After the shower I bandaged again with gauze pads we cut holes in the middle of to poke the new nipples through to prevent them from getting squished with another pad over the top because they were still bleeding slightly. He used dissolving sutures on the nipple and removable sutures on the sides. They look huge when they are first made but now they are closer to normal size. Sheila",

Friday morning, my boss had me change a setting on my internet proxy settings and I lost the internet until Monday afternoon when he had me change them back. Cathi, After my family moved to NC, my father went in partnership with a friend and he was working so many hours at the tool/die shop, mom actually started taking supper to him most evenings. We would pack up the meal and take it and eat in the office area so we would still have family time with him then we would go and help sweep up the shop. If OSHA found out the shop would have been closed. They stayed in the partnership about 1.5 yrs and Dad told him that he wanted out and the partner bought out dad's portion. One quirk of a truck driver is if product is damaged sometimes he gets to bring it home. In the 3 yrs he has driven, we have gotten a 20 lb bag of dog food that was torn open and refused, and a large container of laundry soap (before Christmas) that the plastic bucket was ripped by the forklift. (I am still using the laundry soap, I bought a different bucket to put it in to prevent it from moisture) Well now we have 48 bottles of Witch Hazel and 24 bottles of mouthwash that didn't show up on the bill of lading where he delivered yesterday. They refused the boxes because they wern't supposed to get it. I am trying to figure out what to do with the product. I think I will send some to the battered woman's shelter and to Hospice. Karen the pictures look lovely. Last monday we were looking at 4-6 inches of snow but by the weekend we were in the upper 70's. and that is why my sinuses are stopped up so bad today. They are calling for rain by the end of the week and cooler temps again. Talking about children, my son will be 24 this June so I am feeling old also. Sheila",

It follows the diet for the American Diabetes Association and there is bible study and memorization that goes along with the diet. You record everything that you eat and depending on how many calories you want to eat a day your amounts of protein, breads and starches, fruits and vegetables, and fats will vary. For me it is the writing down everything you eat and add it up at the end of the day to make you realize what you are eating that puts a curb on my eating. You also must drink plenty of water and exercized 3-4 times a week. My sister said she is going on it again and I may join her just so we can support each other, usually it is done in a small group setting. My sister-in-law started it at church and lost 50 lbs in 6 months but due to lack of interest except for our family has stopped the meetings. Sue I did have a small bump come up after my surgery but it was more like a pimple that wouldn't pop. It was nowhere near the main scar but close to the bottom of the reconstructed breast.

I just put myself in the capable hands of the surgeons and doctors in the OR and got ready for a nice rest. I actually went into my nipple surgery in December singing \"I'm getting nipples for Christmas!\" Of course by that time my nerves were settled and I knew that I was well past the physical bootface scare, I only had the emotional attachment to deal with. After my 2nd biopsy for ADH (6 months before my dx of DCIS) my surgeon looked at my mom and said she was my worst enemy as far as the cancer was concerned and for me it was also not \"IF\" I developed cancer but \"When\".",

You might want to start the tamox slowly (half dose for a month or two) so your body doesn't totally rebel against the medicine, if your onc agrees. I didn't and had severe hot flashes and terrible mood swings. Of course when I tried taking birth control pills about 11 yrs ago, I was the wicked witch of the west (according to my husband and son), so any hormonal medicines really don't agree with me. I opted for the bilat after my DCIS dx 6 months after my 2nd lumpectomy and didn't need rads or chemo so I can't help you with the rads questions.

I watched my aunt going through treatments for Ovarian cancer in 1978 when I was just 17, but we didn't know it was in her ovaries until after she died. All they could find in the Nuclear medicine dept at NC Baptist hospital was where it had spread to not the primary tumor. She and her family were living in the duplex my parents owned and I helped take care of her 2 boys (11 and 7). It did hurt when she died. About getting your hair done, my mom made an appointment with a close friend who does my mom's hair two days after I got out of the hospital to wash my hair and it did feel wonderful. She attends church with us and wouldn't let us pay for the wash and gave us a bowl of spaghetti and salad for our lunch. My hubby was so sweet this weekend, he bought me a Fons and Porters Quilting magazine and said that when I wanted to I could purchase any of the fabrics needed for a project out of the magazine for my birthday. What a man, he knows that I love my quilting but since he is a clutz in the fabric dept he would let me pick my fabrics. I had given my scissors (I have had for at least 25 yrs) that needed sharpening to my brother on Wed and he returned them Sunday along with a new pair of 8 inch shears and 3 inch embroidery sissors each with a lifetime warranty, a hug and Happy birthday, you deserve a new pair of scissors.

I had 2 previous scares (once on each breast 18 months apart) and I had lumpectomies after the biopsies showed ADH (pre-cancer) that didn't leave me very much scarred but lopsided (a cup/c cup). I also have a strong family history of breast/ovarian cancer (aunt ovarian cancer in 1978-passed away from it, and mother breast cancer 2001-doing great). After the 2nd scare in August 2006, my surgeon suggested I consider preventative bilat mast because my risk factors were higher than average and he put me on tamox at that point to see if it would protect me from invasive bc. The 6 months I was on tamox was pure torture for me, I had extreme hot flashes and night sweats as well as severe mood swings. At my 6 month follow-up mammo, another abnormality showed up again in the same area as the last surgery and I decided that I wasn't going to wait for cancer to come knocking again and opted for the bilat with recon (implants). I was able to go off the tamox and haven't looked back on my decision. My final path report showed more ADH in the right breast (side with DCIS) and Ductal Hyperplaysia leaning toward ADH in the left breast. What you need to remember about making your decision - it's your decision and no matter what anyone else tells you, you are the one who has to live with your decision without second-guessing yourself. I personally couldn't live with myself not knowing when Bootface would come knocking again, I know that bilt doesn't completely remove the chances of cancer returning but since I had problems in both breasts I didn't want to risk it. You will know in your heart when you have made the right decision. Sure before my surgery, I was wavering asking What was I doing to my body? and Am I doing the right thing but I knew in my heart that I was making the right decision for myself and my family.

My sister had a miniature collie mix for 12 or 14 yrs and when Danny had to be put down, they kept his tags, she found a cute biscuit shaped porcelain trinket box and has his tags in it with a picture of him sitting next to the box.

She came through her surgery last friday well (just resection not complete colonoscopy) but has not recovered as quickly as they think she should, they thought she would be out of the hospital by tomorrow. She came out of ICU on Sunday and put on 3rd floor of hospital. Monday her BP went up and they couldn't get it down, so she was moved to 4th floor 'heart unit' (close to ICU and able to monitor heart and bp closer). Tuesday morning her BP still wouldn't come down and her hemoglobin levels were down again. They put her back in ICU and gave her 2 units of blood. I saw her last night, her hands were swelled up like balloons and her face was puffy. they still haven't given her anything to eat, only 4 oz water every 4 hours. Don't know exactly what is going on or what the drs are planning to do next. SIL'S won't tell me much or my hubby and he is on the road. I can only get in to see her for 30 minutes in the evening but want to let the sils have their time with her. There are other visiting hours in the ICU during the day, but I am at work. They are taking time off from their jobs to sit at the hospital.",

I should have used a hoop when quilting it, it has a lot of bubbles but that gives it character. I don't have the time to reverse quilt it and start over with the hoop to keep everything flat. I am to the stage of sewing lace around the outside edge and heming the back to the front. When I get it done I will get a picture of it with her and try to get the photo posted.

Make sure you take some time for yourself today on your day off. Everyone is talking about children who were always cutting their heads, my little brother was one of them. he has a scar over his eyebrow where he fell on the corner of the coffeetable, a scar under his lower lip where I pulled him off the fire truck at a Waterball/fireman training session because my mom was ready to go home but he wasn't (my dad was a volunteer fireman) and many others I can't remember. Oh last year, at a tailgate party he hosts at the local AA baseball team, he gashed the top of his head and the rescue was called but by the time they got there the wound had almost stopped bleeding thanks to some first aid given by my hubby and some ice on the area. He refused to go to the ER for stitches. He didn't want them to shave his hair so the EMT basically taped a gauze pad over the gash and he wore a hat the rest of the night, he didn't want to miss the game! That is a committed fan. One of the other members of the party (with the team) even offered to take him to the trainers to get them to stitch it up. Nancy Why were you the last one to know! I would be highly upset to think that I was done, they gave me the paper and all then get a call you need boosts! Shari, you are welcome to join our group. As you have read we have pulled together to help others who are having a hard time with their dx.

It was actually 6 weeks from biopsy to surgery by the time I had follow up appointment with my surgeon to tell him my decision, consultation with ps, and the two surgeons to arrange their schedule for the OR. My final path report didn't show any additional DCIS but more ADH in both sides. My avitar is myself and my mom. It is the picture in the local breast cancer calendar for 2009. Just a reminder for those who wanted a calendar,  I have a couple of them reserved for those who said they want one but I am running low on my supply. Sheila",

Cathi, if you need drugs to get you through the next weeks/months, get drugs. I did not get totally depressed about losing my breasts, I guess because I had 6 months prior to my dx to think about it so when I made the decision that if I had one more abnormal mammo it was not a 'life threating' decision. I also have been very upbeat my whole life, almost a 'pollyanna', but don't get me wrong, I did loose it occasionally. We are here to help you 'get it together'.

She is in the National Guard and when her unit was deployed to Iraq I even mailed her care boxes. She calls me even more than she calls Donald. She had one comment to make last year after her first mammo, ' I didn't know that the US Gvmt had approved devices to hurt prisoners!' She had her first mammo.

My doctor said that cough would have to work itself out and could last 3 months, within 3 weeks of starting the herbal capsules, my cough was gone. According to books my dad has on natural healing, Olive Leaf extract is a  natural anti-fungal and anti-virual herb that doesn't interact with other medicines. Olive leaf extract can be found in the vitamin section at walmart and health food stores. Sheila",

I knew that only one Mickey would look stupid so I went back and bought 2 more at 75% off after last Christmas (7.50 vs 30). I would have never paid 30 for the kit myself so 75% off was a good price and I bought the plain red skirt for $1 at the same sale. I just have a little bit left to finish the last Mickey Mouse then position the 3 'stockings' on the red skirt and sew them on, and see if I need any additional items to pull them together. I am thinking that a few clusters of holly leaves between the Mickey's will make it look like a good tree skirt, not just 3 stocking kits I sewed to the skirt. I have a week left to decide what to do. She is putting the tree up this weekend but I am not giving it to her until Christmas day. Sheila",

We went to the Pumpkin Festival Saturday in Statesville and at 8:00 am is the 'Pumpkin Chunkin competition'. My brother's best friend is the professor of physics at the local community college and they put on this contest of building catapults that throw 3-4 lb pumpkins and they have a target that they try to hit, it is not just throwing it as far as they can, they have to be accurate. My brothers have made one the past 4 yrs and we go and support them. It was about 40 degrees when we got up and around 50 when the competition started. John said he was freezing. Eric lost by 20 points, they tried for the bonus target (25 yds closer than distance target but double points) one shot and that knocked them down the 20 points, they missed the target by inches. Here is a link to skill tv who was there and taped part of the activities the day before during practice shots. http://www.plantservices.com/industrynews/2008/137.htmlThey interviewed my family since we have a family of engineers, out catapult was not like the one in the video but looked like an erector set on steroids with large garage door springs used as the method of propulsion. I will check back to see if they put on the shots they did Saturday. Sheila",

Right now I think it is about 35 but with a wind to bring down the wind chill temp. Judi, I hope you don't have an infection going on.

The doctors couldn't find the primary tumor but only treated the mets. I was so scared when my mom was dx in 2001 with BC and watched her go through the same treatments that her sister went through 24 years earlier and realized that the treatments had changed drastically and watched my mom make it through her treatments and thrive after her cancer. When I was dx in 2005 with pre-cancer in the left breast and again in 2006 with pre-cancer in the right, and for the third time dx with DCIS in the right in 2007, I knew that I could make it. I am not posting as much now as I did when I was first diagnosed but still want to be here for those who follow to let them know that they can make it through this trial.

I don't know if using the small hook with the fine thread would affect your LE. I do manage to crochet with my gauntlet on, I don't know if the full glove would be a problem holding the thread. Also, if you have trouble holding the fine hook, you can use rubberbands wrapped on the handle to increase the size of the handle or there are comfort cushions available (both aluminum and steel hooks) that slip on the handle.

My boss and co-workers helped me that morning by moving the boxes for me and my boss sent me home early. It took a couple of days but everything settled down and my back spasms lessened. Fortunately it only took the one shot to help my back. Cathi, so sorry to hear about your bil's friend's in approprate choice of words. It sounds like something my in-laws would say. At least you tried to accept her apology but she stuck her foot in mouth again. Sheila",

I am part of the local breast health coalition and have sent her some pamplets from the Komen foundation as well as the ACS. My friend said that her mom didn't want to talk about it right now but I included a message to call myself, my mom, or the Cancer facilitator nurse at the hospital if she has any questions. My friend's daughter plays on the high school volleyball team and every fall they have a 'spike for the cure' match to raise money for the local Komen affiliate. The coach asked my friend if her mom would want to speak at the game but she said her mom doesn't like to speak in public. She then told the coach that she knew of a mother/daughter who would probably be willing to particiapte, and my mom agreed if they still were going to do it in October. I am going to get more brochures and shower hang tags to remind women to do self breast exams. Sheila",

I know a woman on the boards that had a bad reaction from taking the 20 mg pill straight off. Her doctor agreed to let her build up, she cut the 20 mg pill in fourths (5 mg) and took one a day for about 2 weeks then went to half a pill (10 mg) a day for about 2 weeks, and she now takes it 10 mg in the morning and 10 mg in the evening. I took it for 6 months after the second abnormal pre-cancerious biopsy I had, then when I had my surgery, the surgeon took me off of it. the only side effect I really noticed was the night sweats and hot flushes, though my hubby noticed mood swings. I wish I could give you any stats on the percentages based on the hormone status. I know that I was told when I started taking it that it would reduce my risk from 20% to 10% because of the family history of breast and ovarian cancer, but the odds did catch up with me and I was dx with early non-invasive cancer 6 months later. I am glad that your family knows now, but it is hard on them and on you because they cannot come and comfort you. It would be harder on them if they found out after anything else happened to you and they would question why were they not told sooner. I need to get back to work, Dear Ulla, try not to worry and ask again about the antidepressents, tell all your doctors what you are feeling and stress that you can't make it without some kind of help.

She was sent to NC Baptist and had all the diagnostic tests done that was available at the time and they were not able to find the cancer. She took chemo and rads, ended up with spots on her brain (May/June). She spent that summer in and out of Baptist for more tests and they still couldn't find the primary tumor. We had a wonderful summer though, taking a day and touring the Biltmore House (on her bucket list) and going back to the beach for a weekend (also on her list). She passed away in Sept from excess fluid around her heart and lungs caused from some of her meds. My uncle, who was a physician assistant, requested an autopsy. Her cancer was in her ovaries but so small it didn't show up on the scans. If she knew that it was in her ovaries she would have had them removed. I decided that if I was to be dx with cancer, I would do my best to treat the cancer but still have a good quality of life, that is what my aunt did. oops, while I was posting several others added hugs for all. It is a personal decision about what treatments you want for you. Sheila",

I have not talked to him since he got to Seattle but I am sure that he is wearing appropriate clothing now. I will try and let him know what to expect when he lands here Friday. Sheila",

Lisa, I was up early this morning preparing the venison for the marinate before I put it in the crock pot tomorrow. John's plane lands at 6:00 am tomorrow and he said he wanted my venison stew and barbeque while he is in. I went to my 'supplier' (my husband's cousin) Wednesday and got about 20 lbs of venison out of his freezer. I usually keep some at my house but I had run out. I never know when there will be a dinner at church and I get requests for my venison dishes. I started cooking venison about 5 yrs ago when my dh was unemployed and his cousin offered all the venison I wanted. It kept meat on the table and I actually enjoy it. The way I prepare it you cannot tell it is wild. My brother has season tickets for the local minor league baseball team Hickory Crawdads and he hosts tailgate parties throughout the season and he is having a BBQ party this Saturday for my son. My brother is making BBQ pork, my mom is making BBQ beef and I am doing my BBQ venison (dh calls it Bambi-Q). He has made quite a few friends there and I think that there are usually about 20 to 30 people at his tailgate parties. My parents also have the mini-season 20 game tickets. this is one thing that John wanted to do while he was home, go to the Crawdads game. I am also having some sinus problems from the pollen, hope I stay healthy while John is home. Stephanie, I am sorry to hear about your mother's dx of bc. Please encourage her to join the boards and learn all she can. My mom was dx in 2001, she went through a single mast, chemo and rads. She is doing great today. She is not connected to the internet so I was her personal reseacher. It prepared me for my dx April 2007. I need to get back to work. Hope all have a great day today! I will check in later. Sheila",

I am glad that you and your mother have a way of communicating so she knows that you are doing well. Sometimes the doctors are so arrogant. They need to try some of the medicines that they prescribe before saying that the se's are in our heads. When I was on the Tamox I only had hot flashes/night sweats and (according to my hubby) terrible mood swings. He said that I was having PMS symptoms every day. I was going to see about taking the effexor when I saw my surgeon again but I had the bad test and after my surgery he took me off of the tamox all together. Nancy, It is hard to fix the wild game right. When I was starting, I looked on line to get marinate recipes and the first one I tried was pretty good but I experimented the next time. That has been the only time in my marriage that my husband refused to eat what I prepared. The marinate was vinegar based and the whole stew tasted like the vinegar that I used and was un-edible. Since then I have found several commercially produced steak marinates do great. I thaw the meat out and wash it off, put it in a gallon zip storage bag, and pour the marinate on it. I let it marinate for 24 hours in the refrigerator, then put it in the crock pot with the secret spices and cook it on low for 8 hours. It tastes like a good cut of steak. I make it in stews, roasts, and of course the 'Bambi-Q'. Some people at church don't know that they are even eating venison when I take it to dinners. Sheila",

I could not pinpoint the source of the smell but kept looking. when I went to feed Penelope, I noticed that the kitchen rug I keep under her food/water dish was soaking wet. I know her too well and she doesn't spill her water, she drinks it up to the last drop. I checked and the counter/table water heater (looks like a metal base cabinet on the outside) had water dripping from the front and her dish sets to the side of it. My hubby was sleeping, getting ready for an all night drive to TX, so I had to figure out what to do on my own. I cut the power to the heater at the breaker box, I got to the water cut off valve to the water heater/bathroom and shut it off (I still have cold water to the kitchen sink), and figured out how to drain the tank (slowly into the bathtub) so I would have water close to flush the toilet. I called my handy-man (cousin) to see if he could install a new water heater today. I am waiting on his call, he said that he would be free this afternoon to put in the heater. To replace the water heater with the same type will cost $400 for just the water heater, if I want to go with the energy efficient tankless water heater it will cost me $450 just for the heater. I don't have room for a traditional water heater, unless I want it in the middle of my kitchen. I am going crazy waiting for Steve to call and say that he is on his way to the house and check things over. Boy, is this a long post. I just am crazy wondering what else will break at my house, first it was the AC now the water heater. Sheila",

My son was wearing his custom made pin stripe suit that he got in Puket. The preacher said that usually he gets one of the small children to draw the names but since we had a special guest attending, he wanted John to draw the names. John went forward and started drawing names. The preacher then started ribbing him that he better draw my name out or he would be in trouble. Unfortunately he did not draw my name but he bought my lunch anyway. Then they have all the Mother's come to the front of the church (I think we had about 45) and the children handed us small bedding flowers in cups, but the Preacher made John stay up with us and there were plenty of pictures taken with him in the middle of all the ladies and everyone left comes around and hugs each woman and wishes her a happy Mother's day. I got a few pictures on my 35 mm camera and as soon as I get the film developed, I will try and get them posted. John has been in and out all weekend and probably all week going and seeing friends from school. I am taking small blocks of time off from work to see him when he doesn't have anything else planned. Tomorrow he is going to see his friends from the Avaiation Explorer group and one of the members who has his pilot's license is going to take him flying in the vintage plane that he and his father restored and at the monthly meeting, John is going to have a slide show of the helicopter on his ship in action.

He has played soccer since he was 8 or 9 and played in middle school as well as High school. When he was in High school, his knee started acting up some, we just put an ace wrap bandage on it when it hurt, nothing major. Last year before I had my surgery, his knee started hurting more frequently. He went to the ship doctor and they sent him for an MRI, it showed that it was not the ACL causing the problem and he needed physical therapy to build up the muscles around the knee. The ship was getting ready for deployment and there was no time for him to schedule therapy on base. While on deployment he did the best he could with his knee hurting, taking 800mg Motrin, and exercising some on the exercise bikes on board. Since they have been back in port, they had the mandiatory PRT (Physical requirement training), he passed the sit-ups, push-ups but failed the time for the 2 mile run. He also failed the weight for his height. He will be discharged with administrative separation under honorable conditions (I think that is the right term). by the time he is officially discharged he will have served 4 and 1/2 yrs and will get his full GI benefits. It will be good to have him home or closer to home. sheila",

He would try and plan the most complicated routes for the marble to go. I need to do some cleaning, I still haven't touched John's room and he will be home in 2 months. Don't know what I am going to do with the stuff he has in storage now (left from his divorce in HI). Shirlann, You should see the NC Zoo in Asheboro. They have worked hard to make the exhibits as close to natural as they can. They even match animals together who would naturally be together in the wild. They have large areas for them to roam around. Sue, Just relax like the other woman have said, you are over reacting from stress. Please take time and relax. Karen, Love the puppy. Penelope won't have anything to do with water sprinklers, she runs as far as she can from them. I was hosing off the sidewalk which is next to her cable run and tried to splash her with the hose and she ran to the far end of her run and wouldn't come back until I turned off the water.  Fumi, sorry to hear about your reaction to UV rays, guess you need broad sprecturm sun block now. Need to get back to work, Love and hugs to all. sheila",

When my aunt was dx with her ovarian cancer her family moved in with my family so we could help take care of her. We had planned a trip to Asheville to see the Biltmore Mansion after school let out. The morning of the outing was the day my aunt started losing her hair. We had joked about the projected hair loss prior to that, but that day she said to go on with our lives, she put a hat on and would not take it off until we got home, then she had my mom cut her hair after getting the wig.  When my mom lost her hair, we had gone out for supper with her and dad, the next day she came to the office after lunch. I was not expecting her at work that day and at first I did not notice her wig, it was so close to her natural hairstyle and color. You can make it through this trial. Sheila",

You are just having side effects of the chemo. it can cause an ache in the bones while the marrow recovers from the chemo. Love Sheila",

I have found a woman in Asheville (about 70 miles) from me that will redo them over the 4th of July vacation for 'free' to honor her mom who died from BC in 1980.

Lisa, my ex called before our son turned 17 thinking he was going to be 18 and said that John needed to know about his sperm donor. John agreed to get a letter from him and it would be up to John to follow-up if he wanted to continue the relationship. His dad actually brought the letter to the grocery store when John was working and handed it to him and walked out of the store. We read the letter together and John decided that he did not need that influence in his life. Love everyone, can't remember all of my lovely sister's names. Sheila",

Hopefully I will be able to walk a little this evening after the sun goes down and it cools off some. The you on a diet says to walk at least 30 minutes a day, even if it is broken down into 3 10 minute sessions.

Karen, hope that the change in his meds helps. My dad has compromized kidney function and it causes low red blood cells. One doctor had him taking extra doses of iron but it did not help. he changed doctors and they sent him to a kidney specalist who has him taking injections that help the kidneys produce a hormone that helps the red blood count. Normally people on dialysis get this shot but he is not on dialysis. He is diabetic and that also complicates things. Wren, I have not yet really broken down over the loss of my breasts but I know that it is coming.

I am going to start talking it up at church and work and telling people that if they can't attend they can join the team for $20 and 'sleep in for the cure' on race day. Because it is their 10th anniversary, they are getting honorary co-chair people for the race from each of the 3 counties instead of one honorary chair person. I have sent in a nomination form for my mother. Tuesday night there was a team captain's meeting and several times during the meeting the race committee kept asking my opinion on how I have done things in the past to help out the first time team captains. And they asked me how we came up with our t-shirt designs. I wouldn't give them what our idea is for this year's shirt but talked about different shirts we did in the past.

I finished out my script then stopped taking it last June. My periods are still not back to what they were before. My mom couldn't answer my questions about it because she had a complete hyst done in the late 70's early 80's. Wren, when my dad had it done a couple of years ago by a different doctor, he had to drink the gallon on goo. That is what mom was expecting when they told her she needed one, but they had changed gp and the new gp sent her to a different dr to do it. I went to my ps yesterday and had the 'after' photos taken, he asked if I would allow the 'before and after' photos to be placed in his book to show new patients what he had done in the past. of course my head doesn't show so I said yes, if I can help others go through this process by showing the dr's success.

I told her that I had swelling in my hand and because of the nodes being gone (3 under the right and 4 under the left) I was needing a consultation to see if it was LE along with base line measurements. She said she would call the therapy clinic and get the appointment and call me back, but no call back yesterday. My hand doesn't hurt just looks funny between my thumb and index finger on my left hand. It is hard to tell if the swelling is moving up towards my wrist since that hand/wrist was always smaller than the right side (wrist measurement almost 1/2 inch different). If I don't hear anything by 11:00 I will call back and pester them again. Sheila",

Since they aren't a doctor's office but a therapy center, the cost is part of my deductible until I hit the $400 then the insurance will pay 80%, but I do have the flexible spending account to cover my out of pocket expenses. Debbie, I had to be the squeeky wheel to get this appointment for the evaluation at the LE clinic.

He is having me start wearing an icentonor glove for compression (he gave me one with full fingers and one with 3/4 fingers so I can still use the keyboard) to see if it will help. I go back on Friday for an update to see if the light compression is working. If not we will go to the heavier compression glove/gauntlet. He was impressed with how much I knew about LE and methods of caution to prevent it as well as treatment methods.

I couldn't think what I was missing and he told me and we had a good laugh with that. The last time I went to Niagara Falls my son was 5 yrs old. We went to the Canada side and went to the town of Saint Catherines and rode on an antique carousel for a nickle a ride. I don't know if John remembers it or not, he was scared of the animals on the carousel at first.

They wanted to see my tatts, so we found an empty room at the Museum of art, and I flashed my boobs . They were impressed with the work of Earleen so I gave them her web site and phone. Who ever thought I would be an exhibitionist! Sheila",

I was trying to work fast before the rain came in (we are offically out of the 2 yr drought) and my arm started getting tired but I persisted in getting the job done. Saturday morning my tricep area on that arm was sore, I thought just from working too much. But Sunday morning at church, I looked at my hands and noticed a swelling just behind my thumb. I called the doctor's office and she is the urgent care physician this evening at the office so I will go see her to get a referral to an LE therapist. I should have already been to the therapist to get base line measurements but didn't get the referral. I am a little bummed out about possible LE. I also missed the party at the bar last week.

The compression garments help move the fluid along while you are moving your hand/arm but I don't have the garments (yet).

I am thinking about taking a brochure from the clinic to my doctors office to explain the reasons for LE treatment early. Here I am on my soap-box again trying to convert the masses. Earleen told me that the color you see in the bottle before the tattoo is done changes when it goes under the skin based on the skin tone. I am not sure the exact combination that gets the orange tones but she was able to correct my color problem. Sheila ",

Others were there with their sewing machines piecing quilt tops and one woman brought in her completed 'X marks the spot' quilt top to use the Design wall to get the layout of the quilt top. All in all it was a productive day. I got two new quilt books for my birthday and looking at them, I am planning a new wall hanging for my office, a lone star quilt block.

I tried using photo bucket a couple of weeks ago at work and got a virus so my boss now has it blocked. Fumi, Why didn't you post the photo of Lisa dancing it would have added such color to our thread. This year my sister made a prom dress for a girl and made matching cumberband, tie and pocket scarf out of the dress fabric for her date so they would totally match. We have also done it for weddings. Oh, I did finish the wall hanging for my grandmother's birthday, except for the quilt label that gives the legend of the quilt. I am trying to find the right words to put on the label. Everyone who sees it is amazed that it was made out of handkerchiefs from the 1930's and I do have documents (note cards) to back up the claims. Sheila",

As they got home, my mom couldn't put weight on her right foot, she then agreed to let my sister take her to the ER. She got a hairline fracture in a bone in her foot as well as broke her nose. She is to follow-up with the ear-nose-throat doctor for her broken nose an the foot specalist this week. Judi I know about letting your child go away and not be able to see them for months at a time.

Of course I don't think so since I have been around sewing/quilting all my life, it is just something that I do. Everyone says that they don't have the patience to do that but when I am sitting at home watching tv, I need to keep my hands busy and quilting/sewing is better than eating, right? Cathi, your granddaughter sounds like my great nephews. The oldest one (3.5 yrs old) will pretend that he is stirring something on a pretend stove and come to you with the spoon and want you to taste what he is making. They are both good at entertaining themselves. The youngest (1 at the end of the month) is so funny, he gets into things his older brother didn't do at that age. Sue, I didn't have to take any AD's but you do need to see the doctor and get his input on medicine changes. I do need to get back to work. Love Sheila",

Nettie, sorry to hear that your wee kitty had to lose a leg, although better a leg than it's life. We had an adventure on the trip to Ohio. I went with my parents to help dad with the driving. we got there about 11:45 Monday night to 6 inches of snow on the ground. Got up Tues morning and more snow falling, ended up with approx 12-14 inches. Temps stayed in the low 20's all week. winds blew and the snow drifted. I felt like I was 'driving miss daisy' - Sheila slow down, Sheila watch out there is ice /snow on the road. The funeral was a celebration of her life, the minister (his grandfather married grandma and grandpa) asked for a time of sharing of how grandma showed her favorite chapter in the Bible (1 Cor 13). We laughed and cried about things we remembered. The cemetery was an adventure, they had dug out an area for the tent next to the driveway, (the actual grave was about 20 ft away) the base for the vault sitting on the wooden palet under the tent and the chairs next to it, most people stayed in the cars as long as possible, the minister made the graveside rites as quick as possible, several cousins took some flowers and put them on grandpa's headstone and his parent's headstone. we left the cemetery and went to my uncle's church for a hot lunch of beef and noodles. I saw family I hadn't seen in years. When we came home Friday, we were 20 miles from my parent's home to find out that there was a sink hole on the main road and it took us nearly 2 hours to drive the last 20 miles due to snow in NC again and making the mtn rds dangerous. Again, thanks for all your concern and sympathy about my grandmother. Sheila",

The doctors wanted to see if there was any physical thing to cause the seizures and did an EEG on him to check his brain activity which was negative for any abnormal activity. When they did the EEG, I took him to the hospital with his favorite blanket, they gave him some meds to relax him, wrapped him in the blanket papoose style to keep his arms close to his body and I held him while they glued the electrodes on his head and while they did the test. They managed to get readings while awake and asleep. He stayed groggy the rest of the afternoon (another long funny story about that) then was fine the next day. Holding him was the hard part for me, he wanted down and I had to keep him still. I wanted to rock him and sing to him to calm him down but they wanted him still.",

This tooth was too bad to try and fill but didn't need the root canal but needed the crown. It wasn't too bad, he gave me 3 novicane injections (2 in the jaw and one next to the tooth) and I was numb from the center of my mouth all the way to my jaw. I thought maybe it was a reaction to the novicane since I was on the hydrocone cough syrup for 2 weeks and since they are in the same family of drugs. The cough syrup will give me cramps and constipation like I was feeling yesterday. The dentist I am seeing now said that my teeth are weak because when I was growing up I lived in the country and we had well water so no fluoride to help strenthen my teeth. I am now using 10 dollar a tube toothpaste that I got from his office to try and strengthen my teeth. No other dentist has said anything about my teeth being weak, they would just keep filling the cavities and tell me to brush and floss better.

My X tried coming back into my son's life when he was 17 through a mutual friend. The friend contacted John and let him know that his 'dad' was wanting some contact but would leave it up to John to decide if he wanted the contact. John agreed on a letter from his 'dad' but when 'dad' showed up at his work (local grocery store) to hand deliver the letter, that pretty much decided things for John. If 'dad' wouldn't keep his end of the bargan to mail the letter, John didn't want anything else to do with him. We read the letter together and it didn't say anything that I hadn't already told John.

It is frustrating. I used the medical spending card a total of 4 times in April and May to pay for the therapy on my hand all at Quest 4 Life rehab services. The administrators denied the first charge and last charge but approved the two charges in the middle. I unfortunately have missplaced three of the receipts. I called to find out why they would deny and approve charges from the same place within 3 weeks and the reason I got from customer service - once I finally got through - was that the approved charges were an even $100 but the other two charges were for an odd amount (162 and 38). My first visit charge was 162 for the consultation and testing, the other charges were just amounts to get me up to my $400 deductible when the insurance would start paying 80%. I got through to the therapy office and they are going to fax me the receipts so I can send them on to the medical spending card to verify the charges. As far as Donald's prescriptions. He was running out of his meds and we had to get a new prescription. The doctor's office has saturday hours and we went by Saturday morning to see the doctor and get the script, the (new) receptionst told us that Saturday's were for urgent care only and wouldn't let us see the doctor so we had to leave the renewal form for them to fill out. (We have had appointments on Saturday before to get donald's scripts filled, that is why we changed to that doctor's office 2 yrs ago) I wrote the medical spending card number on the form and checked for overnight delivery. The doctor's office didn't call to say they had faxed in the script but I checked online at the mail order pharmacy to see if they had the order in house, which it was but it didn't say the type of delivery (standard or overnight). I had to call the pharmacy to find out how it is scheduled to be shipped and they did confirm that it is overnight. Each call took about 30 minutes for a simple question. What ever happened to customer service? Sheila",

There is a surgery they could do to possibly give her the use of her legs again but the cost is more than I can absorb at this time. Also her age was against her. Sshe was at least 9 yrs old, we got her in 2002 as a rescue with a verbal she is between 2 and 3 yrs old. The vet said she doesn't see many bassetts over 10 yrs old. They gave her a dex shot and some tramidol for pain and I brought her home to see if there would be any improvement. Overnight she didn't want to eat but I did manage to get her to drink some water. I was up with her 3 times overnight and my son was up with her once. This morning she had less movement and feeling in her back legs. Donald wanted me to try and keep her alive until he got home this weekend but after last night I called him and said that I couldn't look Penelope in the eyes and make her suffer any more. I took her back to the vet's this morning at 8:45 and signed the papers to have her put to sleep. I did take several pictures of her last night laying on her pillow bed not showing her with her legs laying in unusual positions. She is now resting comfortably out of pain. She will be greatly missed at the Race for the Cure in October, She was our team mascot since 2004. We didn't take her in 2003 because we wern't sure if she would be allowed at the race. I am asking friends who took pictures of her over the years at the race to get me copies of them for a scrapbook. Sheila Sheila",

My MIL, who had the surgery in Feb for colon cancer told me that a blood test the doctor did last week was slightly elevated (she didn't know the exact name or what was considered normal) and instead of seeing him again in 3 months he wants to see her again in 2 weeks. She told me 3 different test names everytime I asked her what the test was (including psa which I know she didn't have done) and I think it was the CEA tumor marker test for colon cancer. Her daughter told my hubby that the cancer had come back and it was stage 4 but no additional tests have been done. My MIL has lost alot of weight since her surgery.

We had serious prayer over her and her baby was born with no signs of downs syndrome and has competed in Miss Teen competitions in KY. Nancy, hope all goes well with your father and his move to your sisters house.

The server was down for a day and a half, that time I had to deal with the users in the company asking when will it be fixed.

I know too extreme example but that is the way I see your sil's reasoning. When I stayed with my mom from the time John was 3 months old until he was 5 yrs old, she left some of her glass figurines out we just told him no enough times that he would leave them alone. We were consistant with our boundries which is the problem with Landon's father and mother, but it sounds like you and Ed are consistant. After I met Donald (John was 10), he too wanted to be the cool dad but knew that children need limits and he could be the cool dad within those limits. He was actually stricter on John than I was but his friends at the explorer post all loved Donald and myself and we were known as the 'honorary Mom and Dad'. Sheila",

Kathi, I don't know how you kept your mouth shut all this time with your sil but glad you spoke up at the salon! Yesterday, we had our 'Pink Sunday' at church, that my mother and I started about 3 yrs ago to kick off BC awareness month. I decorated the bulletin board with the local Komen poster in the middle, pink satin ribbon around the edges of the board and photos from previous Komen races scattered around. I also made up pink satin lapel ribbons to hand out. Just before the choir special, the choir director asked me if I wanted to say anything abou 'Pink Sunday'.  Usually my mom speaks but she was in Ohio at the church I grew up at for their 50th anniversary homecoming so he put me on the spot. I got up from my place in the choir and welcomed everyone to our 'pink sunday' and  gave the usual statistics (off the top of my head) about 1 in 8 women will be diagnosed. The local Komen affiliate was actually given more grant money from National than we raised locally to fund mammos, treatment, restorative yoga classes to name a few things funded. we do need more money for research to stop the 40,000 people dying from bc every year. And even though my cancer was found early and I did bilat mastectomy, I am not considered 'cured',  I still have a 1-2% of it returning. I don't remember what else I said but my sister and husband said that I spoke from the heart and it sounded good. Like you Lisa, Back to work!!!",

A young wife sat on a sofa on a hot humid day, drinking iced tea and visiting with her Mother. As they talked about life, about marriage, about the responsibilities of life and the obligations of adulthood, the mother clinked the ice cubes in her glass thoughtfully and turned a clear, sober glance upon her daughter. \"Don't forget your Sisters,\" she advised, swirling the tea leaves to the bottom of her glass. 'They'll be more important as you get older. No matter how much you love your husband, no matter how much you love the children you may have, you are still going to need Sisters. Remember to go places with them now and then; do things with them.'  'Remember that \"Sisters\" means ALL the women...  your girlfriends, your daughters, and all your other women relatives too. 'You'll need other women. Women always do.'  What a funny piece of advice, the young woman thought. Haven't I just gotten married? Haven't I just joined the couple-world? I'm now a married woman, for goodness sake! A grownup! Surely my husband and the family we may start will be all I need to make my life worthwhile!'  But she listened to her Mother. She kept contact with her \"Sisters\" and made more women friends each year. As the years tumbled by, one after another, she gradually came to understand that her Mum really knew what she was talking about. As time and nature work their changes and their mysteries upon a woman, \"Sisters\" are the mainstays of her life.  After more than 50 years of living in this world, here is what I've learned:  THIS SAYS IT ALL:  Time passes.  Life happens.  Distance separates.  Children grow up.  Jobs come and go.  Love waxes and wanes.  Men don't do what they're supposed to do.  Hearts break.  Parents die.  Colleagues forget favours.  Careers end.  BUT..........  \"Sisters\" are there, no matter how much time and how many miles are between you. A girlfriend is never farther away than needing her can reach.  When you have to walk that lonesome valley and you  have to walk it by yourself, the women in your life  will be on the valley's rim, cheering you on,  praying for you, pulling for you, intervening on your behalf, and waiting with open arms at the valley's end.  Sometimes, they will even break the rules and walk  beside you... or come in and carry you out.  Girlfriends, daughters, grand daughters, daughters-in-law, sisters, sisters-in-law, Mothers, Grand mothers, aunties, nieces, cousins, and extended family, all bless our life!  The world wouldn't be the same without women, and neither would I. When we began this adventure called womanhood, we had no idea of the incredible joys or sorrows that lay ahead. Nor did we know how much we would need each other.  Every day, we need each other still. Pass this on to all the women who help make your life meaningful.  I just did. Short and very sweet:  There are more than twenty angels in this world.  Ten are peacefully sleeping on clouds. Nine are playing. And one is reading her email at this moment.  Send this message to ten of your friends including me.   If you get 5 replies, someone you love will surprise you.  Happy days!  Don't break this; it's working I'm privileged to call you all my 'sisters' Sheila",

I am making a hat with a ponytail coming out of the top similar to 'I dream of Jeannie' but I will basically be the evil twin of Jeannie. Speaking of my sister, both herself and her husband have found jobs that originally were supposed to be part-time but have turned into full time! They will both qualify for insurance after they reach their 90 day period. Cathi, I am glad that Jaclyn want's to help out the single parent. Our church is making the Christmas shoe boxes of small goodies to take to the Shelter Home for abused women and their children, as well as looking into doing the same thing for other families. Last year we made some quilted bags that we stuffed with personal care items and school supplies for the Shelter home. The people at the Shelter were touched that we did that. We do try to do things every other month for the Shelter. My quilt guild is making baby blankets, and sheets for the Crisis Pregnancy Center and quilts in all sizes for the Shelter Home as well. Sue about the clock, Hawaii also doesn't change their clocks. that being said, I had purchased a 'smart clock' about 2 yrs before they changed the dates to change the clocks. I woke up Sunday morning looked at my clock and thought it was 7:30, I went to the living room and the VCR also said it was 7:30. I didn't look at my cell phone, then when I turned on the TV for the news, Good Morning Saturday morning was on, It comes on at 8:00. It was then I realized that my clock and VCR had turned themselves forward one hour and I was late for Sunday School because it takes an hour for me to get Donald out of bed and ready for church. This weekend there was a big rock slide on I-40 between Asheville and Knoxville at NC mile marker 3 that has closed the interstate for at least a month while they clean up the slide. There is a detour around the slide that will add 60 miles onto any trips Donald has to take if he needs to go North that the company doesn't pay for since it was an 'act of God'. Fortunately yesterday he went up I-77 to go North. Shiela",

Julie, I don't qualify for COBRA since I have access to a group plan through my husband's job, even though it is crappy insurance (have to pay $5000 per person before insurance starts paying).

And he is consistantly checking his blood sugar, not just when the doctor ordered him to. Yesterday, he got the word and last evening he was trading his old truck (07 volvo) in for a 2011 peterbuilt. They had said he would get a new truck before the end of May, but he thought that they were trying to butter him up because they had been pushing him hard the past 3 months. As he was moving his personal items from one truck to the other, several people came by to offer assistance in the move. He was at the main facility and it is more active through the night than the facility where he collapsed. I ended up and had to buy a new washer yesterday. My washer was about 10 yrs old, I had replaced a bushing 2 times ($75 each time) but this time the motor seized up on it and to replace the motor was going to cost about $200 excluding the labor/service call. I thought it was time I got a new washer. I also have 4 ceiling fans sitting next to the washer waiting for my contractor friend to take down my old ones (that quit last year) and put them up before it gets too hot this summer. With a house, if it isn't one thing it is 10 other things. Sheila",

I don't know if I told this story before but we had a Santa in the local dept store who walked around the store wearing real sleigh bells across his chest, we would listen for the bells when we went to the store. He told the Christmas story and at times during the story he would jump slightly and make the bells jingle (suddenly the angels appeared). After we found him he would ask us if we listened to our parents and teachers and if we were good and if we helped others, my mom would ask him how Mrs Claus and the elves were doing and we would get miniature candy canes out of his red bag. When I was in the third grade we moved to another town about 15 miles away and I thought that MY SANTA wouldn't find me. That Christmas we went into the local 5 & 10 store and there was MY SANTA telling the Christmas story as always. Boy was I happy!  We were raised to believe that Santa is the spirit of giving of ourselves to help others. Later years I found out that MY SANTA actually lived in the farm next to my grandparents and Mom really did know Mrs Claus and the elves . One thing I regret is we never did get any photos of us with MY SANTA. Sheila",

The funny thing is I had that scabby spot removed from my cheek on Tuesday and although the ps said that it would be a small incision (2 or 3 stitches) it ended up about 1 inch long with 7 or 8 stitches. The nurse said that my eye would probably swell shut and I would have a 'he**' of a black eye. My eye didn't swell shut (only slight swelling), I was slightly bruised under my eye, and the incision lays about even with the bottom of my glasses along my cheek bone. The interviewer didn't ask anything about the blue sutures and black scab just below my glasses. I will get the results of the path report on wednesday. It has been hard all week not to rub my eye, as soon as my finger rubs the area I am in pain, but when your eye itches, you want to scratch it. Sheila",

Although the pictures on FB look pretty bad.  Sunday when I was doing my weekly unemployment recording I checked on the ESC site and saw a job posting with a description exactly what I was doing. I sent an electronic message to the ESC to call me about the job. Monday afternoon (4:00 pm) my phone rang although it was in the other room, by the time I picked it up, the call had gone to voice mail. It was the ESC calling about my request. I called right back and left a message. By the time they called me back, yesterday at 3:30 pm the company had received 200 applications and closed the application window. I know that the Lord will provide me a job when the time is right. Sheila ",

Last December, when she was having problems breathing with her pnumonia, Dad called and said that she was taken to the hospital and my mom was there with her, Donald took me to the hospital to sit with mom and grandma. The nurses needed a urine sample and they had to catherize grandma to get the sample. She was so pathetic crying that it hurt and it does haunt me as well. Mom though said that when she got to the nursing home on the 6th, grandma was already in a coma and didn't make a sound when the nurse changed her but she did go so peacefully the nurse, mom and dad didn't realize it right away.",

It started when we were both single parents and our kids would play card games together and we would watch Christmas movies. After I left with my son, she would call my parents to do the 'Santa run'.  I would always drive around about 45 minutes or more to look at the Christmas lights to give Santa time to get to the house and leave the presents before we got home, after Santa left my house he would go to her house. Now we go to her house and have supper and play some games. Last night we played 'Left Center Right' dice game. Merry Christmas to all my Breast Friends. Sheila ",

I drove 1 hour to pick him up, we went out to lunch at the local K&W Cafeteria, shopping at Walmart for his truck stuff, back to the truck to unload, then an hour back home, with another stop at the local Walmart to pick up his meds. He slept all the way home. We watched the NCIS rerun and CSI/NY rerun (hubby had not seen that one) then were in bed by 10:30. I woke up at midnight to hear the neighbors setting off fireworks. Nancy saw on FB that you were buying a home, good for you. It is a big responsibility but well worth it. I have been in my house 20 years. There are things I keep wanting to change but due to unforeseen circumstances haven't been able to change it. I do have hardwood flooring under my old - wore out carpeting. I discovered that when my son was in the 5th grade and we pulled the carpeting up in his room due to allergies. The floor needed to be professionally refinished but we put thin plywood down with small nails and covered it with stick on tile. There are several other things I would love to change in my house but financially I can't afford to change much. Sheila ",

I just found out that the North Carolina Unemployment rates have dropped enough to take away the federal unemployment benefit extensions that have been given out for the past 3 years. Unfortunately, I will be finishing up the initial 26 weeks of unemployment in 2 weeks and will be completely out of benefits at that time. Mind you, others have been able to draw unemployment benefits for up to 2 years. What the drop in the unemployment rates don't fully reflect is the number of people who have used up all the benefits including the federal extensions. I went to a job fair last week and will be putting in an application with a local temp agency for a 3-4 month temp job that is 2nd shift doing billing for a company. The job does have a chance to become permanent. Sheila ",

I did get disability pay while I was out in June at the tune of $150 a week. Considering I have about $110 a week deductions in the various insurances I have taken out (med, dental, vision, life, Aflac) and a 401k loan, I got the grand total of $32 take home every 2 weeks. I just am thankful that I took out the Aflac cancer plan 2 yrs ago before my first abnormal mammo/biopsy which was b9. Last year I got about $15000 from Aflac for all the cancer procedures that I had, that money helped me keep up the house payment and even remodeled my bathroom (crack in the tub). My DH says he Loves that Duck! They say we will be in the 20's this weekend for highs. Not good for melting ice and snow. I get the flushed face from my great-grandmother and grandmother, my father said that his grandmother and mother all got red faced when they got warm, I have done that since I was in my early 20's. Everyone asks me if I am OK when I have the red face. I keep a small fan in my office set to blow across my head when I feel warm. speaking of warm, my face is tingly now, better start the fan. It is weird considering that it is about 40 degrees outside now and I have a fan running in my office but earlier this morning I had a heater running. I just can't get comfortable. Sheila",

If my new dh wanted to he could adopt my son and give him his last name, but when I met him my son was 11 and established with the name Beavers. John said that he did not need a paper to know who his dad was.

I knew that the darkness you were feeling was the medicines and you just had to walk through the darkness until you could see the light. I am glad that I have been able to help you through this terrifing trip of bootface. Jane, my mom did not opt for recon. She felt that at 60 she did not need her boob to identify who she is. Sometimes she goes on about why I chose recon and went through to the final stage (tattoo). At 46, I could not see myself flat, my husband said all along that what ever I decided to do he would honor my decision. He did not pressure me into the recon. We discussed the decision for bilat since September 06 after my 2nd abnormal mammo that resulted in biopsy and lumpectomy for ADH. I was not a good candidate for tram flap but I have had great results with the implants. I had an anniversary last week, Feb 14 2005 was my first biopsy that showed ADH and started me on this rollercoaster ride of BC. Love Sheila",

I put my foot down with a few ground rules. 1. I did not want a dog bigger than me or ate more than me. 2. I did not want a puppy to house train, my son was graduating from High School and planning to go in the service, I did not want another baby. 3. I did not want a dog that chewed up everything. 4. the dog had to be spayed/neutered. My DH came home from work one day (before trucking) and said that the lunch truck lady had found a basset that was 2 yrs old, house broke, fixed and needed a good home. We went that weekend to look at her and immediately fell in love with her. She has been a life saver for me since my DH started driving truck 2 yrs ago. She does not bark in the house and does not chew up things unless I leave some papers on the floor or she drags tissues out of the trash can. I am not able to give her baths by myself so I take her to Teressa's grooming salon for her baths, and as I said earlier, she will not let me trim her nails unless I lay on top of her and hold her down. She is our team mascot when we do the fall Race for the Cure (that is where the photo of her came from) and we get her toe-nails painted bright pink for the occasion. Animals can so enrich our lives.

I was toting drains but had a wonderful time. The group meets monthly at the wig bank but twice a year we go to Cracker Barrel restaurant for Breakfast. I totally agree with you about the roller-coaster and wanting to scream my head off. I want to be right by you screaming (either in fear or relief) and holding your hand. Sheila",

I am with Karen, I don't know why they did not put a port in for all the treatments you are getting. My mom had a port put in and she only took 4 treatments, though before the 3rd treatment, it clogged and they had to take it out and do the last ones in her arm. She also had bad veins and requested a certain nurse to put the IV in. Her onc has offices in three locations and for her last treatment she found out that the nurse she wanted would be at Hickory and not Lenoir, she asked if she could get the treatment at Hickory (20 miles away) just so she could get the good sticker.

I have even put lilly of the valley and iris at the top of the bank but even those are not growing well. That area gets the morning sun but shade most of the day. I don't know about introducing foreign plants, we have kudzu growing like crazy here in the south, introduced from Japan to stop erosion but it grows a mile a minute in the summer and takes over everything. I will keep going with my lytrope (monkey grass) and hope that it will spread like everyone says that it will. Sheila",

I hope that the meds the doc gave you will help you feel better.  You have seen my dog in my avitar. When she gets in trouble, she goes to her corner and looks at me with those sad eyes and I am sorry that I spoke harshly to her. I loved all the puppy picts and stories from everyone. About getting sick on chemo, my mom said that When she was on chemo she found that if she ate something small every 2-3 hours she did not get sick. She would eat a few cheese crackers, some fresh fruit, pudding or jello cups.  I am not taking chemo but I hope that this suggestion helps you when you do start chemo. Sheila",

Lisa, I am one for small houses. I bought my small house when my son was 6 yrs old, 700 heated square feet, 2 bedrooms 1 bath, and closed in back porch. Sometimes I would like a bigger house - no room to store anything -  but glad because it is small - not a lot of cleaning involved. Because my hubby is on the road all week long, I have hired my yard work out to a friend of my son for a $30 box of Angel Food a month. It is a way to help him keep food on his table and get my yard work done. I will give my dog story now. Penelope is the love of my life except for the months of April, May, and June. She is shedding. It takes almost 3 months for her to stop shedding. She can scratch her neck with her back foot and put her foot down and there is a clump of hair! I have resorted to brushing her outside because of the 'fur flying' in the house. I vacuum daily while she is shedding. I have one of the bagless vacuums and in my small living room I have to empty the dust cup at least 2 times because of all the hair she shedds. I brushed her yesterday and filled a small trash can with the fur, and it still comes off. After I brushed her she wanted her side rubbed and I had another handful of hair. I need to take her to the dog washer to get rid of a lot of hair but that only lasts about a week. I'm off my dog shedding rant now. Sheila",

You need to keep your chin up and not worry so much so you can reach 80 I felt the same way you do now right before my surgery. I wanted to scream at the top of my lungs, 'DON'T DO THIS TO ME!!!!!' My husband was on the road trying to get home early the night before surgery but he was held up by a shipper delaying the loading of his truck for over 2 hours and he was 4 hours from the house.  I called him at midnight and cried for an hour and he was still 2 hours away. We will keep you in our prayers that you find comfort and peace before, during and after surgery. Sheila",
