I had long hair down my waist, but I don't even care about long hair anymore, I just want to have some hair, so I don't need the hair cover. I actually have hair on the sides, but the top looks bald.. just like my husbands lol... I think it really looks gross. Even if I shaved it, I am afraid it would look brownish on the sides and bald on the top ... no I am too vain to walk around like that :-D. Hair porn is my thing too! lol Carol - looking beautiful Robo - also very nice hair! If I just had that thickness I would rock it proudly.",

It's hard to tell though, since I never lost all my hair, it's just thinned a lot especially on the top and front. So I am having a hard time searching through hair for the new baby hair, they seem to be very fine. Eyelashes and brows are filling in.. never lost them either. Sandy - 1 inch a month seems really crazy speed. Great for us chemo ladies, but I can imagine how upsetting it must be after spending few hundred dollars for a cut and color and be due back in just a few weeks. ;-)",

I am 7 weeks PFC and it is not growing at all! I still have some left over hair and that hair is growing looking more and more ridiculous. I am thinking to just shave it all off and walk around baldy headed.. :-D I wanna ditch these headcovers I am dying of hot flashes! MamaV - what a ponytail lol I LOVE it! Lago - nice haircut and the color..   I am so sick of seeing that ashy-almost greenish-blond/brown on my head.",
