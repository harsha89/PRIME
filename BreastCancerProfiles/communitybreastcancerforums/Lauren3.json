I had recon already and I will be getting radiation to the breast.  I just have to wait 3 months after rads are done for my exchange so the skin can heal.  If I hadn't done rads I could have had the exchange almost right away.  Mine is closed Thanksgiving and Christmas.  The nurse said it's important to have at least 4 visits in per week though so if we were for example snowed out another day the week of Christmas, they would open over the weekend to get everyone in.",
