I had BMX in Aug. 2009 and after Oct 09 exchange, followed by Dec 09 exchange to larger implants, I was miserable on the right side. Thought the implants were sitting on rib cage. Everytime I used my right arm, the implant rubbed on rib and I ended up with costochondritis (inflammation of rib and cartlidge). Had 1 cortisone shot which alleviated it for a bit and finally PS decided that the muscles had torn from the pec and serratus muscles where they had been sutured together to make pocket. PS rebuilt pocket with alloderm and made alloderm sling. What a difference! Have had adhesion issues on that side and an implant leak requiring exchange and still some discomfort, but at least it is not rib pain. The left side also had to be rebuilt with alloderm about  months later, but it never has given me any discomfort. Dealing with some axillary node discomfort now, but nothing like the rib pain. I wear a bra 24/7 for comfort. Hope you get some relief soon.",

One small vertical scar on right side does bother me as it has widened and is very thin. Feels like it folds over on itself. Will have it fixed in November. Armpit lymph nodes we are watching. Another US in Oct. and will see BS next week for routine breast check. She is also my GP so is always watching. PS is in same practice so it is convenient. Hope your pain gets better.",

After each excission, everything was B9, but with the Bi-Rads being class 4 and suspicious, I was not willing to undergo more biopsies each year. The density and the number of suspicious spots of papillomas made my decision to do the BMX easier. My breast surgeon, who is also my PCP has really supported my decisions and been very vocal that I made the correct decision. I am also becoming very sensitive to any adhesives and some topical antibacterials as well as latex. This means that lessening the exposure through repeated surgeries is a benefit. I also have the peace of mind that my BC risk is now very minimal. I cannot imagine living with the leakage for as long as you did. I had 3 ultrasounds and an MRI which showed the papillomas as suspicious lumps. I did not undergo the ductogram as my BS was confident what was going on. I am also a bit older that you at 58 and did not want to go on with biopsies into retirement and beyond. Hope this helps. Nancy",

Don't fret the drains again, while uncomfortable they really should not be that painful, just a nuisance and to me they are a small part of the journey. I actually was relieved to have a drain with my second alloderm repair as had seromas drained several time the first time so drain was easier. I had a hysterectomy 13 years ago and was so relieved to have had that and now have foobs. One of my co-workers tells me, jokingly, that I am not a \"real woman\" since I have had all the parts removed, but I am a girlie girl and like you overweight. I have found real pleasure in my sexy bras and nighties. My friends think a bad day for me would be not having on a pretty bra ....LOL. My DH is also very supportive and that has been a big help.

Had previous needle aspiration of it a year or so earlier. It was sclerotic adenoma and intraductal papillomatosis. Was taken off all estrogen (had hyster/ooph earlier). Each year the mammogram came back as dense tissue but no abnormality. In May 2008 I began oozing greenish yellow fluid from L breast. Ultrasound was not good and they did ductal excission and biopsy - again intraductal papillomas. One year later the oozing began on R breast. This time we had uni-US and it showed very dense areas of papillomas and cysts that the US tech said we could never get it all by biopsy. Next Bi-Lat MRI which came back BiRad class 4 suspicious and bi-lat ultrasound showed dense papillomas. Had one wire guided biopsy on L breast and 3 wire guided biopsies on R as well as 2 ductal excissions on R in July 2009 (all at one time. Radiologist said this was very unusual to have so many wires placed. I LOL that I looked like half of a daddy long legs spider). Prior to having the multiple July biopsies, I told BS to just take them away. She said it was radical and that I needed to think seriously about decision. DH and I went for 2 hour counseling sessions with her to discuss pros and cons and even the pathologist said that given what my history with them was said to consider dense papillomatosis as diagnosis. Long story short, I was afraid that all of the dense stuff was bound to turn into DCIS or worse and not be caught early enough. Was told Mammo every 6 mo and MRI once a year to follow so DH and I agreed that prophy BMX was the way to go. It has not been an easy road, but I know it was the right one. I am happy with my Mentor Mod. Profile Plus 960cc Saline implants and despite 4 surgeries to get here am seeing light at the end of the tunnel. Insurance paid for everything as Medical Necessary until last surgery and am in appeal process due to some re-insurance stuff (my non-profit co. is self-insured) which should be resolved once PS and BS office billing person gets on the ball and sends the records requested. Bottom line is if you want them gone, you should have that option and you will slowly ease the suffering you are currently going through.   Hope this helps. Nany ",

I Also had smaller implants exchanged for larger to better cover my chest area. My PS tried prednisone injections but that only briefly relieved the inflammation and due to thin skin concerns he didn't want to do it again. He finally decided that the muscle between pec and serratus split and pocket wasn't holding implant. He did a major repair job with alloderm and it is 99% better. I just convince myself that I just have to live with it. It does feel better with a wired bra and I sleep in one every night. Eventually I also had the left side reinforced with alloderm as well. I didn't have drains for either implant exchange and the first alloderm repair did not have a drain, but had to have seroma drained X3. Next alloderm repair I had a drain for a week and it wasn't bad. Hope this answers your questions above. BTW I have saline implants.",

I don't own either, but look on line and you should find something. My mastectomy was bi-lat and PS was such a perfectionist that both boobs are the same and even (though I am worried about what the one with the sling will do on its own when fixed). Yes you will have some extreme pain (that's what meds are for). With the BMX both arms are pretty useless for a few days. No weight on them and every thing hurts like H----! I was told to sleep in recliner and probably did for almost three weeks. I would try bed and get back up and sleep in recliner. DH would then sleep in his so he could be close. For my implant exchange surgeries, I got slanted pillow. It really helps a bunch. I was out of work for 3 weeks and needed every bit of it. I hit the wall at about 2 1/2 weeks and could not even function. PS said adrenal glands took a hit and put me on prednisone. He even asked the nurse if there was a diagnosis code for \"Patient looks like S----)? She told him no, but there was one for patient very sick. Best of luck to you in your surgery.  Nancy ",

I will be having my right breast implant redo with the alloderm on August 27. I am patiently awaiting this date as it is starting to really bother me. See BS on Wed. for routine 1 year post-op check. I know how you feel with the throat infection. Somehow I managed to come down with a cold for the first time in several years. My husband and I were in Nova Scotia for 2 weeks and probably picked up something there. He had pneumonia earlier this year so his resistance was down and then the cumulative effects of 4 surgeries last year undoubtedly left me a little weak in the immune dept. so we are both suffering. I had to work all weekend and could not call in sick as I have few sick days and need them for surgery. I start a new job on Tuesday so I hope that my cold is better. It is a part time job for some extra income. I had one, but due to staff cutbacks at our local hospital, I was let go. What part of UK are you in? My brother and family lived in Scotland for over 10 years so am familiar with UK. Good Luck with your surgery and I hope that the pain is not too great and that it is successful in aleviating the pain you are currently experiencing. Nancy ",

Donamaria - Sounds like you have had similar situation to what I had over the past 3 or 4 years I had a greenish watery discharge with my papilloma. Like you the mammogram did not show much but US and MRI did show diffuse papillomatosis. (See my June 24 post above for further details). I do not remember especially painful symptoms post biopsy, but then they did remove my whole duct at the time of biopsy. I also had 3 other sites biopsied at the same time and had them all done under gen. anesthesia. So sorry you are in such pain. I have to say that I am very relieved not to be going through the same thing this year and so glad that my Breast Surgeon was on my side with the BMX. I saw her last week for a year (almost) follow-up and she told me that she had another patient that had papillomatosis. She said she used to see it rarely and no more than once every 18 months and now she has 2 patients with the same diagnosis within a year. She said her other patient does not have it to the extent which I had and only in one breast, not both. BS is very glad we went ahead with the BMX also. It is so nice to have the support of the medical staff when it is prophylactic. At the time she did mine she had a patient who really needed a BMX and did not want to do it and then she had me with the prophy and was ready to put the other mess behind me. She said she really wished I could talk to the other patient, but with our HIPPA privacy laws, that was not an option. Wishing you good news on Friday for your path. report. Nancy ",

Monday morning I called PS office to confirm Tues. appt. and said all was well. About 2 hours later something felt off and I noticed that I had a seroma developing. Called PS office back and they fit me in and drained about 90cc off. It seems to be coming back, but I will wait until Fri to see if it gets larger. I have followup appt then. Today I have appt with BS who is also my GP so will see if she thinks it needs following. BS and PS share office and nurse so they can consult if need be. I am off work until next week. So sorry about your experiences and after surgery illnesses. I believe that my immunity has been really compromised. I have been getting colds, etc. that I rarely got before.  This surgery (my5th in a year) has seemed to really been the most difficult to recover from. I have felt yucky and my GI tract is a mess. I cannot believe they found no papillomas. What was the actual path report findings? I hope you can find the cause of your bleeding and no more surgery will be necessary. Take care. Nancy ",

I had prophy BMX in 2009 and have had several surgeries but am very pleased with the outcome. I was BMX to TEs and then to implants. Had smallish implants for my frame and hated them and then had them replaced with larger ones and had areola and nipples at the same time. Later I had alloderm placed to repair torn pec muscle and now I am finished (almost 3 years out) and am quite happy and breathe easier without always having another biopsy done. As for the relationship, I can't help much with that. My DH and I discussed everything from the beginning of my decision to have the prophy, went to every doctor appointment with me and was at all of my surgeries waiting to take me home. Guess the best advice I can give is to have open conversation early on and if boyfriend can't handle it you will know early on. It is a difficult time and the surgery can take its toll as well so you need the support and to know you have it before the surgery starts. Good luck with all of your decisions and eventual surgery.",

My solution - though radical - was a prophylactic BMX last Aug. I have had two different sets of implants and now will have revision on rt. with alloderm sling to correct some thin muscle/skin issues, but would do the whole thing again.
