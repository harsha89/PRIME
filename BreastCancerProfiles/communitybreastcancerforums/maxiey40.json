Im a little bummed !  I was hoping to wake up from surgery with a fill but doctor says that they fill them after radiation? Having nodes removed as well.  My tumor was 7cm but with the chemo its almost gone. How is the recovery time for a single mastectomy? Im a little nervous but ready for the next step.. Good luck to all...",
