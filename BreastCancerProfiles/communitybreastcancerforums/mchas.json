I am wondering if I have a problem with lymphedema.  I had a BMX with immediate recon (SGAP tissue flap) with 4 nodes removed on my right side, about 6 weeks ago.  My right arm has always been a little sore and stiff.  Initially, I thought it was from the surgery, and it may well be, mostly because there are no visible signs of swelling.  Now, I'm wondering if there isn't some small amount of swelling going on and it should be checked out by a LE therapist?  I'm not back to exercising just yet.  I was thinking that the soreness/stiffness would disappear once I start running again and get the blood flowing more through my right arm.  Does that seem to help - exercise?  Should I wait to see a therapist until I'm back running again to see if it makes a difference? Thanks!",
