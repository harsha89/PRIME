I never took the time to relax, when I should have.  When I was warned to.  I know I did this to myself trying to be superwoman - for who?  If you feel it is more than now and then, well it could be something else deciding to join the party - low blook counds as Deanna said, or many things could be the culprit. Yes, it is normal up to 6 months out depending on the person - all of this depends on the person - some never feel fatigue, some feel it during and some after. Good luck and gentle hugs!",

HAHA! Kidding aside, I am very tired now.  2 boosts down.  I am dosing up on the cream more now.  Much more sore today than ever before.  I just thank god I have two days off, 3 treatments, 1 day off and then my final one! Yippee!  I changed my appt time that day to 8:45am so I could go home and spend the day ALONE, home on the couch doing nothing but relaxing (until noon when I plan on a celebratory cocktail!).  Sending the kid to day care and making the big kid work that day and hubby will work as well - lucky me! Well, I look forward to finishing up in Nov, starting Tamox in Dec.  I must say. time feels like it has just moved along for me.  I really can't believe I had already done 30 treatments.  WOW! I will drop in again soon! Wendy",

My doc had me wait - and then I elected to wait TX until after the holidays. He said he would prescribe Effexor for me whenever I decided I needed it, I did some research and placed a call on Friday to start it even before the TX.  I think it will really help and know the end result is much more worth it than the fact I have to take an Antidepressant. I must say I am one that suffers through a headache before I take tylenol - if I do at all.  So this is a big step for me and I must say in addition I am excited about it - I really hope it does it - I want some more balance...... God speed to all.",

Thanks for the reminder - it never hurts! The doc thought I was thinking clearly - going from DDD to nothing would have been extreme on my mental too - and she didn't think it was warranted now.  She will take ALOT more than needed and that will be great.  She elected to do SNB as well so less chance to go back in. IF it comes back (in my head it is when) I will lose the girls - thats fine if it comes to that.  But this is my baby steps I guess. Thanks for the feedback folks! Oh yes - both breasts - left one will have the lumpectomy - and reduction, right one just reduced - Breast MRI clear.",
