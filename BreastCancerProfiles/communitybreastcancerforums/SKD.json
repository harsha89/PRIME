I put it on and  showed my husband and a bunch of my friends and they all couldn't tell the difference! It makes me less sad now about losing my real hair and I just want to shave it all off now and wear my nice wig. I am only on day 3 of it falling out and getting sick of it already!

I don't seem to be as paranoid this time about getting sick and don't seem to be knocking back the liquids like I should be. Guess I better get on it! I find that after taking the steriods I have more energy but I am only on them for 3 days. It seems like my body is going through withdrawels after I am done taking them and I am tired too easily after. But no other side effects other than that so far! It has been one week since I have shaved my head. It is honestly not as bad as I thought it would be and I loved my hair before. I bought a very comfortable wig identical to my old hair and I wear it everyday but it still took a good 5 days to get use to it on my head. When I went for my second chemo appt the nurses were asking if I lost my hair yet, they said ithey couldn't tell and it looked really good! I wear a scarf around my head at night because I tend to get cold easily. I also bought a cotton night cap but the scarf feels better with the hot weather.  My scalp tenderness is gone finally too!!  brat 352: Thats so funny how you said you wanted to stuff kleenex up your nose and leave it there, because I had a bad cold last week and my nose wouldn't stop running so I had to stuff kleenex up it to get it to stop! My husband was laughing at me, I am sure it looked real attractive but it worked! Hope everyone had a fantastic weekend!! Good luck everyone starting chemo this week, WE CAN DO THIS!!!   ",

I was very tired for 5 days and had very little nausea and no vomitting, no diarrhea or constipation. Every time I felt somewhat sick to my stomach I took \"decodron\" or gravol and felt fine (along with the other drug cocktail of zofran and mexeran). The gravol helped me sleep at night too. I have a very sensitive stomach (IBS) and I hardley had any nausea luckily! I had some heart burn so took Zantac. By Thursday night (6 days post chemo) I was feeling back to normal again but just today I started to get a sore throat (hope it goes away. I am using biotene mouth wash...). I am on day 10 now...my hair hasn't started falling out yet but feels really dry. I have gone out walking and biking lots and it seems to help me sleep. And I still drink TONS of fluids. For some reason I can't drink water so I drink TONS of juice ( I especially drank lots during the first couple days.. at least 8 cups!). It flushed all the bad stuff out and I was going to the bathroom constantly and I think that really helped me!  Good luck everyone starting this week and I hope you all have minimal side effects. Round 2 of 6 for me is June 18th. ",

He said I could shave his head then he would do mine. We will probably do it this weekend so I will let you know how it goes. I've always wanted to know what I would look like with a mo-hawk!I think it will be easier to just do it then constantly see my hair fall out. Everytime I see strands it makes me sad so I figured why be sad for the next week when I can just do it and be sad for a day! Plus I figured it will be nice and breezy for the summer. I don't know if I can handle seeing it come out in clumps, it is hard enough seeing it come out in 2-5 strands.    I guess most of us are losing our hair in the perfect season of summer! And then it wil start growing back by the fall/winter to keep us warm again! I bought 2 nice head scarfs and a night cap because I get so cold at night. I also bought a wig that looks identical to my hair now so my wig-hair dresser said not to cut my hair short because then people who don't know I have BC would be confused seeing me with long hair one week...then short hair the next week..then back to long hair again. I think I am also going to buy a synthetic wig that you can wear under hats or your scarf that doesn't cover the top part of your head...so in the summer months the wig won't get too hot. Its crazy how there is a whole \"wardrobe\" out there for your head!",

But my scalp still hurts, like it's pretty itchy and feels tender, does anyone know how long that lasts for and why it is so tender?

MAC does have really great eye liner and Avon has a great eyebrow pencil. I received both for free at the \"Look good, feel better\" workshop I went to. I highly recommend it, they taught me so much there and you get TONS of free goodies. They help you with makeup tricks when you lose your brows and eyelashes. MAC also has really good mascara that thickens your eyelashes so it fills things out a bit! kittycat: I have been eating tons of veggies and fruits and have never had a problem, I have just been careful to wash them well but thats all I seem to crave after treatment since I am sick of drinking water and juice! I had no idea about lettuce either and have been eating it all along without a problem.  Cheyanne: My eyelashes/ brows are the same. they have been thinning/breaking too.can't wait until they grow back! How long does it take for the hair to start growing again after the last treatment? Hope everyone had a great weekend!",

My plastic surgeon thought it was a good idea to remove the other breast and I agree too, I NEVER want to go through this ever again..and being so young (im 25 years old) I have to keep my bases covered! I am finally feeling back to my normal self again 5 weeks post chemo. My hair is SLOWLY growing back but it is super thin and I have hair on the sides but the top is all peach fuzz!!

I used to have long, thick hair that went midway down my back and I loved curling it and doing it up nice and the last thing I thought I would ever do was shave it!  I didn't like to look in the mirror without my wig for the first day because I was so shocked and I felt like I looked like an alien....and the second day I woke up and put on my wig again but today I looked in the mirror and decided I actually look pretty good with a shaved head and I am getting used to it. I talked to my husband about it and he said even when he shaves his head in the summer for the first time, it takes him a couple days to get use to it.  I have been using Nioxin shampoo and condioner in the shower to help with the scalp tenderness, I like it because it has that \"minty\" tingle and smell to it and makes my scalp feel better. The tenderness is getting better and my scalp hurts less every day. My wig-hair dresser said to use it even when I don't have hair because it cleans your scalp and when you hair does grow back after treatment, it makes it stronger. So if anyone is experiencing tenderness, I definitely recommend Nioxin!  I go for round 2 of chemo this Friday, I really hope it is like my first round with minimal side effects. I hope everyone is doing well and wish you all the best in your chemo \"adventures\". We can do this ladies, it is do-able!!",

I totally understand about it being \"just hair\" but its so sad to see it falling out! I think it usually takes between 14-21 days after treatment to start falling out. I guess hair falling out is a way to show that the chemo is working and attacking those cells but it is hard...I have really thick hair (my hairdresser says I have the same amount of hair as 3 people) so I am hoping it takes awhile and wont be too noticeable.  ALso, I have been using Nioxin but only because the hairdresser where I bought my wig said that Nioxin is good because it cleans the scalp, not just the hair. It is also good for when your hair starts regrowing because it makes it stronger. I like it because it has a refreshing feel to it after I washed my hair and helps with the hair cramps I have been experiencing (feels like my hair is constantly in a really tight pony tail). I am scared to lose it all but I bought a fantastic wig!",
