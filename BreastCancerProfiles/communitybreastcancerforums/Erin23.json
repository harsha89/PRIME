My wig is itchy and uncomfortable and i like to just wear scarves. I see kids staring at me in the hallway... i think the right words to describe it is embarrassing and unconfident. I like going on this topic every morning and reading about the hope you all have, it gives me some hope too. I wish teenagers were more understanding about it, doctors and psychologists kept telling me that theyll support me no matter what. But they don\u2019t. I guess i am happy that i am the one who has to deal with this instead of someone i love facing it. i cant even watch tv because all i can think about is i wish i had their hair. They have hair and i don\u2019t. Ahh!",
