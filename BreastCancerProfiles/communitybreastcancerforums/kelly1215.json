      "Content": "Dec 16, 2008 07:53AM - edited Dec 18, 2008 08:06PM by kelly1215 I have been on Taxotere for the past 2.5 years (with one 4 month break), which adds up to 40 treatments so far. I get a higher dose every three weeks. It is hard at times, but tolerable. Side effects I have experienced are: fatique, hair loss, fingernails and toenails messed up, drippy nose and watery eyes, weight gain, and just that yucky chemofied feeling. No nausea or stomach stuff. The worst of my side effects hit 3-5 days after treatment. I have 2-3 really bad days where I mostly just sleep. I've scheduled my treatments for Wednesday so that those bad days will hit over the weekend. It sounds like you have a good man by your side...that counts for a lot in this crazy battle of ours. Hang in there...Taxotere IS doable!",

It is hilarious when one gets rubbed off, or when I draw them on differently. It looks like I am all mixed up...one side of me is mad, the other is surprised; one side is happy, the other is skeptical...I can rarely get them on evenly. I ordered some temporary tattoo eyebrows last year (also from headcovers.com, I think), they looked pretty good but they eventually got rubbed off too. I bought some fake eyelashes, but they looked stupid when I tried to put them on. I think it helps to already have a base of eyelashes to add the falsies to, not just bare eyelid skin.",

Hopefully you won't need it, but If you're looking for a site that is specifically for young women, Young Survival Coalition is a great place for those of us who were diagnosed in our 20's and 30's. Unfortunately, it's becoming more common for women to be diagnosed at younger ages and some of our issues are different than our older BC sisters (i.e. fertility). Good luck with your tests on Friday! Hugs, Kelly",

I meet with my onc. next Tuesday to discuss our plan of attack. I won't have my first treatment until the week of 12/29. I have that week off of work, so I thought that would be a good time to try out a new drug and learn its side effects/timing of the crap. I was really hoping to be able to get away from the Decadron since I have such a love/hate relationship with it.  Sounds like there will be several of us on Doxil...that's good, we can help each other through. Thank you all so much for your input! Hugs, Kelly p.s. - Kim...I am originally from Jax and still have family who live there (Orange Park). ",

Not sure if it has anything to do with cancer. I thought it might be residual stuff leftvoer from radiation. The docs never seem to have answers for these kinds of symptoms since they can be caused by many different things. Good luck & hugs to you!",

There are times when chemo and/or surgery are not recommended if they feel they would only do more harm than good. There are always doctors who will agree to do either or both if you choose to find them. Get a second or third opinion if after asking more questions you truly feel like your mom's current doctor doesn't want to waste time on her. She needs to do whatever she is comfortable with. Best of luck to you and your Mom!",

      "Content": "Jan 31, 2009 10:35AM - edited Jan 31, 2009 10:36AM by kelly1215 I was recently diagnosed with 'true vocal cord paralysis' after my voice became raspy and weak. I cannot pronounce certain words and especially the letter 'e'. An ENT put a scope thingy up my nose that went down my throat and then he had me say certain things so he could see the vocal cords at work. I have mets to the mediastinal area, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and a blood clot in the super vena cava. They say all of this is causing the vocal cord paralysis. I just had PET and head/neck CT yesterday. Isn't it frustrating not being able to speak properly? I get so upset when people can't hear or understand me. And I can't yell at my boyfriend! He made the mistake of making fun of my voice yesterday. Tears always make men feel bad, but these tears were real and I was so pissed that he would be so heartless. Anyway, I am sorry you're going through this and I hope you get some answers (and solutions) soon! Hugs, Kelly",
