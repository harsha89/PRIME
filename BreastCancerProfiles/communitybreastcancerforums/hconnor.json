Her scans/petscan/MRI/CAT have always came out great the doc says. She does have some side effects like, dizziness, headaches, loss of appitite, shortness of breath, andÂ tingling in her feet and hands. Now she has moved to a differ state and has a new Oncologist who suggests that she stops the medications because he can not see anything on her most recent scan. He said long term of these drugs can gave serious side effects. One is heart problems which my mom already has. He is giving her the option to continue or stop. We could really use some advice. Oh and another big concern is that if she decided to stop treatment then her insurance(medicaid) will drop her then she will not have insurance at all!! What should we do? Anyone with similar experience? Thank You in advance. Worried daughter",
