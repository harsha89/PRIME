I've been a patient there for three years and can't say enough great things about my care. If you can identify a department there, call and request a consultation. This can take time and persistence, but in my experience it's totally worth it. Good luck.",

I don't know if I ever had one (I've had normal mammograms for years) or if sometimes breast cancer cells just show up in other locations. If you find out anything interesting, I'd love to know. Hang in there, Kristin",

She was very apologetic, said it had never been their intention to let me go that long without doctor facetime, and put me on her schedule for next month, which is usually an impossible feat. The idea is I need to see her roughly every 3 months - after each scan - or more often if needed. So I feel hugely better. I've also learned I have to speak up sooner. Have a great weekend, Kristin",
