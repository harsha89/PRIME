    "Content": "N01FIGHTSAL0NE wrote: I was recently diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma. I had a double mastectomy with reconstruction. Margins and lymph nodes clear. I now need an oncologist in the Northern Virginia/Washington DC area. I was referred to Dr. Raymond Wadlow. Has anyone seen him for breast cancer? His focus seems to be in gastrointestinal cancer. Dr. Mary Wilkinson and Dr. Claudine Isaacs were also recommended. Any feedback on these oncologists or on how to make this decision for a doctor I will be seeing for a long time?
