I had four lumps removed that were in two different locations in my breast. Playing the waiting game to hear back from pathology. BS said she is pretty confident that it's not breast cancer, but you never know. Thinking happy thoughts and am enjoying my Vicodin! I took off two days from work (Thursday and Friday) and will also have the weekend to recover. Hoping to be back at work by Monday!",

      "Content": "Apr 12, 2013 10:31AM - edited Apr 12, 2013 10:32AM by Amanda84 Hi there. I just had 4 lumps removed from my left breast two days ago. While I was dreading the surgery and am in pain now, there is no better feeling than running my fingers over where my lumps there and not having them there!! While I am still waiting for pathology results, I am so thankful that I got them out. One less thing to worry about! You are younger than me (I'm 28), but you'll heal quickly and the scars will probably fade over time. My surgeon went in through my nipple so no one, aside from my husband, will see the scar anyway.",
