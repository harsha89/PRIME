I went to to Dr for a regular check up....but was also have some issues with my left breast. Slight pain, not really pain but more of an awareness my breast was there...if that makes sense. Then I was in the shower before the appt and noticed my nipple point just slightly down. When l looked in the mirror and raised my arms, I noticed my skin under the nipple sorta crumple up and the nipple invert. From this moment, I've had a type of sinking feeling that I've never had in my entire 52 years. Anyway, off I went. She was very pleasant and I felt just toooo nice. She checked the breast and made an appt for the next day for a diagnostic mammo and ultrasound. Still smiling and saying not to worry. Well, this set me into panic mode but I kept it together enough to seem like a normal person, though I wanted to crumble. She continued with my pelvic and as soon as she looked in, she was surprised to see something on my cervix. At this point, I went into fantasy land and didn't really hear or was able to put her words together to makes sense to me. The words growth, cyst, and polyp came out of her mouth. She couldn't be sure and I sure as hell have no idea what she was talking about. At this point, she sounded like Charlie Browns teacher talking. She got the pap and said the results would be back this week. BUT, she also made another appt for this Friday for another pelvic exam by another gyno. The diag mammo and ultrasound were last Friday. They found the lump, told me it was not a cyst and due to the change of shape, they were very concerned and that it's a strong possibility for cancer. Biopsy tomorrow, Tuesday and was told I'd know by Thursday or Friday. Why would they tell me about their concern and that it's a strong possibility I would've thought they'd wait to say anything until sure. And, if the gyno took a Pap smear, wouldn't they wait for it to come back abnormal or cancerous first before making an appt a week later? Did she already know something even without the pap? I'm sure I would've asked all these questions if I wasn't in shock and I know I'll find out all for sure by the end of the week....but these last few days, I'm a wreck, can't focus and seem to be breaking out in tears for no reason at any time. I'm so glad I found this site and wish you all the best.

Results this afternoon for the breast, tomorrow Cervix info about pap and seeing the head gyno to check out what the Dr saw last week on it that made her eyes change and say \"ohhhhh my dear\" The Dr prescribed me Ativan for anxiety last week. Only took one before biopsy so far but just took one now. I'm a wreck. I couldn't stand waiting but now the wait is almost over and I sorta want to wait some more now....I'm scared to know the truth. I believe in God, not a big church goer....but this last week, I've prayed everyday to Him, to my Mom and my Mommom. I hope they're watching over me. I miss them. My nerves are shot and my emotions are either out of control or just flat and numb. No matter the outcome, it has already changed my life. Even if all is clear and disease free....I'll never be the same. .‚ù§‚ù§ Priscilla ‚ù§‚ù§  ",

I feel so alone though I have many who love me and care. I just want to know. And if it's cancer, I want to fight right now. Just the waiting is making me feel insecure, lost and pretty much insane. I did tell my dad today and a few others. They could tell I was not right. I have not mentioned anything to my daughter. She's 21 and in college hoping to be a psychiatrist (too bad she's not one yet, I sure need one right about now!) I don't want to worry her until I have to. Just reading and replying on this site seems unreal. Like this can't be happening to me, I must be \"asking for a friend\". I'm so happy to have found this site and all of you. ",

Then, wow...reading my original post totally took me back to that feeling. Amazing how fast things went, physically and emotionally. So, to catch up....It was breast cancer, stage 1B....ER/PR positive/HER2 negative. Had a skin saving mastectomy on the left side and tissue expander is in. The cervix issue came out fine....just a polyp so no cancer there. Seems chemo wasn't necessary from the Oncotype test but have started Tamoxifen. Doing okay but mood swings started kicking in. Dr offered effexor with it, to help with possible side effects but I opted to wait. I wanted to know what side effects were caused by what. For sure I've got the \"rabid dog\" side effect...or I could be mistaken for an actress prepping for her role in the remake of The Exorcist! I literally scare myself and have no idea who I will be from one min to the next! So thinking effexor may be worth a try. Reconstruction in early June then hopefully, life can move on for a while without all this nonstop drama. Hope you all are well and sorry for not paying attention.    ",
