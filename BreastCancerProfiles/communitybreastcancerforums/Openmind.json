Have you considered creating a thread for it? I know a lot of us will be very interested in following along. If I'm remembering correctly, I think you said it's normally done in conjunction with your standard of care treatments. With Ibrance/Letrozole out of the picture, will you be utilizing this therapy alone or adding something to it? Please know I admire your research skills, careful thought and planning and I wish you a phenomenal outcome. In reading the recent postings, it seems like it's Letrozole/Ibrance fail-liver progression week. My SIL is a new member of that unpopular club as well. Her MO is setting up a liver biopsy and genomic testing with Tempus, but initially suggested Faslodex and Affinitor as the next step. I was interested to see you say Faslodex alone is a standard of care option, as I have very strong concerns about Affinitor for my SIL, who has had several bouts of pneumonia prior to her de novo MBC diagnosis. I suggested considering Faslodex alone until the biopsy genomic results are back, so I'm comforted to hear your MO would suggest that option too. I inquired about immunotherapy therapy trials, but her MO indicated that she felt they are not producing great results yet for ER+/PR+/HER2- breast cancers. I'm interested in any therapy option suggestions at this point. Thanks & best of luck to everyone in beating this awfulbeast.",

DS-8201 is comprised of a humanized anti-HER2 antibody attached by a peptide linker to a novel topoisomerase I inhibitor that utilizes Daiichi Sankyo's proprietary linker-payload technology, offering a unique mechanism of action.2 This linker-payload combination of DS-8201 allows for a higher drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of about 8, which may help target low expressing HER2 tumors by supplying more payload per antibody to a tumor.2 For some reason I'm not allowed to post the article link - search for US FDA grants fast track designation for HER2 targeting antibody DS-8201 Here's the clinical trial.gov identifier: NCT02564900   ",

There's no excuse for the lack of a correct diagnosis after 6 longweeks with the issues you described. I'm so relieved to hear you are feeling better, I just wish that feeling had been achieved much earlier.",

My understanding is that Tempus is not specifically in-house to Mayo, it's a separate company working in conjunction with numerous medical centers. Here's a link: https://www.tempus.com/ I was just wondering if you thought it was comparable to Foundation One or Caris. Thanks again. I'm so sorry to hear of your frustrating experiences. Wishing you much better treatment with your new group & good on you for making a change! Thinking of you and wishing for an easy and effective biopsy procedure.",
