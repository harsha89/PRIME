It took me a year to try the anxiety meds, and almost two to take an antidepressant. In retrospect, had I started the meds in the beginning of treatment I may have tolerated it better. I was SO depressed, I couldn't leave the house. I didn't realize how bad it was until I took the help and realized how much better I felt. I never wanted to be on meds, but this was just too much for me to handle on my own. Good luck with your treatments my dear. It does get better, it does get easier, but you don't have to be a martyr. Take every bit of help that's offered, and then ask for more if you need it! Hugs, little flower",

I also take an SSRI and with both these i can be functional- which i wasn't able to be for a long time after my diagnosis.  I used to hesitate to accept help, now i'll take whatever makes this life a little more bearable! good for you for taking the first step to feeling better.

I speak from personal experience with a family member.  Before i was diagnosed with breast cancer my mil had a lumpectomy, she was being followed by her breast surgeon, never saw a med. oncologist, and i think that her life may have been different had she seeked a second opinion.  It's easy to say, oh just a little cancer, go into a safe place and move on with life, but cancer is vicious so make sure you know what you  need to do to make sure you remain cancer free.  Really not trying to be  a downer here, just that your post struck a cord with me since a family member has been down a similar path.......Hope your healing goes quickly following your recent lumpectomy.

Hope you can find a smile my friend, LittleFlower",

Here's what i think... Maybe you  could try the chemo first being closely monitored because this way you get the comfort of systemic treatment.  Then if there is response it will be seen in your nodes....then maybe the next step could be to do radiation if there is not complete resolution in the nodes.  The chemo can shrink the nodes then finish them off with rads, or it could just Kill the damn cancer all together!  It's such a tough decision...........i am so sorry you find yourself trying to make this decision.  The good thing about rads is that if you debulk and kill off all that cancer then there is a reduced chance of it spreading.  I guess what i would weigh the side effects of the chemo into the equation too.  Gee i see your dilema, can you do both??  kind of like if you have a primary bc then do the chemo and the rads?  so sorry hon, please let us know how it goes.....

She is ususally so mild but today the techs called her sassy!  I think it's a good sign.  The ER vet yesterday was pretty sure kidney dz with 50/50 chance of making it.  I will only be truly happy when she's with me again, at home, purring next to me.  I told her there would be lots of prayers for her!  THANKS SISTERS for being there, as you always are!

The drastic weight loss has left her frail, but hopefully with time she'll pick up a few ounces.  She, like most cats, likes to do things in her own time! LOL.  I read her these messages when i sign on.. and i truly believe that prayer pulled her through this awful episode.  I didn't think i'd have her long after she was admitted in the hospital.  one of the er vets had me online choosing a little casket for her ( the way he doom and gloomed the situation) Anyways!  Thanks again for checking... i'll let you all know if there is any change in status!

Hoping this is just a slow road to recovery, and not a slow process in the other direction.  It's hard to tell sometimes   But it is very comforting to know you all care and ask about her.  I really tell her every single time... to give her some strength to fight through this tough time.  THANKS.... from Tabitha and myself!",
