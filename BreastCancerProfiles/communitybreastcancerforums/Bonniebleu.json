Like somebody said before, just putting a seatbelt on, or reaching for things, that you'd never notice before become very painful/uncomfortable. Its the breast area PLUS the armpits, and underneath the armpits, upper arms, torso, you name it. I was so tender it hurt just when my arms would lightly brush my side. Definitely have some pillows ready to rest your arms on AWAY from your body. I've had gallbladder, hysterectomy surgery, the BMX was a lot harder.",
