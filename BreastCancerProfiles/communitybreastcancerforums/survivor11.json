It gets hard again, like I am now, finished with chemo and anxiously awaiting the day I see any real regrowth.

When you've lost your lashes, extend a daarker than your normal eyeliner in towards your nose more. Then just in the inner corner of the eye, dab some white or whitish eye shadow on the upper and bottom lids, just in the corner. It gives the illusion of a wide open eye which distracts from the fact that you have no lashes. Tried it and it worked for me, just sharing to see if this helps anyone.",

Have very good hair coverage but can still see scalp thru it. Seems to have alot of body ontop and seems course in the back and sides. Always had very wavy, thick hair so curious to see how this ends up.",

This is a funny story-many years ago my very young boys (all of whom LOVE Harry Potter) asked if there was a HP world. I said no there wasn't at the time, but if there ever was I'd be sure to take them. Who knew they'd actually build one, so the summer before my DX I flew all three boys, my ex-husband and myself down to Orlando and went. Spent a fortune but it was soooooo worth it. They had a blast, a once in a lifetime moment to have such a great trip with my little men, especially 9 months later when I was dx. Be sure to try the butterbeer, sounds nasty, but is awesome.

In sooooooo many ways we did, but we had to fight like hell for it. It's a bit of survivor guilt I think. We hear and see so many of our sisters lose this fight that we wonder how and why we survived. Unlike alot of people, thankfully, we live everyday with our mortality staring us right in the face. Guess it's just another thing we now have to learn to live with. As far as lessons go, I will never say that I'm glad I got BC, but it has taught me things and taken me to a place in life that I don't know that I ever would have gotten to on my own. Take today for example, I smacked into the rearend of a car on the rain slick roads, No damage, but crazy girl I hit went to hospital cause \"my back and neck hurt\", whatever. Was obvious nouthing was wrong and she's looking for a payday, cop even said so, hell I was only going 5 mile an hour. Anyway, before BC this would have totally pissed me off and made me anxious as hell, but now it didn't bother me in the least. Things just don't bother me the way they use to, and I find that I take time now to enjoy the hear and now and not spend so much time wondering about the future. Also because of BC I finally opened my eyes the true love of my life, and that he was right infront of me the whole time-can never be grateful enough for that.",

Anyway when I went into the dressing room with the assistant I took it off to change and she went on and on about how cute and edgy my hair looked. Then on my way home stopped by the postoffice, inside were several ladies that have known me since I was a child. They all went crazy for my hair and asked if I was going to grow it out again. Told them I thought I would, but they were all like, I love you in short hair.

Alot of it is light/gray (I suppose) but underneath stubble is dark as before chemo. My only concern is that it feels so thin and I had extra extra thick hair before. Does it start out feeling thin even if it will be thicker later-not long enough yet for me to tell. Find it so funny that every morning I wake up to look in the mirror like it's x-mas morning.

Actually the day after I lost my hair (which had been past my shoulders), I got out the face paints and let the boys paint it. It was a way of them getting upclose and personal with the baldness in a fun, nonthreatening way. Seemed to have done the trick cause they never acted like it was a big deal at all.

Might be fun to try it out. Oh and loved your husbands comment about the pumpkin. If I hadn't already gotten alot of coverage by Halloween I was going to paint my head like one. Lago-have faith in the nails. Mine were a hot mess when I fininshed chemo and I thought they were destined for permanent nail polish to cover them up, but now they are great. Healthy, long and strong with no nasty ridges or lifting. Also I so know what you mean about those damn dreams. They are so real and you feel so complete again, then you wake up and it's almost like your mourning your \"old\" self again. If I'm going to dream, I'd prefer that it involve Brad Pitt and a hot tropical getaway (sorry BF). Mammalou-Holy crap, steroid shots in your head. Bless your heart, that's awful. Your a better women than me, I'd just say to hell with it and break out the wig. i2willsurvive-10wks and 1\", I'm dying of envy. You better go topless girl, for all those of us that have hairevny toward you, LOL. I bet you look great and if your ready, going topless can be very freeing. Hope you have fun with it., Kymn-your hair looks great, very sassy. Liked your long hair (in avatar), but no fooling, you really can pull off that short hair. ksmatthews-good for you. This is you right now, and your good enough, You are a fighter and a survivor and we need to wear this super sexy short hair with pride, because we've earned it damn it. LuvRVing-Look at all that hair at 6wks. I thing you win the award for fastest growing hair, and I love the new Spike theme I see going on. linnyhopp-what a great attitude you have. We will all ber here cheering you on. You can do it, and before you know it, you'll be on here compairing your own hair regrowth. Best of luck to you girl, fight the good fight. 3jaysmom-gosh you have alot of length. I agree, cutting and shaping it up will help alot with making it seem fuller. Gotta love our hair. So mine is just about 1\" long 13 1/2wkPFC. Was noticing that the crown in my hear ( I have two of them by the way) seems to have the least amount of coverage, although there is really quite alot around, Have you ladies noticed this with you own hair? Also is it a bad thing that once or twice a week I take the tweezers and pluck out a hair ot two and measure it with mySpongeBob ruler? No I'm not kidding. Love ya ladies.",

Kks_rd-I agree, I had TAC from June to Aug and although it sucked at times, it is doable. Just take it one treatment at a time and the time really will move faster than you can believe. Thanks Clams for the wonderful words of support. Very much appreciated. As for me, I'm feeling better everyday just trying not to overdo it now that I don't feel life death. Good news is that my boys are finally home sleeping in their own beds since I've been sick.

You've still been through a hellofalot. There really arent degrees of hell with this, we are all in this together no matter what our individual treatment plans. I did have to do chemo, but didn't consider myself less lucky than someone who didn't have to do it.Â  You have every right to every emotion your dealing with but I know it's hard when friends and family don't follow suit. Just be honest with them and let them know that just because you may appear done with treatment the longterm emotional effects are still there. grandmarose-a blood clot, holy crap.

This really is your decision, but ask yourself...if it came back would I be able to live with the fact that I didn't do chemo? This may help when you think of the longterm. Chemo suck, no two ways about it, but it is doable and although right now it seems life it will last forever, it really will go by quicker than you realize. You are in my thoughts and prayers. I do know that most MO really recomment chemo for us younger women (I was 39 at diagnosis) because they figure we have alot of years left to live so they want to make sure that this is our only round with BC.

My OB/GYN whom I've known for 9 years and who delivered 2 of my 3 babies, well she is nationally recognized MD and has recently become director for a womens care center in our area. She was telling me at my appt this past week that she is very interested in starting a Breast Care Center as well and was picking my brain about how all of my care had gone. I told her about this forum and how knowledgable all of you ladies are. She was really interested to know about how long each of you ladies had to wait from time of dx to surgery/treatment began. Also about how well corrdinated your care was, like did your BS, PS and MO actually communicate with each other. Would appreciate any responses you could give me. Basically she is wanting to for a center where a women can be dx then have a \"team\" approach to their care, as in everyone meeting together with you and discussing your care throughout your treatment.

Keep up the positive attitude, even though it may be hard at times, it does make it go easier on you in the long run. Stephanie33-the BMX will be nouthing like your lumpectomy at all. First off you won't be feeling much of your chest at all, which is weird but helps with the pain. Stock up on lots of pillows (different sizes) and lots of ice bags (the soft ones that you put in kids lunch bags). Find a comfy chair, recliner or your bed (although wouldn't suggest your bed cause you don't want to sit in it all day then try to sleep in it later). You'll need a comfy little nest where you can get to the phone, remote, magazines, etc where you'll be sitting in a reclined position. Helps with mobility and comfort during the first few weeks. I strongly suggest surrounding yourself with flowers and nice smelling candels-it seems to help lift your mood during the boring first days.Hope this helps some. Have a good night ladies.

You had done nouthing wrong and you are not weak, it's just one of those things that is for no apparent reason. Increasing the protein in your diet can help and if you smoke you should stop, but other than those kinds of things, you are following the best course of treatment to get your wound to heal. As far as chemo goes, it really is okay that their has been a little bit of a delay, and if your really concerned contact your oncologist, maybe they can help put your mind at east.

Like everyone else they get in a routine about how many they put in, ask your PS. Of course it also depends on how much you bleed and produce fluid during the surgery. I'm a fluid producer (lucky me) so I had 6 drains in. Actually it really wasn't bad for me, everything is so numb there wasn't much discomfort, they were just a pain in the ass to have around.

I understand feeling like you want to keep your dx secret. I felt the same way. For one I didn't want anyone to worry about me, second I didn't have all the information that they were going to want to know, but third and probably more to the point, I didn't want to be \"cancer girl\". I didn't want to be sick or need anyones help. I was convinced that I could do this all on my own and that I could keep my secret from as many people as I had to, mainly my kids who are all under the age of ten. None of that lasted long. Very quickly I found out that people around me are very smart and they pick up on so much. I also realized that by not telling the immediate people in my life, that they would feel betrayed when the truth finally came out. I really thought by not telling my kids that I was protecting them, but I was wrong. I finally made the decision to tell those close to me, including my three small boys. I gave themÂ up to dateÂ information without frightening them and above all I made it a point toÂ tell everyone that I was strong and that no matter what, we would all be fine in the end. My 10 year old son has since told me that he trusts me when I tell him that Mom is fine,Â because I have never lied to him about my dx. This is just my experience, your journey may be different. If you need more time alone with your dx, then take it.Â You have BC, you have a hard fight ahead of you. Be kind to yourself, give yourself the freedom to be \"selfish\" for awhile and try again explaining to your sister that this is your challenge to face as you see fit, but remember her concern I'm sure comes only from the love she has for you and your family. The hardes part about BC for me really was learning to except others love and concern, excepting their help and confessing then I needed it. It has hall been apart of the learning experience that comes with a diagnosis such as ours. Good luck on your path.",

Praying that all turns out well and remember if you don't hear exactly what you want, try not to panic. We will be here for you and whatever is ahead we will all help you in any way we can. Just remember how strong you all are and what fighters you've already proven to be. Jerry & Shannon-I know your scared about your appt on Tues, but believe me you will feel better once you have a gameplan. It will take awhile to get your head around all of it, it may be a good idea to take a third party since most of us don't remember our first onch appt and everything they say-too much to take in at once. We will all be here ready to answer any questions you have afterwards. Try to remember that this battle is fought one day at a time, don't get too far ahead of yourselves, okay? CLC-yeah for the BRCA neg. Sorry you had a bad hospital experience. I'm a nurse and consider myself lucky in a way because now when I go back to work I will be so much better prepared to take care of my OR cancer patients, hope I can make a difference for someone in our shoes. Sorry also that you had a bad experience with your daughter. All kids are different and they cope in different ways, at least it is now out in the open which hopefully will make the communication easier for both of you guys. Gamergirl-how are you doing? Kellyod-stay on the meds if you need them. Everyones journey and recovery is different. Don't compare yourself to anyone, alot of different factors affect recovery. It is so easy for us as woman to push ourselves. This really is the one time that you have to be selfish and put yourself above everyone, even the kids. In order to get back to where you want to be, you have to be selfish now.Will be thinking about you and your soon to come up path results. Sott-I had a BMX with TE placement and my PS didn't put me in a compression bandage or a bra, Just gauze overing incision sites. Afterwards he only told me that he didn't want anything tight on and no underwire what so ever. Like others have said, every PS is different, make sure they give you the instructions before surgey so you can be prepared. AnnAlive-yeah on the path report but sorry don't have any answers about staging afterwards. jmz-sorry how your son is behaving. Hopefully he will snap out of it soon, but like i said above, now is the time when you really have to be selfish and put yourself above all others. Hope you can do that and am glad to hear you have your family to lean on. rachelvk-I had BMX and was told the same thingÂ about radiation. I had IDC with no node invovement so don't know if that makes a difference. iLUV2knit-With drains, alot of times your PS will tell you to put a small gauze over the insertion sites to catch any fluid that may seep out. Plus by anchoring a gause there with a little paper tape, it will help keep them from pulling when you lean over. I did this and changed the gauze twice a day. spunkybo-love the name. Welcome but sorry you have to join us. Kim137-glad about your surgery and hope recovery is going well. Okay think I got most of you, if I missed anyone very sorry. Continuing to pray for all those having surgery this week and all of us that are recovering. I see my PS tom and hopefully get an answer as to when my TE will get reinserted, will keep you posted.",

So here I was thinking that waking up from my exchange with a flat Lt chest and TE still in Rt would be as bad as this past month could get, um no. I just got discharged from the hospital after 5 days. Here goes my diagnosis...Hepatitis A, Mononucleosis, Anemia and oh yeah your thyroid has shut down. This diagnosis was only after 3 days of my MO, the hospital primary physician, the infectious disease MD and the renal MD not knowing what was wrong with me. Went from missed liver cancer, to acute renal failure to unknown infection. Scared the hell out of my family and probably would have me if I hadn't been unconcious most of the time from built up waste products in my blood stream. All came down to continued immunosuppression and neutropenia from aggressive chemo treatment. WTF, I finished chemo in Aug. One good thing about it is that it took my mind off of my flat Lt chest for awhile. Now I'm dealing with fluid overload from hospitalization so most of the time my face looks like the elephant mans until the Lasix kicks in and my docs all tell me that I will be weak as a kitten for atleast the next 4 wks-great. Gosh this has been fun. Anyway good news is before I started getting really sick I saw 2nd opp PS and he was great and my TE will be able to go back in Jan 6th with hopefuly exchange in May. It sucks that it will take 7 months to get back to where I was 28 days ago. I hate this fuc_en cancer. I want my life back.",

Your right, everything does change after you start your journey, nouthing will ever be the same as it was and you have to mourn that but you also have to remember that maybe just maybe it will be better than it was before-that parts up to you. Would never say I'm grateful for BC, that would be tinkerbell, nicey bullsh_t, but it has taught me thing that I needed to learn, things I'm not sure I would have learned any other way. Kinda hardheaded, needed a 2x4 to smack me up against the head. Your going to do great. You'll have your bad, I hate the world, don't know why I'm going through this, why am I going through this, I'm tired of going through this days, but you are also going to have good, near normalish days and you will get to the light at the end of the tunnel-just keep believing that no matter what. Mardibra-yeah for you, no BMX, that's awesome, so happy for you. I have three kids myself (5.7 & 10). Only thing I can say is be honest with them as much as age appropriate cause if lie or don't tell them the whole truth now, how are they ever going to believe you when their 16 and you tell them not to drink and drive cause it can kill them/someone else. Kids are really so much more capable of dealing with this kind of crap than even we are. They see things very black and white-your sick, you get surgery/medication/radiation, you get over it. Thankfully alot of the rest of the crap inbetween is lost on them. By the way you don't have to cry to be processing this. As long as your not doing it for someone else, don't worry. Just keep marching on and your eye on the prize.",

The only advise I can give is what worked for us. I told the boys everything, was always very honest with them, showed them the drains, the scars whatever they felt comfortable seeing. It really was the very best decision I could make. Because they have known everything from very early on, nouthing that has come up, sickness, hospitals, surgeries, has scared them and they have taken everything with a grain of salt. My thought was, if I make sure there are as few of surprises as I can have control over, then there is very little room left for fear. Fear comes from the unknown, I wanted my boys to have all the knowledge they needed to deal with any anxieties they were going to have.

Even though I would consider this surgery for me to be a good one, I still feel the anxiety of the upcoming event, hang in there sister-it is nice toÂ have someone to share the date with. Chemo before surgery really depends on the size of your tumor and it sounds like for you and what was for me, surgery is your best inital treatment. clarms-out your kids ages, honest is the best policy. My kids range in age from 5-10 and I to was very honest with them, even with the cancer involvement. I have found that it was totally the right decision for us throughout this journey. My kids believe me when I tell them something about a treatment, procedure, etc. They don't think, \"well Mom is probably protecting us and not telling us everything.\" Good for you and your family. This really is no time for secrets.",

Hopefully you guys will find the ladies here informative, supportive and compassionate. Hang in there ladies, this journey will move forward and we are all in this together. Judy67-I had surgery before my chemo. They wanted the tumor to establish stage and to do Oncho test. I have several friends that had things done the same way. Not sure why alot of you guys had your chemo first. If your having concerns be sure to voice them to your MO and BS.Good luck. trinity-my surgery sister. I did the same darn thing with my BMX. I remember ridiing the hospital when it hit me, I'm getting ready to have someone butcher me. That was really the only time I freaked, but got through it and kept my eyes on the prize as they say-to be cancer free with perky new boobs at the end. I'll probably do the same thing Mon, freak as I'm riding to the hospital. Just remember, if you freak out, put your hand in your pocket, and I'll take your hand. Much love.",

To all those anticipating telling family/friends/kids, gosh I feel so bad for you guys. I remember how that felt. Thankfully my kids did so much better than I anticipated and have continued to do the same through out all of this. Was very open andÂ honest with them about everything and thus I think they felt more in control. We always talked about it, surgerys, chemo, TE's, they've heard it all and feel comfortable with it now so it doesn't seem as scarey to them. Telling my parents was hard, with no family history they didn't exspect their 39 yr old daughter to come in and say, \"I have cancer\". My dad who is a military man had the hardest time cause this was something he just couldn't fix, and he can fix anything. We all found our way though and have done better than I every anticipated. Hang in there ladies, I know right now you can't get your heads around how this is every going to be alright again, but it will, just hang onto that faith.",

We as women are always more concerned for others than we are ourselves. Just hang in there, but remember to keep your own self in mind-this is the one time that you really do have to be selfish and concentrate on you. A very good friend gave me a piece of advice right after I was dx-she said \"Now is the time in your life when you have to cut out all the cancer in your life, friends/family/stress, anything that isn't positive.\" Good luck. clams-hope your wife has a good day today.

I've worked in hospitals my whole life, spend enough time sleeping in them on call so I'm advocating that in a nurses case we should not have to spend anymore time in the hospital than we already have-maybe they can set up a cot outside for me?

Rockysg-can't believe your having to deal with moving in the middle of all this, you certainly have some big ones. Just proves the power of women Slgarcia05-your wrong, you do get some joy at the end of your surgery. The joy of finally having a complete diagnosis and knowing that you have cut this shit out of you-that you finally had some control and it is another step towards being cancer free. Trinity and Rockysg-I realize our surgeries are at a different times in our journeys. My BMX was in May so let me tell you both-it won't be easy but as I said above, the completion of your surgery does bring some closure and control. Thats what I wont both of you to concentrate on tonight and tom. Not what your losing but what your gaining. You are gaining control and information and you are completing another steop on this journey-closer to being done. I will be in each of your pockets tom holding your hands and whispering in your ears that you are not alone, that I will be right with you through all of it. I'm wishing each of us, easy, quick recoverys and before we know it we will be back on here giving advice and comfort to the rest of our Oct sisters. I'm sure I'll be on here tonight to, cause I'm sure sleep will escape me tonight as well. Love all of you and since I won't be on here for a couple of days want to say good luck and much love to all the ladies that will follow our path in the next few days. Hang tough ladies, we are stronger than we know. Â ",

We can feel alone together I suppose. It just seems like when we get a plan and we circle our wagons for that plan, the damn plan shouldn't keep on changing. I'm not sleeping much right now so if you can't sleep much tonight, I'll be here but hope your pain meds kick in and you can get some rest. Thinking about you.",
