I am 45 years old . estradiol is what I was on after my surgery my OB took me off the estradiol , I also have a heart problem . the only pain that I feel is that every once in a while I get a sharp pain in the nipple area, I have not had no biopsy's at this point but I am in the process of a breast surgeon I was refered to one by the ob , I had the u/s and the mammogram completed the same day and then was told to waite 6 months to see if any changes, I was going to at first then the shock wore off and I said I didn't want to wait another 6 months to find out since 3 years ago there was a pea size nodule bi-rad 2 then this year I went in I had a 10mmx 5mm in a lymph node of the breast and then 4 nodules for palpable concern that I believe are 5x2 mm each I have green discharge from my breast",

Just go get the mammogram and u/s asap then start from them since you posted earlier ( u had a lymph node biopsy done in 2011 for my the one in your neck (tested me for lymphoma bc ugot really sick) and it came back as b9 hyperplasia........... ) not sure maybe it will be the same testing,",

I moved states then went had the same findings on the mamo and u/s but the ob their took me off the estradiol , then a year later I have a total of 5 nodules in my left breast 1 in a lymph node that is the size of 10x5mm , I have pain In the breast and the arm pits also in the rib right below my left breast , so until a dr tells me that I have no invaders to worry about I will push to have them cut out of me.... @camont sorry to hear about your mother . I fully understand my daughter had a friend since kindergarten that was missed diagnosed and just passed away from cancer that took over her whole body don't wait any longer I feel like if there is something in there the only way to know its b9 is to take it out run test better safe than sorry I'm a mother of 3 girls my oldest is 27 and my youngest is 20 I have 5 grandkids ,my 1st husband passed away at a young age so i raised my daughters on my own. then I remarried my husband has little children the youngest is 12 so I will be teaching them all to be proactive in their health care also. @mommy ... yes there is no worse pain then having a hysterectomy , I would of rather had a baby it hurt less,,,,... have a great day everyone 2",
