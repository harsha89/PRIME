Bad path report...all nodes positive, bad margins, highest grade, lots of abnormal cell differentiation, abundant lymphovascular invasion...pretty upset, but not willing to give up. I'm 26 and I haven't even started my life yet, so I'm not going to let this stupid thing get the best of me. It's been tough, especially since they can't find a pain medicine I can take (allergic to narcotics), but I refuse to back down. I will be starting rads in a few weeks. First TE fill up is Wednesday! At least they got the stinkin' port out (I had 6 rounds of neoadjuvant TAC)!!",

I had my DMX with expanders placed 10 days ago, and yesterday my left side got all red and hivey-looking, and started itching like fire. I was terrified it was cellulitis. Got in to see my PS and he declared it contact dermatitis. I have a history of eczema so wasn't terribly surprised. Benadryl helps some, both PO and topical. Now the right is a little bit involved too. It SUCKS! I'm still a little worried that my incision is getting infected. The left is a little oozy. All in all, I just want to hang out at home topless and let it all air out, but I have two little kids that I don't want to traumatize.",
