One is in her neck, not sure where the other ones are.  She is starting chemo tomorrow.  Have any of you been down this same \"road\" with positive results?  If so, what was your treatment?  I would love to give her a pile of emails from some of you that can show her that many, many women have been in her same shoes and have come out the other end a survivor.  We (her friends and family) are confident that she will be OK but it would mean so much more hearing it from someone who has been there.  Please email me with any uplifting stories I can pass her way.  Thank you all so much in advance!!  Colleen Log in to post a reply",
