Nutshell of my story: 2cm IDC tumor in left breast that my surgeon is confident can be removed via lumpectomy and she's forecasting radiation and inhibitors. BUT, when getting pre-surgery MRI, 4 small lumps appeared on both breasts in almost the same spot on both sides, different quadrant than cancer. All four are less that a cm. I am having them biopsied. Could be fibroadenomas (I already have a benign one near the cancer and have SUPER dense tissue) or it it could be more spots of cancer. Here is where I'm at: if cancer is in both breasts, I'm getting a double mastectomy with recon. If right breast remains healthy and another cancer is found on left side, either uni or bi (hard decision, leaning towards bi). If (fingers crossed) all lit up MRI spots are all benign, lumpectomy as planned. She says I'm a great candidate for a skin and nipple sparing direct to implant, being young (42), thin and good breast shape. I would love to hear stories of those that have had that (and also, silicone or saline) as well as pros and cons of uni or bi if one breast definitely had to be done and one was still healthy.
