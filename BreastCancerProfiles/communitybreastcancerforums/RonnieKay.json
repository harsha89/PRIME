I lost my 7 yr younger brother 27 yrs ago in an accident. He was a kind, sweet, gentle person. My 1 yr older than me brother is a different fellow...almost savant-type person & I can't relate to him on most levels. It's sad to me, as we were close growing up, but he's not a main part of my life & that's ok. I know how you'd hoped for a normal relationship with him, but it sounds as though that really never would have been. Your brother's past problems and allegiance to your ex DIL is hurtful and unexplained...so I truly hope, as others said, you can let it go & focus on you. I know you're worried about being able to be with your grandchildren. My hope is your son does everything in his power to keep them close to you. You are right to vent here, dear sister, where you're surrounded by people who do care!",

Navelbine shrunk my liver tumors (a bucket of biggies!) very quickly...80% in 5 mos, 30% more 3 months later.  My first onc said I'd be on it for life, as long as it worked (one gal's been on 5 years) and I'd be ok w/that...and if necessary...I could go on again. I had zofran tabs left from surgeries & it works as well as being given in my port so I take one after my blood draw (1-1.5 hrs before nav). I had weekly nav for 6 mos & started feeling awful so I started on 2 weeks on, 1 week off (Sue had that regimen so I asked my onc for the change), a lifesaver!  I have herc/perj on day 1, navel and neulasta on day 8, off day 15. My white count's been stable since regular neulasta about 3 months in.  I only do zofran, no pre-meds, just some fluid, but I always hydrate very well, like Penny said.  I can tell the next day if my urine smells, more water!  I think more water helps every aspect of this journey!  I get it over 20 min ( although pharmacy says it can be 10...my nurses like to slow it a bit).   I take Acyclivor days 7-11 to combat mouth sores.  They were never awful, but like small cankersores & that takes care of it completely.  I started getting a bit of foot neuropathy about 14 mos into it and I have crazy cramping every now and then in my hands/feet/toes (I just take deep breaths...I used to freak out!).  My onc said to take glutamine for neuropathy but it constipated me horribly!!!! I only have a little queasy right after treatment.  I've never had nausea, even on tc first diagnosis, iron stomach. I just can't eat as spicy as normal...if I do (Indian, Thai) I take a compazine (surgery leftover!) and it works!  Hair may thin...but you still have it!!!    Too much info..but I wish you healthy cells!  Stay in touch..we're here for any/every question...Navelbine sisters!!!",

I was diagnosed 12/21/13 w/liver mets.  It was my 3rd diagnosis of bc and came 6 months after I'd had diep flap reconstruction. Scan before 6/28/12 reconstruction was clear and in Dec, I had 8 & 4 cm mets.  I've been on bc.org since 2009 with my first diagnosis and have my September Sisters who I've kept up with since then and have met 2 of the 4 that have been together since.  First diagnosis was lump, radiation (internal), chemo, femara. I got through it so well! Two years later, 2011, during a routine mammo, 4 mm IDC.  Mx showed clear margins, no lymph nodes but since it was 2nd occurance and family history of bc (although brca neg), suggestion was also prophylactic mx w/reconstruction.  Broke my elbow 11/11, so postponed proph mx & recon until this past June...rest is history. I'm trying so hard to stay positive, look at every day as a gift, cherish my loving family who's amazingly supportive, value the friendships that are a blessing & give thanks to God who's blessed me beyond belief.  DH and I have been married 39 years, with 3 beautiful kids, 38, 36 & 33, their incredible spouses & our perfect grandkids 5, 4,& 2.  I'm on leave for 10 weeks from my part time job in the district office of a large school district and am contemplating not going back.  My husband & I, both being semi-retired, have stayed close to home with treatments, aside from frequent trips to Calif to see our son's family.  We have the home I grew up in in the eastern part of WA (we live in the western part) so we take that 4 hour trip often to \"go home\" and relax.  Most of our time is spent with our kids...our best friends.  I babysat our grandson during his 1-2 years, while going through chemo and he was the best medicine! My treatment is Navelbine/Herceptin/Perjeta every week...for life.  That's a daunting thought, but I'll do what I need to do to find NED!  Thanks to all for being on bc.org.  You are my lifeline for so much information & support.  May we all be blessed with love & life!",

Each time I go (every 4 months) I wait for the \"no sign of cancer\" statement w/a bit of anxiety. I've had a purple tongue spot for years & check it all the time myself. My hygienist has been my gal for nearly 20 years, been thru my 3 dx, & celebrated her 3 yr bc cancerversay on Wed, so she's totally thoughtful & gentle with our conversations. SOOOOO....I can feel your pain & worry. For a dentist to be so calloused, obviously knowing your cancer history, is totally unacceptable! And to hold you hostage on getting a surgeon referral sounds like a $$ thing, which is shameful! I know how you feel about just getting it done, especially with zometa coming up, & if your dentist has always done good work, get your work done, get a copy of your charts & then get references (from your onc, friends or maybe the endodontist) for a new dentist!! I had somewhat the same problem with an opthomologist. I was having weird eye stuff going on (thanks cancer drugs) and one of the dr in the practice I've always gone to said it may be a wrinkled retina...come back in 2 weeks. It became a \"migraine\"...and maybe a cataract. I asked about the wrinkled retina..maybe that too. I asked if there was a possibility of eye or brain mets. His response, \"We don't want to talk about that!\" I asked if he read my chart...yes, breast cancer. I said liver mets. He said, that's too scary to talk about. I said it would be a lot scarier if he knew I had eye or brain mets and didn't tell me! He said to come back in 6 mos & I said no...I won't be back. I went the next day to a retina specialist who said I DO have a wrinkled retina but mostly just aging eyes. The same dx, but this time with confidence. Glad you got some confidence in seeing your surgeons!!!! Will hope for smooth sailing through the root canal & crown!!!! XOXO",

No two people are the same, but much is very similar so you'll find good, honest, helpful info & love.  I am one whose TMs are right on.  With 3 diagnoses, each time there was a huge jump...and bingo, scans showed tumors.  With each treatment, not long on chemo, the numbers dropped drastically, quickly.  Since my TMs are pretty good indicators, I have them quite often, but as Meow & Bon said, it's the trend.  They also tend to zigzag, so that can be alarming, but it's \"normal\"....(if we can call anything normal with mbc!).  I only have ca2729 & Cea as my system doesn't show the 15-3 marker.  Wishing your mom healing!!!",

You've already gotten great advice on learning more about your biopsy.  I was actually told a couple of days after biopsy what type of cancer they'd found, which gave me a bit of an idea about what my journey would entail.  However, as gals have said, most of the answers will come after surgery.  A suggestion I have is to audio tape what your surgical team discusses with you.  My center did that and when you're in the midst of hearing all of this, it's a bit daunting, even when you have active family participating ( I had my husband and 2 grown daughters).  To be able to come home and listen to exactly what the discussion was the next day, when I'd accepted the whole idea of cancer, was so helpful.  I will pray for your strength and hope that you have awesome support that will help you through this journey.  Kick it to the curb!!!  XOXO",

I didn't get the braces, just slept with that in my consciousness (weird how I'd wake up thinking \"is my wrist straight?), but it worked!  The pain went away almost instantly.

I\u2019m happy to be a member of the bc.org OP club! I logged on (and most of you know I\u2019m spotty on that), to see how Jen was doing since being herceptin free (a month ahead of me) & am so happy to read good news, Jen...and celebrating with Laurish too! I am 9.5 months post living w/out herceptin & I can add that along with the joy at celebrating the fact that we\u2019ve defied the odds (my onc\u2019s words describing NED for a good while after a stage 4 dx), I still get little aches and pains (normal at 64, I suppose) that make me visit a dark place. I doubt that will ever change. My onc told me, when ditching chemo after 22 mos, that perjeta would be next to drop & herceptin after that...so we had a plan all along, even though i was nervous. I added acupuncture, thanks to SUE\u2019s recommendation & that helped my mental state immeasurably (I dropped my Prozac after a couple years). Now it\u2019s helping my sexual state as well...TMI! When I asked my acupuncturist if he could help with (no) sex drive after decades of a healthy one, he explained to his student that as a stage 4 patient, the drive to survive is stronger than a sex drive, so that part takes on little importance. I\u2019m thankful for integrative options & my cancer center has added this as well! I did the turkey tail tea/her2 vaccine study Jan-Mar 2017 & was able to add turkey tail supplements after 1 year post trial so I take one daily, along w/Letrozole. I\u2019m up & down on diet...but stay active with kids, grandkids, friends, church, tv. & my dearest bc.org sister, WOODY, on messenger. Even though I didn\u2019t think I had herceptin ses, I do notice feeling a bit more like the past me. My eyes are more clear, which seems trivial, but it affected me. My onc agreed that the ses are subtle, not chemo ses, but they\u2019re there. I no longer have 3 month echos, but I have blood draw w/TMs every 6 weeks & onc visit every 12 weeks. My onc doesn\u2019t scan routinely, unless there\u2019s some change in my tests/appearance, or I request one. Sorry this is so long....prob info for 4 different threads. OH....MBC Project got my blood too! We are all in this together, even though we are all different, and I\u2019m thankful that there\u2019s a place we understand & support other.

SUE & I were on it almost 2 years & both met stable! My first scan, at 5 months, showed 80% reduction of a liver full of tumors...some up to 8 cms. My TMs and liver enzymes were in the normal range after the first 2 months on tx. We both also had perj/hercep. Mi was on it weekly & had to have it held twice due to WBC. The first time I had 3 neupigen shots to get back on track, the 2nd time, neulasta, which became an every 3rd week standard. At the 6 no mark, I was getting really fatigued & ask my onc if I could do 2 wks on/1 off (I knew Sue was doing that), she agreed & it made all the diff in the world! My energy went back up & I felt good. I still had my p/h & neu every day 15 & at month 22, having had normal blood/TM's the whole time, with stable scans, a new onc said he was taking it off my plate! Six months on Wed...woohoo. I hope it's the magic bullet for you gals too! Since he took me off, should it be needed again, I can have it-my body didn't fail on it. As time goes on, you may notice cramping in hands, legs, feet, thinning hair, possible vision changes, but some of that may be perjeta too. Nose bleeds & dripping were bothersome. I had a tiny bit of constpation, but perjeta causes diarrhea so they evened out. Organic prunes are good. Remember to tank up on water.

Tryn...it seems sometimes every thought I had, every step I took, I measured in the number of times I had left to repeat them. I think it's the nature of the beast. But Spring is right...my onc, who early in my first treatment, said she'd never tell a person how long they had left, told me w/my mets dx that I would be in chemo for life..and that would probably be 5 months. That was 29 months ago...the last 6 on only h/p/let. That said...I'm like everyone else...hoping, praying this works forever!!! So...enjoy those pix...and plan for many more to come!!! Woody...still singing praises for the great news you've gotten!!! Penny...asking the Great Healer to keep watch over you!! Laura...how are you feeling after Halavan???? Thinking of you! Leah....wondering how tx is going??? SyrMom...thinking about you!",

I don't care for it anyway (except for a Baileys at Christmas, which she said I could have after my first stable scan...but I didn't), so that hasn't bothered me at all...except for wine at mass...which I've only had 3 times since dx. I just figure if I can have control over anything in this journey...I'm taking it. True...there are so many different attitudes/opinions/interpretations, etc, when it comes to this disease. If I hadn't had to see a new onc, due to former onc's health issues, I'd still be on chemo. Seven months later, I'm so relieved...but every now & then, I'm nervous.

I think reading what many of our sisters are experiencing is bone chilling...but it's real. And thank God we have each other...a true lifeline! It's so important to trust your care team, and be an advocate! As for the liver...in a 6-month period, I went from a clean scan (too small to detect, of course), to a liver filled with tumors up to 8 cms. In the first 5 mos of Navelbine/her/perj & neulasta, they shrunk 80%...another 3 mos another 30%...4 mos later...stable. Twenty-two months on that & able to drop navel/neu. My onc said remission. Doesn't totally erase the uneasy feelings but...thankful & hopeful. You're dealing w/more than liver...so just saying always hope! I did like you...a clean diet & list 36 lbs (which femara is returning, dang). Low carb, lean protein, loads of cruciferous foods, low sugar, cinnamon, turmeric, pomegranate juice every morn, green tea. Dr Scrivene-SH???? Anti-Cancer book has great recs. I called it my \"save my liver\" diet. Making it easy to work was my goal. My onc's only order-no alcohol. I know others who still drink...I never did so I didn't care...but I figure if she was that adamant, it would be something to take note of. Rest...and keep stress down...important for us all (I'm not good at either since off chemo...gotta practice). Trish...I'm sorry for progression & the brain mets. It sounds like you procedure wS successful & I'll pray for the new combo to be totally successful w/no (low!) ses. Sending love. Jos...I hope the specialists are completely assured there are no critters lurking. You've had such good response. My onc was very suspect about surgery on the liver, but if you've got their assurance...I hope you find answers & healing. Woody's my go-to girl...always...for my emotional & physical well-being so she needs to be healed, with the rest of my sisters, sweet Jesus. Chichi...glad you're doing well & Kiss...I'm hearing (not knowing first hand much about bones) that your tx sounds like the right one. Hallelujah for navel working. I've missed some of you but my DH is helping me clean our country home & he keeps finding me hiding in different spots so I can blog. Busted in the bathroom, a bedroom & now laundry room-dang. XOXO & prayers for healing!",

B) he always gives me my echo #, cause he doesn't want me to have to wait (with the caveat that when I get the onc call, I'm surprised!) C) he says he knows that he's most at risk for certain diseases, but is most scared of cancer. He scans for many different reasons, but he says C doesn't discriminate...healthy, conscientious living doesn't mean you're exempt, and that the courageous people who see him humble him. He was so real...I put my arm around him as we walked out of the room and thanked him for being honest. So many times, as you say Gramen, people have a hard time grasping what we go through, it was refreshing to hear his thoughts.

My onc waited 5 months to scan me after starting navel/herc/perj. My liver was full of tumors...and at that point they'd shrunk 80%. I was on weekly nav for 6 mos & then went to 2 wks on, 1 off. It really saved my bacon, having the week off. Food poisoning...ugh! I got it right after starting navel after eating at Whole Foods salad bar. I guess just because it's a natural food store doesn't mean it's w/out bugs! My onc said Never eat salad bars! We'll await good news! Muther....looking at your bio, I get nervous. We've somewhat done the same routine, with a few changes. Now that I've been taken off Navelbine after 22 months and am on femara, herc/perj, I'm concerned about seeing so many have progression. I wish you the best healing on your new regimen...and I pray for ses to subside. Glad you've come to chat...we're in this together. XOXO",

If you eat a few organic prunes every day...it's like a miracle (hope you like them...I like almost everything so it's a natural for me). Cheery..when I was dx w/liver mets, my onc said not to change anything I was doing...except not to drink alcohol, which I don't like so I didn't care. I know not drinking anything is probably a bit much, but I wouldn't imbibe too much...I tend to go overboard on being proactive with anything that can help us live longer...(my sisters get tired of me preaching...but I'm the HEALTHIEST sibling...and with stage 4 cancer!!). I say God knows I'm strong & can handle this disease...my siblings could never survive it. Off my soap box. Love to all",

At that time, I was still in a fog and didn't quite grasp the TM importance. I don't think I paid any attention my first time around. Woody, it sounds like if you're in the 40s, you're not far out of normal range...and you're just in the beginning of txt! I do remember when mine fluctuated, I panicked and my onc said even though 37 is normal, she wouldn't care if it was higher, taking into account how I felt & all other tests (like liver enzymes)...I still worried, so I understand your concern. My onc said it is normal for TM's to zigzag...so I think that's what you're seeing! Prayers that the numbers will zag next time...and that this regimen will be the best! I have faith!",

Normal bilirubin is good.  I read so often that pain can signify tumor death, and it will take a while for tumors to shrink, so I would think it not unusual for onc to still feel the liver enlarged.  Ultrasounds will be a good, non-invasive way to see how treatment is going...and ask fog pain meds if needed.  Prayers to you & Mom :-)",

I don't know about Alt or Ast being higher. Mine are similar to your usual counts..13-15.  How often do you have hepatic function tests?   As much as I worried about seeing it every 3 weeks, now that I'm having them every 6 weeks, it's harder.  How do you get a real scope on zigzagging tests if not regularly done. They may be totally normal, but I'm so much more at ease when they're low, so  hoping they'll go back down fast!",

A focus in their journey was human impact on plant species. I shared with them that I had just had 22 mos of chemo, derived from the periwinkle plant. I was asking all sorts of questions about their adventures, but they just wanted to hear about my treatment & were awed by it. They were leaving the next day for Costa Rica's rainforests. Thanks to the brilliant minds who tap into the natural wonders & find these things that keep us alive. Next may be the turkey tail mushroom.

If I rub it, it's much worse (so quit rubbing it, right?). I'm trying to attribute it to muscle strain, playing w/grandkids, tag at recess w/grandson's class, etc. but why is it on my liver side (insert sobbing voice). It doesn't hurt terribly bad.. just the dull ache. I'm not scheduled to see onc for 3 weeks but I'm thinking I may see my gp....or take an ibuprophen...which I rarely do. I hate giving cancer so much credit...maybe it's a muscle strain! Leah...can't wait to hear all about your Grandaughter's prayer party!!!! These are things that make us thankful for life & hopeful for many more moments as these! I got to share our grandaughter's baptism experience with her religious ed class when I was in CA. Seeing hope & faith in childrens' eyes...priceless!!! Chemo brain...was it benjnate that couldn't get chemo due to low neutrophils? I didn't have Navelbine if my count was 1. I would've had it at 1.8. Maybe it's different for each chemo but I was unsold to have 2 treatments about a month apart & I cried, but it didn't affect any of my counts. At that time, my onc added neulasta to each day 8 of my 15 day cycle and never had a problem after that. I understand how frightening it is, but now I can say...enjoy the break!

He said they don't heal quickly...have patience. I said the dr said a chiropractor could fix it in one visit. He looked at his fellow & they both shook their heads and said no...don't go there. Maybe that's why. Another concern is taking Tylenol. With liver mets, I'm surprised your onc hasn't told you not to use it. It was the first thing my onc said...only to use Ibuprophen, and only as necessary. I realize you have pain, and I hope there is something that will alleviate that...but no Tylenol, ever (do I sound like a mom, or bossy big sister????).

After the third time I was going to miss chemo, my onc gave me neupigen, 3 like Woody, to get on track, then I started getting neulasta after every 2nd tx (I was on weekly tx). After 6 mos, I officially went to 2 weeks on, 1 off...the neulasta given after 2nd chemo (and then my week off). Never missed another chemo. I went to that regimen cause I felt like crap and that's what SueOpp was doing (love my bc sisters) so asked onc & she approved it...it was magical for me! Good luck & may it bring you healing!!! Kcoralee...my heart is aching for you...but it sounds like you're full steam ahead...and I applaud you! Good luck on your biopsy...you may follow Josalive in tx. Josalive...I had your same tx in '09, w/out perjeta, of course. I was stage 2, grade 3. At that time, when chemo was over, herceptin went for a year & then AI only. On my 3rd (mets) dx, my onc said she knew I should've stayed on herceptin, with first recurrence, but it wasn't protocol for stage 2. I detest stage 4...but w/her2+ ...now h/p are protocol so, hopeful it keeps working! I felt pretty good on Josalive's same tx..fatigue, but.no nausea, a little indigestion, but watched what I ate closely. Day 3-5 were slow days for me, but I took care of a 1 yr old grandson & we napped together & did library, parks, etc, and I never missed a day with him. My onc called me a poster child for chemo...little did we know then, it'd be my drug of choice for 22 months, 3.5 years later. Sorry for the blabbing. In the car on a 4 hr drive. I'm holding you all hostage!!! Thinking of you all...have a lovely weekend. Penny...you're in my thoughts, prayers & heart always. XOXO ",

I was also told no shingle shot, and when my husband had it, he had to go to our farm place for a weekend to be away from me.  My daughter just had shingles...and her med was Acyclovir...which, funny enough, is what I take on navelbine cycle days 7-11, so I have a sort of immunity.   With #3 dx, my onc took me off letrozole when I began nav/herc/perj.  I also had had 3 zometa before she stopped that as well.   My tumor markers/liver enz/blood tests have all been normal since the first few months of txt starting 1/13. But teen22...my onc doesn't do regular scans.  I had them at my 5th, 8th & 12th month of txt.  She based my need on the blood and my physical condition. I think it may be protocol w/some oncs, not all.  Now the hard part for me.... I has my appt w/my new, younger onc last week (as mine is I'll & return date not known).  His recommendation....no more Navelbine.  He wants to add an AI to herc/perj, as he says my blood tests are great, physically well & scans were all good...although he will scan next week (this is my off week so I'm visiting son's fam in CA).  He was adamant about nav being toxic after 22 months, the fact that neulasta builds white cells but marrow isn't as healthy, neuropathy rearing itself in my feet (nothing like others...and it's better the more I walk).  He feels scans will show scar tissue, not C activity, but I have capsular retraction, which makes detection more difficult...ugh.  I really liked him.  When I said my other onc said it'd come back if I went off chemo, he said, \"Maybe not!\"  I like that attitude, but it's also scary.  I see so many who have prog when on AIs.  Does herc/perj help...enough???   I truthfully welcome the break.  Not that my regimen wasn't tolerable...and yes, I have hair :).  Get also said that with scans more often, he'll see how I'm doing & then will move quickly & said there are so many advances & if I do need further tx, my body will be healthier.  I'm praying madly...hope, hope, hoping we all find what keeps us on this earth & banishes bad cells!   Side note....sister had successful uterine C surgery yesterday!  Thanks be to God :).  Love you all!",

I'm a bit concerned about not seeing onc for 12 weeks...does anyone else go that long. Perj/herc every 3 weeks seems like 8 weeks should be ling enough. On chemo it was every 4 weeks. Just a little worried. Sending cyber hugs & prayers abound for good scans!!!! Late to babysit!!!! ",

Your mum will hear everything, as you've seen, not always understanding, so conversations you don't want to have around her should be far away (mom didn't want to miss out on anything). White noise is good, as others said..maybe her favorite music. Be careful of news programs if tv is on. Her favorite foods (my mom loved Pepsi so I blended it w/ice...she was so happy)...and like others' said, don't worry about pills if the give her peace and calm. Are there friends that could visit?

From that point on, when I flew Jet Blue, they issued me 1F, free of charge, because even though germs are rampant in a plane, my onc didn't want me in the middle of a bunch of people.  I had that seat until I said I didn't need it on our flight October '15, a year after dropping chemo!).  Today, flying down to celebrate GD's 8th bday, they saw my DH on crutches from his hip surgery & issued him F1, free of charge & me next to him. I cried, explaining the whole story...the flight attendant cried & asked what you do when you're given THAT dx...months to live.  I told her I made a list of things to do....and then decided instead to enjoy living...none of the other stuff mattered that much after all.  I know I'm extremely lucky to be where I am right now. I still have that crummy voice that sometimes haunts me, but I mostly do what makes me happy (read: not housework..LOL).  Interestingly...we had a very bumpy landing in rainy so cal.  The pilot apologized & the co-pilot was totally shaken.  He said the winds changed, unexpectedly, at the moment of landing....kinda what we're all talking about, right???   In the meantime...I'm glad we can talk about this with each other....a great thread, Diana!!!  Not today cancer...nope!",

I'm definitely not saying not to use the cold cap and maybe you can't start using it mid tx, but you'd have time to research, I think. I had tx every week for 7 months...then 2wks on, 1 off.

I may just have the beginning of a cold. On to Navelbine.  On 10/10, it will be 21 months for me...thank you, Jesus!  Since I also have herc/perj, I don't experience the binding others do (perj can cause D so they cancel out!)).  I have all 3 on day 1, navel & neulasta day 8 & then am off a week...which is 13 days until day 1 again. Penny, you said they changed your regimen...to what?  Getting the neu on day 8 keeps me good til the next shot.  My ins requires my center to give the shots.  I take Claritin every day anyway, for allergies that hang around always (thank you cancer), so I rarely have any bone pain aside from maybe a little pinch in my ribs...that I actually like, cause it means  it's working!  Oh, the little things that make us happy!

Last year it went to her liver & it's now progressed to lungs. She's been on arimidex (after xeloda & a few others she couldn't remember). I asked if she'd had a biopsy when they found liver mets..she said no. She'll start taxol next week but I said to discuss it w/her onc....who told her she could have 6 mos-1 yr. Of course, I wish she knew first hand of the stories of sisters here...but I told her of you & others. So...again, thank God for this place...she thanked me over and over again.

My onc wanted it w/navelbine & herceptin, but the ins powers that be (no oncs!), decided there weren't enough million dollar studies to warrant the 2 together.

I was on navel/her/perj for nearly 2 years & lived pretty much my normal life...yes, being more careful w/keeping a healthy immune system & yes, being reminded constantly of the disease & being frightened, but it worked well. I pray you can reach Ned w/out iv chemo, but just know that if it becomes necessary....there are drugs that you can have qol with. Im sorry I don't recall who is getting a port (if I go back...I'll lose what I've typed)...I had my first removed when I was \"cured\"...I said it was the best day of my life. When I got my port w/3rd, stage 4 dx, I said it was the best day!!! I can't believe getting accessed somewhere outside of the cancer center will mean they need to use veins...ugh. I also have aches & pains, but they're mostly due to muscular exertion, even though I always fear it's due to lurking bc cells. I am lucky to be doing well, but I take prozac, do acupuncture, walk & am going back to yoga to keep my mind sane. I pray earnestly for everyone, all of us, living with this disease.",

I haven't had them since Aug & he said they aren't planning any. Said w/TMs good (faithful to me) & good physical condition, no scans. He said if some little thing showed up, they wouldn't really know what to do with it...has to be a combo of how I feel, markers, etc, before he'll scan. Mattie...this is such good news!

I had total diep flap recon 6/12 following recurr 6/11. Clear scans, great blood, markers. At my 12/12 scans, a liver full of tumors.  All I could think was 12 hours of mutilating my body and now...stage 4.  Of course, being on chemo prevented some inside healing in my stomach so it's probably more of a physical hinderence to me than chemo. Just a bummer, but I do have boobs and mostly flat tummy.  I will also pray for negative scans!!! Jo..did you get a power port instead of a regular one?  This was my second power port,, which is nice for scans, etc, but they do stick out. My first one was bothersome but I attributed it to knowing I was getting rid of it. This one I knew was a lifer../but it is in a better spot, I think. Gooood luck with it!  Should be your bosom buddy by Dec!!!! Went to gp on Mon for wellness check.  Told her I couldn't catch my breath, bp up, heart races.  Saw my tms from last Wed were great, great enzymes & blood.  Told her I was worried about mets, for no reason other than my onc was gone & I wanted scans.  She did thyroid, sed rate and a couple tests that may show mets, but thought underlying problem is anxiety.  Oh my...hit the nail on the head!  I went home and that night could breathe!  Feeling better so even though she thought I could try meds, think I'll see my center's psych.  And all the tests were totally normal so she said it was a good sign no other mets since the tests showed no inflammation of any kind. Breathing much easier....which we all know is a tough thing sometimes! I see my new one 8/22....looking forward to it. XOXO",

I could get used to it...but like all of us...always on guard! You put my thoughts into words, thank you! Sometimes when people (my sister is the main one) start telling me about things going on in their lives (I'd call it scuttle butt), I find myself wanting to scream, \"Who Cares!!!\" I find I have very little patience for trivial things...most of what life is made up of...thinking it's a waste of time & energy. But then I find myself being almost panic stricken...wanting to micro-manage things like grandchildrens' or my kids' diets, or discipline (I'm the parent that yelled at my kids & find that now I can't fathom my grandkids being in time outs!!)...all because I feel like I have to instill all the life lessons quickly, if I'm not here to help in the future. My BIL said (privately) it's the chemo that poisons and takes my \"fun spirit\" away...and I think that's a bit true...but it's the fact that we have a disease that's robbing us of being who we were & knowing how much time is left...and it's hard to overcome that thought all the time (even though no one's time is certain). Seriously...I love my life, my family, my friends (mostly you all), my faith in God & church..and I know every day is a blessing...so dang it...don't waste my time & energy...right??? LOL!!!!! So Syr...love you & you are NORMAL to most of us! Jaytee...I have capsular retraction (like shrivels from shrunken tumors) so my liver will never be clear...but my onc likes my scans, saying he thinks what's shrinking is just scar tissue...so anything shrinking is great news! Good news on lower dosage and a parking sticker!! Both will make each day a little easier, I think :) Leah...I'm so sorry TMs are up. Which marker is it? I only have cea & ca2729. I will keep praying that scans are good. Woohoo for a healthy heart, Penny! I smiled reading about your tech relationship...I have the same! First time I said I knew he wasn't supposed to give me results-he said he's not supposed to but didn't mean he wouldn't :). He's a black man married to a blonde women & showed me pix of his darling kids. My DD is a blonde married to a black man so I showed pix of Grandaughter. He also said he does mostly cancer patients and he knows it doesn't matter if you led the healthiest/worst lifestyles, and that he's scared sh..less to get cancer...such honesty was so refreshing! So he's my go-to guy now. She gave you a present!!! That's so touching...you've impacted her as you have us! Wondering how long you'll do xeloda but that's probably what you'll be learning soon. Hope her/perj were kind yesterday (Josie's 7th bday..on the 7th & she told everyone she's lost 7 teeth so it's a triple gold bda Woody...I know your team was tickled to see you & happy for the drop in your marker. That, along with good liver enzymes & blood is very heartening!!! Prayers for great scans in 3 weeks...you and I will be visiting the onc the same week. I'm hoping you're feeling strong after treatment...I know being \"truly home\" must give you an added boost of joy! I did a 5 mile walk with grandoggie today...loving sunny California!!

I am forever grateful my onc chose it first..which she said she usually does for mets. And...now I'm grateful to onc #2...for taking me off it after 22 months! I saw him Wed, my 6 month anniv of my last Navelbine. He said he's very happy that I'm doing so well on herc/perj/letrozole & asked if I knew how good my markers are :-) (his nurse calls me every 3rd Fri, after infusion and markers that Wed). He said in 6 months, if all stays the same (which he expects...even though I'm nervous), perjeta will be dropped. He said it's obvious my C is her2+ sensitive & research for years has shown herceptin can do the job...although he'll monitor even more closely. He said he's going to be developing a study w/her2+ bc mets women, who've reached remission-ME-in regards to vaccine, etc. he used the R word. I asked if it's allowed to use that word in today's cancer terms....he said, \"I just did.\" I then got my latest TM's-cea-.7 (which it's been since on Navelbine for a few months), ca2729- less than 5...not measurable. I'm a bit numb, very happy & thankful for this smart onc, who looked at my history & came up w/the right plan. Yep...a blessing, for sure.

Brnxgirl, I'm surprised they put a port in before actually knowing your tx regimen, but I totally agree, with regular blood draws & scans, it's a great option to spare the pricking. I also don't understand no mouse tail into the main artery. That's how meds are sent into the system. Mine is also a bard power port & you see the complete outline through my skin. With first dx, my onc said I didn't need one, tax/cytoxan & herceptin, but at first infusion, my nurse said to get one (herceptin would be a year, so lots of needles). I said my happiest day was getting the port out. With 3rd dx, the happiest day was getting my port put in. They said chemo for life so there was no option, which was fine with me. My second one is a tiny bit lower so no wide necks (the tail doesn't bother me) & swim suits are tricky, but any time I complain about it, my family says it's my badge of courage. I can imagine your children being upset, Patty, my kids are grown & understand the cancer story. My grandkids always seem to hit it, but after 3 years, it's wrapped in scar tissue. I always use lidocaine cream 1-2 hours before infusion so they don't have to inject it. I figure the less pokes the better. I appreciate the fact they have lpn & rns doing access...it takes a while longer at blood draw, not as many do ports, but I like it's so sterile (I still watch like a hawk, as some sisters have had infections). It will take a while before it feels right, Patty, but thinking about what you've been through and your hospital experiences, I'm sure it'll be a big relief! Who knows, maybe your kids will see you as the superwoman you are!!!",

A brutal 12 hr surgery but it went well (I'm a good, strong, healer!).  With 2nd step, 11/12, I noticed bulging in my pelvic area that was dismissed by my ps...guess it's not uncommon.  At my 6 month scan, 12/12, my liver was FULL of tumors.  My team felt cells were probably in my liver early on, but being healthy w/strong immune system kept it dormant.  Going through the surgeries may have weakened that and cells grew.  Since I had to start chemo immediately, my healing suffered a bit.  Over the months, even being careful to not lift, etc, I got diastasis (bulging) and more upsetting, a hernia.  The main comment from the drs was how great my abs were...always firing even after surgery.  After seeing a hernia specialist, her comment was-it's not uncommon w/diep.  Very LONG story but in a nutshell...i have friends w/implants that're great.  I have nice breasts, but the price I paid in losing my great core...not worth it.  Months of healing & I'll never know if it all broke me down & helped mets cook.  Whatever you decide...stay strong.  Many have great success & if you're considering back transfer, it'd be less risky, I think.  Good luck!!!",

One thing that's weird is my bc hand fingers are a little swollen.  I'll ask Wed, but I don't want lymphedema & I don't know if there is a chance of that.  Since I had diep...maybe those channels are really messy and will take longer to heal.  Anyhoo...sorry to go on & on...the accupuncture dr said he needed to calm me down...to which my DH said...good luck with that!  When he finished, I asked if he'd fixed me...to which he said, I wasn't broken.  I liked that, cause sometimes I feel like a walking disaster :-)",

It's so lonely when they're gone, but what a beautiful life...to be loved and nurtured for that many years!!!  Our DDs have cats in their families...and with each vet appt, they wonder how Skeeter made it so long, so healthy :-). I'm comparing myself to her...going to go the distance...and wishing it for all my sisters.  I share the wish that the euphoria of a good scan would last. It seems when someone asks about it, and I relay good news, I get energized.  Then the reality of \"the other shoe dropping\" comes back.  I guess that's why I need/love this place...we get to share what SUE calls, a victory for one of us is a victory for all of us!  I feel that so strongly.  So I'm still cheering :-) Patti...I remember when you posted a pic of a new hairstyle...cutie you!  You spend your days making others feel good...what a gift...just wish I could pamper you...but it wouldn't be cutting your hair :-).  I'm a good foot rubber!!!  Hope to hear about acupuncture & hope it helps you feel like you again!  I've been reading lots about it & am hlad I got an appt too!

I found that I could tune out quite well, or walk away, which was never my personality. I never missed a social event...now, like Kjones, I decide if these are truly people I want to spend time with. Mostly, I focus more on my legacy of loving and nurturing than just about anything else (easier because I'm almost 61...not so easy for my younger mets sisters). I bought a new pair of asics yesterday & my daughter said, \"Wow, Mom, that's your second pair of shoes!\" I was confused. She reminded me at dx, when given 5 months, I commented that at least I didn't have to keep buying expensive walking shoes :-). The bummer...they havebright pink laces!
