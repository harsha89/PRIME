I have been taking Motrin for pain and headache. In the middle of all of this, one morning after radiation, I started seeing lightning bolts in my vision. Ended up at the eye doctor. Diagnosed with a new aura - I had showers of sparkles before. I also prayed for radiation not to damage heart and lungs. I was finally told to look out for a cough that antibiotics won't take away and to make appointment with RO for steroids.  Brightness 456 - I was told that I needed to heal up for 4-6 weeks after surgery to start radiation. I started 7 weeks after surgery because of waiting on Oncotype DX test results to come back. Radiation for 5 weeks will be 5 times a week and then you can start getting your life back together. I was told 5 weeks to start and then they shortened it to 3 weeks of accelerated treatment. I am going to dermatologist for checkup on Monday. It will be interesting to hear what she has to say about skin treatment after radiation. I will let you all know what she says. Boy, we all been through it all. I pray for strength and healing for all of you daily.",

On your question about NP - I would rather see a doctor than a NP unless it would be on a rotating basis and for general care and not a follow-up. I have had a few visits that weren't followed up with a NP in other areas of my health care and ended up costing more time, pain, and money. On the follow-up mammogram - a friend of mine is a RO and she said the the doctor who did the biopsy and your MO and RO should work together to get a date for the follow-up. It is usually 6 months to 1 year after diagnosis. I feel uneasy waiting for 1 year. I have also been prescribed with Tamoxifen. Only been on it for a week. All seems okay. I feel like have taken Dramamine - sleepy, cotton mouth, and on the verge of nausea. I take it at night. I also take Zyrtec with it. Some women take Claritin it is suppose to help with the bone pain. I was diagnosed with osteopenia from my dexascan and will probably be receiving Prolia. Has anyone been give this?",
