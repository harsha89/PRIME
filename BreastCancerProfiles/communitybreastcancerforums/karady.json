After googling , found out there are three sub divisions within that level. However they did not distinugish 4A , 4B or 4C in the report. They recommended Needle Biopsy . The report says \" There are increasing calcifications.... \" We are still waiting for the doctor's office to call us about it . They are not responding in the rate we would like. My questions are a) How to identify if it is 4A , 4B , 4C b) What is the prognosis ? What is the percentage of turning into cancer. The wait is killing us. Thanks everyone . Log in to post a reply",
