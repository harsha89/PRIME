I plan on having a single skin sparing mastectomy on my left breast and after reconstruction ( expander) my PS will do a lift  and add a implant on my right breast.  I figured that all women have a 12.5 % chance of getting BC ( 1out of every 8 ).  I have a 10% chance for getting bc on the good breast, the way I look at it that I have a better chance of not getting cancer on my good breast then I did of not getting bc at all. I hope & pray that I made the correct decision.. if not I will face whatever i need to ... DOWN THE ROAD. Thanks for all of your help!",

The lab report of the FNB on two areas indicated low grade IDC.  They are 6mm and 8mm, therefore I need a mastectomy( I am a 36 b in a well padded bra LOL).  I am happy that I get a  mamo every year, this was discovered in my yearly mammogram.  My breast surgeon said that the good breast can be watched although I have dense breast tissue they were  very good at discovering these very small cites.  My BS says that I would have a 10% chance of getting BC in the good breast. so I am struggling with is the risk of 10% worth removing a health breast, I know it comes down to this.  My PS suggest removing both, his  wife, and other family members had/have BC.  I don't have a family history so... Did you have a skin sparing mx? if so what type of reconstruction did you  have?",
