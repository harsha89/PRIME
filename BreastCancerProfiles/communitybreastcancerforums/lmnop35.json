    "Content": "lmnop35 wrote: Hello all, I apologize if this is not the appropriate forum for this question. I was wondering if you all shave your armpits (with a real razor) after a an SNB. I only had 2 nodes removed so I know the risk of lymphadema is slim, but I hate to take chances. But, on the other hand, shaving with an electric really doesn't cut it. Any thoughts? Also wondering about professional manicures since they sometimes warn you of infections. Thanks for the advice! DX: 2/4/10 age 35. DCIS with 1mm microinvasion, Stage 1, ER/PR-, HER2+++.
