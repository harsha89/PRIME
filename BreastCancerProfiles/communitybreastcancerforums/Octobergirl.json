      "Content": "Feb 6, 2011 03:25PM - edited Feb 6, 2011 03:26PM by Octobergirl Friends, thanks for your responses.  Kerry Mac, I had emailed my onc and asked his advice about having an MRI at the March appt. and have not received a reply. The clinic called with my appt. times and there was no MRI scheduled. Of course this change may change his answer. The March appts. are 6 wks.from now. As far as the vacation, I can definitely go and enjoy it without perseverating about the lump. Maybe that is what scares me...I seem to have a well-developed capacity for denial and deferment with health issues. So calling my onc would not be to relieve the angst...the fear I wrote about isn't going to go away no matter what the onc says. I just want to make the right clinical decision despite the fear and denial. I want to think 6 wks.won't likely matter re outcome of this but as Kandy said there is a change. Are there other reasons for hard lumps in postmenopausal breasts? Other things wander around in my head. What if this were another kind of cancer that Als don't touch?  Does 6 wks. matter then? I  know my initial Her2 test was not definitive and it took the FISH test to get a Her2 neg. diagnosis...is that usual? Still trying to figure this out. Weesa, glad this helps you. Sometimes, it helps to get out of the tunnel...or circle...guess that is exactly what I'm trying to do by coming to you all.  Thanks again and know I send light to each of you as I read. Molly",

      "Content": "Octobergirl wrote: I wrote in October about a biopsy for a very small lump (hard to palpate and hard to biopsy) in my right/contralateral breast. The biopsy was benign, thank God, but there was a lot of fibrocystic disease and inflammation and they saw a second tiny lump that seems to be \"part of the same system\". I am to have a followup ultrasound at the end of March and my annual mammo at the same time.  Now it feels like the lump is about double in size. My breast is still sore in the area.  I don't know if there could be a hematoma or increased inflammation from the biopsy itself or if this goes with the fibrocystic disease and I'm arguing with myself about whether it is ok to wait until late March for the recheck. I desperately want to put this off...to stay in out-of-treatment mode a little longer and head to Florida for warmer weather...but then I tell myself it is incredibly stupid to risk spread to my lymph nodes if it happens to be cancer. On top of that, I've just read a study that links inflammation to growth of breast cancer cells and the radiologist described the area as having a lot of inflammation during the biopsy.  I usually can come to a logical decision in cases like this but I seem to have no perspective or balance now because of conflicting feelings of fear and avoidance. I am becoming more and more aware of my fear now that I am out of the long crisis of treatment and the ruptured appendix/infections that went on so long. Now this along with all the aches and pains from Als and radiation damage....metastisis?...makes me feel like I'm losing all balance at times. Ironically, much of my work was in crisis management.  A coworker once said I was so calm that if I took a Valium I'd fall asleep for the winter. I stayed pretty calm and balanced throughout surgery and tx. and through the appendix debacle. Now I am becoming so aware of this fear....not panic that makes one run to the dr. over every pain or worry...just an ever-deepening fear as the reality sinks in that I've been dealt a pretty bad hand with Stage 3 breast cancer. I have no idea whether I am overworrying about this to compensate for usually minimizing physical issues. Or am I overcompensating for the fear by telling myself that it is a PTSD reaction and to  just wait till March? And, girls, I'm sorry I've run on so long trying to explain why I no longer know what to do.  My questions are: 1) Has anyone here had experience with this kind of pathology after initial diagnosis?  2) Any advice re rechecking this...trust the radiologist recommendation and wait til March or call now? 3)What are the stages of the psychological struggle against this looming beast that will never go away?  Help!!!!!

I've also had 2 Birads 4a MRI results at Duke in my right breast...my cancer was in my left breast...resulting in 1 benign biopsy and 1 repeat MRI at Moffitt Ctr. that was read as a Birads 3 recommendation to have a 3rd MRI in 6 mths. That's where I stand today.  I know there is a real question how long the Letrozole will be effective to prevent recurrence, especially since I had a high Ki-67 score, 63% (just learned this at Moffitt and wondering what else don't I know since Duke didn't let me know about my Oct. MRI results until March when I happened to find it posted to my online patient record. Sideline rant: why are these oncologists so much less interested in talking about long term follow up and prevention of recurrence than about a diagnosis and treatment?) Anyway, I'm so weary of the abnormal results/biopsies long cycle that preceded my cancer diagnosis and continues after.....I feel like I've chased my tail around the tree for yrs. now. I have relatively large, extremely dense breasts that were once my friends but now only exacerbate the problem. I'm wondering if anyone here has considered a bilateral mastectomy or even significant breast reduction to reduce the breast cells that spawn these inflammatory/fibroid issues as well as produce circulating estrogen cells postmenopausally (is that even a word?) that feed recurrence???  Can that significantly lessen the endless appts., tests, murky results and second guessing? Am I crazy to be looking for an answer when I know the larger risk for recurrence is distant metastisis from the positive nodes? I haven't posted much lately but lurk often.

I have the feeling that I am in danger of being labeled \"a worrier\"...or \"the patient who reads too much\"...or \"controlling\" (a convenient label for any woman who persists with a question or conversation until there is some resolution).  Actually, I am none of these.  My work was crisis intervention with high risk kids and families.  I think in terms of understanding and assessing a situation/problem and then making/communicating a plan to AVOID crises. I have a lot of practice putting in my time upfront to circumvent future problems.  It is interesting to me that I am receiving, internally or externally, the script that I am worrying too much about this as I try to make sense of my own crisis :).

He said that Vit D accumulates in one's system (unlike water soluble vitamins) so it sounds plausible that the increase over time could cause calcium level increase over time, as in your case.  If applicable, I can try to cut and copy the (longish) article here or forward the article to you. To stage 3ers, the gist of the article is that the newest govt. standards continue to underestimate  optimal therapeutic levels for Vit. D....I did not want to imply the article opposes Vit.

The problem is the NC plan has a $1million lifetime cap which apparently doesn't fall under the new legislation prohibiting lifetime caps. I am really upset about this...what's the point in offering a stage 3 cancer patient insurance coverage with a $1mil. lifetime cap?  I plan to bring this to the attention of  our WNC Congressman Heath Shuler. It would be helpful if Congress and the NC legislature heard about this from all over the state.  Regarding the new federal high risk pool, rates are even more affordable and subsidies are available but you have to have been without insurance for 6 months to qualify. What a way to promote continuity of care! I wish you success in making the transition....manuvering through the insurance company hoops can be frustrating and discouraging.  Maybe we can learn from your experience. ",

And I thank Chrissy and the Stage IV forum for allowing us here at all.   Sometimes, one's questions are best answered by personal experience and guidance not found in healthcare system. I am there now. Since late Feb., I have had progressive tightness and soreness along the left side of my throat. My onc's NP had mentioned a bumpy hardness there at my Dec. checkup and decided they were bones so noticable because of my low body weight. I felt fine then and wasn't worried. But now the throat tightness and upper torso aches around my shoulder blades are noticable daily. My gut tells me I am about to enter a room with no exit....like it told me in 2009 the new lump was not just another cyst. I can't call the onc...I can't pickup the phone to do that. My next appt is late May for 6 mth check and breast MRI. The cancer ctr. is 4 hrs away and I know they need heads-up to schedule any testing for the symptoms. Every night, I tell myself I'll do it 1st thing the next morning but then I choose 1 more day in my familiar world. My fear and sense of loss is mirrored by the fact we brought my Mom home last week with hospice care after a horrendous emergency hospitalization for diabetes-induced kidney failure. My brother called me and DH and I drove 13 hours from vacation, hoping to get to her bedside in time. Though making decisions has been hard and not without controversy, my sibs and I are committed to holding her hand and honoring her desire to die at home.  Time is short and I want to be there for her as much as possible.  I need guidance to deal with this fear about my own situation and to find my way forward.  I know I'm different from many on BCO who feel safest calling the onc early about new symptoms...I experience making that call as jumping into the abyss. Please tell me if you've had this experience. Thank you for taking the time to read this.  ",

Last year, I saw a local dr. here for antibiotics (recommended by my onc) and she prescribed them very reluctantly since she hadn't seen me before. Ma111, thinking about why I haven't called...it's really just fear. If it comes to chemo again, I don't know what my decision would be. I would ask questions, push my onc for all the straight facts and look at all options including clinical trials. And I would travel. I guess life has a way of moving forward whether or not we do. I weighed after I arrived here and have lost over 5 lbs. fairly quickly...a lot since I only regained to 104 where I held steady 3 yrs. post-tx. And I'm having more pain around my left shoulder blade. I will call 1st thing Monday morning....after a peaceful Sunday afternoon with my Mama. Again, thanks for the support here.
