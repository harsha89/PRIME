And why do they keep calling it surgery if it is a biopsy?   Thankful that in a few days we will have the distraction of my daughters dance competition at Myrtle Beach. Quality time with the kids and our dance family is always great!!!",

Apparently, the first doctor was really lucky on 6/19 to isolate the duct.   My surgeon was comfortable doing the surgery with the dye, using films from previous ductogram.  Surgery went well, doctor informed my husband that everything looked normal around excision so he was hopeful that pathology report would come back clear. Observations... The hospital staff was great and moved quickly to try to keep me on schedule...even though the ductogram had me an hour late.  My anesthesiologist provided clear expectations and made sure I was given anti - nausea medicines during and after surgery. I woke up with chills and hyper sensitive to anything touching my breast.  Felt like I was being slashed by the wolverine.  That sensation finally went away about midnight.  Just used saran wrap to cover breast and was able to bathe this morning.  Just took my meds (doctor recommended taking full dosages through today and tapering off tomorrow). Sleeping in my recliner was a great idea, but hard to get good rest once the family is awake.  Waiting on post op to get results. However surgeon told my husband to call for an appointment next week which is much sooner than scheduled appointment.  So I'll wait optimistically and wait for results. ",

Everyone is telling me I'll be fine and I just don't believe them.  Adding to insult...my uncle is within his last days of life (kidney cancer) and my best work friend has just been referred to Hospice for end of life care (analysis and liver cancer) .   I'm finding it hard to be optimistic when all the things I told them now seem to be end of road...
