Just got two of my drains out a few days ago and will be getting the other one out on Tuesday. I will also be getting a filling if my incisions look better. Have trouble getting that black tissue off. He suggested scrubbing with hydrogen peroxide. Any suggestions on that? Going on my 4th week post op and feeling about 50% of pre surgery self. Chest feels tight all of the time. Sucks sleeping sitting up since I am a side sleeper. Take my percs and valium less each week. Found out this past week that I will be starting Herceptin, Taxotere and Carboplatin, yuk. I went from DCIS stage 0 to IDC stage 1, HER2+. I have to do 13 rounds of Herceptin and 6 rounds of TC, x 3 weeks. Not looking forward to losing my long beautiful hair, :(. I have been positive through my whole experience and will continue as long as I can. I figure my situation could be worse!! I just thankful that I made the right decision for my BMX instead of waiting as see. Any suggestions are welcomed and appreciated.",
