I can see everyone talks about when they started and where they are. Is there just a link for that to compare with. I too stated TCH on the 15th, still have hair but expect to to go soon. However my nurse said not to shave it since some people only get a bit of thinning. so I didn't yet. I worry then it may not be working a well on the ones with hair still. Funny how we think. Like since mu side effects were not as awful as I thought is it working. I will regret those words I am sure. Any other moms on here with kids. Any one have any tips and tricks they are doing to stop this from coming back. Pray of course but anything else you are doing?? Kara",

I am going threw #3 on Wednesday and thus far it has not been too bad (3-6) days are blah but gosh I am sorry to say it is not as bad as I thought. I worry it is not doing the job. IO am still having to shave, did not lose any hair where I I could have given up bikini was UGH. I shaved my head only cause I wanted to fit it ( ok not really just tired of following myself around with a vacuum) but now I have peach fuzz. I got my period, awful for 6 days. I can not stop whining. If it is doing the job then I am blessed and sorry for bragging but am I only the one that does not have it as awful as I planned and think maybe the drugs are not enough or doing the job. HEY WHAT AMOUNT DO YOU GET . I do weekly  and I don't have any problems, thank GOD as well. I can eat a Big mac and fries (super size in 3 minutes flat) so I have not even lost a pound, no nausea, no meds at home, little burn when I drink soda the first few days but not enough to stop the double fisted Diet Pepsi. Anyone out there can you relate. REAlly only word of wisdom is don't eat Jalapenos after chemo. For those that are having a hard time, know that you are being healed and that the light at the end of tunnel is almost here. Subway  light not any other light. So I pray for you each day, for us all. Blessings and Hugs",

I too wear hats but in Florida it is so hot. I am still embarrassed to wear nothing although I would love to. What do people that are brave enough to go bald seem to think of people around you. I have a 5 and 10 year old and they think it is cool but I wonder what their friends say. Blessings and Hugs to you all. This will go away. I am watching funny videos and that will make you feel better. ABC family. Laugh so much I wet may wet myself. That could be a new side effect though.",

Would love for you to share and lend support. I pray for each of you daily and as soon as I see a postin my email I read and say a prayer for what ever your needs are. Take care:) I also wanted to share that I have loads of easy recipes to go with so anytime you need to know what is for dinner pop over and look something up. When I had my surgery I could not or was afraid to move my arms for fear of ripping a stich and using bags to do everything was a huge help and as a chef I had always used them but invented The Bag Holder to have a container to help me to everything that a bowl or plastic containers did. I hope you love it, share it and show some support. I was a TCH girl and currently in the neratinib trial with 4 weeks left. Since I thought I would be dead by now I moved quick and wanted to make things hapen, do any of you feel that way. Praying for a cure each day> http://www.thebagholder.net/  see me on face book too:)",

I am trying to enjoy all this, read what I should and shouldn't eat, what may interfere with chemo. I still don't have a port anyone else the same. I am so chicken and really don't want to have some other thing attached to my body. Is anyone that had a bilateral having radiation as well. No one has said anything to me about it but just curious. To the diet pepsi gal, it was my first love and am having one today but really need to cut down a lot so I am, but my throat doesn't burn today so I am enjoying it. I am praying for all you ladies starting this week, it really is not as bad as we think and I brought cards and peanut butter crackers, drank a ton of vitamin water (defense, and orange, drank a ton of crystal light immunity) had a chicken salad sandwich for lunch there and then it was over 5 hours and done. You will get through FAITH OVER FEAR!!!  Anyone else HER2 here doing TCH and does anyone have young kids on here?? Mom to 5 and 9 year olds",

I wish there was a little survey so maybe we could over time find a common denominator(haven't used that word since high school). I would definatly lose my drivers license when this is over.

How in the freaking world did they miss this and allow it to spread like this. What is the trial concotion you are trying to get into. I am going to put you on every prayer list I know. Did the doctors not listen, did you have pain, I saw you had liver scans or tests months ago and they found nothing then. What is your onc saying NOW! I am praying every second and woke thinking of you so prayer is all around you. Michelle, I had a few scans when I was diagnosed and all clear but taht was 16 months ago and I want more. I am on the neratinib trail and all is going well but I am not sure if it is placebo or not. Feels real:) I had a scare with thryoid cancer this June, had a biopsy a etc but thankfully it was enlarged nodules. I did do loads of research and it seems easily removeable and treatable.  Well I am praying for you both and all the rest that this crappy cancer never hits any of us again. Blessings and Hugs kara",

I also think it made my stomach burn so only one a day for three days instead of two. Anyone else TCH and no steroid or decrease. Ok the period thing. My onc said depending on how close your body was to menopause is how strong or often you will get your period. Apparently mine thinks I am a teenage. Lasted 7 days and still a bit. Today I did not shave my legs so that is good, it did not grow and the peach fuzz coming in is gray so I think I got the wrong hair growth order.. Anyone wanna change. I have never died my hair but I am about to spray paint my scalp. Alright girls. Stay Strong, FAITH OVER FEAR. Say it , feel it believe it.
