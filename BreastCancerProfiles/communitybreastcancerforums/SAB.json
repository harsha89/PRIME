I was fortunate to be BRCA negative, but a positive result would have indicated a different surgery for me.  Don't feel bad about advocating for yourself.  Do research, ask questions and explore your options.  Take lots of notes and if all else fails ask for your path reports and get a second opinion.  It's your body!",

In the end though, thinking about that distracts me from the job of fighting this right now, and also from the happy task of living. I have a good friend who is a nine year survivor and she said it takes a good long while before you start each day thinking about bc.

(p. 49 if you have the book.) Sort of a self-limiting mechanism, and so when they are removed it allows new blood supplies to be established, and thus new tumors.  The book is advocating the prevention of cancer through a reduction in inflammation (diet and environmental factors) that will help prevent new blood supplies from growing.Meanwhile, a line of research was established for blood supply and cancer control about 1994. I'm not sure if that line of research panned out or not because of course the author Servan-Schreiber eventually succumbed to his own brain cancer. ",
