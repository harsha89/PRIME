I think I need to have another talk with them, with your post in mind. I am only 4 months into this mets journey. Discovered at my onc appointment yesterday that our first drug of treatment - good old Arimidex, which I was on for 5 years (and was taken off of 1.5 years ago as per protocol) - isn't working, as my markers jumped from 153-253. He said that he wasn't surprised, put me on faslodex, and let me know that chemo was next on the list should faslodex not work. Up until then I had been doing well, even planning for future adventures! - but the past 24 hours have been blue blue blue. I'm so glad I read this thread - this is the kind of encouragement I need, especially when my mom already has me 'dying'. Leslie ",

I was actually on a boat stoking the fires at this: waterfire.org/ until midnight on Saturday - what a difference!!  Thank you all for your input - my oncologist is probably sick of me bringing you all up at my visits, but truly, I would be hard pressed to continue any part of this journey without every one of you.",
