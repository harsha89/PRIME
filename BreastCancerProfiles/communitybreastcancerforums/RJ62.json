Its scary to think that this has come back again. But I do not have any mets anywhere else which is good. Thanks again.",

Turns out that I started to develop a fever Sunday afternoon and by Monday I felt like I had been hit by a mack truck. I went in to see the PS Tuesday morning (He was not in Monday). My fever was 101 at this time. The tube had got another clot inside where I could not see and was not draining. Fluid was building up and I got an infection. He had to remove the drain as it was not doing its job. I am on a heavy round of antibotics and am feeling better today.Boy was I in a lot of pain.I still have pain but not so bad. Underneath my mast scar it had turned red, hard and swollen. I see the doc again on Friday and he will probably have to aspirate since the drain was not ready to come out yet. My hole is closing where the drain tube went in so I cannot get much fluid out (it sure came out yesterday when the tube was pulled.) Gushed actually......pretty gross.  Just more we girls have to deal with. In 2000 when I had this done on the other side I was actually hosptilized for infection (sudomundous..sp?). My fever was higher and I had green puss coming out. YUCK!!!. So this infection bit scares me. I knew when I developed a fever that it was not good. So for you girls out there going through this or are about to, get in to the Dr's quick anytime you deveope a fever and are sore and achey beyond the norm. Thanks for everbody's support. This board is great and I have learned a great deal. I just wish it was here 8 yrs ago when I went through all this for the first time.   ",

So I guess 1 out of three isn't bad (this last one was from a seperate AND) The Dr. didn't take any blood tests which I though was odd. I will see if it gets better. I feel better today so I think the antibiotics are working. Thank you all for your support.",

I had a mast done on the left side in 2000 with recon and the pain was excruciating for a while. The doctor (plastic surgeon) said I did not have a lot of muscle and skin to work with and that is why it was so painful. I guess all the pulling and manipulating they had to do.  The recon did not work out and was removed due to complications. I was in the hospital a couple of days.

I did not go to ER but this morning as I was milking my 6 inch tube (not an easy position when the drain is at your rib cage) the clot let loose. My bulb filled up in like 5 secs. (its a little one). It is draining now..WOO HOO. I over did myself yesterday (cleaned the house) And I wonder if that broke the clot loose. I know I shouldn't be doing anything strenuous but I couldn't stand my house any longer. I am paying for it today as I am real sore. Today will be a relaxing day. Thanks everbody for your help. It was greatly appreciated. The only thing is, I had to wrap the bulb since it is now touching my skin by my rib cage and it is a cold clamy feeling. I believe I can wait until tomorrow to see the sugeon as it is draining great. Thanks again everybody. Newbie..... Yes go BLUE  ",

I no longer have to keep my arm glued to my ribcage. Sorry for all you girls that had to stay in the hospital and/or be cut open again for a stupid infection. Just more we have to go through besides the normal pain in the @$% stuff that goes along with this unfortunate disease. I don't think the real world has any idea what we have to go through.(many many dr's appointments, testing, waiting for the results, surgery's, chemo, radiation, the list goes on)Whether there are no complications (which is hard enough) and god forbid if there is. We are tough and everyday we wake up is hopefully one day behind us and on the way to recovery.",

I had a lot of blood clots coming out in the beginning and I have been stripping it alot. I have had a clot stuck right where the tube starts to enter the skin for about 2 days now (under arm drain from AND). Anyway it is not draining well now and fluid is building up. I keep milking it and I can get the fluid out but now I am afraid that this short tube is not going to withstand much more milking before it breaks again. The Dr's office is not open till Monday. What do you think they will do? This clot has to get removed (it is still there) and I think the only way to do that is to pull the drain. I am not ready to have the drain pulled as it is still putting out 60-70 cc's a day. I am 10 days post op. Also I had a mast 3 weeks ago and the drain is catching some of that fluid also. I am leaking out of my hole where the drain tube goes in and have to change my bandage a couple times a day.    I am thinking that they will pull the drain out and I will have to come in every couple of days to have it asperated.
