I felt like I was reading my own post.  I am waiting for my cousin to be tested and she keeps saying she will and hasn't gone yet.  She has fought with my genetic counselor over appointment times etc... I really believe she doesn't want to know (already had BC about 12 years ago) and can't tell me that. My take is this.  I have to do everything in my power to get her to test.  If she does not then I go with what I have and be prepared to live with my decisions.  Alot of times people truely do not understand the testing and how the results can help you.  If you would like to talk you can email me at charisamc at gmail dot com. I would love to talk to someone who is also in my boat.  I am in the planning stages of PBM.  Also had a lump earlier this month... appears begine.",
