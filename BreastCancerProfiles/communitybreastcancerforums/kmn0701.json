These are some songs I've thought of so far: ~Tubthumping (Chumbawamba)Â  ~Dreams (The Cranberries) ~Blue Savannah (Erasure) ~Sweet Escape (Gwen Stefani) ~Soak up the Sun (Sheryl Crow) ~Leave You Far Behind (Lunatic Calm) ~Unwritten (Natasha Bedingfield) ~Ain't No Mountain High Enough (Michael McDonald) These are pretty much ALL over the music spectrum but that's fun for me, I like a little bit of everything. Any others that you just love when you're feeling down?? ~Kristine Dx 11/18/2008, IDC, 6cm+, Stage IIIA, Grade 3, 2/14 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

I'm not around the forum as much as I used to be....sometimes it's SO difficult to try to get past it all when you're surrounded by it, you know? I finished Herceptin in February & had reconstruction that month also. Working on getting the foobies to look the same, as the left (cancer) side had the radiation & radical mastectomy....so the skin is much tighter/thinner. Might have to have another reconstruction, time will tell. Going to see a new Oncologist as I was never really happy with mine. When I finished chemo she basically sent me on my way with blood work follow ups every three months for awhile. No scans of any sort. I have two little girls (ages 6 & 4) so that's not good enough for me. I want a scan for some confirmation that the damn drugs did their job.",
