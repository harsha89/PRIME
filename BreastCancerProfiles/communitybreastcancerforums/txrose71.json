I have tissue expanders and before going into surgery last week my surgeon decided that my expander was sitting up too high and had too much saline in it for him to see a vein.  He said he wanted to put the port in my neck! Needless to say the surgery was cancelled and I had 100cc's of saline taken out of my expander. The surgeon said he still would now know until he goes in for surgery whether it will be my chest or my neck. Just want to know if anyone here has a port in their neck or any experience with this.  Seems as though the chest would be soo much better  any info would be greatly  appreciated Thanks! :) ",
