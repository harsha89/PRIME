Then couple days later got my lab results and the Ixempra had brought my TM's down from 169 to 67! That is waaaay more than any other drug has done for me! I am sticking to my new chemo regimen for now but if it fails to work I will definitely look at Ixempra again,,,just maybe in smaller dose.  Good Luck to you-",

I am going to call the pain specialist tomorrow to get the details. sounds like steroid injection may be what he has planned. However, he didnt say anything about needing a series of them. Got my insurance approval and they are going to cover it....but with a hefty copay.  At this point I may put it off and see of he can give me stronger pain meds because I am having pain in mets to hips too and he said that meds would be best to address that issue. ",

Onc sent me to pain specialist. He says the source is probably mets in my lower spine. He gave me cortizone shot which did not work. Went for MRI Wednesday...dont have results yet but doc says will probably do some sort of injection for it depending on results. I was thinking quick shot in docs office...but then his office contacted me about preregistering at the surgicenter and then told me not to eat anything for 6 hours before the procedure. Not sure what he has planned for me but you can bet I will find out before I just walk in to the clinic for my \"procedure\" Anyone out there had issues with pinched nerves?

I've considered it myself but my situation probably wont allow it from what I m learning from evreyone's posts. My dr. tells me I could live for years..mets is extensive in my bones (sternum, ribs, spine, both hips, skull) but hasnt spread to what he calls \"life-threatening organs\". I have been having severe pain in my hips even tho they were radiated in September...I would like to take some insurance money and do something fun before I am confined to a wheelchair! ",

Scans last month showed liver looks clear and my bone mets show improvement!  The main side effects I've had are numbness in my toes, a low grade fever in the evenings for about 3 days after treatment, and some flu like symptoms day 4 and 5. But this is one of the most tolerable chemos I've been on and I've been on just about everything over my 18 year struggle. Glad to hear others are having good responses as well!",

My back pain has decreased substantialy.  She has me walking every day and has incorporated both yoga and pilates in my exercises.  Since radiation on both my hips I have lost range of motion and cannot sit cross-legged. So, some of my exercises are modified. I go once a week with every other week in the pool...I love those days the most! It seems like I can move so much better in the water. Unfortunately, I dont have access to a pool the other days of the week. My husband joked that he would dig one in the backyard with his garden shovel ....but I declined his offer!!
