I am very scared because of the way the radiologist was showing me everything and the fact that she said likely its cancer. I am even more scared because I feel that it is worse than just a lump caught early - she showed a few areas of concern, used the word rare at one point and mentioned lymph nodes. Of course all this time I am in a state of shock because I suspect by now it's not a simple cyst, so everything she said is now kind of a blur. I wish someone else was there with me but as I mentioned I thought i was going as just a precaution. I will keep everyone posted. ",

My mom has worked in oncology for years and she has listened to me and has answered my questions about all of this, things I can expect if i have it, etc. Her knowledge and these posts are keeping me somewhat sane. My husband is not accepting this just yet-- he won't until this test comes back. He will be strong for me I know but right now I think he believes all will be okay . I thank you all from the bottom of my heart. I don't know any of you at all,  but I feel so comforted by your replies and you are all amazing. ",

I really want to hear some success stories right now. Thank you, this helps a lot!",

I am 43 and have 2 kids ages 6 and 8, so I know how scared you must be. I have met virtual friends on this site that have been such a support to me during this difficult time. You are not alone. I hope this comes back negative for you.  I had the same thing happen, they told me after my mammogram it was likely cancer and indeed it was, but please know that if that does happen, this is not a death sentence as someone stated above. Trust me you will feel better when you start talking to the doctors and get your treatment plan in place. I have finished my chemo and now facing surgery, so I am about half way through. Stay strong and please stay positive! Let us know what happens and if you need anything at all!",
