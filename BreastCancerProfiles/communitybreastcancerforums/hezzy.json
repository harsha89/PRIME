Last weekend I noticed that my shoulder ( scabula bone w/ b-mets ) was bruised.  I called my ONC and hadnt heard back from him.  I had an appt Monday so I figured when I saw him Id give it to him for not calling me back and letting me worry all weekend. (( i had bruising once before there after taking asperin but hadn't had asperin or pain meds for some time and was over worried going nuts )) When I went in Monday I told him about my concerns and he didnt even seemed shocked.  He than told me that the bone scan showed nothing in the scabula bone or hip.  He said there was a very small amount shown in the lower vertebrae.    I started screaming, laughing, and crying I was so happy.  Although the bone mets are still showing in the lower back it was still a relief to hear they didnt see them anywhere else.   It was the first time since I was DX that I have recieved good news. I was scared I'd never see my three year old grow older, or my husband would disappear ( he's not her father but has been there since she was three months and done more than her father could imagine but the thoughts are there that if something went wrong my family would fall apart )) For over a year I have worried about what the future will hold and cried myself to sleep. For the first time in over a year.  I cried happy tears.  I will continue to pray and have hope.  Thank you for everyone that has helped me, listened, or prayed with me along the way.

The ONC at first was going to put me on Xeloda, but due to komaden I cant take it right now.  Than, she said she was putting me on Tykerb which I was thrilled to hear. However, I have a severe phobia Ive had all my life.  Ive seen Dr's for it and been to groups for help and have not got past it.  My phobia is swallowing anything without it being chewed or liquid.  I was told I had to swallow the Tyberk its the only way to take it. Has anyone ever crushed it, to take it?  Please dont tell me ideas on how to take something Ive been threw them all with drs all my life .... and havent made it past.  Its sad on my part yes I know but Im asking for helpful ideas hezzy/heatherj heather j Dx 7/2/2007, IDC, 6cm+, Stage IV, 16/17 nodes, mets, ER+/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
