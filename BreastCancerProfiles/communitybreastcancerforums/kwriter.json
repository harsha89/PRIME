So I just thought my hormones were out of whack when I found a lumpy painful mass on my left breast. But it hasn't gone away and is still very painful. I fell pretty hard on my bottom on Christmas Eve and hurt my back so badly that I couldn't walk for a few days, so I thought when the back pain and rib pain lingered, as it still does, that it was from the fall since it only seems to be bad if I sit at the computer or do a lot of walking...it's a little painful when laying down, or on the sofa, but not overly so. There is also a little swelling in the bottom of my ribs. But now I am starting to pull it all together because everything hurts on the same side. I am very scared because I had someone tell me that if you have breast lumps and they are found to be cancerous that my rib and back pain is defintely because it has spread. This person also told me I probably wouldn't be here for Christmas this year. Needless to say I am terrified because I am a single mom of two young ones. I have no insurance so I have to be seen at the clinic and that won't happen until next Tuesday. I'm a total basket case Log in to post a reply",
