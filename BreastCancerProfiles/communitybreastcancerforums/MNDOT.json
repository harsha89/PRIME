My experience was that after the 2nd or 3rd fill I could feel discomfort behind my chest, lungs and shoulder.  Then on my last fill I thought I was not going to with stand the pain.  I had pain in the two areas I mentioned above but also the sternum too.  I was thankful when I had my last visit to determine if I should have another fill or just wait for the exchange I did not have to have another fill. In my case I took my time because my medical flex spending starts over in October.  My PS said actually it is good to give the muscle and tissue time to expand and he will have an easier time with the exchange. Good luck and hugs..",
