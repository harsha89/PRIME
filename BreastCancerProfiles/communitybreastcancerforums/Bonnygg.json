I was back at work on Monday. No one knew a thing. I followed the surgery with mammosite then chemo (ac x 4 doses). I didn't miss any work because of the surgery. I took 1 week off for the mammosite because I had to go twice each day. I worked nearly every day through chemo. I did take off the day of chemo and one other day. But, my job did not require me to be on my feet alot. I did have to slug around network equipment & rack it and that stuff isn't light. I made the decision that I would do everything I could to survive & have a long life. I didn't want to have to look back over my shoulder and think *what if...*. I wanted no regrets. So, I threw the kitchen sink at it to make sure it didn't come back or rob me of a long life. Cancer is cancer. It's not a death sentence. But it is nothing to toy around with either. You've been dx'd with cancer. This means that your body is not able to kill of the cancer cells on it's own. Your body needs help fighting this life threatening disease. You are lucky that it's been caught early. Survival rates of lumpectomy+rads+chemo are as good & sometimes better than mastecomies. BC is not automatically an mx. At least a lumpectomy + rads + optional chemo buys you time. You may never need to have an mx. Why chop off something if it's not necessary? Don't let it sit there & spread when there are reasonable treatments that are relatively short in duration.  Good luck with your decisions. bonny",

That worked for me. When I started loosing the head hair, I immediately had my hubby buzz it really, really close. I also had him use his electric shaver. Then one day in the shower, those small hairs (shorter than an eyelash) started coming off. I stayed in the shower and just rubbed & rubbed to get them off the head & down the drain. The shower-rubbing process took about 2-3 days and those little short hairs that were going to leave had left. Not every hair left, but, at least they stopped coming off in the shower. All the other hairy things did their own method of departure. The \"down under\" hair and the hair on my arms & legs never did grow back as thick as it was before chemo. What I really hated to lose was the eyelashes. I could paint on eyebrows, but glueing on false lashes was beyond my abilities. My last chemo was late in Feb 2005 and three weeks later we had my daughter's wedding of 250 people. I had no eyelashes, my painted on eyebrows and my \"shake-n-bake\" wig. So for the next 25 years, I get to look at all those lovely wedding pictures where I look like a freak. Pisses me off. But, I'm still here above ground, still fighting the fight. I was lucky in that I lost my hair during the winter and had polar fleece caps to wear and my \"shake-n-bake\" wig. Keeping the dome warm was a challenge. When the hair started growing, it a) was gray and b) was curly which was all new to me. I let it grow for a month or two before I did anything to it. All the hairs don't grow at the same speed, so it all wasn't real even in length. After it was a couple of inches and looked rather scragly is when I went to my hair dresser to have him clip it into a more recognizable but very short style. For those of you that will be out in the sun with zipity-do-dah for hair, be sure to use sunscreen up there & on top of your ears & on the back of your neck. It's tough loosing the hair on the head. Our self esteem takes such a hit and then we have to try & go to work looking somewhat normal with zero hair or a scarf tied to our head or a fuzzy cap or some goofy wig. But like I told my daughter during the wedding, what we see as a problem others doen't know or see it. If you smile & keep going, other people don't know that it's a wig. Other people see a scarf on your head and think it's a \"fashion\" thing. Other people see a fuzzy cap and that's normal winter wear. Other people see a ball cap during the summer & think you are just cutting the sun off off your face. Good luck to you all. bonny",

Don't think that I'm one of those little gals that can only take 1 asprin at a time. I'm 6' and 200+ lbs. The Effexor wasn't bad at all after we adjusted the dosage. I was on it for about 3 years. I weaned myself off by dropping down to one pill every other day and so on based on my Onc's direction. Do try to limit caffine especially after 5 pm and drink extra water. Good luck.",

Chemo doesn't kill ya but boy it sure takes your body for a roller-coaster ride to hell & back. It ain't fun BUT, BUT, it is managable and it isn't forever. When dx'd with bc, I took a stance that I still am following. I am going to do whatever it takes to stay alive for very long time. At the end of my journey when I look back, I will have no regrets. I will not have to say \"I should have....\". Yes, chemo took it's toll on my body but I'm still kickin' & riding my Harley. Don't let anyone tell you different. Chemo is poison, plain & simple. That's how it works. Yes, the hair falls out, ya loose your eyelashes, eyebrows & the *down-under* hair <grin>. But guess what? It grows back just fine. Makeup, wigs & caps of all kinds fill the void of going to the hair dresser. I worked every single day through my chemo. My chemo really gave me a whack. I had to do 4 doses. After dose #2, we figured out that I was alergic to it. I did dose #3 and my onc was hesitant to give me dose #4. I came all unglued on the poor guy and I took dose #4 with all its risk. I came through with flying colors. I did Tamox for a couple of years until I broke my ankle after dumping my Harley. I ended up with DVT in the leg and was hospitalized for that for 7 days. An SE of Tamox is blood clots. Go figure. I went onto Femara. About a year later during my annual physical, I now have high cholesterol. An SE of Femara. To deal with the high cholesterol, I'm now on Lovastatin. I was pre-menopause before chemo. My first chemo slammed me into chemo-pause. My *power surges* could melt paint off the walls! Night sweats that I floated in. I took Effexor for about 2 years then weaned off. I still get warm flushes, but NOTHING like what I did in the beginning. Now come to find out, I'm braca1+ and am scheduled for double mx + DIEP in Feb. 8-10 hours on the operating table is going to be tough, but, like I said, no regrets. I'm going to give it my all. I have to set an example. My daughter is braca1+ too and I have to show her that whacking off the tata's ain't all that bad.  I know I'm long winded, but, I wanted you to see that it is doable and managable and, that little boost of extra insurance was well worth it. It's an individual choice for sure. Everyone has a unique experience with chemo. I gained a TON of support during my chemo with these boards. Surround yourself with a good support system and you'll be just fine. Good luch with your decision. bonny",

I ended up on 37.5mg with mild hot flashes and mildly warm nights and not nearly as foggy-brained. Check with your Dr's and see if they will prescribe it for you.

I'm a research nut and knew pretty much how the whole process works & what the odds/statistics were, etc. So no big surprises there. What I wasn't (and still am not doing well with) is the huge amount of guilt. I pushed my 30 year old daughter to be tested before I was. Her paternal grandmother had bc, I had bc and her maternal grandmother died of colon cancer. She came back positive for the braca1 gene mutation. I went & got tested and I have it too. So I've managed to pass on this shit to my only child. I think I would put a gun in my mouth if it would do any good. But, the damage is aleardy done. I get to live with knowing that I've managed to pass this on to my daughter & yet-to-be grandchildren. So, there is more than the $$$ involved. You need to be prepared for the results (should they be not the best). I live day-to-day knowing that my boobs are going to kill me. They are ticking time bombs. I'm currently fighting with the insurance bozo's. I can't have implants because the FDA did not approve of implants that will fit my frame. I need to have DIEP, but the one dr here in Phx isn't on my primary insurance's plan. He is on my secondary's, but I have to fight with my primary first. So while the jerks screw around, my boobs are planning & plotting how to kill me off. They tried once & failed, the next time (and there most certainly will be a next time unless they are gone), I won't win. I am on Femara. But in the beginning, I was on Tamox. So I wasn't worried about the ovaries. Now, with the test results, I moved as fast as I could to get the ovaries, fallopian tubes & the uterus yanked. That took less than 30 days after my gene test results. So, I've dodged that bullet. Because my mom passed away from colon cancer, I was having a colonospcy every three years. With being braca1 gene mutant, I'm in a higher risk of colon cancer. Had my mom not had the colon cancer, I wouldn't have been on the 3-year frequency. But, with the gene, I would have had to up the frequency. My sister (also with bc but not a gene mutant) and I have been in contact with our female cousins to encourage them to be tested. They believe ignorance is bliss. I can only pray that ovarian, colon or bc doesn't screw up their life plans. With the test results comes a whole pile of responsibility and a whole lota guilt. Be prepared cause it ain't easy. Would I do it again?.... In a New York minute!!!! I know somewhere, sometime, somehow, by being tested, something good will come out of it and it will help someone else. Good luck.",
