    "Content": "Rheam831 wrote: I am Stage IV and was taking tamoxifen, but couldn't tolerate after 3 1/2 years. Switched to Arimidex-have been on it for 4 years. I feel like a slug. I have no energy to do anything. I just saw my Oncologist and all blood tests are normal my CEA tripled in the last 3 months though. He doesn't seem to concerned. My concern is no energy, weight loss without trying. Only a couple lbs a month-not complaining-but concerning. I cannot muster up enough energy to even go out to dinner with friends anymore. Anyone else experiencing this?? Log in to post a reply",
