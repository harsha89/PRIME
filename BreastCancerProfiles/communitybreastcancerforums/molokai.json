My surgeons were Raquel PratiÂ  (breast) and Jaco Festekjian (plastics and reconstruction). Call Jeani Primes (breast reconstruction coordinator) at 310-794-4126 to get more information. Of course, I don't know your medical details or whether or not you'd be a candidate for immediate reconstruction and DIEP, but I can whole heartedly recommend UCLA. I'm a physician myself.",
