I will be doing Cytoxan/Taxotere starting next Thursday and doing it weekly in smaller doses rather than every 3 weeks in larger doses for a total of 9 weeks.  I am doing this in hopes of keeping most of my hair (my doctor has studies that show weekly doses give me a 70-80% chance of keeping my hair while providing the same benefits), but it was mostly done in older ladies, I am 28. Has anyone received these 2 drugs in weekly doses?  How did you do? Did your hair fall out?  He said my side effects will be minimal as they were with the Cysplatin/Gemcitabine - I was a little tired and didnt have too much of an appetite but I didnt throw up once :) Thanks in advance for your help and comments!
