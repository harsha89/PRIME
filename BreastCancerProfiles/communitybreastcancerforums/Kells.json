Lobular carcinoma in situ and then 5 polyps both of which put me at high risk now. She suggested monitoring. I went to another surgeon and she is agressive going in for a MRI Monday. Now the 2nd opinion specializes in breast only so I tryst her especially since I found out my biopsy path report had the wrong year on it and my mammogram slides were mislabeled! I will be having these areas removed. I am concerned about disfigurement. So I am thinking about doing a nipple skin sparing mastectomy. I heard good things about the plastic surgeon she uses but I just read a complaint about the same surgeon hes from Columbus indiana so I am sooo confused on who does good breast reconstruction.",
