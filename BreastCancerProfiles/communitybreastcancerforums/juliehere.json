Is it possible just to use massage to get swelling down and then use the sleeve? I am afraid that the tight wrapping may actually induce swelling with a rebound effect. Log in to post a reply",

Interesting, last night I used the trampoline (rebounder) to see it if helped. Afterwards, I noticed it did not hurt a all. However, it is aching this morning when I move it. I guess I need to jump everyday to get benefits and see if I get more improvement.",
