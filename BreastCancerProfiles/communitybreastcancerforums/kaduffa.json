    "Content": "kaduffa wrote: I just went for a baseline mammo- the results recommend a biopsy.  The \"nodule\" they found is measured at 6mm x 3mm- this seems incredibly small to me.  Others have been talking about masses in the cm measurements.  The bi-rad category is 4.  What does that exactly mean?  What does this thing have that makes it warrant a biopsy?  Why is it different from other growths that are larger and you would think need a biopsy?  My husband thinks I'm overreacting.  It is very small and I am only just 35 years old with no breast cancer in the family under 40... or 70 for that matter.  I am nervous; this was not what I was expecting.  Should I get a second opinion first?  My referring Dr. wants me to find a surgeon like next week.  This seems really abrupt.  Is this what usually happens?  I wish I could have seen the pictures to know what they're talking about.  As the others who have posted here have asked...Who has advice or knowledge to share?
