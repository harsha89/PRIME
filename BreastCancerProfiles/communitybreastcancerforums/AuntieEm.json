      "Content": "Feb 16, 2013 01:13AM - edited Feb 16, 2013 01:22AM by AuntieEm It's been a few days since I checked in. Amazing all that has gone on... I am on round two of AC (RED DEVIL)! It's 2am and its kicking in. Luckily I took my anti-nausea and pain pill before going to bed. Still a little queazy but I'm holding up. I hope I don't have the same horrible experience as the last time... I felt like road kill. We shall see... Tami- Great news about the drain. Finally! Sorry to hear about the excess swelling. I hope that gets resolved quickly. It seems like your fills were going so well and now this. Best of luck! Teresa- did you have lymph-nodes removed on both sides. If not, why BP from your thigh? So sorry you had such a hard time in the hospital. It sounds like they really did not manage your pain very well. My story was that I am super sensitive to pain meds. Morphine makes me dizzy and crazy nauseous. My husband is a physician and was very specific that they do not give me a morphine pump in recovery. Well guess what I was holding when I woke up from anesthesia? I had a pump in one hand and the nurse call button in the other. I was so loopy from surgery, I kept pressing the button. Although my little brain kept telling me, you are not supposed to have that. After heaven knows how many hours I was finally able to speak up and tell the nurse, I'm nauseous and the room spins every time I open my eyes. Oh, it's probably the morphine. We'll take it away and give you anti- nausea meds in your IV with another pain med. My husband was not a happy camper. The Anti-nausea stuff knocked me out. The little oops kept me in recovery for several hours since I couldn't get my act together to wake-up and go. Your story sounds way worse. I'm so sorry. I too had lymph nodes dissected. 19 to be exact. I can't image moving my arm AT ALL during that time. Thankfully it does get better. I'm almost a month and half out. It's amazing how stiff you get on that side. I used to think I was I excellent shape. Now I'm happy to be able to get my arm few inches over my head each day. But I look back to where i was and i have come a long way. you will see for yourself. As for the lymphedema, i get worried as well. My appointment with OT is not until late March and i am planning on traveling. My SO has told me the the method he used to remove my nodes has proven to be pretty successful in not resulting in lymphedema by over 85% but I'm still scared. I'm pretty thin. I'd look very strange with a giant ballon arm. BTW my sister had bc 6 years ago. She had a lumpectomy with 17 lymphnodes removed and she is fine. She works out a lot and has had no problems. However, I did go ahead and ordered a sleeve for my trip to hold me over until OT. Better to be safe than sorry. Anyways, you're at a good place. These women are amazing and a wealth of information. I've learned so much! Hang I there! I wish you the very best! Blessings and prayers to all! Emily",

Every time I opened my eyes the room began to spin and I became crazy nauseated. I would just close my eyes and take slow deep breaths. At first I thought I was getting over the anesthesia but then realized it was the narcs. Once I was off those and on anti inflamatories I felt way better. I got home yesterday and took a very short walk today. I suppose I can check this part off my list. Hope everyone is ok considering why we are here. Prayers to you all and much love. We will get through this! Hope Tami is well also. I know we both went in at about the same time. Hang in there everyone! Xoxoxo",

This combo seems to be working well. I was trying to stay away from the Percocet but NOW IS NOT THE TIME! Take those meds! My stomach is doing well with this mix. My husband is a doctor and keeps telling me I'm less than a week out and I'm doing well. Everyday is better. Also get as much rest as possible. So far my major outings have consisted of doctor appointment and short walks. The walks do take a lot out of me and I think of myself as pretty fit. Finally, I also recommend getting those frozen gel packs to place on your chest. They are helpful. Best of luck!",

I'd love to have the port and permanent implants done at once. The thought of going under twice more is not appealing to me at all. I'm actually a bit nervous about it. Can anyone tell me how long it will take to get my full range of motion on my node dissection side? I feel like I was doing well but my nerve ending are waking up and it's like I've taken a step back. Will it be better once the last two drains are out? I was so active and flexible before surgery and now I feel so stiff. I find it hard to believe it will come back. So frustrating... As always my prayer are with you all! Xoxoxo",

To tell you the truth that night was my best night sleep since surgery. I was the last case of the day so I was NPO pretty much all day. I had toast and a 1/2 a cup of coffee at 7:30am. I got to the hospital at 3:30pm and went in at 5:00pm. They put you to sleep (Michael Jackson style) and numb the area. I was home having dinner by 8pm and in bed by 9:45pm. Slept through the night... Ahhh... It was great! The area is a little tender to the touch. It is dressed with steri strips and covered. I took the gauze dressing off yesterday so I could shower. The incision is pretty small (3/4\"). The steri strips should fall off on their own. It's more of the ick factor of having another foreign thing in my body. The other thing I noticed this morning is that the shoulder strap of the car seat belt rests right on it. That feels weird. I think I'll use a pad or small pillow as a buffer. Chemo starts this Friday. I'm wondering how that will go... Hope this helps. Best wishes to you!",

I was hoping to get the last two drains out but he opted to leave the one on the node dissection side in until Tuesday. I was bummed but I guess I can wait a few more days. He also filled my expanders a bit. Last night was like I was fresh out of surgery. It felt like I had an elephant sitting on my chest! Ouch! I was small busted to begin with so the 40cc's felt like a lot more. Now I have 190cc's in each total. The good news is I'm not going for any record so he thinks all I need is one more fill in a few weeks. Does anyone have any home remedies for the discomfort besides pain meds??? JRMH- Sorry you're having a rough time. I hope things quiet down quickly. My prayers are with you. Jojo- I do know the one excercise that the surgeons keep reinforcing is walking my fingers up the wall. Stand infront a wall let your fingertips walk up as high as you can. The goal is to eventually bring your fingers up over your head. I think we all have a long way to go on that one. You can also roll a tennis ball up the wall with your hand. I have not been super successful with either but I'm trying. My PS doesn't want me to go up over my shoulders since he doesn't want the expanders to move out of place. Love and prayers to all!",
