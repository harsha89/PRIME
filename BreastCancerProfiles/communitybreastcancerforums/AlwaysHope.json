Stats are usually based on women diagnosed 10, 15 or even 20 years ago Treatment has come a LONG way and most are surviving BC. Bottom line:  don't cash in the 401K yet.  You're probably going to need it when you retire at 65.",

The most important thing in this journey is having a doctor you can TRUST and who LISTENS to YOU. If that is not the case, run to another doctor! If this is a general surgeon see if you can find one who specializes in breast/oncology cases. Mine is a Breast Specialist (its on his office business cards) and all he does is breast cases. Nothing else. I love him! (in a purely platonic way :) )",

Only a physician should be telling you that skin sparing or nipple sparing is not an option. And if this physician won't even consider it then why not get a second opinion. You need to decide this before surgery because after it will be to late. It may be that they get in and find that is really isn't possible but you need a physician who will try to consider your opinions and decisions. If it is possible then they should do everything they can to consider your wishes. Its YOUR body.",

It is not vain or shallow to want to preserve your breast as much as possible. I would not let anyone even try to go down that road. Just tell them to STFU already. And I never curse but stuff like this just makes me angry. It is a form of bullying someone who is very vulnerable. I think you have time to arrange a second opinion.

Maybe it will help you to know that you are not alone.  Most of the women I know who have gone through chemo/post treatment drugs are thrown into premature menopause, which I believe is responsible for the weight gain.  I was a size 6 before diagnosis but now waddle along at a size 12.  A size 12! ...yes for my short frame and the fact that most of the weight gain is in my stomach makes me look like the prototype for the 'weebles wobble but they don't fall down' toy. Its an insult upon injury that not only do we lose our breasts but our remaining body image is dealt a severe blow.  It is what it is and learning to accept what can't be changed is a hard step to take. Go for that job interview with your best smile and the best outfit and do your best.  If they don't hire you then maybe that wasn't the job for you. Maybe its time to find a new career direction.  Is there something else you always wanted to do? ",

Thank goodness the HealthCare reform is on track.  No more discrimination for pre-existing.  On the other hand, even with insurance, I usually had to jump through hoops and fight to have chest ct's covered and I never have had an MRI or PET because my insurance would not pre-approve.  I don't have a solution for you.  Maybe talk to the doc and see if a chest ct will do instead and then check with your local health department to see if you can get into the state/federal  breast health plan.  There are no income limitations for this program.",
