      "Content": "clifgoodenough wrote: I went for my core biopsy today. the doctor had heard from my surgeon about my horrible experience a few weeks ago with another doctor i had for my ultrasound(who i cancelled with because he wouldn't give me 1 ativan for my nerves before the biopsy)he hurt me so bad doing the ultrasound i had bruises and skin worn off my breast. anyway.. i was waiting and the nurse came in and said the doctor wanted to do another ultrasound on me, before the test.. the nurse statrted and the doctor came in and did one also....HE SAW NOTHING STRANGE, JUST THE SMALL CYST I HAD 4 YEARS AGO THAT IS THE SAME AS IT WAS. I was told to leave it alone unless it was causing me discomfort...he didn't have those ultrasound tests, but had THE OTHER CRAZY DOCTOR'S.. HE KEPT SAYING THIS IS SO STRANGE....HE SAID HE SAW NO SIGHT OF CANCER, AND IT WAS THE SAME CYST I HAD 4 YEARS AGO.. HE ASKED ME IF THAT DOCTOR HAD AN ACCENT?? I SAID YES AN ENGLISH ONE.. HE JUST SHOOK HIS HEAD...he said no reason to do a core biopsy and he will call me when he gets the ultrasound pictures from 4 years ago.. he told me it IS A CYST.. THE OTHER DOCTOR SAID IT WAS NOT.......SO I AM HAPPY, BUT MAD AS WELL.. I HAVE WENT THRU PURE HELL OVER THIS MISTAKE.. IF YOU CAN CALL IT ONE!!!!!! Log in to post a reply",
