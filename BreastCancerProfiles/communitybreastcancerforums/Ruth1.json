And that is because he has put me on tamoxifin which so far is working great and much easier than the chemo Abraxene caused many problems for me, neurophy in my legs and feet and therefore my walking ability  isn't too great.  My doctor told me that the CEA tumor marker tesst for non-smokers normal is 3 and for smokers it is 5.

I don't know what to do ass they certainly do not deserve being treated this way.  As they have been a wonderful support for me during this time.  I cannot seem to show a lot of happiness when I am with them.  I snap at them, I wear hearing aides in both ears and still seem to have trouble hearing what they are saying as a result I aquise them of saying something which they deny saying.  I hope someone has some suggestions on what and how to make a change..  Thank you, Ruth1 Log in to post a reply",
