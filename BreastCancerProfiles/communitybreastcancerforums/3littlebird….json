My incision goes around the underside of my nipple and about 2 inches out towards my underarm, so they did the SNB from my mx incision. However, was very sore and still swollen under my arms. My PS ok'd only spray deodorant 1 week after surgery. When I saw her on Tuesday, she told me I could shave very carefully while looking in the mirror to make sure I wasn't cutting anything that was numb.",
