Mitotic index is a measure of how fast the cancer cells are dividing - it is graded on a 1 to 3 scale. Pernineural invasion - this is when the cancer cells grow around small nerves in the breast. Surgical margins positive - after surgery, if the cancer goes to or past the tissue they test they say a margin is positive.  That would usually mean more surgery to try and get clear margins if you had a lumpectomy. DCIS (Ductal carcinoma in situ) is considered invasive cancer but it hasn't yet invaded the surrounding breast tissue - it is contained in the milk duct.  5% of the whole tumour was therefore DCIS.  Grade 2-3/3 means that it was pretty aggressive - Grade 3 is the highest grade in how aggressive the cancer is. No lymphovascular invasion - this means that the cancer cells have not invaded the lymph vessels. As for the nodes - metatastic means that the cancer has moved out of the breast to other areas of the body, in your case the sentinal nodes. I think it means that 18 were taken and 4 of 5 sentinal nodes were positive but any after the sentinal nodes were clear.",

I have had a ridiculously busy week and have just not had the energy to log in and see how you ladies are - didn't even have the computer on a couple of days - unheard of for me! We are unaffected by the recent earthquake (7.1 on the Richter scale). It was in the South Island, about 600 miles south of here, and damaged the city of Christchurch and surrounding country areas. Apparently it was centred on a previously unknown fault line and it has been such as shock to everyone as Christchurch has never been prone to large earthquakes before. It is the 8th largest recorded NZ earthquake and had vertical as well as horizontal movement and has done a lot of structural damage to buildings and homes as well as disrupting water, sewerage and power infrastructure.  They are saying it will be a $2 billion fix- yikes, that's a lot of money for a country of 4.5 million people! No loss of life so far, although two people are in ICU after being hit by falling debris, a miracle really. It hit at 4.30am which probably saved lives.  My twin DDs are in Wellington (our capital city which is about 300 miles north of Christchurch) at university and they were both woken up by the earthquake so it was a doozey but we didn't feel it here.  Christchurch is an old city, is very flat, has a small river running through it and is known as the 'garden city' because of it's extensive botannical gardens - I hope none of the historic buildings like its beautiful cathedral are seriously damaged. Had a lovely walk on the beach with my friend and our dogs today and then a picnic lunch - so nice to get away from everything and just enjoy the uncrowded beauty of our area.  It is Father's Day here today and I felt a bit guilty leaving DH by himself but you have to take your chances to connect with your friends when you can eh?     ",

My GP ordered a base line bone density test at 40 and annual mammograms from 40.  He said I should be vigilant about BC as it can strike anyone anytime and early detection was important.  Am very glad I listened to him!  He also said to go to the same place for my mammograms each year so my films were in one place for comparison so that subtle changes might be picked up. Meece - it is common practice in NZ for all specialists to copy test results to our GPs as they are the ones who hold the complete record of our medical history.  They don't hold the actual copies of xrays etc now but all the reports are held on their computer files.  My GP got surgery reports, path reports, report from onc, everything so if I have forgotten to ask a specialist for something I can get it from my GP who I have to see every 3 months at the moment just so he can 'check on me' he says, emotionally more than physically now I think - such a concerned man. Charmaine - My husband got extremely protective of me and worried about things to start with. I have always been super healthy - hardly ever have a cold even - and apart from being terrified at the thought of losing me he was just thrown by the fact that I had this nasty disease - he couldn't help himself.  It started to annoy me at one stage but I realised how wonderful it was to be loved so much by him and then I rather enjoyed that he fussed!  However it is more than a year since dx and he has returned to 'normal'.  I hope that when you are post BC treatment he may be able to relax and mellow out. You are lucky to have a hubby who cares. Am glad to hear you have enjoyed your week and are spending money on yourself.  I don't spend much on myself either but when I found out I didn't have to have chemo and lose my hair (I was more upset by that thought than the loss of two breasts - weird?!?! ) I suddenly found myself thinking 'I am not going to have my hair cut in one of the cheap places anymore' so I now go to a swanky hair salon and pay $65 for a shampoo, cut and blow wave and I enjoy every single minute of it! Lucky Seyla - wish I was going to Hawaii for 3 weeks - going anywhere for three weeks would be good actually!  For one reason and another I hadn't been on a proper holiday for 2 years before dx and then last year was a write off too.  My hubby is working toward a Canadian holiday and an Alaskan cruise next year for us so I amfor him to get us there. . Nice to catch up with you all Rae ",

Sheila - Cancer cells can have proteins that the estrogen or progesterone binds to and these proteins are called  'receptors' - hence ER means 'Estrogen receptor' and PR means 'Progesterone receptor'.  They do a test to see how many cells have Estrogen and/or Progesterone receptors and come up with the % figures.  So in your case 90% of the cancer cells used Estrogen as fuel to grow and 10% used Progesterone as well.  The 90% ER is good as it means that Hormone therapy, which drops the estrogen levels in our bodies to virtually nothing, should be effective in preventing recurrance as the cells won't get the estrogen they need to grow and will hopefully shrivel or die while we take the HT.  My ER was 90% and my PR was 80% so 90% of the cells were receptive to estrogen and 80% were also receptive to progesterone.  My onc said my cancer cells were strongly hormone driven so HT would be more effective than chemo for me - hope he was right!  I haven't researched about the HER+ numbers so can't help with that.  Are you nervous about stopping the HT next year? I feel nervous about stopping now and I still have 3.5 years to go!  Fingers crossed for good results on Wed. Michelle - hope you are feeling a little more comfortable now. Hoping your results are A-okay too. Val -  I love that friends in the computer graphic too. A friend sent me the same words but a different image a couple of years ago and at the time I thought how true that was, as more often than not I communicate with people even locally via email instead of phoning nowdays.  And now, here I am 'talking' and making friends with you ladies who are half way round the world away from me!  Computers and the internet are just the best thing since sliced bread!!! ",

I decided against chemo mainly because of the real possibility of permanent damage to my body when there really was little gain but also because my cancer cells were very strongly hormone driven so HT was going to be as effective as chemo as 'insurance' against recurrance, which may be the case for you too. Sheila - ditto.  It is heart wrenching to see so many new ladies but then I am glad they have found this site and will have support and help from everyone here rather than trying to get through this terrible time alone.

Val - it seems crazy that through no fault of her own your DD is responsible for replacing her own vehicle after the accident.  I hope that No-fault law means the car insurance is low and that she doesn't lose her no claims bonus because of the accident.  I agree - thank goodness they were in a substantial vehicle and I hope they can afford to replace it with something similar. green and jodimaca and kathy - in NZ the oncotpye test is not available so the oncs rely on the basic characteristics of the tumour and then balance the benefits.  I was stage 1 (tumor was 2cm), lower grade 2 (score of 6 on the Elston and Ellis system) and ER+ 90% and PR+ 80%, no nodes and no vascular invasion.  My onc said that chemo would give me a 3% benefit over 10 years but a negative benefit of 4 or 5% so he recommended no chemo.  He said because my cancer was so strongly ER/PR positive that Hormone therapy would give much the same benefit without the risk of long term damaging SEs of chemo.  I decided against chemo as I felt my ER/PR percentages were high and so HT would be effective for me without the damaging SEs (however HT is not without its SEs either in my case!) Check out your ER/PR+ percentages and that may help you in your decision.  Kathy - it is very common for ILC to be under estimated by imaging tests - my MRI showed 1.2cm tumour but it was 2cm when tested after surgery.  And it is also very common with ILC that a re-excision is required following lumpectomy (something like 60%) - as you say it is the linear flat growth habit that tricks everyone.  Check out the ILC forum too - you may find more specific info re ILC and chemo there.

Any Barbies that came into my house were soon headless - three girls and not one of them a doll lover Meece - wonderful work - I know the time and skill it takes to make something so lovely.  I have knitted since I was 8 when a neighbour taught me, sewn since I learnt at school at 10, and as an adult I have taught myself to decorate cakes (got sick of that when the hobby became a job as people started asking me to do cakes for them and I couldn't say no) and my handcraft of choice for the last 10 years or so is cross stitch. My mother didn't teach me any skills much - even taught myself to cook really - so I decided I would make sure I taught my girls but I have found it hard to interest any in handcrafts or even cooking - they would all rather sit on their computers or watch tv   I have managed to teach one DD3 very basic knitting and I did get them all to do a few small cross-stitch patterns a few years ago and they can all cook enough to feed themselves properly but I feel I have failed miserably in handing on those sort of skills.  Oh well, you can lead a horse to water ... Val -  welcome back!  Glad to hear you had lots of love and laughter.  Yep, I can imagine there being a lot of special hugs for DD1 after the last few weeks worry - bet they were very healing for both of you. Renee - good to hear you are healing well and looking forward to going back to work. Sheila - how much do you pay for an avocado there?  I buy them from road side stalls direct from the grower and pay NZ$2 for 4-5 depending on size.  Haven't been so many around this year - maybe they had a bad season.  Our friend who grows cherries lost his whole crop overnight with mould.  We had had a week of rain and the temps were high and he went out one morning and they were all spoiled. It is a tenuous thing to be a primary producer. My DH was talking to our friend the other day and he said you don't make money out of the crops, they just give you a living, it is the increase in land value over time that gives you the biggest return so you have to stick with it for a long time to get that return. No wonder people go bust if they go into intense crops on small pieces of land with big overheads - one or two bad years and you are being sold up! Funny story re enjoying the beauty of others - my oldest twin has a boyfriend of 1 year - a lovely young man and he loves her dearly but he can be a bit jealous of others around her at times.  The other day she saw a good looking young man in a magazine she was reading and unwittingly said 'I am going to put him on my list'.  Her BF said 'what list' and she explained that we girls have a family thing where, if we like the look of someone, we say we would put them on our 'list' of people we would like to meet or be with.  Well, he was not impressed and said 'there will be no list and if there is I am the only one on it!'  We roared with laughter when she told us - obviously his list only has DD on it - lol.",

No comfort from ongoing checking here unless you are a 'serious' case it seems   I am quite worried about going off the Femara because then it will be up to me to monitor my BC - a wee bit scary. Val - travel safe.  Enjoy the grandbabies. Annette - sorry to hear you had such an extreme reaction to one little pill but I know what you are talking about when docs don't believe you have had a reaction to a drug. I was put on a very common blood pressure pill a few years back and instantly developed terrible heartburn - had to sleep sitting up because it was too painful to lie down - I had never had it before even when I was overdue with twins!  I told the doc and he said I was drinking too much coffee and eating too much citrus fruit - um, had been doing the same for years previous and it had never been a problem, but ok, so I cut them out and still the indigestion persisted.  He then gave me another drug, Losec, to fix it and it didn't make any difference so in desperation I talked to the pharmacist and he said that 99.9% of people tolerated this drug extremely well and he had never had anyone complain about it so he thought it would be something else too.  I finally decided to take myself off the drug and within 2 days the symptoms had completely gone.  I learned the lesson and now I listen to my body and my intuition.  Femara makes my life very uncomfortable and painful in many ways but I keep taking it because I am able to manage the SEs and I feel permanent damage is not being done and it gives me a 3% absolute survival benefit and I need every % I can get - lol. Glad to hear the instant SE are lessening and hoping they will go completely real soon. Hi Joni, BarbaraA, Granny, Meece, 3jays, Deborye, Raj and everyone one else who's reading this!",

The only tests my GP orders are for lipids and CBC once every couple of years.  I did ask about cancer tests (because my hubby has a terrible family history of prostate cancer and he has an annual blood test as a check) but he said 'there are no reliable tests for BC so it is not worth the stress of false positives after what you have already been through'.  It is very freaky though that after all the diagnostic tests that were done at the beginning ie CT scan, MRI, bone scan etc that the only real follow up depends on me - if I feel pain or something unusual I am to go to the doctor because the statistics say that follow up diagnostics don't increase the survival rate if the cancer metastises.   I am beginning to dislike these 'statistics'!!!!  It's all very well if you are in the good section of the statistics but who wants to be in the bad section?! Sugar77 - I am so glad your GP is thoughtful - waiting for tests is just horrible and she must have worked that out the old saying 'no news is good news' doesn't quite have the same meaning when you are a patient and so she goes the extra mile to make sure her patients don't have to suffer unnecessarily.  My surgeon actually rang as soon as he got the results and he rang the day before surgery to make sure I was ok with everything - a lovely man - I felt I was in very good hands.  Ontario, that is on the Eastern side of Canada isn't it? Is it REALLY cold there in the winter?  You will be glad summer is on its way I expect?

Your oncotype result is just one of many the onc should consider when deciding on chemo or not.  He will assess features of your cancer like ER/PR/HER2 status, node involvement, lymphatic invasion, vascular invasion, grade and particularly the mitotic score which tells him what rate the cells are dividing, size of the tumour, stage and the oncotype result.  My cancer was ER+90%/PR+80%, HER2-, 2cm, grade 2 but slow growing (mitotic score = 1) with no node involvement, or lymphatic or vascular invasion and stage 1.  We do not have the oncotype test in NZ so with my stats his recommendation was 'chemo will give you a 1-2% benefit but a negative benefit of 3% because of the possible damage from the drugs' - so no chemo for me.  Because my cells were so strongly hormone driven he said taking an Aromatase Inhibitor (AI) - which drops the level of estrogen in my body to virtually nothing - would be more effective for my type of cancer than chemo so I decided to take that. Other IDC ladies will post soon I'm sure but check out the IDC forum in the Connecting with others with a similiar diagnosis forum- there will many topics on this subject I'm sure.

Educating yourself and as you say, weighing the benefits of taking the drugs, the negatives of Side Effects and the possible impact on your quality of life, is the best way to make the right decision for you - good luck with your decision.  Jo - thank you for your understanding about my onc.  Over here you either go through the public hospital system or if you have private insurance you can opt to be treated privately.  I did have insurance and opted to see the 'top' BC onc in NZ privately but he is 2.5 hour drive away and is not only the top BC onc but the guru in most cancer treatment it turns out so he is, as you can imagine, a VERY busy man and saw me as a closed case after my one 20 min visit.  Having seen him and been given the 'all clear' so to speak, I cannot now go to a public hospital onc and ask to be taken on as a patient (they are so overloaded with new patients that I would probably never get to see one anyway) so my GP and I are out in the wilderness doing our best.  My GP is great and I know if he thought there were any problems he would have me seeing someone pronto but I kinda feel he is not a specialist onc and so doesn't do any tests to check for BC and it is all a little unsettling when I think about it.  Mainly just hope like heck the onc is right and that I am a closed case!",

Because ILC grows flat and spreads out and so is not particularly dense it is difficult to see on mammograms but is usually visibile on ultrasound and MRI.  MRI is the best scan to see the full extent of the tumour and its position in the breast.  It takes images from different views which are helpful in determining if surgery is possible or whether it would be better to have chemo first to shrink the tumour which would make surgery more effective.  My MRI results were available in 3 days. In the Sentinal node test the surgeon takes the first few lymph nodes that drain lymph fluid from the breast and tests are done to see if cancer cells have spread to the nodes.  If some of the nodes are affected (node positive) chemo will generally be recommended post surgery as it is assumed the cancer has moved out of the breast possibly to other parts of the body.  If all of the nodes removed have cancer in them a further surgery may be done to remove more nodes to find out the full extent of the cancers movement through the lymph system.  Usually the MRI only images the breast and a CT scan, a chest xray and a nuclear bone scan will be done to see if the cancer has metastised to other areas of the body ie liver, lungs, bones, brain. Re lumpectomy for ILC - this surgery has a high re excision rate (another lumpectomy has to be done because the margins of the tissue taken in the surgery were not clear of cancer cells) because of the way it grows and often with larger tumours a mx has to be done as clear margins cannot be achieved. At grade 2 your cancer would not usually be considered very aggressive - Grade 3 is the highest grade and so is considered the most agressive. However, if one of the three factors which make up the grade score - the mitotic score (how fast the cancer cells are dividing) - is 3 (the highest score) then it may be considered aggressive.   If you have the BRAC gene mutation the treatment recommendation would be the bmx to try and avoid recurrance or occurance in the other breast as your chances of that happening are very high. IMHO it would not be wise to rush into surgery without having diagnostic tests first to get information about the extent of the cancer in your breast and body.  It is impossible to make sensible decisions about treatment without that sort of information anyway so I suggest you have the MRI and whatever other tests your doctor can schedule quickly and then you will have solid facts that you can start making decisions with. Take someone with you to the appointment with the doctor to be your ears and to take notes as you may not catch or remember everything that is said. Please feel free to Private Message me if you feel I can be of any further help.",

I used to do BSE - waste of time for me as ILC is hardly ever found as a lump until it is huge - and my surgeon said to carry on with BSE on my reconstructed breasts because a recurrance would form a lump, even if it is lobular, as there is little tissue for it to 'hide' in.  So all in all it is up to me to monitor myself again.  At least I am spared the annual 'squash' now. I am looking forward to my warm electric blanket bed tonight.  Don't like winter anyway and the cold makes my 'Femara' hands and feet even more uncomfortable. Night ladies Rae",

Hi Val!!  My day was not too bad except that I had two classes come nearly together this afternoon and my little library was full to brimming with noisy, restless kids and at the end of the day that is NOT a good thing!  I am off to my pink tennis night when I finish writing this.  The only concession I have made re wearing pink is bright pink socks with the breast cancer symbol on them.  I bought them many years ago to support the BC society when they were running a fundraiser here.  Since dx I can't bear to wear them but I have brought them out of retirement tonight.  How was your day? Better get going.  Will be back in about 2 hours if anyone is still awake.  I have lost track of time zones lately and daylight saving has altered it all again. Bye - love to you all Rae",

It sounds like the IHC because it gives a number but it is unusual because it should just be a 2+.  Hope that helps you understand it a bit better but sorry it doesn't explain the 2.2  ",

Best wishes as you make your way through these tough times. Please feel free to Private message me if I can help you in any way. Rae",

Meece - allergies are the pits and waking up with a headache is not nice.  I used to occassionally wake with a migraine and that was a real downer on the day.  Summer allergies have got the better of me the last two years and I have had to resort to cortisone nasal sprays to keep it under control, better than taking yet another systemic drug I guess.  Must be annoying to have them all year round though - you are in winter and still have them. raj - Some women who had bc in a lot of nodes do stay on hormone treatment for longer than 5 years and many stage VI women are on an AI for as long as it works but early stage treatment is usually only 5 years and can be one drug all the way through or a combination of Tamox and an AI.  I am sure I rely emotionally on the drug, as taking it offers protection from a recurrance, and I know I will feel apprehensive and vulnerable when I stop taking it as you must be feeling now.  This is the last challenge in our experience with bc though (we hope) and if we have made it this far I guess we will deal with this change when it comes to us. ",
