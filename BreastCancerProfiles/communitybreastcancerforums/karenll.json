I've had it before they knew what it was, for @30yrs. Basically, you want to get it chk'd out. the color seems to be okay, but better if bilaterally. keep in mind that most all is B9. or it could be infection. But it is good that you are following thru. Be persistant. get your questions answered. You are your own best advocate- & that is key. Pls remember what stress does to our bodies (BAD, BAD, BAD) and take a few deep breathes and just breathe...... Keep us up to date. We are here for you. Hugs, Karen",
