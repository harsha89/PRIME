I have had a very early stage cataract in each eye that he checks yearly going on for 3 years now without change. With the Tamoxifen I have some concerns about it causing the cataracts to grow faster. The eye Dr. said don't stop the medication because it's benefits outweigh any vision SE. Does anyone else have concerns about eye problems as a possible SE on Tam? Kim",

When that wore off I remembered I'd had to put my cat to sleep 2 days before surgery. I started crying every day for 2 months. I know I've been grieving the loss of Archie but it is also the loss of my former pre-cancer self. My old breast, although it was replaced with a new one is still gone. Any surgery effects us emotionally on some level and losing one or both breasts is not an easy thing to go through. Give your self time to go through what ever your feeling. I find talking to people in my life and on this forum helps a lot. Also I have a few women I talk to who have been through breast cancer. You are going through post-surgery emotions. It is hard but it will pass. Remember, your not alone. Kim",

Recovery is going well, still painful breast though especially at the end of the day. I have several more weeks before I can go back to my full time job, but do not mind because thankfully I have plenty of sick time. Taking walks outside helps. I wish you all who have had surgery a complete recovery. I'm new to this site and not sure quite what I am doing yet. Best wishes to all!",
