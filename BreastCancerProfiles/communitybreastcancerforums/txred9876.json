I have been living my own kind of nightmare with the neurapathy and not being able to drive due to the medication I am currently taking (the accident in August was probably due to me falling asleep - nodding off due to medication from the night before). My family will not let me drive and get pretty ticked off if I suggest it....so it is probably better for all of us if I just not drive. The CPAP machine is hard to get used to but I am not feeling as exhausted as I was. ' The calendars my daughter and I were in (Pam my youngest) are available if anyone is interested.

From the very begining I did not like the \"brush\" offs and kept pushing through 4 doctors to get a proper diagnosis because I knew something was not right. I am not saying this to add anxiety but sometime we know because it is our bodies. I have had a miracle! I have had severe nerve pain (mainly in my legs) since I had Taxol in 2006 (finished 6/06).  We have went to a new chuch the last few weeks and on  Mother's day they did special prayers at the end for anyone who had physical ailments. Well I figured I needed all the help I could get! There were three woman whom prayed over my legs (one of them a 2 time breast cancer survivor herself). Well I really did not feel anything different..... it was not like something instant ...but...afterward we went to eat because the service lasted about 3-3.5 hours and we were startving. About the time we were eating lunch it would have been time to take my next round of morphine for my legs (in order to keep the pain under control). Well..... I was not feeling any pain so I did not take any morphine,...... and this is now my 9th day pain free (from the neurapathy in my legs)! Never underestimate the power of prayer (no matter which religion you are). I am still having some swelling from the lymphadema that is causing some arm pain however. I have been going to therapy for 3 weeks already and they did a demo of this machine called a flexitouch. It was a wonderful machine and it works to get the fluid off my chest wall, underarm and back area. I have had trouble with this since surgery in 12/05 (and probably always will). The machine costs 10,000 or so, but my insurance should pay for it out of medical need. As always I am thinking of each and every one of you and sending prayers your way! Tina",

Sunburn at the volcanic peak of a long Texas summer; what could be more ordinary? At it turned out, the most extraordinary experience of Tina's life was about to begin, starting with the news that her red spot was due to inflammatory breast cancer, not absence of sunscreen. The stunning diagnosis meant she already was at Stage 3 of one of the rarest and deadliest forms of breast cancer. Though lacking health insurance, she would somehow have to pay for months of harsh and expensive chemotherapy that, in one doctor's prognosis, would give her only a 20 percent chance of survival. Three years later, the HHSC network analyst and help-desk expert not only has survived but become one of Central Texas' most effective advocates for breast cancer awareness and research. Using her own story and growing skill as a communicator, she educates the public in person and through the news media, promoting the same combination of early diagnosis, family support and positive outlook she credits with saving her life. With October's celebration of Breast Cancer Awareness Month coming to a close, The Connection took a few minutes to speak with Qualls about her experiences with breast cancer and how she's taking her message to the public. *  *  * The Connection:  Why is inflammatory breast cancer so deadly? Tina Qualls:  Well, as I learned, it's not just an incredibly aggressive form of breast cancer but one that people know very little about. Because the first sign you see is right on the surface [of the skin], it's easy to assume it's just a rash or sunburn. There's not always a lump with this form of the disease, so many women figure, \"Hey, there's gotta be a lump for it to be breast cancer, right?\" It's natural to sort of ignore the \"rash\" because you assume it'll go away with time. Trouble is, when you see those first signs you're already at Stage 3. Q:  How did you find out you had breast cancer, not just a sunburn or rash? A:  I was on some pretty strong antibiotics for quite a while, but of course that had no effect. After that, other doctors checked me out, and one even came right out and said, \"This couldn't possibly be inflammatory breast cancer.\" Well, that was the first time I'd even heard the word cancer brought up, and it really got my attention. I started doing self examinations and, one weekend, I did find a deep lump in my breast. In hindsight, I'm really grateful for that. Otherwise, I doubt my case would've been taken seriously. Q:  How did you deal with the expense of chemotherapy and other treatment? A:  It wasn't easy. I had no health insurance at the start of my journey. I'd previously worked for the state, but I'd taken a couple years off and was working in real estate. And [because of a technicality] I couldn't qualify for a state-funded program that might have paid for my treatment. Thankfully, I was able to get into the Shivers Cancer Program at Brackenridge Hospital in Austin. That wouldn't have been possible without help from the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation and a lot of money I borrowed from friends and family. It was actually a pretty interesting experience. My type of cancer was so rare that many doctors had only seen it in textbooks. So in a way, I was kind of a test case for some of the people who were treating me. They'd be, like, \"Do you mind if these interns come in and take a look at you?\" Q:  So, what happened next? A:  Well, basically a lot of chemotherapy. In a typical case, you might get four doses of the hardcore chemo every three weeks. But due to the severity and aggressiveness of my case, I was getting six doses every two weeks. All in all, I had 26 months of various kinds of chemo. It was just awful. I was utterly, completely fatigued all the time. And you can imagine the damage it does to your immune system. You're susceptible to any and every disease. The doctors and nurses have to mask up, glove up and apron up just to examine you. Only lately have I started to feel completely human again. And because of neuropathy [caused by the chemo], I still have to take pain meds just to go walking. Q:  It's obvious that walking has been a major symbol of not only your personal progress but also your public image as a survivor. When did you start including it in your recovery process? A:  I started as early as I possibly could. This year will be my third time taking part in the Austin Susan G. Komen Family Walk [part of the Nov. 2 Race for the Cure event]. I also participated in the Houston Komen Walk on October 4. Plus, I walk 2-1/2 miles every day after work. Q:  How do you keep yourself motivated? A:  I'm making a serious effort to get into better shape, and walking also gives me a real sense of well-being. Plus, I have the advantage of four excellent walking buddies - my dogs. I've got have a Chihuahua, a Corgi, a St. Bernard and a Miniature Pinscher mix. We're a real rat pack when you see us going down the road! They don't let me slack off even a little bit. If I come home and sit down at the computer rather than getting dressed to walk, the St. Bernard will nudge up against me and make me get up. That's a lot of force to resist, so I pretty much have to obey. Q:  The walking seems to have worked, because you're looking very healthy now. And with all that canine motivation, it's easy to see how you're able to stick to it. But why did you feel the need to get out and walk long distances - in public events no less - while you were still in treatment? A:  I felt it was imperative to share my story with as many people as possible, and those big, well-promoted events were a great opportunity to do that. Plus, I had a lot of support. My friends and family walked with me, and my boyfriend, Joe - who's now my husband - has been great all the way through. Everyone has, really. Q:  How did your family handle it when you first got the diagnosis? A:  They all responded in different ways. For example, Pam, one of my two daughters, wrote a fictional story based on what was happening to us. It was about a child whose parent was very sick and how she was able to deal with the situation. She's a great writer, so that's how she was able to work through her emotions. I love the story and am looking forward to that classic parent moment where you embarrass your kid years later by pulling out something they created in their teens and gush all over it! Q:  You've obviously reached the point where you can find humor in what was once a very dark situation. Laughs must have been harder to come by a few years ago. A:  Right. When I got the diagnosis, my first thought was, \"What's going to happen to my daughters?\" And of course I had the long boo-hoo night of crying and going \"why me?\" But you know, when I woke up in the morning I was in full fighting mode. I just decided this was not going to happen to me. My attitude was, I refuse to let anybody tell me what's going to happen to me. And there's no doubt that, in my case, a powerful spiritual force was giving me strength to fight. Without that, I'm sure I couldn't have made it. Q:  You've said that you felt compelled to personally get out and educate the public about breast cancer. Did this aggressive approach come naturally to you? A:  Not really. I mean, I'd always been a person who was easy to get along with, but not necessarily one of those folks who could just walk right up to someone and start a conversation. Now, it's a whole different story. I'll chat up anybody who'll give me an ear. . Q:  Apart from face-to-face talks at events like the Komen walks and races, what have been some of the major promotional activities you've done? A:  All sorts of things. I've worked with a public health educator to give programs in Caldwell, Hays and Bastrop counties. I made an appearance at the Women's Chamber of Commerce annual conference. I spent a day with a lady from M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, working a booth right next to the front door. And here in Austin, I've done sound bites for The River, an FM station that plays a lot of Christian pop music and programming. They've been really supportive; this month they're featuring the Month of a Million Mammograms pledge program on their website. Q:  Sounds like you're verging on celebrity status. A:  Kind of. I will say that appearing repeatedly within a network of people who are concerned with breast cancer awareness has led to my name coming up more and more frequently. I guess you could say I'm becoming a go-to person on the subject. And I have to add, as all of this has been happening, my boss, Cheridan Brown, has been very receptive and supportive. Q:  What areas are left for major education and outreach efforts? A:  One thing I consider extremely important is increasing awareness among men. My husband's support has been such a blessing to me, and the same can be true for other women who've been helped by their husbands, boyfriends, brothers and dads. So far, though, the guys haven't been heavily targeted for outreach. I think that's one area we need to be pursuing. Awareness of symptoms is so important, especially for something like inflammatory breast cancer, which you don't really notice until it's at Stage 3. A guy who's informed about breast cancer is more likely to urge you to get a checkup and better able to support you through treatment. This is a fight where we need everyone to get involved. *  *  * Resources for Breast Cancer Awareness",

They did a third mammo on her because of two spots (one by her right nipple and the other near her chest wall). They told her to come back in 6 months for a repeat mammo to see if there are any changes. My sister, Julie is kind of a basket case and does not really like the answers or lack of answers she was given. My sister has many risk factors.

Last week we did the booth at the Women's Chamber of Commerce-  Money and Power Conference. It was just an IBC booth and we had lots of information we handed out. We also had clementine oranges to show the texture of your skin when you get IBC. The lady who put on the conference contracted IBC about 4 months ago. She put in a good plug for our table in the exibit hall so we had that many more come to the table. I have now been invited to speak in front of 40-50 woman at the Pampered Chef meeting this saturday. To top it off I am working with a lady to get some grant money to do breast cancer awareness in the local rural communities around where I live. She works full time and will probably be hiring me part time. I am very excited about the prospects of it all! The more and more I hear about people suffering and dying from this disease the more fired up I get. I am starting to have less and less fatigue and if I can just drop a little weight  I am sure I will feel much better. This is the heaviest I have been. I will share pictures from our conference as soon as I get my hands on them! I know some of you are going through rough times.... just remember.. it too shall pass. We were all given a huge wakeup call and time to get closer to those we love. Yes we had to go through a lot of .... CRAP! ....but we also became stronger women for it. I am thankful everyday I was given this second chance at life. There are many who are cut down in their prime who are not able to give their final good bye's.... Treasure each day... Tina",

My own daughter Naomi (she will be 18 in sept) is back home for a few days and then she is going to head cross country from Austin, tx to Grants Pass, Or. (alone....stubborn little sh*t!) She has friends in Phoenix so I sure hope she takes the time to rest up there for a day or so. It has been an interesting few weeks... first she got stuck in Reno (mechanical failure and they wanted to put her up in a hotel and fly her out standby the next day....not hearing from her that she is 17 and cannot rent a motel room!) She called her friend whom drove the 5 hours to get her and she stayed with him until yesterday morning when she flew home. Her plans all along were to drive back after her trip to Reno to visit her grandmother but they just got delayed. I was hoping she would stay but it is time for her to grow her wings and fly! It is really hard for me to let her do that but one thing good that has come out of all this is he has convinced her to go on to college! I sure hope that turns out the way it needs to be. Ok enough of the poor me stuff....there are those of you who have much greater worries then a child growing up! Maxine, Congrats on the 3 year mark...mine is coming up quick. I am not sure what date to use. I know now my cancer was there starting the 4th of July weekend but did not get formally diagnosed due to the inflamatory until aug 10th.

I also got my custom sleeve and glove as well as night garment.....I just feel WRAPPED all the time!!!!  Everyone is ok at my house and I am sure glad we finally got some measurable rain!

So far I have lost two sizes and 18 pounds. I found out I was not eating enough so the weight stopped coming off! My training is coming along and I found out a few things this weekend about myself: I don't care what others think.... I was having an issue with my swimsuit because everytime I did freestlye it was like having a drag suit on. my fake breasts would pull my suit down enough the water would go in and have to go out somewhere! I decided I was just going to not wear them and my swim on saturday was the best one thus far. I did spin class before swim class and I burned off around 2300 calories saturday alone. No wonder I was starved after! The second thing is .... when I put my mind to it... I can do anything. I made it on a 12 mile bike ride sunday! Thats as long as the triathlon bike portion! Little by little I am making progress...and if i can do it....any of you can! Tina",

Sorry to hear about your uncle and the fact he is in denial makes it rough.  I have some good and bad news ...... we think my issues are Lymphedema. If I use my flexitouch and gret out of my bike shorts asap it seems to have gotten better.It is just such a pain because you have to plan and hour and 15 min or so to use the machine after exercising and if you do it after work starting at 6 and ending at 8....drive home 8:30ish then take shower 9pm then try to eat in there somewhere and lay on the machine. But..... it is a small price to pay to be alive. I keep telling myself and thanking God for this small miracle! Liezel, A group called Team Survivor has helped motivate me to get moving and keep moving. They want me to do another triathlon in August but I think it will be to hot and the lakes are very low so you have a long way between the water and the transition aarea. I think I will pass this time and keep working toward my centry! Your vacation sounds like a fun time. I love to travel but kind of afraid to these days. I also have to take my machine and cpap so its a lot of extra stuff. Take care everyone....we are off to Dallas for a wedding in the morning. Tina",

The weather is just about to cook us to death. We have had 41 days over 100 at the last count (since sometime in june). It is hampering my riding some so I am going to join a gym! I have now lost just shy of 39lbs! I road last Saturday with a group (there were 4 of us). I knew the 47 miles was a bit far for me but started out anyway. We did 26.6 miles at a 15mph rate (faster then I normally ride by several miles per hour). I called for SAG to come pick me up! Thats what they are there for and I still got one heck of a workout in! Well I have gone and done it... I registered for the sweet and twisted triathlon in mid august! This one has a slightly shorter swim - 500m instead of 800m, the bike is 15ish miles instead of 12ish, and the run(walk for me) is still a 5K or 3.1 miles.Most of the time it becomes mind over matter. The mind is a powerful drug!! lol I am still training for my centry...or however long i make it. I know for sure I can make the 65 miles between 8am-4:30pm but we shall see how much more I improve between now and then for the centry. I have come a long way in a very short time so I am not worried about it and plan to go out and have fun with my team mates and friends. sandra your trips sound wonderful! Maybe one of these days I will make a trip over! When I can find a responsible babysitter for my babies! Tina",

Then Iot to see my youngest graduate in Oregon, plus spend 3 weeks vacationing in oregon and northern California. Got home and helped my friend and her 4 kids for a few more weeks before heading to Victoria Mexico (4 hours south of the border) for three weeks. I fell and  broke 2 ribs while in Mexico also. Even though its been a few weeks they are still pretty sore. I got home from Mexico only to be the driver of a friend to Big Bend National park. My husband was supposed to be the driver but he could not do it.....so here I went again!!! We hiked so much that my feet are killing me still .....one week later, but they are getting  better each day. I will be heading next saturday back to oregon because my dad has a pituitary tumor that is 4.5 cm that will be removed on sept 9th. This is the second time it has reappeared (first time was in aug 98). Now on to the good news....as all of you know i have been trying to lose weight....as of last count I have now lost 58lbs!!!!!!! With all that stuff said.....It saddens me to hear of your news Susan. I had started to write a note many times this summer but at times I was out of pocket as far as the internet goes.  Lizel....Let us know when that baby gets here! Congrats!

WHen it rains in pours... long story short..she is ok...for the most part...or will be in 4-8 weeks. She was in the outside lane...a guy came from behind her to middle lane just about the time a guy had a blowout in front of the guy with the big truck and boat. He swerved in front of Naomi but luckily even though she is not as experience driving as some she was able to almost miss the boat trailer. It did about 3000 damage to her car and ...cracked the boat and tweaked the trailer. This guy was a professional fisherman so he was pretty ticked....but not at Naomi...thank fully.She is seeing the chiropractor 3-4 days a week for now due to whiplash and severe sprain in her wrist. My dad has been here a week already....how time flies! He heads home saturday. I am still dealing with a witch for a boss....and FMLA and Civil Rights. They have already said she has crossed the line....now we just have to wait for the final thing of the investigation. Anyway...its late...take care and god bless all my sept sisters... Tina",

I am to start those by the end of the week after they get my lab work back. I have Herceptin tomorrow and cannot wait to finish this ordeal. I will have two more after this....one on Halloween (oct 31st) and on On Nov 21st (the day before thanksgiving). I so badly want to have this journey ended! I have been having chemo since sept 05 and I am so tired and fatiged all the time. I am however still doing the Komen walk on Nov 4th. We have not raised as much this year as we did last but it has been a rough one physically for me. I am just thankful to have supporters! It has been wonderful having my daughter home (it has been nearly 5 years and she just turned 17). We have been doing a lot of catching up these days. My husband is also home so things are looking up! I just thought I would give a short update...take care all my sept sisters! Tina",

I have been completely exhausted and having tons of tests ran since my accident back in August. Apparently the Taxol has really screwed up several things and it may never improve. First off I have the severe neurapathy in my feet. I have had some difficulty sleeping ever since Taxol but after the wreck I finally went to  a neurologist. He had me do treatment for Vertigo (its wonderful ...no more symptoms), the brain mri, as well as two sleep studies. Well the sleep studies concluded that I was not breathing an average of 11-15 times an hour. This is not like regular sleep apnea but the \"cure\" is still the same. I would just fail to breath...and they recorded my blood oxygen level down to 86%. This is very scarry as this would mean I needed oxygen!!!! Well the second test included the cpap machine i had zero non-breathing episodes and my oxygen level at its lowest was 94%.They think the nerve damage from Taxol is the culprit but with my new cpap (no one wants one...but I want some GOOD sleep!) machine I am slowly starting to get some good sleep. I have two more Herceptin treatments (one on Halloween - oct 31st and the other the day before thanks giving nov 21). I will be so glad to be done. I hope and pray for my sept. sisters each and everyone of you.... I know some of you are sad for those that passed on from this horrible disease...it is very very rough and I have lost several IBC sisters on my other list over the last couple months, plus my oncologists own mother had a reoccurance after 15 years and lasted just 3 months. We cannot control what will happen but just be there to support wherever we can. Take care all, Tina ps i am getting ready for my Komen 5K on nov 4th",

Just enjoy the time you have each day with those you love. I have been having my own nightmare things go on and the I finally finished chemo after 26 months! Even though hercetin is not supposed to have all the impact it sure has with me. I am so glad this part of my journey is now over. My doctor is going to order the genetic testing, bone scan and bone density test this month since I have my deductables met (small favors anyway!). I will still not be able to drive for another 3 months because cancer  and treatment has my sleep patterns so out of whack that this is what contributed to my accident in August. My husband and dauther will NOT let me drive at all (ok...had to run out to the conveninece store a couple times....less then a mile away and we live in the sticks!!). I am working less hours at work due to my illness and I just cannot wait to get to a happy medium. I go back to the sleep specialist in three months and I am not sure what will happen at that point. Basically even with the cpap for a month the most I am in REM sleep (themost restful sleep) a total of 1-3 hours a night. I go back the the oncologist on 30 days and then it will be every two months for probably a year. He is still the treating doctor for my neurapathy and we are going to see if it starts to get better now. If it does not then we will deal with the pain medicine then. I hate taking it all but without it I have no quality of life to speak of. I hurt so bad I just want to crawl up in the recliner or in bed. This is very unlike me. Ok...enough of the boo hooing! This is the season of happiness and not only is it the holiday season but my husband and I will celebrate one year the end of december. It is kind of ironic because he has been there for me from the begining and we are in this for the long haul! We already got the worst of the stuff out of the way! Interestingly enough he has AS - a type of arthritis and is on Enbrel but they may add methotrexate soon ( a chemo drug). I am just getting off and he might be getting on it....as the world turns.... Take care all my september sisters. Love tina",

I wanted to know if I had the gene so we knew if we might want to test my daughters once they are over 18 and also I wanted to know if I carried the gene to see if I might have my one remaining ovary removed to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer. I did not know how much greater the risk was of getting ovarian cancer if you carried the genes. The test also will not cost me anything as I have met all my out of pocket for this year. Sandra, There are laws here to protect one if they have either of the breast cancer genes. In my case having inflammatory and at such a young age, I wanted the test. Tina",

We did not do much but did go to have lunch in San Antonio with old friends and then took in \"the bucket list\".

His business is ramping up (it appears the rich are still building houses in Austin, tx!). He said it should take about 2 months to get started and another 3-4 months to finish. This is just one job of many as he has sold another 100,000 or so smaller jobs. I am finally starting to feel a little better and will be returning to a full work week on feb 4th.

We are in the process of negotiating a deal with a couple who have been married 61 years (in march). They live on 45 acres and really do not want to move but want someone close \"just in case\". Or instead of running to the store 15 miles away have us pick it up on the way home. We are going to buy the 45 acres and give the couple a \"life estate\". This will allow them to live out their days in their home while getting a mortgage payment so they can make ends meet a little better. This is going to be a win-win for all of us. Maxine, Keep going until you find out what is wrong or that you are satisfied with what they are telling you. You know your body the best and know something is wrong.

I know how the anxiety can get the best of us and I hope now it will come to a more managable level! Sandra, do you have some of those curte little masks? (i hated them during chemo!) I hope all is ok with your candidate and the swine flu. Peg, Have fun with your temp change of scenery. I hope things start picking up for you! on the tina front.... I got my scans results back yesterday and they are all clean. I am fast approaching year 4 and looking on to many more to come. It has been over 100 degrees all week and that makes it very hard to exercise! I got a new bike! I am so excited! Here is a picture of it: http://www.birkenheadcycles.co.uk/products.php?plid=m1b0s134p609 I went out tuesday even though it was so hot and did about 12 miles before calling it a good maiden voyage. I have tomorrow off and will go in the morning when its much cooler. I think I am going to go around 24-26 miles (if all goes as planned). I am going to go on a 20-30 mile group ride on sat and a 10-15 mile beginer training ride (I am going to help be a leader of the group). We are training for the Mamma Jamma bike ride that is in oct. I have a good friend that told me....oh you are already signed up for 65 and now with your new bike you should be able to do a centry with me......all 100 miles.....we shall see! Tina",

Your are right the neurapathy and sleep issues go hand in hand and aggrevate each other. Plus the fact that I am still on a big old bag of steroids every 3 weeks did not help. I am so GLAD to be done with those! Bone scan on Tuesday and I will know when the genetic testing is shortly. Has anyone in our group had the testing done? Tina",

I am walking about 2.5 miles 5-6 times a week (and I have gained 5 pounds!). I have been walking for the last 4 weeks and last weekend I was part of a team of around 50 for the Susan G Komen Walk for the Cure in Houston! We were bringing to light Inflammatory Breast Cancer. The team included most of the staff from the Mogan Welch IBC clinic at MD Anderson. Up to and including Dr. C (I dont know how to spell his name). I made the entire 5K!!!!! I am planning on doing the walk here in Austin as well on the first sunday in nov. I was the only IBC survivor out of our group. There was planned to be a couple others but they were unable due to illness to attend. I took a little longer then some and there was a very large group cheering me through the survivor path to the finish line. It was a very emotional day for many of us. My husband walked with me (but in the crowd he got ahead of me...I am sure in a past life he was a speed walker..>LOL) and he was at the finish line with a big warm welcome hug and kiss. There were not many dry eyes in our group. During my walk I thought of all of you and our battles. I thought of our triumphs and our warriors who have gone before us. I had a hard time keeping a dry eye most of the day. Tina  PS update on hubby's business - he is busier then ever and the \"economic slowdown\" has not hit his business much (he taylors to the people who don't need loans....wouldn't that be NICE!). My oldest daughter,Naomi, who turned 18 last month started community college in southern oregon on Sept 29th and she started working full time in a assisted living place in mid sept. She loves both and is doing great (the bf I don't like is still around for the time being). After over a year of very little communication (due to my ex husbands antics) I am finally having some communication with Pam, my youngest child who just turned 16 last month.",

When I was at the walk my husband and I were talking to different parts of the group and after my husband said several of the doctors kept looking and referring to me like I was just on borrowed time. They feel it is more likely then not I will eventually end up a patient at their specialty clinic for IBC.  They did not tell me this or act that way toward me but if the doctors feel this, should I?  My opinion, since 80% reoccur within 5 years of getting IBC, should I not feel like I am just waiting for my doom. I am not going to wait. I am going to value each and every day I am given on this earth, but if my maker (does not matter which religion ) has other plans for me I am ok with that because I have been able to say things I may not have otherwise said, done things I might not have done and been loved by some wonderful people. I am right with my maker and that is all I need to worry about the rest will be taken care of. Seek whatever you must spitiually, medically or psycologically to be ok with your scans and your future, no matter what that may be.  Just my two cents .... for what its worth tina",

Susan and Sandra, I think it is so wonderful that the two of you are going to get to meet! I have met so many wonderful people through this horrible disease. One just never knows.... It is so hot here tonight I had to get up and turn on the AC! It was 81 today and still in the mid 70's at 10 pm. It was a record today and they are predicting more of it tomorrow night. I am starting back to 40 hours and for the first time in a couple months I am haveing a hard time sleeping. I know it will be ok but when the boss says we will gradually add back hours from 27 to 40 over 4-6 weeks and then with springs it on you one week before that you are going back to 40 all at once it does add some anxiety. She is not the easiest boss to deal with but I thank god every day that I have a decent job and good health insurance. I remember the days when I had no health insurance and I was just starting my journey. We all will be fast approaching our 3rd anniversary! Take care and God Bless all my september sisters! Tina",

OMG its been since early August since I have driven (other then to the corner quickie mart - one mile from home). I go in on the 4th for my 1/2 yearly CT scan. I am really not worried about it to much. It is just something I have to do! I have been following a 1300-1500 calorie daily intake (not a diet!) menu. So far I have lost 2 pounds this week and things are going well. I am going to start up in the next month at the gym with a good friend of mine (she already goes and has lost 40 or so pounds). I am bound and determined to be my own \"biggest loser\". I have between 100-130 pounds to lose! If anyone would like a copy of my menu please let me know. I am not really giving up any food group, just watching portions and eat 5-6 times a day instead of 2-3. I will try to write more later.... Luv to all my sisters.....  Good Friday and Happy Easter to those who celebrate it. Tina",

My first tri My first open water swim My first bike race Saturday morning we had a survivor breakfast which was attended by Sally Edwards. She is a big supporter of team survivor. She was high fiving us all as we entered the water and she grabbed my hand and said \"you can do this\". She is such a neat lady. At the end of the race she gave me the biggest hug and told me she knew I could do it. I was not in this to be the fastest but to prove.... to myself... there is life after cancer!!!! My daughter (poor kiddo is in a walking type cast until surgery in two weeks - she came from Oregon for race weekend) hobbled all over the place to cheer me on. It meant so much to have my daughter and husband out there. My husband is so funny....I was really tired the last uphill mile! He came and met up with me and two other ladies the last 1/2 mile or so. He was jogging in his steel toed boots!! lol Someone asked me if I had the tri bug yet.....well as funny as it sounds I might have the tri bug now..... On the way home I was telling my husband I needed to get a real road bike (I have a cannondale hybrid - but during race day I road a trek demo bike and fell in LOVE with it). I told him there were some more tri's coming up this year (the Sweet and Twisted tri is going to have a huge Team Survivor showing) and I might like to do them. I also told him I was going to do the bike leg of the Danskin coming up on June 7th. I met up with one of my fellow Team Survivor woman who had ovarian cancer 15 years ago and Breast 5 years ago.....who is working on 50 tri's in 5 years..... She only has 3-4 more to go to reach that goal... she is one of the fittest 40ish woman I know!!! The things you learn about others and yourself during this challenge is enormous! I could not swim 25 meters without thinking I was going to drown when I got started the end of Feb. I made it all 800m pretty much without stopping. There was a couple of times I got a wave full of water and now I need to learn to breathe on BOTH sides! Even experienced swimmers said the water was pretty rough.... good choice for a first open water swim, then I will love it when its much easier...LOL My ride was great and I was told this was one of the hardest courses around this area. Since I was not in this for \"time\" but to finish I actually stopped for about 10 min on my bike course to help a fellow rider with a chain issue. She was grateful and a little surprised. I know there are people along the way to assist but in the 10 min we were there no one came along and she kind of had the deer in the headlights look when I stopped and was quite upset. During the walk/jog I ended up walking with two very nice ladies (pic 26) and now they might come and do the Mamma Jamma breast cancer bike ride in Oct. I signed up for 65 miles!!!!! Its all about the experience! Life is such a challenge..... but I am up for it!! Thank you all for all the encouragement! One bonus to all of this is.... I have now lost 32 pounds! Tina Q!!! ps I have some other pictures but not sure how to publish them. It is now three days post triathlon and things are going great!! http://www.kvue.com/perl/common/slideshow/sspop.pl?recid=16429&nextimage=0 Images 7, 10 and 12 are of our survivor wave. #14 is out special designation transition area #17 is my friend, coworker and survivor Hannah #24 Some of our group at the finish # 26 is Me finishing! Iam the one with team survivor on my shirt. I was getting tired the last couple miles of the walk/run and the other two ladies I finished with walked with me. At about 1 mile left it was a very steep hill and I told the other two ladies I needed to slow and thanks for walking with me. They both slowed to my pace and made sure I came in with them. I really touched me that they would do that for me. # 34 - my daughter Naomi (the one with the crutch) marking another fellow survivor.",

I finished in June 06 and still have continued numbness and pain due to nerve damage. I do not think I am the rule but rather the exception. Nothing has worked in my case to reverse the side effects. I would do it over in a heart beat though because it could have been the one drug that saved my life. I had Inflamatory breast cancer, 2 tumors of IDC, and extensive DCIS. I was a mess.... I had 6 AC DD, followed by a double mastectomy, 12 weekly taxol, and a year of herceptin. I was ER/PR++ and her2+++. I did find out I am BRAC1 and BRAC2 negative. I finished Herceptin in nov 07. 26 months from the start of chemo to the end (I had a few months off to let my heart heal from the AC... had ejection fraction go down to 42%). TINA",

Since I do not have high blood presure at first they gave me an ace inhibitor and beta blocker. Now that my heart has healed and my blood pressure was going way to low (94/54 is a bit much!) they took me off the ace inhibitor but kept me on the beta blocker. I am just about done with Herceptin and then they will decide when / if i am getting off the beta blocker. This drug probably saved my life. I have inflammatory and I watched it disappear before my eyes with each treatment. Just my experience with Adriamycin. Tina",
