I told her the ps set that up I went yesterday for first time. She's going to give me ambien to help me sleep but said its only for limited time!!! As if I'm looking to stay on drugs! So hopefully at least I'll sleep and physical therapy twice a week will help. Thanks for your response!!",

It's intense and keeps me from sleeping. It feels like someone is using a metal rake and raking the inside of my back at times.. Sometimes it feels like a muscular ache. It's across my shoulders mainly but I also get the lower back pain. At night when I am sitting it feels like restless leg syndrome or whatever that's called. I just can't get comfortable and want to crawl out of my skin!! I feel like if I could get this back pain in check I'd be ok...this pain is killing me. I'm taking 800 mg of Motrin 3 times a day and 2 extra strength Tylenol. This pain is beyond that medicine. ",

I too respect my bs as I have been going to her since 2008 when my mom was diagnosed but I feel her assistant is shrugging this off. They haven't even seen the swelling I'm talking about. She tells me over the phone it can't be due to the BMx. I go to my pt on Monday. I've only seen her once I'm going to tell her my concerns about lymphedema and tell her it may be best if I go to a therapist that has training w lymphedema. My mom went to this office so were familiar w some of the staff but the therapist trained in lymphedema is no longer at this site, they have a therapist two towns over from me affiliated w this group. When I registered they actually asked if I had lymphedema... I said no and she said ok if u did I'd send u to the other site... Might be better to go there now in case. And like you said, y wait til it progresses. Even if it's not \"full blown lymphedema\" the trained therapist may be able to help with the swelling. I just feel like they are dismissing me. There is something wrong when I had a BMx on my BREAST 5 weeks ago and it's my BACK that's causing me the most pain!!!",

I chose double mastectomy. I'm glad I did because they found more DCIS and Lcis than anticipated. Each person is different as far as how to treat it. The only thing that is the same for everyone is the fear and uncertainty that this disease puts in people's lives. I'm glad your results came back benign and sorry you had to endure all the tests.

I was hospitalized for 3 days and put on I'V antibiotic. I had the area excised again, she cleaned out the pocket w antibiotic ( like a power washing) and re stitched and glued incision. I'm hoping it works.  She said the skin is thin in this area and with the weight of the implant it isn't allowing  the area to heal. If it becomes infected again I may lose the implant.  Talk with ps and bs for/ with your mom. If its an infection you want to treat it ASAP!!!!

I'm saying this not to panic you, it cold very well be nothing, but wouldn't you want to know and then move on? If its something it's probably early on like mine was (dcis is stage 0, I had no invasive cancer) if left untreated you risk it changing or evolving to invasive cancer.
