ER+,HER2+, BRCA2+, Stage 1, Grade 2; Treatment plan, TCHP, then bilateral mast + reconstruction, ovaries removed after dbl mast. Herceptin for 12 months, Tamoxafin 5-10 yrs. Now that I've been through 2 rounds of chemo I have a better idea of how to manage my SE. I am thankful that my side effects have mostly been annoying. Got sick once and took the anti-nausea and it worked FAST!! Had to take it 2 more times proactively and it worked great. Hair started falling out day 13 after 1st treatment. Had a little moment in the shower, so I took my time doing my hair for what I knew was going to be the last time and that really helped. But by the next day it was coming out in clumps and it was pissing me off. I grabbed a towel, some good shears, and started whacking it off. Took my husband's clippers and shaved it down to 1/4 inch. Kinda cute I think. I had gone to look at wigs the weekend before so I was set just in time. For me, days 4,5,6 have been the days I have more of the achey and GI issues. I stuck to the BRAT diet for the first week; breads, bananas, cream of wheat. But I wasn't getting protein, so by day 5 I was ready to crash, not good! I went to the grocery store and bought some baked chicken, within 10 minutes of eating I was a new woman!! Don't forget to include protein!! But then, on day 13 of second round, my new world of \"fun\" started. I started back to work (working from home) and all day long it's sweatshirt on, sweatshirt off, socks on, socks off. I'm cold, no I'm hot and I'm standing in a tank top and nothing else. I thought i was running a low grade fever, or maybe it's because I can't regulate my temperature with no hair on my head.... I finally decide at 8 pm to text my onco to inquire what was going on, were these hot flashes? He texted back \"yes\" with a sad face emoji. Great, friction, great. I think I've had a harder time accepting the medical menopause at 44, than anything else. Had myself a good cry, then ordered some hand held fans from Amazon Prime, I already have them in hand -yippee! I'm rocking a red mohawk now and hope the top stays for awhile, it's been a good source of entertainment for me to watch people's reactions. I do hope the hot flashes will not go on forever (i've read posts with varying experiences) But, if it's one thing I've tried my best is to take it one day at a time, regardless of what the situation is. Easier said than done sometimes. The other SE that is driving me a bit nutty is the tearing eyes and runny nose. I'm now taking Claritin, Allegra, and benedryl! Good grief! I can't not have hair and Not be able to wear eyeliner, that's just not Right! lol. Cravings: Mexican food and pickles. Okay, that's it for now. I wish you ladies easy days and strength when you feel bad. ",

First cycle was long, but Benedryl gave me a nice snooze through some of it. Was tired first couple of days and took naps, SE included diarrhea and acid reflux. Onc prescribed protonix and I took over the counter anti-diarrhea proactively so I could venture out and eat more than bananas and bread. I also noticed that by day 4-5 I had not eaten protein (mainly because I was afraid it would not sit well with me) and boy what a difference once I did. Had me some baked chicken and immediately felt like a new woman! Thankfully, no Nausea. Allergy symptoms started day 8, runny nose and teary eyes. The nurses had recommended Claritin when I was undergoing my first treatment. I took it for a few days, but stopped as the oncologist had said if I didn't think I needed it, I didn't have to take. Started taking again, but my eyes still won't stop tearing. I have 5 more cycles and will then undergo bilateral mastectomy and ovaries removed. Need to find a good OB-GYN and determine if ovary removal is sufficient or if I need to consider fallopian tube etc. My Aunt was diagnosed at 55 with rare fallopian tube cancer... Lots of information to take in and consider, taking it one day at a time. And if you get a chance watch the Facebook video of the girl and the Star Wars Chewbaka mask-, made me laugh so hard, I'm keeping it as my daily watch video. Laughter is great medicine right! Good night all.  ",
