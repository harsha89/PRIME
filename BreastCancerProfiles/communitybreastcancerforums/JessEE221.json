Unfortunately my excitement is mixed right now because I am having some breast pain and found several mini lumps in my breast that range in size from a nerd to a pea. It is the week before my period so I am unsure how that may be affecting this. I have been on birth control for ten years now and I know the risk for breast cancer can increase if you are on it for that long. Since I just quit my job and my new insurance does not start until October 1st I am unsure what I should do.... Should I go in and pay out of pocket to have it checked? If i do this, will be new insurance still cover me once October starts? Should I wait a month and see how it might change during a cycle? Should I look for a low cost place to be checked? Besides the breast pain and the tiny lumps, I do not have any other symptoms listed on the websites. Any ideas or advice would be greatly appreciated so I can be excited about this month again and not stressing out! THANKS SO MUCH!    Log in to post a reply",
