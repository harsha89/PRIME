When taping wires by my healthy breast they only move the blanket enough to tape them, never exposing my breasts. When I'm on the table and they line me up, they cover my back up to my neck with the blanket, and again as I am trying to get up once it's done (have a little bit of hard time due to achey stiff joints) they cover me up. Finally they take the wires off like they put them and hold the blanket behind me when I wear the gown. I don't see why anyone needs to be exposed in areas other than that being radiated. It just shows the techs are not considerate I think. I also don't take off my wig.",

In the meantime I wanted to give you an update in case any one of you have similar discomfort with the arm on the treated side. I had developed some discomfort and mild swelling in my hand/arm towards the end of rads. The assistant doctor at the radiation oncology pretty much dismissed it as I only had 4 nodes taken out and basically said don't move your arm if it bothers you! Anyway, I insisted to be set up with a physical therapy appointment which I went to for the first time today. The therapist was very sweet, she confirmed I have swelling pretty much all over my arm and hand and said that while it was very mild it was important I follow certain precautions to not get it worse. She said it did look like edema. She told me to buy a specific type of compression sleeve for my arm and one for my hand, and wear them as soon as I feel discomfort. She also will be helping to move the swelling out of my arm over the next two sessions and then will help me train my arm and chest with super light weights until I can be ready to go and do this stuff on my own. I was very pleased to have seen her as I started working out at the gym last week and she told me to absolutely not do anything by myself at the gym for upper body until she can slowly get me there. She also gave me a stretching exercise to open up my shoulders and taught me how to massage my breast as I have a lot of tenderness. Finally she said if I was to fly, that I would need to wear the compression garments as a precaution. Maybe all would have been fine in time regardless but I am glad I saw her as I do not want to make this any worse. Just letting you all know in case you have s similar situation. Take care!  ",

I did #15 today, I have 10 more full breast and 8 boosts so 18 more to go :( up until 3 days ago my skin was fine and soft just slightly pinkish. Over the last 3 days my skin has dried up and feels rough, some areas are peeling, though very thin, and I am definitely tanned. Saw RO today and he mentioned I could get sores right under my breast (where peeling is most). Weird thing I got the same peeling on part of my upper arm, he tried to blame deodorant but I have not worn deodorant in a while so finally said it must be them then. Scary! I wonder where else this stuff is going. He only recommends aloe at this point still, said again it was not so much the aloe itself but the increase in circulation while applying it that helps in his opinion. Also he said to expect my skin to get rougher especially above the breast. Today I had to drive 3 hours and was wondering if in fact that could be because of the seat belt. It is the same area and we all pretty much drive to rads and back daily. Probably not but I wondered. Work is super busy these days, helps keep my mind off bad things but at the same time very tiring. I've worked pretty much till midnight for the past 10 days including the weekend. I was telling the rads techs that rads was the highlight of my day as I got to leave the office for a bit, see the afternoon light, and listen to some music while getting zapped :) ",

I don't know what to believe as almost everyone here seems to be benefiting from lotions creams etc. it's frustrating to not have a standard on this. On the alcohol, thanks for the input, RO did not tell me no drinking but the tech did and when I was surprised said in general they do not recommend this.

The position itself is very easy, I just lie on my belly and extend my arms to hold the handles, not uncomfortable at all, plus it takes 5 minutes anyway. I think this should be be provided at all facilities as I would imagine the machine itself should be the same.

I don't understand the psychological effect of short hair falling being better than long hair, it's the same amount of hair!  As I didn't cut my hair I could wear a cap over it even though my top if my head was bald, which bought me time as I was late in buying a wig (I had not anticipated loss over only one week). Finally, i can't imagine how hard it would be to collect the falling hair if u had it buzz cut. If u leave it long u just grab what falls and it will mostly fall when u touch it anyway so u can get rid of those strands easy. Being bald sucks and is one of the worst side effects in my opinion. I did get a full lace wig and it is very comfortable not hot or itchy and no one can tell. Still can't wait for the day I have some hair so I can stop having to wearing a wig.

I have 15 more full breast and 8 boosts left. I got a lumpectomy so mine maybe more in number than yours. So far it is moving pretty quick, although with every treatment I am anxious to see if my skin will change. So far I have tanned a bit but my understanding is that skin issues really start after the 3rd week so fingers crossed. My center recommends aloe so I have been putting it on three times a day. Initially I could not find 100% aloe they recommend and got Lilly of the earth aloe from wholefoods. It's 99% and seems like it has some vitamins in it too. Yesterday I finally found the 100% one (fruit of the earth brand) and used it before bed but I really like the other one better. This 100% one did not dry as quick and seemed to stick make my skin stick to my tshirt. Maybe I just have to wait a bit longer before wearing anything. So I decided to use them both. I also got aquafor, only because I saw it mentioned here but I was not too fond of it after one use so I continued with the aloe. I did have some swelling by my 3rd rads and continue to have it. It feels like my boobs when I had pms. Other than that no discomfort during or after the procedure. Ladyb, I don't have fatigue but I do feel more sleepy. I am passing out on the sofa if I lie down, and this started with the rads. I still continue to go to work full time but if I have skin issues or feel sleepy during the day I will prefer to work from home. As I mentioned above, my main side effect so far is swelling. I wish you both, and everyone else going through this now, lots of good luck.",

I posted a pic of my skin below, I didn't have peeling or discomfort other than the occasional swelling. So if you are headed to where I am in terms of color, you may not have a tough time.

There we have social security where if you go to any state hospital treatment is pretty much free. My two relatives who got cancer and got treated at these state hospitals did not pay a dime. They are also the larger hospitals so the standard of care is very good. However, if you have something less important, you will have to wait in line for a long while before the doctor will see you for this free service. That's why there are a ton of private hospitals who provide health services for higher fees, where the facilities are pretty and there's no waiting in line. They are expensive, although no where near the prices in the US. Private insurance, if purchased, covers the costs of these private hospitals.  Healthcare is a mess in a lot of places... Edited to say: since 2012 heathcare insurance was made mandatory by the government for people over 18 years of age. they determine the premiums based on your income level I believe.",

I am not sure about tomotherapy, although RO told me the difference in machines is the imagining used and the beam is the same beam, so maybe with tomotherapy they see it better. My facility has a tomo machine but I don't think that's what they are using for me, I will ask though.

I am interested in this FAST shampoo and conditioner you mentioned, do you think it makes sense to buy it at this stage of growth that i'm at or would you recommend it when i have more coverage. I do still have spots that don't have the fuzz. I can't wait to grow this hair!! As soon as it is long enough for extensions I will get those too. I have (had) thick frizzy hair and live in Miami so short hair is definitely not my thing. Also - it looks like there is a version \"original\" with sulfates, and one without. Which one are you using?",

I am 5 months post chemo and while I'm still on herceptin I don't think that's the culprit as my hair is doing fine. I just started tamoxifen last week so that can't be it either. Did this happen you as well? I guess I am worried they will stay this way :( makes me look unhealthy unless I'm wearing makeu",

The foam I use is proclaim, it was cheap at Sally beauty and works better than a mousse, which I also tried. You will see that once the hair is molded into shape wrapped and dried, it comes out with no volume and shaped, all you have to do is comb and style as you like. http://youtu.be/pYHlMHYpOUQ  2.

I don't mind the sulphate so much but the other one is also paraben free, and for hormone positive people that may be better. Although I am not sure if it makes sense to be that picky u know. I will use the regular version and if I like it my next order will be the paraben free one.  Tangles, thanks so much for recommending this.

I've been researching online and saw that if you get the strand by strand method whether it is fusion or microlinks it costs more than having I guess it's called a weave where 2-3 inches of hair on a track is sewn. On another thread a girl from Brazil posted pics of the method they used on her when her hair was less than an inch, which was the tracks. I think from a looks perspective each of these methods would produce good results if done by an experienced professional. The deciding factor to me will be the comfort when sleeping, and whether I can put it up in a ponytail. I intend to get them not so long, shoulder length tops and hoping this will reduce the weight and stress on roots. There is a man called Jon Richards who does it in his salon but it seems he uses curly hair only for one inch of hair. Not that fond of the looks he has on the website. Think the cost can vary from couple hundred dollars to over a thousand, the more expensive strand by strand method seems to require less frequent maintenance so the cost may even out over a year or so. At this point I will just take this as if it was part of my deductible, I've spent so much money on treatment like others that I will take this as part of the treatment and not for just beauty. I am hoping to hear experience of others, even if it may be before BC on how they felt using and sleeping with their extensions.",

Up until a few days ago I was still planning to wear the wig at work for 3-4 more months but I've just changed my mind about this. At this point while our hair is a short pixie it is still a cut other people in fact go and have. It does not indicate cancer or chemo.

Watching a bunch of ladies on YouTube and how to do Halle berry hair tutorials here's what I do now: After washing hair I generously put foaming wrapping lotion and comb it down (making my part) with a fine tooth comb. This makes the hair slick and straight. Then I put a mesh wrap and dry it (just leave to air dry if I have time) when u take the wrap off the hair will be much straighter and will not have any u volume and nothing will be sticking up. Then I go over it with the mini flat iron and shape it the way I want . Because the hair is already straight u just have to go over it with the flat iron once to give more shape like fluff up the front. If u prefer u can leave it like that. I do use a heat spray to protect the hair before ironing (which I never used to do before but this is chemo hair). The next steps I put some texturizing balm and hairspray only because I live in the very humid Miami weather. The foam wrap part is the real key thing and a life saver. I use proclaim foam wrapping lotion. This keeps it good for 3 days, I just touch up with flat iron, and then wash and do the routine again third day. If u are interested YouTube it, there are a lot of videos or I can post a link. It's easy and makes a huge difference at least for my unruly frizzy hair in humid weather :)",

I am not sure how far along they were but sounds similar to your timeline. I hope all will go well for you. Take care",

I did neoadjuvant chemo so while snb came negative afterwards I'll never know if there was a micro invasion. When I initially mentioned about this concern of never knowing before starting chemo, doctor told me it would not change my treatment plan so it really is not useful info. I figured if th tumor could grow that much and clearly it's connected to blood supply, surely cells must have entered the bloodstream at one point. it's hard to accept but it's the reality for most of us. I feel angry when I think of how we can't know in this day and age what triggers this",

I also did not ice my ties nails or mouth due to the same reason. I absolutely hated losing my hair. If you do end up not using the cold caps but are self conscious about hair like me, you can look into lace wigs and PM me if you want more info. I was told many times that \"at least I did not lose my hair\". They look very natural. Although once someone tells me that I always feel like I would be lying if I said yes so I end up telling that it's a wig :)",
