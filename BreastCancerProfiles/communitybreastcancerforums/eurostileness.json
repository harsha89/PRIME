    "Content": "eurostileness wrote: my mom just got diagnosed with breast cancer. Im unclear as to what stage she is at and how long she has left.  The doctors really havent been saying much but im hoping its because they want to get test results and be clear on everything. It has already spread to her bone, her spine and her leg and possibly her arm.  Realisticly whats her most likely scenario? Or is everyone just different?  Please keep my mom in your prayers. She is only 62. She is still in the hospital after being diagnosed, they do not want her to walk as they fear she might break or fracture a bone. Log in to post a reply",
