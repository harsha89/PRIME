      "Content": "janejetson wrote: Tomorrow morning I'm going in to have a biopsy of my biopsy. Actually it a biopsy of a thickened area of redness and swelling that developed after a biopsy I had in July (12 weeks ago.) The original biopsy was a benign lymph node but 2 or 3 inches away from the location, the stereotactic machine hit a blood vessel, this swelling in that area began that turned red and hardened and dimpled. After antibiotics for 10 days it dulled the red and the gardness got softer, but the edema is still there. I feel my surgeon is trust worthy and kknowledgeable, but I seem to have him stumped. After an ultrasound which showed boyhing abnormal, he has decided to biopsy the area to as he says \"rule out inflamatory cancer and look for a bacterial infection.\" He says that if this comes back as ibc then its the weirdest case of cancer he has ever seen, and he has had a long career. Anyone ever deal with anything similar? Trying not to go crazy with worry. Log in to post a reply",

A friend of mine was the surgical nurse for my biopsy and said that when she spoke to the doctor afterward he said that it was very superficial and he is thinking its just inflamation. It bothers me because during my original biopsy they hit a blood vessel it was really painful, but my current swelling is in the area where I had the blood vessel pain. Id assume the swelling 12 weeks post surgery is related, I didnt think you can trigger IBC, and I had no redness or swelling prior to that incident but the doctor mentions biopsy for IBC and rational thought goes out the window. I already have a hard time trusting doctors and I seem to have this one stumped (aside from his not thinking this is bad statement.) Now of course the swelling and pain is worse, but I have a new biopsy site. Ah, stress! Thanks for reading and responding to my rants, It does help to get responses.",

It has been now 5 months since my original lymph node biopsy (negative) which triggered redness, swelling and peau d'orange on the opposite side of the same breast. That caused my surgeon to do another biopsy, this time a surgical skin biopsy on the edge of my nipple where the swelling was causing my skin to thicken. That biopsy too was negative for cancer, positive for a fibroid tumor. Of course then all doctors (I had seen 2, breast surgeon and obgyn) said \"ah yes the swelling is the fault of the fibroid tumor, mystery solved!\" And that was that. I came across an article that said that one skin biopsy was not effective in diagnosing IBC, of course this uos my anxiety because while my redness is gone I still have permanant thickened skin and obvious hair follicles In that area of my breast. While I have been under the impression of probable lymphedema, the doctors have adamantly disagreed or basicly shrugged. There are no lymph specialists anywhere near me. Not that I can afford it as all of these biopsies have pushed me into debt already, and such a mental toll should I be seeking a third opinion? My obgyn really tried to explain the fibroid tumor to me but I dont get why this would present this swelling. My surgeon explains that \"its somewhere in there blocking things up.\" Does anyone have any thoughts on this? Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "janejetson wrote: So today is 6 weeks since my stereotactic biopsy which resulted in a benign lymph node. During this procedure they hit a blood vessel twice. Needless to say this resulted in bruising and a rather large hematoma. I followed up with the surgeon last Tuesday which was almost 5 weeks post opp and the first thing he noticed was the redness of my breast but proceeded to tell me that the cording and dimples and light pain I'm experiencing is just the natural healing process. What concerns me is that while the biopsy incision was in the upper outter area, after surgery I was bruised also in the lower inner area near my nipple. Now that area is where the redness, tingling, and swelling is occurring. My skin is thick there and dimpled. I find it slightly warm at times, and of course with all that's gone on I'm paranoid about IBC. The doctor did tell me that because of the blood vessel trauma the complete healing could take months, and the tingling pains I feel are probably nerves. Also this thick red area hasn't gotten any worse in the past few weeks it just hasn't gotten better. I have rather large breasts and the part that stays swollen is the part that seems to be the lowest. Has anyone experienced this? Does anyone know if healing could mimic the signs of bc? I'm in such a bad financial situation I just cant afford to run off for a second opinion if its just my anxiety and all I need is time. Any input is appreciated. Log in to post a reply",

However I recently found a little hard lump in the other breast. I visited the same surgeon as the previous time, he referred me for a mammogram and ultrasound and both showed nothing. However my lump cannot be felt laying down only sitting up, so my doctor made me question the ultrasound results when he called the next day and asked me if she did the ultrasound in the right area... he then told me to follow up in 3 months. I felt uneasy, so I decided to have my film transferred and seek a second opinion from another surgeon. This surgeon did an ultrasound himself in the office while sitting up, he saw something tiny and decided to do a biopsy there guided by the ultrasound. (I Am not sure what the correct term is, it was a device with a needle and made snapping sounds). He marked the area with a marker and had a difficult time pin pointing it again after numbing me. After he was done he said it was very tiny and looked mostly like fatty tissue and I probably wouldnt even feel it again. This was two days ago, I'm sore, and my annoying little pea sized knot is still there. Is it possible that he biopsied the wrong area?

That's it... after two surgeons and ultrasounds I don't feel like I have any other options. Apparently I have to live with this and monitor it. Has anyone had a similar experience?
