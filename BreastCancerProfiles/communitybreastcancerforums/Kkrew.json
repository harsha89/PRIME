It feels like it's taking forever but I promise it will come back! 3 yrs later and I have thick (curly) brown hair to the middle of my back. I really thought it would only take a few weeks to come in but in truth I didn't feel comfortable going wigless for a couple of months. Best of luck to you and congratulations on finishing chemo. You are a warrior.",
