After a rough first chemo (port in the same morning, got deydrated and spent a couple of days in the hospital), the second one was so much better, but I did get a nasty headache again. This time I took my usual migraine medicine (Zomig) and it worked like a champ. Zomig is a little old-fashioned as migraine meds go, but it works for me. I wonder if your dr wouldn't give you something specifically strong for headaches.",

Went in for my first chemo this morning and the dr decided to put it off a week as they had not gotten me in for a port yet and my veins are subpar (I've had a lot of complaints over the years) but on the good, good, good side, the results of my petscan were fine. Whew. Since I still am having the leg pain, they are doing a bone scan, but I really don't think they are thinking mets. so big whew.",

I'd skipped more than one mammogram, but having a symptom got my attention. I worried that it might be very advanced since there was some pain, but that was not the case. I hope yours turns out to be nothing, but I am glad that I had some symptoms or I might still be letting things go instead of paying attention and taking care of things. Good luck to you. Kay",
