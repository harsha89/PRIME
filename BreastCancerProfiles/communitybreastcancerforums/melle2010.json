    "Content": "melle2010 wrote: Last month I found a hard pea-sized lump under my left areola. My gynecologist sent me to the hospital to have an ultrasound. The doctor at the hospital told me that it is a complex cyst with debris and recommended that I see a breast specialist for a needle aspiration. My appointment is next week. I am 22 years old and have no family history of breast cancer, but I'm afraid of being misdiagnosed. The mass doesn't feel movable or fluid-filled. It feels solid and I have noticed that my left nipple is now larger than my right. What are the chances that my \"cyst\" has been misdiagnosed and is actually a solid mass? What are the chances that the \"debris\" in the cyst is cancerous? Can I have the cyst removed? What is the likelihood of recurrence? Has anyone else here been or know someone who has been in this situation?  The waiting and googling is driving me crazy!  Much love to you all.  Log in to post a reply",
