I only have cancer in the left but given my horrible family history( grandmother, aunt, and mother had breast cancer and my mother died from it), I want them to remove both breast. I just can't imagine going through this again. Has anyone ever had a hard time getting there insurance to pay for a bilateral mastectomy when only one breast had cancer. I am just worried they will deny it. I plan to do immediate reconstruction with TE and alloderm at the same time as my reconstruction. Thanks in advance for your help.

They cancelled my radiation treatment today which means I would have to come in next Monday. I can't bear the thought of not being done on Friday. After 10 months of this crap (chemo, two surgeries, and 28 radiation treatments) I have had enough. I had a celebration dinner planned for Friday. I thought I read from some of you that it is possible to have two treatments in the same day. I asked the nurse on the phone today and she said she didn't think so. I want to know if any of you had two treatments in one day. Thanks Dx 3/3/2010, IDC, 4cm, Stage IIIA, Grade 1, 1/6 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

I am to be admitted as an observation patient which I know means 23 hours. Is that typical? I can't imagine going home in 23 hours after this type of surgery. I have a low pain tolerance and as a nurse I know IV meds are much better at pain control than oral meds. The plastic surgeon did stay it could possibly be extended another day, but that would mean resubmitting it to insurance. I like my plastic surgeon and his work is excellent. I am not just not real confident about how much he would advocate for me for a second night. This all has my anxiety through the roof. I had an anxiety attack just thinking about it yesterday. I am not normally a anxious person. I would really like to know how long others have stayed in the hospital after a bmx and TE. Was anyone admitted as a 23 hour obs patient and then converted to an inpatient with another night.  Thanks in advance to anyone who answers my questions.
