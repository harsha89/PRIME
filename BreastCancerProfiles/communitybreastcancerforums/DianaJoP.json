Still feeling the \"zings\" and have more than occasional tenderness in the area of the lumpectomy. I mentioned this to my doctor a few months ago and was just told \"not to worry about it.\" I would have liked to have known that this is not uncommon. I was starting to feel like I was \"just a baby\" or imagining the continued discomfort. Don't get me wrong, I am grateful that this is just discomfort and feel blessed to be alive. Thank you to all of you strong women for your posts. You have given me peace.",
