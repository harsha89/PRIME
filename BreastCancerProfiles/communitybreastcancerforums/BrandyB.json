As far as the tape is concerned, I just did my best to keep it on. It's not really a big deal bc they see you EVERYDAY. If the tape begins to peel or the lines fade, they'll touch them up. The tape they use is very soft and flexible so it never bothered me. As far as people seeing the markings... I never gave a care in the world about that! Let them think I had some cool tribal markings or whatever. What did I care? You are in the home stretch now baby!!!! I'm sure you'll meet some amazing people during your radiation treatments (as I did). Do Yoga breathing and guided imagery while the radiation is happening.Lead the radiation straight to those little bastard cancer cells!!!! Let them fry!!!! Send mental energy to your healthy cells to 'hang in there, you can do it. Put up a good fight!' Now that you know how crazy I really am... I hope that helped some :) Brandy",

I'm over one year out from chemo and my hair is totally out of control curly. I dye mine brown as well, but I've been doing that for years, but the curls are sooooo tight. I've been wearing a headband and letting it go crazy like an Afro. I always had a secret longing to have an Afro. They seem so cool and easy, but mine is not easy. It's taking all of my efforts not to look like Ronald McDonald! I've been following the hair care instructions in The Curly Girl book by Lorraine Massey. The tips really help, but as my hair gets longer it seems to just get taller!!! I'm trying to embrace my curls and my new look, but sometimes it's sortof hard. I look like my black standard poodle. Talk about people turning into their pets!!",

She stayed and discussed my case from 5:00 to 7:00 pm. She is level headed, experienced, knowledgable, respected in her field, there aren't enough good things that I can say about her.

I'm about 9 weeks out from a DIEP reconstruction and my abdominal muscles started to seize up, sort of like a cross between a Charlie horse and a labor contraction. The cramps were pretty intense and scary. I called my plastic surgeon who told me that these cramps are not uncommon with the DIEP reconstruction and prescribed a muscle relaxer. The muscle relaxer helped but didnt completely stop the cramps. Before I spoke with the PS, I was pretty freaked out thinking that it was a recurrence. It was imagining a tumor growing in my abdomen. It would go something like this: cramp, anxiety, nausea from the anxiety, then heart palpitations from the anxiety. I just wanted to share this just in case it happens to someone else.
