I have been thinking that two or multiple types of cancer cells that might co-exist as well. My cousin's PR status changed from positive to negative when recur. She has been seeking second opinion. Before her brain mets were found, the second doctor suggested to do a chemo before moving on to letrozole as she believed there might be some vicious cells that don't respond to hormone therapy. I haven't heard of doing chemo before exhausting other drugs, but it kind of makes sense. They cannot do anything now as she's doing whole brain radiation, but they might change her treatment plan after the WBRT. Has anyone had similar experience or heard of it?",

She found the recurrence a month ago, no symptom, but TMs were high. Then it took them a month to finish all other testings: biopsy, petcan, uri. MO told her to stop Tamoxifen until the new treatment and said it wouldn't progress too fast. He was wrong. She got worse day by day. Double vision made her not able to walk or see. Last thursday she started Femara,same day found more those bruises on arms and legs, which got worse Friday night, a quarter sized hematoma was found on her buttock when she showered. Ibrance arrived Friday night so she took one, the hematoma became bruise next morning. Since it spread to bones and brain, I wonder if it caused platelets problems which caused the bruises and hematoma. She's seeing her MO tomorrow, hope he will have some insight. I don't like her MO because he missed diagnose her brain mets when she told him she had a bit double vision and he also underestimated how aggressive the cancer cells in youngmy cousin, but he's probably the best MO in her area, so we don't know where else we can go.",

My cousin switched to faslodex and Ibrance after xeloda stopped working for a year, when her scan 3 months ago showed progression on bones. The latest scan showed that bones are stable and some some spots in lung disappeared; HOWEVER, there\u2019s a new 19 mm spot and probably some tiny ones showed up in liver. Her dr thinks it\u2019s progression and wanted to change to another chemo therapy. I personally think liver is out of control because of removal of Xeloda and Faslodex/Ibrance combo does not work very well on liver. Can you please help me to uderstand why keeping the combo + local treatment on liver (like Y90) would be a bad option? Any comment is appreciated!!!",
