I'm 19 years old and I've had some lumps in my breasts honestly for a while, like, years. I never thought anything of it (due, in part, to the horrible sex education in America), and only recently decided to go to a doctor about it to get some peace of mind. It sort of freaked me out because she said that my birth control dosage is too high (I'm on tri-nessa. Also, note that this isn't my primary physician since I'm out of town for college break). Then, she ordered the ultrasound. The facts about these lumps are that there's one in each breast, the left one being larger. They're both very mobile, which I'm assuming is a good sign. The doctor said she believes I just have fibrocystic breasts, especially considering my age. However, she's just being cautious I suppose. Also, I've had an onset of continuous tenderness in my breasts since starting the birth control two months ago, as well as some slight swelling. I'm already pretty small to begin with, so anything really is noticeable to me. How worried should I be? I'm probably just freaking out because I've been having a lot of health scares recently, but I'm quite an impatient person when it comes to waiting on medical results. Log in to post a reply",
