My Gyn found a suspicious lump back in October, sent for a diagnostic mammogram. That was early November...they did mammogram and ultrasound that day. Said everything looked pretty good. Then I get a letter saying I need an MRI, had that done in early December. Got another letter saying everything looked ok. Then got a call from Dr. office saying I need a follow up in January. Dr. decided a biopsy was needed then. I saw my surgeon on Wednesday 2/6...he recommended the excisional biopsy. My \"little lump\", as I like to call it, is on the left breast, very close to the chest wall. Surgeon feels like it is probably fibroadenoma, but with where it is and they can't see it in any of the images he feels it is best to remove it. I am nervous mostly because I don't know what to expect after the surgery. Unfortunately I have a lot of risk factors...including family history of BC and Ovarian Cancer. I have never been able to get pregnant, and a few others. I am 39 years old, I actually had my first mammogram and ultrasoundÂ at 34, then another at 35. This is the first time I have needed a biopsy...",

I feel like I am dealing with the stress of all this ok...waiting the 5 days for the biopsy was the hardest so far. My shoulders were so tense I was using a heating pad every night. I am not focusing on the outcome of the biopsy really at all. Though I do feel that I am glad it is me going through this rather than one of my sisters...they both have kids, I don't...",

It however did not show up on mammo, ultrasound or mri. Mine too was about 1.5 cm, very close to the breast bone at about 11 o'clock. I am 39 and also have very dense breasts. As others will tell you , 80% of biopsy come back B9. That is what I am focusing on. :)",

Just saw GS today...said it was probably caused by an injury that killed the fat cells, then scar tissue developed. It was larger than we thought, about the diameter of a quarter and about 1/3 of an inch thick. Glad it is out! Now to recover from the excisional biopsy. Still have a follow up with GYNO and a follow up mammogram scheduled as well. They did find fibrocyctic breast disease in the same breast.",

Had a regular checkup in Oct 2012, sent for diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound in Nov 2012, breast MRI in Dec 2012, follow up in January, then excisional biopsy in Feb. My biopsy turned out to be a benign fatty necrosis, thay they could not really see on all the images. When I had my follow up in January my Gynocologist, who has been directing all these tests, told me to cut out caffeine and start taking a vitamin E supplement. Caffeine can cause fibrocystic lumps to swell, and the Vitamin E is supposed to soften the breast tissue. Went back for another follow up on Monday with the GYN, she was very pleased with the reduction in size of another lump we were concerned about and feels the decreased caffeine is helping. So thankfully I don't have to go back until my regular check up closer to the end of the year. I am 39, have never been pregnant, and have a family history of breast and ovarian cancer, as well as some other risk factors.",
