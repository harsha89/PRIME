I was wondering should I have both removed just to call it even. I also wondered if there are special bras for the side with the missing breast. And how will I feel looking down and see one of the girls gone (expression) or looking in the mirror or showering and rub across the flat surface where my breast once was. So many mixed emotions......but what I do know is that you have to make decisions for the greater good (my entire body/life) regardless of what I, my husband, or anyone else thinks. Although, with the exception of my husband, my plan is not to tell people about the surgery (family & close friends) so when they talk to me they look at my eyes (face) and not my chest to see what it looks like have a breast missing. I can sympathize with your dilemma. ",
