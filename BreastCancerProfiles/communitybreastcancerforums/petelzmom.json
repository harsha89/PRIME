A follow up MRI showed 2 small tumors which were IDC in my other breast. I thought I would lose my mind, I had 2 small children to take care of and had lost my Dad and several other relatives to cancer. The surgeon gave me a presc for Xanax, I think i took about 4 total. Once I had my treatment plan laid out I felt like I was in control again. Chemo even just the word would send me into full panic. I had 4 dose dense AC and 4 dose dense taxol, (they did chemo first to shrink the tumors) followed by bilteral mast. and 38 radiation treatments. AC was very flu like for about 2 days each cycle - it was not the horror show that I anticipated or that I had seen my relatives go through. Taxol was much better although i did have some bone pain. The bottom line is that with each SE I visualized those cancer cells dying! I know that right now despair is in the fore front but just believe that we have come so far in cancer research, cancer treatment, and the new meds to manage side effects. You will get through this. Keep coming to this site there is so much support here, i couldn't have done this alone! I have made life long friends here and you will too. Take care and keep the faith Carolyn",

My biggest problem was joint pain, I learned a regimen of 2000 mg of Tylenol for 2 days prior to treatment and 2-3 days after treatment helped considerably. Narcotics did not help at all and I tried several! Neuropathy - tingling feels like when your foot falls asleep, I had a very minor bit of that in my fingers and toes. My taste buds were off quite a bit but that might have been cumulative from all the chemo. My nails got discolored - I did actually lose my big toenail which was painless and really didn't bother me ( I have the UGLIEST TOES) My skin on the bottom of my feet would peel - very painless and I looked at it as the ultimate pedicure ;) What I noticed most was that I felt more \"normal\" A/C really messed me up. I was very tired but clear headed. It was also winter so that didn't help. I hope this helps. Keep checking in this is a wonderful resource! Good Luck and remember you are halfway there!",

I was basiclly left with some form of flap being my only recon. option. That surgery is way too much for me to do. Having expanders put in during my surgery would have been the easiest method and I would have been done. I currently am armed with double protheseis. They are comfortable but a hassle getting dressed and it does impact your pysche. Look at all your options very carefully and get full details regarding surgery.

I also have found non-alcoholic white zinfandel at the supermarket and it is delicous. I have read several studies that conclude that \"women who had one or two drinks a day were 10 percent more likely to get breast cancer than light drinkers. Those who drank more had an even higher risk, leading researchers to say that it is the volume of alcohol consumed that increases the risk.\" I found this on www.thebostonchannel.com/breastcancer I'm not a reformer, but I have gone through a lot because of this disease, and if drinking raises my risks of it returning - the hell with it. That said I am still smoking - about 5 a day. Hope to stop soon. Good luck",

I remember being totally exhausted to the point of shaking if I didn't lay down. It does get better, pamper yourself and rest as much as you can. For the sleep issue I use Tylenol PM or Simply Sleep pills to help me get through the night. I hate taking more pills, but you have to get your rest. Good luck with the radiation treatments. I sailed through 38 plus boosters. My chief complaint was fatigue. Like you I had it at the end of the day. I was able to work all through treatment.

Make sure the dr. you choose is someone you can be comfortable with. I had one dr. who refused to see me because I had rads, the one I did go see insulted me the minute he walked in the room - comments about my weight and the size difference between my breasts. My sister who was with me was ready to kill him! I just shut down and decided to deal with reconstruction later. Lots of regrets now though. Go see as many Dr's as it takes. The state web site has directories of Dr's, and should also note if they have had any disciplinary actions. You can also post on the boards for women in your region to give you some referrals.

Thank God because it was not a well defined tumor and was spread across my breast. The chemo allowed my surgeon to get clean margins during my mascetomy. I had a second cancer in my other breast with several small tumors. They were undetectable during surgery after the chemo. I didn't pay too much attention to the numbers, I was determined to treat this as aggressively as I could. For me that meant 4 rounds of a/c and 4 rounds of taxol, followed by bilateral masc and radiation. I would strongly recommend that you research reconstruction options while you are having treatment. I did not because I was so overwhelmed with the whole process. I am now limited to options due to radiation. I have heard that women have implant/expander process prior to radiation and it had better results. Some of the other options are pretty extensive surgery. I have seen pictures of most of the procedures and they are getting very good results. I am just very reluctant to under go several hours of surgery - too chicken i guess. Is it too late to freeze eggs? Are you still getting your cycles? I entered menopause because of chemo, but was also 44 at the time. Hopefully you are young enough that your body will fully recover. I'm glad you have found this site, I have made several lifelong friends here and found it to be a wonderful resource for all aspects of treatment.
