But I am delaying it until next Wed.28th, I'm taking part in the Dublin City marathon,( all 26 miles of it!!) in aid of The Mater Hospital breast cancer Appeal. So wish me luck girls to get over the finish line, I will be thinking of all of the June ladies as I make my way around the streets of Dublin. Preparing for this has given me great focus,just hope I have trained enough. and by the way,my hair seems to be growing back, very slowly, but there is a faint shadow of very gray, almost white hair !!!!! but its hair, so , happy days , Bye for now, Joan",

However , its great to be getting to the end of it, I met with my Breast surgeon yesterday, and he examined me , went over my charts, and said, \"get your rads out of the way, and then you can put this all behind you , \" he is very pleased with my recovery, and has sceduled me for a routine mammogram in March, so I,m seeing my onc on tues, and hoping he will say the same, On another note entirely, on british tv this morning there was a study done on bc survivors and alchohol consumption, and there is a definite link to recurrence and wine drinking in survivors,especially post menopausal, now I think most women like a glass or 2 of wine, but i have done a bit of research since hearing that on tv, and it seems its the equivalent of throwing petrol on a fire, so I am making a concious decision not to drink wine , only perhaps a glass of champagne on special occasions, there seems to be enough evidence to support this study,It also said very moderate or occasional drinking is fine,   let me know what you think, by the way , it applies to both red and white, and all alchohol in general , so my new motto is LESS IS BEST FOR THE BREAST !!! ",
