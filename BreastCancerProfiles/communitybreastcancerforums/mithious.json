Am waiting on excistional breast biopsy, the one with the wire inserted first? They found a mass with lots of white leading away from it...having problems with memory lately, so sorry can't remember the tech terms the surgen used??? Plus everything is happening very fast!  The at first wanted me to go to Dartmouth??? But it is too far away for me to drive, again, I am alone, far from family.  I do have a friend driving up next week for the biopsy though...sooo grateful for a friend to lean on this time...sounds like the first part will be a bit tough...I am adopted so don't have family history..they didn't do that back when...trying to keep as positive as possible and look of others to talk online with...I truely have no one here...and can't sleep either ;) though am exhuasted...have been trying, but not tonight... Surgen they would call tomorrow or monday to schedule the biopsy...I did look at the mammogram...from what I've read and some stuff she said...wish I could spit it out, grrrr, it was an undefined mass with what looked like \"tentacles\" from the mass in opposite directions...mass was VERY white, other stuff a bit less white...so that's me :)  Most people call me Mith for short  BTW ;) So glad to have found some others in the same place on the road as me...thanks for all you guys have written about and again, please please forgive my memory...I think that's the hardest, so far, to manage...oh this is my first mammoram too.",
