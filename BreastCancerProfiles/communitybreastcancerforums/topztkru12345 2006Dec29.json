ONE TUMOR SRUNK APROXIMATLY 50%, BUT SECOND LOOKS SAME. I CAN CANCEL SURGERY AND TRY TO CURE CANCER OR AT LEAST TO SHRINK THEM MORE. LOOKING FOR HELP TO MAKE MY MIND. IF THE CANCER IS RESPOND AND ARE GETING SMALLER DO I STIL NEED TO REMOVE LUMPS ANY WAY? I READY TO DO IT IF NESSESARY, BUT NOT REALY BELEAVE ITS LESS RISK THEN TRY TO TREAT TUMORE. IS ANYONE CURE OUT OF CANCER WITHOUT THIS HARD PROCEDER? THANK YOU VERY MUCH LIALIA Log in to post a reply",
