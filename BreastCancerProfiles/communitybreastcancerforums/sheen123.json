Since a week I had been experiencing this really weird kind of pain under my right armpit and now since the last two days I feel some thing beneath my right breast near the armpit when I touch that part it feels something hard and it hurts. I don't know what it is and neither do I know much about breast cancer but I am really really scared. Should I get it checked?? Please help me out this thing is really scaring me",
