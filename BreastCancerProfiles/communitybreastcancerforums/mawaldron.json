    "Content": "mawaldron wrote: I am 51 years old and have been having clear nipple discharge in my right breast for some months. My doctor sent me for a mammogram and ultrasound. The imaging was normal, they just showed I had some fat necrosis and a cyst. But, because I reported clear nipple discharge the radiologist suggested further studies. My doctor told me it is possible for there to be a problem in the duct and have normal imaging, so she is sending me to a breast specialist. The discharge isn't very much but it's still there. I am nervous, but I am just wondering what's the likelihood of there potentially being a problem based on this one symptom? My mother and maternal grandmother both had breast cancer as well.
