I'm 50 now.  Later after one of my plastic surgeries I got a staff infection in the donor site.  Leg turned black.  The doctors said I would never be able to run.  The doctor's said I wouldn't have much use for my left arm.  After my last surgery at age 13, I have plenty of use.  In fact, Not only did I run and was able to use my arm.  I joined the Army!!  I had several doctors check me out during the physical and after a while, one doctor said..\"you don't think there is anything wrong with you do you?\"  I said no.  He then said then there is nothing wrong and I served my country. Point is, If a doctor says you can't, start looking for another doctor that says you can.  One that is ready to fight for you and with you and not have you in the grave before you even start fighting. ",

I was burned as a young baby and my chest had a lot of scars  so,as it was,  more scars didn't mean anything to me.  I have had many, many, many surgeries throughout my life and when that doctor kept saying \"and then we would go back and then go back and then go back.\"....... no.  One surgery was all I was going to let him do.     Like everyone else has said, this decision is an individual decision and there really isn't a right or wrong on whether to go with the lumpectomy or not.  The best thing to do is research ALL options and then make the decision that is best for you.    Just my 2 cents worth :-) ",

It was just fat necrosis.  5 days later the doctor himself called to say that the pathologist called him to say that I did have cancer.  I got a copy of my pathology report.  The first pathologist said it was organizing fat necrosis with associated caolcifications.  She then wrote ER/PR and/or Her-2/neu studies are not bing performed onthis case because no carcinoma is present. An second pathgologist looked at this again and did do those test and that is where he found the cancer.  It was imbedded in the fat necrosis.  Can you believe it?  It didn't look like cancer so she didn't test it?????  My doctor said that the lab has two pathologists do the testing.  He said this was very rare and he and the pathologist have been apologizing over and over since last week.  I have an added complicationn due to scars I received from burns when I was six months old.  The only type of radiation I can have is the mammotome.  Doing it on the outside will damage the scars and cause serious wound problems.   I have opted to have a mastectomy.  The doctor said he was going to remove some of the nodes for testing while I'm in surgery and the pathologist is going to look at it then.  Let's just say I'm very, very nervous about the patholgoist testing anything again.  Wishiwere, the pathology report does say 1.9mm.  However, with the first pathologist not doing the job right first time around, I wonder if that is actually correct or not.   Ok, I've rambled and rambled enough. ",
