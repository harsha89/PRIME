Sometimes I think the tightness is going to kill me like its choking me. I hope it will go away. When I take a shower I do massage it and it feels better for like 20 minutes and its back again. I do feel like I'm going nuts. If I ever find an answer I will let you know. Hang in there your not alone. Rosana",
