I wish I had found it pre-surg, but oh well. :) I am 54, and five days post bilateral mastectomy with no recon. Most of my life, I always planned that should I get a diagnosis, this is what I would do. Then my mom got her dx, and I re-confirmed my plan (she had single mastectomy - hated being lopsided and hated her prosthesis. Her surgeon refused bilateral (12 years ago) and she regretted it). But when I spoke to the surgeon, I began to wonder. I was glad I took some time, even though it was stressful, and talked to a bunch of different docs. I got excited about reconstruction when I learned they could do it with belly fat, but when I investigated the procedure, I was pretty sure it wasn't for me.  I have a condition called Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (it's a connective tissue disorder - my collagen is broken) - hypermobility type. It causes chronic pain, similar to fibromyalgia. The plastic surgeon said in 15 years, he'd never had a patient with it (wasn't about to be his first). I don't need to willingly sign on for more pain than I already have.  I wish I had been more able to prepare for surg. You definitely need all the troops to help you! I wish anyone had mentioned that there are things made to handle drains. NO ONE, not the nurses, not the docs, nothing I had found up to this thread. I'm pinning them to the front of an clean white t-shirt (mens 3X, my standard sleep shirt - I have many).  Mommy2six, be sure to tell everyone that you're sensitive to the tape. Don't rely on it being written in your chart, or only your surgeon knowing. They plastered the drains on me with tegaderm, and I have a vicious blister for their troubles. :P  I'm sleeping on my back - a must, because my drains are on my sides. I don't usually do that, and it's a challenge. I didn't have great sleep before surgery. I've used some fabulous hypnosis CDs for pain release and healing.  Oh, and I haven't seen anyone mention butt-wiping. (sorry, I have no shyness, I'm a professional patient) :P Cannot twist, have to bend over and go front to back, from front. For me, a challenge. Also a challenge because that's where the drains are. Be sure to eat your veggies and all the stool softeners. Pain meds are terrific; their side effects, not so much.",
