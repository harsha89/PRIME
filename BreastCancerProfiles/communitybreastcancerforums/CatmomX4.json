The only discomfort was the slight burning when the second numbing shot was injected. I felt virtually nothing during the biopsy. In fact the biopsy procedure was more comfortable than the mammograms and regular ultrasound I've had the past few weeks. Tonight I have just bit of pain...it feels a little like a needle is in my breast, but it's not a sharp pain. I've been icing every twenty minutes or so to minimize swelling and bruising.",
