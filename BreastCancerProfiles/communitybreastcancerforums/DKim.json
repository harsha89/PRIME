Just over a month ago I started feeling a large solid lump in my right breast that was very tender. My breast became swollen and painful. At first I thought it might just be hormonal period stuff but then the area became discolored. I went to my doctor who gave me ibuprofen and antibiotics thinking it was mastitis. This diagnosis seemed weird to me since I am not pregnant and have not nursed in over 10 years. My doctor also sent me for a diagnostic mammogram and a sonogram and had me see a breast specialist because I had to take antibiotics for the issue. The mammogram an sonogram showed that I have very dense breast tissue and several cysts which they said was not a problem. The scans showed no sign of cancer or any tumors. The infection went away but since then I am having that let down type sensation in both breasts. More so in my right breast. And sometimes I have severe shooting pain. It also feels like part of the breast becomes hard or swollen at times. In addition, where my breast meets my under arm I feel an itching sensation. The let down feeling and the pain both emanate from under the arm toward the nipple. I went back to see my GYN and she is sending me back to the breast specialist. She said I will need to get a breast MRI next. One last comment, my GYN says it is not the cause but I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia about 6 months ago. Still getting my head around that diagnosis.
