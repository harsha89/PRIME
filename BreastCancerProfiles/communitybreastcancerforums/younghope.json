I researched on google and found this type of Mammogram and found that it entails a few more pics than a typical screening because of the lump found. The x-rays will be evaluated and read before I leave that day and I will be able to actually speak to the radiologist about his findings and if needed will do an ultrasound that same day and go from there.",

      "Content": "younghope wrote: I posted a message early today and got no responses, but lots of views so thought I would delete it and give it another shot worded differently. I am going for a Diagnostic Mammogram on April 4th for the marble sized hard knot my doctor examined during clinical exam today. I saw my doctor today and was examined in the office. She did rule out it being a cyst, because it does not move and is hard and appears to be attached to the muscle. She seemed very concerned and I am going for a mammogram next week. She said there is a slight possibility it could be a calcification but it was really too big for that and fearing it may be something more serious. However there were no lymph nodes involved that she could tell if I understood her right. She said they would basically give me an answer before I leave my exam next week. She said if it is a calcification they will tell me so and there are no concerns. She also said if they find it to be more than that, they would send me for further evaluation. I am sure many of you have gone through this, my mind is just kinda swirling not knowing. I was told the tests would take 2-3 hours, I am a little confused because I always thought that a mammogram was fairly quick and you were done. What does it all entail that it takes so long? Responses would be appreciated....... Log in to post a reply",

My mind keeps going back to the night that I found the knot about 3 weeks ago. I can still feel my heart skipping beats that very moment, not a good feeling for sure. It is hard for me to get this off my mind and will be a long 13 days for sure.",
