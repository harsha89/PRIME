We encouraged him to ask questions and answered as best we could.  The funny thing was that for him cancer didn't carry all the negative connotations that it does for us. I'm a high school teacher and ended up telling my students when I found out that I was going to miss school for my reexcision and I wanted them to know why. With them, I told them very briefly what I was going through, had cancer, was being treated with surgery, just the basics, but then I opened up the floor to questions.  They all handled it quite well, no snickers, no inappropriate questions, and I think they probably all learned something from the situation as well. For me, honesty is best, the truth comes out in the end anyway.  I'm lucky that my cancer was caught very early and my prognosis was/is good, so being positive is relatively easy. Good luck!",

I'm thinking I may start one for ALL December surgeries, but then I'll have to keep up with both. I'm having a uniMX December 15. I opted to go for the DIEP as the PS said I was an ideal candidate. I'm curious about what two hospitals your PS would recommend for DIEP, Lesley. Our diagnoses sound similar, but my DCIS seems to be spread throughout my breast, 3 lumpectomies and we still couldn't get clean margins, hence the MX.",

The second time it was 1 week post surgery and my BS said that given that it happened both times, it must be related. This time it was exactly the pattern of the prep that they used, so she figures I'm allergic to it (Chloraprep). They won't use it tomorrow. I'm looking forward to a recovery without the itchiness - it was terrible, both times. And if it shows up again, I just might scream. Good luck figuring it out, I hope we got it this time, but the BS did say that the rash looked like an antibiotic allergy, but it was only on the skin where they prepped me for the surgery, so it's a bit odd. I hope it's the prep and we'll be in the clear this time. Sleep off the itch, it was about the only thing that helped me.",

The healing from re-excision was way easier than from the SNB or even the 2 site original excision. Claire - I hope your return to work was pleasant and that you received much love and niceness from your colleagues. Shannon - we all travel different paths, yours different from others but not an easy one either. I hope chemo is as minimally unpleasant as possible Margie - you make the TE's sound like so much fun, I just might have to get some myself!  Rachelvk & Kelleyod - yay for fewer drains, but let's only have to put out metaphorical fires, not real ones, OK? AJ - I'm JEALOUS of a good path report Ginger - sounds like you're healing right up, keep at it. Dawn - hang in there and keep your spirits up, any way that you can Deniseday - 9 hours, oh my. Welcome back on, from what others have said, it sounds like it's harder than it seems to pull the drans out Lisa & Judy67 - boo on delayed path reports, the waiting is hard enough. My BS said she almost called me last night, but decided to just wait until our appointment today and talk to me in person. Ann - glad you're losing drains and I like the eviction notice, although when I first saw that I thought, great just what you need on top of this stuff, but then realized you were evicting the drains. TexasRose2127 - Great news on the lump! And hoping for smooth sailing through the chemo and beyond. mauimom -I was also hoping to finish radiation before 2012, but now that's out of the picture for me. Good luck with the rads. ___ now my update - I wanted to update earlier but just didn't feel up to it, sorry. Had my follow up with the BS today. The path report looked like the previous one, with one focus of DCIS about 2 mm and less than 2 mm from the new margin. She echoed my thought when she said that even though we could do another excision and possibly get clean margins, she would still not be comfortable that we'd gotten all of the DCIS as there seems to be little bits of it (not connected to any other areas) that we keep finding. So it looks like I'm off to mastectomy land.  I'm still pretty shocked about it and have lots of research ahead of me about the type of MX to have. I've been referred to a PS and will meet with him sometime soon, I hope. I suspect that the MX will happen in December sometime.I'm glad that I took the route that I did, as I wasn't ready for a MX back in August when I had my first surgery, but now I think I'm better prepared for it, still not thrilled about it, nor about the recovery/long haul, but I can cope. On the upside, likely no rads for me anymore, unless the MX margins aren't clear, then again, not having clear margins seems to be my specialty. Hey, at least I've not lost my sense of humor yet. Best wishes to you all and I know I've got positive thoughts coming my way too. I'll be checking in here still, of course. Keep healing everyone!!",

We got some VERY good news about someone to cover my AP classes while I'm out and that was a HUGE relief. They are being supportive and understanding and kind, I really couldn't ask for anything more. I've not figured out exactly what I need to do at home or about purchasing anything to prepare for the surgery.

Ginger48  - good to hear from my surgery sister. I'm glad the exchange went well. Keep healing! I guess I'm slowly settling into this next journey. I haven't done a ton of research yet and have yet to sent an appointment with the PS, but did finally get approval and have contacted his office. I'm hopeful for a consult and surgery schedule next week. Once I know, I tend to be a lot better off. Unknown tends to drive me nuts.  My inclination is to do the recon. using my tissue. I know that it means a longer initial recovery, but then seems to be less maintenance, so to speak. I think I'm a good candidate for it my tummy definitely has some extra fat and skin that can go. :) One thing that I'm struggling with a lot is that almost universally people say to me, \"Yay no chemo, yay probably no radiation, yay you're going to live a long happy life.\" While all of those are true, the surgery and recovery are going to suck and there's no way around it. I'm happy that I'm not going to die, but I'm still down because of what's to come and sometimes I feel like my family and friends think that I should just be happy because it could be so much worse. I've been very upbeat and positive through everything so far (3 lumpectomies - 1 w/wire loc in 2 areas, 1 w/SNB) but I'm having a difficult time keeping the all positive attitude right now. I'm scared, I'm worried and I would love to just jump to June 2012 right now. I still haven't had a good cry about any of this, and since my newest diagnosis, it seems that everytime the tears start to come, I'm in a situation where I just can't excuse myself and just let myself cry - It's usually while I'm in the class with my high school students. I'm sorry to go on here at you guys right now and should probably take myself off to the upcoming surgery area, but I suspect that many of you understand exactly where I am, having been there yourselves.

It was pretty good; I was sore and tired each day, hopefully it'll get better over time. I have some pulling in my upper chest and some minor pain along the incision, but the most bothersome is my belly below the breasts and above the incision. It just feels weird. I suspect it'll get better over time. I must be doing better though because DS' soccer team had a scrimmage today vs. siblings and parents and after watching for 3 quarters I couldn't resist so hopped in for the last quarter. I'm going ot be sore tomorrow, but no major ill effects and I think my legs will be more sore than anywhere else, so that's a good sign. I'll probably hold off on stage II until summer so I don't have to worry about how quickly I recover (I'm a teacher). I'm not really looking forward to more surgery, but the PS says it will be MUCH easier than the UMX was, it'll likely be just outpatient, or MAYBE one night in the hospital, we'll see. My good news is that with the MX they found more DCIS, but it was well clear of the margins so I managed to avoid radiation and chemo. After 4 surgeries I've gone through plenty, and am thankful to get to skip the other treatments. OK, I've gone on for long enough. Take care all. -Judy",

I figured it was just a normal muscle thing and would go away - I pinched a nerve or slept on it funny or something.  I've used Advil some, tried muscle relaxants (they just made me want to go to sleep but didn't help the pain or make it get better), heating pad, a bit of massage (but DH says he can't feel a knot there), and such. Well it's still not better yet. I've swum with it and it hurts off and on, I skipped swimming last week but it still hasn't gotten better.  It hurts when I look left or right and my range of motion of my head seems less than usual. It's worst 1st thing in the morning sometimes making me not want to lift that arm (it's on the opposite side from my UMX) and it's hard to get up sometimes. (I'm only 41, BTW) Of course, after 2 weeks of this, my brain finally says, \"maybe it's BC related, maybe it's mets.\" I rationally think that's an insane explanation. I can't get my brain to shut up about it though. I also now worry that every ache and pain will automatically become BC related in my head so I have to worry about it. UGH. I may e-mail my MO just so that she can tell me I'm crazy, might shut my brain up, I don't know. Any sage words of advice or anyone want to kick me in the head? Ha ha ha! Edited to add: This started before I started on tamoxifen so I can't blame that. Also, I've tried a different pillow, two pillows, one pillow, to no avail.   Thanks. -Judy",

Kind of odd, but the hospital in Santa Monica is definitely undergoing changes - they've now taken down the \"old\" part but the new part is up and running just fine. Anyway, I hope everyone's well and I'm looking forward to getting surgery over and done, but not really looking forward to the recovery. Looks like I just might have a drain again UGH!

I'll get a lift and reduction on the other side and probably a bit of a reduction on the recon side, it's a big D or maybe DD, and I wanted either a big C or small D, he left room just in case I was going to get radiation, which I don't need. I'm to see the PS again in 2 months and the BS in 6 months.  They're not 100% sure that I'm allergic to the clyndamycin(sp?) because I had it for all 4 surgeries, but only had the reaction with surgery #4. Since I have more surgery coming up, I'll probably get allergy testing done to see if we can figure out what it is. FUN! (NOT!) I got back my driving privileges and am now allowed chocolate (but was cautioned to not overdo it - as if there is such a thing with chocolate! HA!). I also can have full use of my arm back as well. I guess everything looked good today. BS agreed with MO that I should have mammo and MRI, yearly, 6 months apart. So in June I'll have a mammo, and then the following December the MRI and so on. They took off the last of the steristrips at the BS/PS today, the DIEP skin is a different color from the surrounding breast skin. The incisions are all healing nicely. The PS removed the leftover staple - not sure why it was there, but it was. And then he wants me to keep the drain holes moist and use neosporin on them until they fully close, there's also one other area on the ab incision that nees a bit more healing too. So I left the office with 3 band aids and that's it. I suspect that if I asked about going back on Monday, he'd let me, but I think I'd rather wait until I'm feeling closer to 100% before I do. I'm definitely still healing up. This has gotten long so I'll end here. -Judy",

I bet your extra drainage is a result of the exercises you did and the fluid leaving also left some dead space and hence ths sloshing. My only major work/disability issue is that someone let the form get buried on her desk and so didn't sent it back in a timely manner, it's now been filed, so hopefully it'll get processed sooner than later.

My update - my back is a million times better, thank goodness. Was just a lingering muscle thing, but it took over 2 weeks to go away. Irritating. I've been on Tamoxifen for 2.5 week and I *think* I'm having hot flashes, but I'm 41 so I've never had them before. They're not BAD by any means though. I'm overwhelmed at work but have asked for and been given something of a repreive on a deadline, that I may still hit, but it takes the pressure off at least. Some of my colleagues (one in particular) is behaving poorly and putting our future happiness at risk and all because of some assumptions that I don't think will come to pass. We'll see though. Luckily a few of us are on the same page about it so we sit around at b*^&ch about it together, but even with blowing off steam, it stresses me. I also think I might be mildly sick, must get more rest. The whole family is excited, we're going to the season opener for the LA Galaxy (MLS team) on Saturday! OK, I should head off to bed shortly. Take care and healthy and happy wishes to all.",

For the DIEP in December, the abs hurt more than the foob, for this one (he did a foob reduction and a bit of lipo on the side near the foob and revised the ab scar) the boos seems to be hurting more than the ab. I think the local pain meds are starting to wear off in the ab area and it's getting just a little achey.  I did have a leakage problem this time though. In recovery I noticed some blood beneath the foob so we wiped it up and the nurse put some gauze on, I put my shirt on (decided to forgo the bra - luckily) and they got me headed out. When we got down to the entrance my shirt felt damp and when I looked it had gotten blood on it, so we had to go all the way back upstairs and get it taken care of. The nurse paged the PS and he told her that it was fine and not unusual - wish he would have told the nurses! But once we put another piece of gauze on, it settled down and I'm fine now. I did have to wear a hospital gown home, as I didn't think that showing up to pick DS up from his playdate today in a bloody shirt would be a good idea. HA! Bogie - I hope you're resting MORE comfortably than I am, and I'm pretty comfortable! Now onward we go - oh, it just dawned on me that I might have to sleep on my back tonight - YUCK!",

Still, the stress of dealing with it can be a pain and it's being studied whether or not stress can cause BC too. I'm actually participating in such a study through UCLA. I'm curious to see how it goes because they're supposedly going to ask about your life the year previous to the BC diagnosis, but my MO says my BC (slow growing and not terribly aggressive) was probably around for 5 years before we discovered it during my very first mammogram. We'll see how this goes. I want to go bra shopping too, but I have to wait, I'm only 3 weeks post op so the swelling is still there. I got approval from the PS to take the steristrips off so did so last night, lots of peeling skin underneath, but no open wounds or anything - one would hope not after 3 weeks. My arealas are not terribly round right now, wonder if that will improve too. Pre BC I was a 34/36 G/F, but asked to be reduced to a C, I suspect the end result is somewhere in the middle. I'm looking forward to wearing real bras again and not just big sports bras. We have a place out here that all they do is fit bras properly, I'll go there when it's time.

Because of that I had surgery in April (spring break), July (summer break) and then have a procedure scheduled for December (winter break). The appointment on Wed. will be with my PS to see what he thinks we can do at the next procedure and what that procedure will be. I hope he'll tell me he can flatten out my areola. The non cancer side got a lift and reduction in July and the thing that bugs me the most is the raised areola, especially since the DIEP side will be just a tatoo for the areola. We'll see what he says. My MO gave me permission to take a 2 week break from Tamox to try and determine if it's the cause of my mental troubles. I feel less sharp, more disorganized, lacking focus, I'm not as good a teacher as I was before. So once the stress decreases from having to do quarter grades and comments, I'll take the 2 week break and see what happens.

Have any of you, as healing progressed, felt pain from the abdominal incision this far out (it's healed up nicely, with just a couple of spots that aren't totally closed up yet). I'm wondering if it's maybe the nerves figuring things out as opposed to anything bad. It's not so painful that I think I should call the PS or anything, but I'd kind of like to know whether it's at all normal or it's unusual. In other news, I got a call from my PCP, they got the authorization to see the allergist (to figure out what the heck I'm allergic to from surgery), so I called to make an appointment only to be told that this particular allergist is on leave and they don't know when s/he'll be back. FUN! And then had to call the state disability office and ask why my disability benefits were denied as my employer is only paying me for my sick time and then disability should pick up. Was told that they sent paperwork to my employer on Jan. 6 but it's not be sent back yet - UGH! I wonder whose desk it's sitting on. Aargh! And I had to call probably a dozen times just to even get the honor of sitting on hold for 15 minutes. WHEEEEE!! At least there was yummy homemade lasagna for dinner tonight. (and homemade cookies for dessert too) OK, enough whining from me, time to go tuck DS into bed. But if any of you have any insight into my first part of this post, I'd love to hear it - if I don't hear much here, I'll probably go post it in the DIEP 2011 thread. Thanks!!",

I made it through today OK, but didn't do that much actual teaching, mostly reconnecting with the students, letting them look at their final exams, letting them bitch about the sub, and tell me what they DID do while I was out. I'm a little bit sore today in the abs (not where the incision is, but up higher). Right now I think I'm feeling more mentally unprepared than physically unprepared, once I get some lesson plans written, I'm sure I'll be OK, but right now I don't have anything written up so I feel totally adrift. I think I'm awfully tired too, curling up in a ball sounds good to me right now. I hope the rest of you are all feeling good. I sent off my Tamox. rx, now get to wait for it to show up and then start it. I'm hoping I'm one of the no symptoms people. One other question. Before dx I was doing Weight Watchers. I feel like I'm ready to start up again, I'm almost 7 weeks post DIEP and I don't think I'm going to do stage 2 until summer, so I have some time to lose more weight. The PS told me that I shouldn't diet post DIEP as my body is healing, but I feel like now I probably can, anyone else been told anything about dieting while recovering, especially almost 2 months out? -Judy",

I had a coughing fit a few days ago and came out of it in pain. I don't know my Ki67 score or my %ER+, but I'm pretty sure it's quite low. I was first told I was ER- and  PR+ but that was later revies to weakly ER+ and PR+. My MO actually looked at slides with a pathologist to see that I was indeed ER+. I kind of wish I knew these, but they don't seem to be in the report I received either from genomic health or the pathology report from the surgery, I may see if I can get these specific results too. I also survived my first week back at school and other than being tired, I'm OK. Getting anything done is harder, my focus was crappy, but I did it, and have at least some stuff planned for next week too. I hope you all have a lovely weekend. -Judy",

Some friends brought over dinner last night and we chatted, ate, played a game, it was probably just what I needed. I also was able to sleep on my side part of the night - that also proabably helped. Hopefully things will improve from here. I'm trying to stay up, but in some ways I feel like I've finally hit the wall. I was diagnosed in early August and have trooped through 5 surgeries now, I'd like to put this all behind me, but I'm not done yet, still more surgeries to come. Sheesh. OK, sorry to dump on you guys, but I know you've got my back and appreciate it! Most people really don't understand. They say that I look great or that they would have done what I did in my place, but they haven't been through it and don't really fully understand it. It's a lot and I've taken it all so far pretty well, I think. But it's just finally gotten to me, I think. Thanks for being here and for reading/understanding. I hope that everyone is enjoying a lovely Easter with family and/or friends. We're going to a friend's house in a little while for his totally secular Easter party (with enough chocolate to \"choke a horse\") and then out to dinner with my in-laws. And then back to work from Spring Break tomorrow. -Judy",

I had 3 wires placed, two via mammogram and one via ultrasound. After the two via mammo, the doctor asked how I was doing and I said I felt a little light headed so they had me lay down on the floor right there in the mammo room and said that they did a lot of their work on the floor. I felt kind of silly. One thing that will help a lot is to not look down, don't look to see what they're doing, just let it happen, either go to your happy place or find a spot on the wall to stare at. Because the hospital doesn't have digital screens in the OR that we were in, they printed out the mammo films for the doc. I remember seeing them in the OR when they wheeled me into the OR, and then after surgery, they gave me the films. I now have films of what I lovingly called my \"frankenboob\" Wow, that surgery seems forever ago, it was August 23rd. Anyway, if you want more info on the wire locs, ask away, many of us have had them already. -Judy",

But either he's delusional, his patients seem to fare better than most, or the people that we hear from on BCO generally have a harder time than most. He told me that I'd be able to sleep in bed, propped on a few pillows, that I'd have full use of my arms (to lift them over my head etc) before I leave the hostpital 3 or 4 days after surgery, that by day 3 in the hospital I'll be up and about and wondering why I'm still there, that I'll be wanting to do stuff other than lie in bed - use the laptop and/or read a book etc... I guess only time will tell. As it's getting closer and closer I'm getting more and more nervous. Today's appointments increased my stress level and anxiety a fair amount, it's really happening and SOON. I also got the pre-approval for the surgery in the mail today. OK, deep breaths and I should probably go distract myself, I have grading to do.  Best to all having surgery this week. We'll hear from you on the flip side.",

For me, after just about every doctor appointment or other important step, I've written up what went on, and about my feeling about much of it as well. It really has helped me process what I\"m going through and also has allowed me to think through things a second time, and this time more slowly and thoroughly. I do e-mail what I've written to those intersted and post it to an online blog that only my friends can access. I am a science teacher and writing is not something I've ever thought of as a strength, but through this I've heard from so many people that they appreciate me doing this and enjoy reading it. Not only do they understand better what I'm going through, but I have also helped demystify this whole cancer thing for them.

I was seen a lot in the hospital, PS rounds 2x per day except on Sunday (and maybe Saturday), I think it was. PS saw me daily except on Sunday and then wasn't able to get by before my discharge on Monday, but called to let me know that. Oh, and I asked about the binder wrapped around my middle and he said that it pushes the skin and fat layer (that gets moved up and down for the DIEP procedure) up against the abdominal wall (muscle) and it helps the two stay in contact and heal together better. Anyone have suggestions for showering while keeping the drain sites dry? He said I can shower but have to keep them dry, but I'm not exactly sure how to do that. I'm open to suggestions.

He took sutures out of the DIEP breast (that did kinda hurt in spots). He also took out the breast drain (no more boob tube - DH said). He cleaned the ab incision, which looks kind of ugly right now and it did bleed a bit in the middle. The sensation was the strangest thing, it felt like he was touching two totally separate parts of me as he ran the cotton down the incision. My nerves haven't figured this whole thing out yet, hopefully they will, eventually. If my other two drains slow down to 20-25 mL daily I get to have them out. That'll either be next week Thursday or the following week after the new year. The PS commented that I heal quickly and at one point he made some comment about it being 2 weeks after surgery, it's only been 1 week + 1 day. I guess things are healing up well. We then did a little bit of shopping (one store NOT in a mall) and then had Chinese for lunch. We came back home and I was thinking I'd nap, but not at this point, it's too late now I think, if I'm going to sleep tonight. I've found that my energy is definitely lower than it was before surgery, I'm sure it'll come back though, eventually. The PS visit seemed good, he seemed happy with everything and wanted to know how I felt about the size, it's so hard to tell right now, we'll see how things settle out. Take care all!! -Judy ",

This is by far the easiest recovery for me, I had two lumps taken out with my first lumpectomy and then the re-excision and SNB the second. This one was just a simple single margin re-excision. I'm not using the Napoleon pose that I used with the previous two, right arm crossed over my belly, just below the breasts. My BS told me that if I were 70, she would have sent me on to radiation after the first re-excision, btu that I'm not and at my age we want to do our best to get everything out.  I get it, but still felt a little like the boy who cried wolf when letting people know that I was haveing ANOTHER surgery. I received much support, but *I* felt weird about it. I have not had any chemo, so I don't know your particular situation, but I did think about whether or not I should take a leave from work (I'm a high school teacher) and decided that it would be a bad idea for me to do so, I'd just sit at home bored and miserable, worrying about cancer, but everyone is different and you have to figure out what's right for you. Not an easy decision. Dukes_Up: I will be devistated if I don't have clean margins this time and will likely opt for a mastectomy. Follow up with the BS is on Wed. so the waiting game is upon me, must keep busy, but I'm back to work on Monday, so busy shouldn't be too much of a problem.

      "Content": "Nov 10, 2011 05:35AM - edited Nov 10, 2011 07:13AM by CookieMonster Well, so much progress in this little time. I don't know how you all keep up with everyone. I can barely keep up with myself, my DS, my DH, and my job, I'm trying to read, but the brain seems to contain only so much. AthabascanWarriorPrincess: I've had three lumpectomies all with dirty margins (DCIS), so now I'm going to have a MX. I have been told that the likelihood of needing rads after MX is low, but I keep joking that since I'm the queen of dirty margins, I won't be too surprised to find that they come back dirty agian and I need rads after MX. So my heart goes out to you, I hope the rads are easy compared to all the stuff leading up to it. Here's my update: We met the PS yesterday (got auth. on Fri. called Mon. and he somehow managed to find a way to see me on Tues.). He laid out the options, then took a look at my breasts and stomach and said I was the perfect candidate for DIEP. (I wasn't sure if I should be insulted or not - ha ha) Having done my research, DIEP was my choice if I had a choice. So no complaints there. He has a very high success rate with DIEP and only very rarely has to turn a DIEP into a muscle sparing free TRAM surgery. I'll be having a unilateral MX with DIEP on the right side at UCLA. He measured a few things about my breasts and took some pre-photos. He and my BS had tentatively set aside Dec. 15 for the surgery, pending my approval and insurance authorization. That date sounds good to me so we've essentially booked it, pending the insurance approval, of course. I'm nervous about it all, having NEVER undergone anything like this. I'm nervous about being under for so many hours, about the pain and other trauma to follow, etc... But I am glad to be getting to have the type of surgery that I want. I e-mailed my BS to keep her in the loop today and asked about deciding on breast size and who should help with that. Turns out I should have probably been more direct with the PS about my questions about it. I'm not an expert and I don't want to do anything that won't look good on my frame. I'm 5'1\" and wasn't sure what size the reconstruction should be. She answered some other questions and forwarded my e-mail on to the PS who called this evening to answer my questions. I'm more comfortable and happier now that we've talked. I'm going from a G cup to  C cup, so I'll be unbalanced for a little while between stages 1 and 2, but will get the left side reduced to match in stage 2. I think I've probably babbled on long enough at you guys tonight, I'm having trouble focusing on much today, but should probably at least TRY to go get some quizzes graded or something. I may have some questions about my upcoming MX and this seems like a great place to ge them answered, so many of you having just been through MX surgery. Actually if you've read this far and have had DIEP or TRAM or similar surgery, how long was your recovery? I guess it's soon to ask for some of you, but the BS said 6-8 weeks, the PS said 4 weeks. I'm thinking of telling work 6 weeks (2 of which will be winter break) so only 4 weeks of school missed. I teach high school so I won't be having to physically interact with the kids on much, but it's still an active job, on my feet etc... TIA!",

Anyway, take care and let us all know how it goes, when you're up to it. Survivor - I've heard so many of the \"let me know what I can do\" and gotten very few of the \"I'm doing X for you\" I think most just don't know what to do and I know that I'm not good at asking either. Sometimes I wish people would just step up and do stuff, but then again, I don't feel like we need a lot done right now, maybe after the MX I'll feel differently. Tomorrow's my bone density scan, not worrisome at all, just eating up more time and right now I can use all the time I can get. Take care all!",

For the DIEP in December, the abs hurt more than the foob, for this one (he did a foob reduction and a bit of lipo on the side near the foob and revised the ab scar) the boos seems to be hurting more than the ab. I think the local pain meds are starting to wear off in the ab area and it's getting just a little achey. I did have a leakage problem this time though. In recovery I noticed some blood beneath the foob so we wiped it up and the nurse put some gauze on, I put my shirt on (decided to forgo the bra - luckily) and they got me headed out. When we got down to the entrance my shirt felt damp and when I looked it had gotten blood on it, so we had to go all the way back upstairs and get it taken care of. The nurse paged the PS and he told her that it was fine and not unusual - wish he would have told the nurses! But once we put another piece of gauze on, it settled down and I'm fine now. I did have to wear a hospital gown home, as I didn't think that showing up to pick DS up from his playdate today in a bloody shirt would be a good idea. HA! Now onward we go - oh, it just dawned on me that I might have to sleep on my back tonight - YUCK! Sending positive vibes forward to those who need it much more than i do now. Off to the MO tomorrow for a follow up. -Judy",

Ice packs are my friends right now as the boob is starting to get a bit achy. Ginger- I'm glad yours went well!  I also have the sort throat and rough voice too. For me that's probalby the worst pain, so I'll take it.  Good surgery to those upcoming and good healing to those on the other side.",

Some costs are going up (copays for office visits) and some are going down (in and out patient surgery). DH joked that we should postpone the surgery until Jan. 1 as the cost would be half of what it'll be Dec. 15. fitzdc - Good luck with your decision. I've found that these things are just so personal, everyone has a differnt inclination and feeling about it. And no one is more right than the next person. I hope surgery turns out just how you want it to. Ginger - Glad you're getting in out of they way in 2011. I'll have more in 2012 (stages 2 & 3 of DIEP). But hopefully those will be minimal compared to the doozey in December. Gosh I'm still so nervous about it, and it feels like it's just not getting any closer (I know that it actually is, but it doesn't FEEL like it is). And then I look at all of the work that I need to do and think I'll never get it all done before I have the surgery. I'm a mixed bag of emotions, one moment I'm fine and the next I'm feeling overwhelmed. Sorry to vent, but I gotta do it somewhere. How's everyone else hanging in. Are you keeping busy? Too busy?

AussieKate - I had lumpectomy with SNB for my second surgery, the pain wasn't bad, the armpit was worse than the breast incision. Have ice packs handy if you can. We ended up buying a case of them online and have gone through more than half of them (then again I've had 3 surgeries already). But I figure with an 8 year old, having ice packs around isn't a bad thing anyway. I am also currently a G cup (well on the unaffected side - the surgery side is now smaller) and am going with a C+ or maybe a D with my reconstruction and then will have the other side reduced and lifted in stage 2. I've never really been bugged by my breasts but they are large and I'm looking forward to seeing what they'll be like after the surgeries.",

I slept in my bed last night instead of on the couch and it was fine, but I need to move the clock to somewhere that I can see it, so I don't have to ask DH what time it is - can't roll over to check it.  I'm starting to get the weighty feeling in my belly, but it sounds like it's not unusual. My BS called yesterday with the pathology - exactly what I would have requested if I could have it custom written for me. They did find more DCIS, just a little bit, and it was well clear of the margins, so, the MX was a good idea but I won't need radiation! From here, it's stages 2 & 3 of reconstruction, starting on tamoxifin and then some careful watching - not exactly sure how the MX changed the careful watching part of my TX. I think I need to go find some breakfast. Have a good day all and positive vibes out to those in surgery today.",

We uncovered it for my shower today and it looks kind of ugly too, hopefully it'll all heal ok in the end. For those contemplating a shower with drains, I took the advice of many to hang the bulbs from a conference lanyard around my neck - just to get them out of the way and so they weren't hanging from the holes. I then took saran wrap and paper tape and taped the top of a piece of saran wrap above the drain tube and then down the sides on both sides and it pretty much kept the drain sites dry. Next time I think I'd put the drains hanging down my back instead of my front, but other than that it all worked pretty well. -Judy",

It's not as bad as it could be but I think I'm going to be uncomfortable for 3-4 days at least. This afternoon when in the restroom I noticed some red spots on my thighs and wondered if I should worry, but then I put it out of my head. We had a busy afternoon and evening - had to pick up DS from an overnight then go to my aunt and uncle's house for a late Hanukkah celebration with my cousin who's in from out of town. When we got home and I took off my bra, I felt itchy and have a rash.  Some background - my UMX (2 weeks ago) was surgery #3 for me. 2 weeks after surgery #1 I developed a VERY itchy rash and the BS said she didn't think it was associated with surgery as it took so long for it to develop. After surgery #2 I developed another rash but a bit sooner, and BS noticed that the area matched the area that they had prepped in for surgery with chloraprep, so she decided that I was allergic to Cholraprep. Surgery #3 they used Betadine instead of Chloraprep and I was fine. Now today, 2 weeks after surgery I'm developing a rash. I had the on call doc. paged and he said to stop the anti-biotics and to take Benadryl and see how I am in the morning. I'm itchy now and seem to be getting itchier - UGH! I'm even itchy under the binder- which is not fun. I think I'm going to go get ready for bed, take that Benadryl and climb into bed. At least with the Benadryl I'll probably sleep really well tonight. I'm so irritated by this, it is NOT what I want to be dealing with right now. WHINE WHINE WHINE! Sorry about the whiny, but that's how I\"m feeling right now. Goodnight all.",

My BS told me that they would not be doing the biopsy during surgery on the sentinel nodes because recent research has shown that taking more nodes, even if they're positive, does not improve prognosis, so they just take the sentinel nodes and send them out to pathology. Sentinel nodes are what they take first and then if they take more it's called an axillary node dissection. My BS doesn't do axillary node dissections anymore so I didn't have to deal with that, but she still took a BUNCH of nodes, mostly because there was a group of super tiny ones.

I'm doing online only, so no meeting, but I do OK with it that way.  My week, food wise, has been OK, but not great. I did lose 1.4 pounds this week. And I've once again reminded myself of the not so new info - if you exercise, the weight comes off faster. Even after a not so great food week - I did get exercise 3 or 4 days this week and lost. Next week I'll hope to do even better. We'll see. I hope you're all doing well and look forward to more updates. I got my 1st bottle of Tamoxifen in the mail today and am definitely NOT excited to start it. DS has a soccer tournament out of town this weekend so I think I'm going to wait and start it on Monday when we're in town. Take care all. -Judy",

And not a single person was able to adequately explain to me WHY they had done that. It's common, cheap, and is not in high demand on the street (that I know of). And some of their own literature lists it as a Tier 1, which only confuses things. WHY is it listed as Tier 1 and being treated at Tier 4, which one is it, and again, nothing but round about answers and people telling me that I need to talk to OTHER people to get answers.

For the 3rd surgery they used Betadine and no allergic reaction. Then for the UMX/DIEP I again had an allergic reaction. The PS and BS both swear up and down that they used Betadine. Maybe it was the 14 hour exposure that caused it, or maybe someone prior to them entering the room used Chloraprep, who knows. Surgery #5 was just a week ago, so I'm still waiting to see if I react to the betadine or not. I was abundantly clear to everyone that they should use betadine only, hopefully it actually stuck. The allergic reaction is MISERABLE! Just today I got a bit itchy on the ab scar, but it feels more like healing itches not allergy itches, hopefully it'll stay that way!! Of course sitting here writing and thinking about the allergic reaction has gotten me all itchy - STUPID BRAIN! $1675 damage to my car. It should be done in a week. Neither DS nor I seem to have been injured still, so that's good, at least. Neither of us saw or heard it coming. I'm very glad that tomorrow is Friday - although we have a busy weekend planned.

They cut a circle around the areola & nipple, then cut from that a line down underneath the breast. I suspect he took out a wedge of skin from that vertical cut, took out some of the tissue, cut the areola piece smaller (he said my areola was bigger than most so I okd reducing it's size too). Then pull the two sides of the vertical cut together and put the smaller circle of skin nipple areola back to fill the hole. Does that make sense, it's hard to describe, but I can picture it all in my head. If you take a circle of fabric then cut out a circle from the middle of it leaving a ring, then cut out a wedge from the wing, pull the two ends of the ring together, the cut out circle area gets smaller, so cut some off of the cut out circle and put it back in - I think that's basically what he did, but on a 3D shape instead of 2D, same idea though. Moonflower - sorry you're unemployed. I'd check to see if them terminating you is legal - it may be in some states and depending on the size of the company, but it might not be, definitely worth checking.

I hope surgery in the new year goes smoothly!! Teresa -  I'm glad everything got figured out and that your surgery is a go. I found the latissimus dorsi surgery interesting to read about. I hope it goes well for you. Mamabear - Welcome! I'm sorry you're with us, but we'll all stand strong together (or recline strong together?). Before my first BC surgery in August the only ones I had had were wisdom teeth removal 20+ years ago with a BAD reaction to general and C-section for DS when I wasn't asleep. So in August I was VERY nervous about the surgery. Now that I've had three, I'm not as nervous about them, but every time I think about being under for 8-10 hours (I'm having MX with DIEP), it makes me nervous all over again. Luckily there are lots of people there to watch over us and to make sure that we stay safe. The procedures that they're doing are all well researched and safe, so hopefully we'll all come through with flying colors. Hang in there and if you have questions, ask as many of us have been through surgery before and some even through your particular surgery. -Judy",

My BS did not do the frozen section on mine because whether the nodes were positive or negative wouldn't have affected the surgery that day, so there was no point to doing it, she just sent them on to pathology for a full analysis. If your surgeon does axillary node disections if you're node positive, it's good to know right then and there, but my BS says that research says that axillary node diesctions are no longer thought to be helpful, so she doesn't do them. Hence the week long wait for me to get pathology results. Hope this helps. -Judy",

Congrats on your clear pathology! Ginger - congrats (again) on the clear pathology! I'm settled at home now. Bedtime is coming soon. I think I'm going to try my first night with no pain meds, we'll see how it goes. And sadly, I was so happy to poop today without the stool softeners maybe I won't need them with the limited pain meds I've needed. I think that I've taken 3 percoset since midday yesterday (one right when they took me off the pain pump, one at bedtime and one for today's ride home). We keep getting food given to us for the holidays and an awful lot of it is cookies, mostly with chocolate. And I CAN'T HAVE ANY CHOCOLATE!! :( So far no chocolate is the hardest because it's around and I LOVE it. We got home from the hospital to a box on our front step that contained a Ghiradeli gift basket. DS said he'd save some for me, I responded that it was not going to get opened until I could eat chocolate, there was plenty of other chocolate around and this was a gift for me. Sometimes you just gotta defend your chocolate, right? OK goodnight all.",

I think that I've escaped the constipation monster so far - one advantage of my apparently high pain tolerance. DS came downstairs about 30 min after I woke up and is just sort of hanging out doing some independent stuff and keeping me company this morning. He's such a sweetheart. He went into the kitchen to get breakfast started for himself and came back into the family room and said to me in the saddest little voice, \"I guess we can't share the french toast this morning.\" I asked why not and he told me because it was the chocolate stuffed french toast. I took pity on the kid and told him he could have it. Can't be a mean mommie all the time, can I? Today is a designated mellow day for me. One question - my hands and arms seem to be much less swollen and almost back to normal but my feet and legs are still pretty swollen, is this normal? I found that crouching down releived my lower back pain but my legs started to hurt a bit when I did so because of the swelling. Things will eventually get back to \"normal\" right? I have a friend who had the same tummy tuck part of the surgery to repair her abdominus rectus, think I'll talk to her about her recover too, I suspect the boob's just fine and the difficulty is the ab. recovery. EveBarry - the two common pain meds are vicodin and percoset and as Ginger said, only difference is that one has tylenol with the oxycodone and one does not. I have vicodin left from lumpectomy #1 and the dr. prescribed percoset for UMX so I have both at home and can pick and choose if I want, hopefully I can avoid them all. The only med I have to take is the antibiotic, but it's not keflex (that might be what I was on in the hospital via IV), it's clindamycin. I've also got the stool softener and anti nausea meds, but hope I won't need them and so far so good. Good luck to all the surgery sisters today - there are lots of you. You'll do fine. You have lots of us pulling for you. -Judy",

I had a UMX on the right and normally sleep on my left side. Anyone know if I'm OK to sleep on the left side? Thanks!! Having these two out didn't hurt nearly as much as the boob tube one did. It felt weird as the internal part slid across my belly on the inside, but they didn't hurt much. I'm glad to be rid of them though. They weren't THAT much of a pain for me, but I'm just as happy to have them gone. Now I'm without any extras right now, pretty much (unless you count the binder, but it's more of a girdle than anything else). In fact the NP today said I could switch to a girdle, but I don't own one so I'll stay with the binder. Janie-bug - a 2 Oncotype is very good. Unless you have other mitigating factors, that number would definitely indicate no need for chemo. Mine was a 14 and I didn't need chemo either. The lower the number the less likely you are to need chemo. I hope that sleeping will be good tonight with the drains out. DS is off at a sleepover so it's just DH and me tonight, he might even get some snuggles, we'll see. :) Have a good evening all. -Judy",

But here I am, at last, sorry to keep you all waiting. As I knew from before, margins are clear, nodes (from Oct. surgery) were clear as well and Oncotype was low (14) so I'm still in the no rads no chemo camp. I asked if endocrine therapy (ET) was necessary even though I had the UMX. The MO said that while all of the BC is gone from the breast, the ET is to take care of any cancer cells that might have escaped and gone elsewhere. Becuase if they set up shop elsewhere, THEN you're in big trouble. She also said that if it had only been DCIS, then no ET would be necessary, but since there was a bit of IDC, we do the ET. I asked when I had to start and she said that it was a marathon not a sprint so whenever I was ready I could start, but it didn't need to be right away, I could wait until I felt closer to 100%. She gave me a few options: Tamox. or Luprin (sp?) injections monthly with an AI, or ooph with an AIl. AI is usually used with post menopausal patients, but if we supress estrogen (or remove the ovaries), then I could do AI as well. I think that Tamox is my best bet. She also said that the tamox or other treatments lower my chance of mets (cancer settling somewhere else) by about 50% which seems pretty good to me. I asked who was in charge of my TX and BC care, it's her and I asked about mammo/MRI and she said that yearly on both would be good. I've got dense breasts and so mammo misses about 15% of BC in dense breasts, but that MRI helps reduce that 15% to much lower. She also mentioned that my last blood draw (while I was in the hospital) showed very low hemoglobin. It is not unusual, but she wants me to get another blood draw just to make sure that it's come back up. I'll do that next week on Friday when I have to go see the GYN anyway (for Tamox. screening). It was a good visit. Oh, she also did a breast exam. Getting to the breast took some work, I had on a button down shirt, the abdominal binder, a t-shirt for under the binder and a bra. Ha! She said that the breast looked amazing being only 3 weeks out from surgery. I think that covers it all. It sounds like Carol Ann and I heard much of the same information from our MOs Have a great evening and weekend! -Judy",

Clearly it didn't show it all as I had 3 lumpectomies and didn't get clear margins so finally had the UMX. I only learned about the IDC after the first lumpectomy as it was small (a line of IDC about 1.1 cm long) and in the middle of the area of DCIS. I only had an ultrasound with my very first mammogram and they couldn't really see anything with it, then one with the wire placement on the OTHER area that the MRI found, but that was it.

Interesting what different PS's have to say on the subject. On a totally different note, I accidentally inhaled at the wrong time tonight and got some liquid down my wind pipe causing a coughing fit. Even after almost 7 weeks, that was no fun at all. My DIEP stomach didn't like it - not at the incision but above there, that's been the most tender area lately anyway. It sounds like I'm lucky I had a UMX and so can have BP and blood draws on the other side at least. It's my preferred side anyway. I survived the swim this morning, it was a bit uncomfortable, especially when I stretched out the right arm (DIEP side) so I tried to take it easy on that side. I'm glad that I did it although I'm slower and more out of shape than the last time I swam. I'll keep at it, and I'm sure it'll get better. I may try to start other exercise too, it would be good for me, after all. Finding the time is the biggest hurdle for me. Be well all. -Judy",

Sounds like my Dec. sisters are all keeping busy. Wishing you all good things, in whatever form they come in. Today was my 3rd Weight Watchers weigh day and I've lost 3 pounds in 3 weeks. I'm happy with that progress. I've seen that exercise really seems to make a big difference for me, I haven't been eating perfectly, but have been getting more exercise. I bet a week of better eating AND exercise will drop even more weight. And in other awesome news, DH has a job offer in hand today!!! It's about darn time. He's been without since the crazy women who hired him let him go (it was for the best anyway) about a year ago, I think. The commute will not be great and schedules will be more difficult, but overall it's a good thing and in 3 months he'll get insurance (probably better than the policy he has now-paid for out of pocket). We took 113 Freshmen to the Griffith Observatory today, it was fun but I'm now POOPED! My pedometer is over 13,000 steps today too. And I'm totally behind on schoolwork, so I should probably go do some now. Have a great Friday tomorrow and a lovely weekend, we'll be at another soccer tournament this weekend. -Judy",

Lucky you.  OK ladies, can you help my stupid brain? About 2.5 weeks ago, my upper back and lower neck started hurting. I figured it was just a normal muscle thing and would go away - I pinched a nerve or slept on it funny or something. I've used Advil some, tried muscle relaxants (they just made me want to go to sleep but didn't help the pain or make it get better), heating pad, a bit of massage (but DH says he can't feel a knot there), and such. Well it's still not better yet. I've swum with it and it hurts off and on, I skipped swimming last week but it still hasn't gotten better. It hurts when I look left or right and my range of motion of my head seems less than usual. It's worst 1st thing in the morning sometimes making me not want to lift that arm (it's on the opposite side from my UMX) and it's hard to get up sometimes. (I'm only 41, BTW) Of course, after 2 weeks of this, my brain finally says, \"maybe it's BC related, maybe it's mets.\" I rationally think that's an insane explanation. I can't get my brain to shut up about it though. I also now worry that every ache and pain will automatically become BC related in my head so I have to worry about it. UGH. I may e-mail my MO just so that she can tell me I'm crazy, might shut my brain up, I don't know. Any sage words of advice or anyone want to kick me in the head? Ha ha ha! Edited to add: This started before I started on tamoxifen so I can't blame that. Also, I've tried a different pillow, two pillows, one pillow, to no avail.   Thanks. -Judy",

I found this site, none of the UCLA docs are listed, but there are some familiar names: http://www.diepbreastreconstruction.org/diepdocs1.htm Then there's finding a GOOD DIEP doc vs. just a DIEP doc. I highly recommend mine and have heard great things about some of the other DIEP docs at UCLA. I feel lucky that I work about 5-10 minutes from UCLA.

They wanted to know, \"if this treatment occurred as the result of an accident or injury for which another party may be responsible.\" Man, if I could pin my BC on someone else, I'd totally do it, but no.  I thought that this was ridiculous.  So I called the number ready to tell them how crazy they were. The gentleman on the phone looked up what \"triggered\" the letter and apparently my reported tweaked elbow (as a result of the 14 hours of surgery) triggered it. Um, I received NO treatment for the tweaked elbow, so even if they did want to blame someone for it, it didn't matter because none of the day's expenses were due to that.

Wow, I thought I was the only one with a nickname for some of the parts.  I was given, and still have, the mammogram films of my breast with the localization wires in it. There were three needles/wires sticking into and out of my breast. From that I nicknamed it Frankenboob, then after lumpectomy #2 one of the sutures had an end that was sticking out of the skin a bit, so I had a string about 0.5-1 cm long hanging out, that just confirmed the Frankenboob to me. One evening when looking in the mirror at my now three scars (2 on the breast and one from the SNB), new words to the song \"Starry Starry Night\" popped into my head so I shared them with my DH.  It went, \"Scar-y scar-y wife...\" It made us chuckle at least. I have found that having and keeping my sense of humor has been instrumental throughout this ordeal. I'm so glad that I found this group too, it's so interesting to read just today about the decisions that you all chose about your breasts. I seem to have gone a different route from most of you, but after three surgeries now, I'm definitely wondering if I made the wrong decision, although I don't know that there's really a wrong decision, it's so personal.  If my follow up with the surgeon tomorrow is bad news, then I'll probably end up with a MX and wonder why I didn't do it in the first place. Both my mom and my aunt (aunt had an MX) thought I should have done the MX, but I just wasn't ready for that at the time. I think if it happens now I'll be more ready for it, still not happy about it though. The thing that I really like about this group is that we're all here to support each other and not judge or wag fingers at anyone's decisions. So, thanks to you all for being here for each other and for me. I'm very thankful that you are. It is also great to hear that many of you are moving forward in a positive way, are receiving positve news, and life is continuing for you.

But the possible SE's and required follow up seem daunting. We'll see how it goes, I suppose. We spent the weekend at a soccer tournament and I noticed that I barely thought about it, nor did I notice it. My UMX was Dec. 15 and this was truly the first time that I really didn't think about my BC and recovery from the UMX. At dinner on Saturday a parent mentioned someone who had lost his wife to BC (just in passing in a story she was telling) and I realized that I hadn't thought about BC that weekend. Maybe some normalcy is returning to my life? That would be nice. Take care all!",

Hang in there and let us know what the Dr. says. I have an MO and an RO, saw both before I had any surgery (way back in August). The MO is managing Tamox., giving input on when to have scans (mammo & MRI), and other general BC support. I've only seen the RO once, and then didn't end up needing her for treatment, but UCLA docs had me seeing them all early, it seems every organization does things differently. Thanks for the thoughts so far. I may just e-mail the MO to have her tell me either to come in or that I'm nuts. :)",

Everyone - I'm learning every day how much to appreciate you all. I'm having another surgery in about a week (April 5) and tried to start an April surgery group. The April MX group is going strong, but only one person has joined me in the general surgery one. Maybe it's too early for most of them, I don't know? It's not a biggie, I have support from so many directions, but it would have been nice to have some surgery buddies. I still can't believe that after 4 surgeries I'm still nervous about another one. And this one should be easy too - reduction to the reconstructed breast (PS left it big in case I needed radiation) and revision of my abdominal scar (2 small dog ears to fix).  When I tell people now, I refer to the upcoming surgeries as the Humpty Dumpty phase, as in putting me back together again. It's interesting, I get a mix of reactions - some wonder if there's more cancer and others don't get why I'm doing this because in clothes I look perfectly normal - out of clothes, perky and droopy would beg to differ. Apparently I needed to vent a bit today. Thanks for reading, ladies!  Take care all.",

How about something FUN to do it next time? Hope you heal quickly and that the PT helps! I have one spot on my DIEP breast that's kind of hard, the PS said it should soften up. PS also said that he doesn't discuss stage 2 until closer to it, probably to give things time to settle and for healing to be complete. There are definitely some areas along the ab scar that need revision right now, but that may change 2 months down the road, we'll see. blessings2011 - my reaction wasn't nearly that bad, but now, a week and a half later, I still have evidence of the rash on my legs. I guess we should try to figure out if it is that or something else I'm allergic to, but I'm not looking forward to that testing. Rest assured all that chocolate has been consumed (just a bit now- I'm really looking forward to that cup of cocoa tonight - I don't do coffee, but the cocoa sounds delightful!). And on a funny note, when I was sitting in the PS/BS office in the hospital gown, I started telling and showing DH where I had sensation and where I didn't in the DIEP breast. He started testing it a little bit too and then declared that he would need multiple hours with the breast to fully map out the feeling and not feeling areas. HA!! Any excuse he can come up with to get to play with the boobs - even the fake one. :) (is it really \"fake\" if it's all my tissue?) Have a lovely evening everyone. DH is off taking DS to the dentist and I get to stay home and wait for our dinner to arrive (courtesy of someone from school).",

I did not go in to get treated for an elbow injury, but in the course of the surgery they tweaked my elbow pretty badly. They never treated that, just told me to let them know if it got worse and that it would likely get better. They must have notated it somewhere in my records and the ins. co. picked up on it.  This letter, and the phone call were actually with a 3rd party too, not the actual insurance provider. Spunky - my insurance was with Aetna, but it sounds like most of the insurance carriers do this. It was just so bizarre, especially after more than 3 months.",

They are said to have Estrogen Receptors (ER+) and/ror Progesterone Receptors (PR+). It seems like cancer that is ER+ & PR+ but HER2- is the easiest (?) to treat. The worse ones are what's called triple negative (ER, PR, and Her2 all negative), and Her2+ with ER/PR positive as well. I'm assuming that's why what you've read has been confusing.I don't know anything about cancer during menopause so I can't answer that part of your question, sorry.

There are no good solutions anymore, only tolerable ones. I'm trying to not get angry with my colleagues, but it's not working. So much for being supported by your colleagues. The two gents who teach the same thing I teach and would have just added 1 or 2 more of the SAME THING!! have both opted not to cover for me because it would be too difficult for them and they don't want to have to do the extra work, for 4 f*&#ing weeks!! As I type this I get angrier and angrier. I can't believe how selfish they're being and how difficult they're making things all because they can't handle a bit of extra work for 18 days. Sheesh.

To everyone who I've not responded personally, it sounds like overall the Dec. group is going well. Still thinking about the previous surgeries and about the upcoming ones as well. I can hardly believe mine is in just 5 days. EEK! This whole insurance thing is a bit maddening. I can sort of keep on top of it right now, but after surgery, who knows. Why do some offices take your copay up front and others do not, it'd be nice if they were consistent. I also have two bills for two different amounts of copays for the same procedure. Do I get to pick which one I pay? If so I choose the $35 instead of the $200 one. This cancer crap is EXPENSIVE!! I'm still working right now but am taking Monday off for a family day - to spend the day together enjoying each other's company. Most of my work is done except for the people for whom I must wait - we try to give the same final exam and therefore I must wait for my colleagues to get their butts in gear too. It'll get done, just not on MY time schedule - I'm the one who likes to work on the early side of things, the others, not so much. But overall, I'm coping OK.

I get the feeling that I'm going to get tired of them and that they might provide the most pain too, but I'd rather have them than need the docs to stick a needle in me to pull out fluid. It's a balance I think. I'm ready for home so the timing is just about right. I'm noticing that the skin on my hand is looking wrinkly, the swelling must be going down. I'm not sure how I'm going to get clean because the drains have to stay dry, but we'll figure out something that'll at least be OK. I saw my tummy this morning when they changed the dressing - I can't remember it ever being that flat.  Apparently, I also had a split abdominis muscle (common after pregnancy when things get stretched and don't get unstretched) that the PS repaired as long as he was in there. I'll have the belly and boobs of someone half my age soon, it all feels a bit weird still, just will take some getting used to, I think. DH is on his way ot take DS to a friend's house for a play date then he'll come get me and we can go home and then DS will get brought home by the friend's mom whenevery they're ready. Seemed wise to have him out of the house for me to get settled. That's all the news I have right now. Take care all.

This got LONG too, sorry. I'm a teacher and our school has a wonderful program called Meals on Wings that provides food for families going through difficult times. They contacted me and asked if they could provide meals for us and after I turned them down once before (Lumpectomy & SNB) and was told that I should probably allow this and that there were lots who wanted to help, I accepted. I turned them down for the lumpectom & SNB surgery during which a few individuals chose to provide us with food (sending at least 3x what my family can eat for a meal). I let them provide one meal after my last lumpectomy too and the amounts were still high but not unreasonable (3 dishes from a chinese restaurant w/rice). I decided this time to ask for just 3 dinners a week and figured that between dinners out with family (a fairly regular occurrence) and other events, we would have plenty of food, as most restaurant meals feed us for 2-3 meals. So they put out the call to parents in my son's grade and one family stepped up to provide all 3 meals for the whole time (3 weeks, right now). I felt badly that so many had volunteered and only one family was going to do it all, so I spoke to the planner about this and they've made some sort of arrangement (I don't know what as they did finally take me off of the e-mail distribution list for all this). So Monday night dinner was received and it's lasted us through that dinner, plus at least two lunches for me and there's still some of it left. Tuesday night dinner also arrived as requested, DS ate almost all of his, DH ate his whole steak salad and I ate 1/3-1/2 of mine. DH ate some of mine for lunch today and I ate some of Monday's leftovers again for lunch today. I should also add that all of these meals have come with desserts (unrequested) all of which have a chocolate component - and the chocoholic that I am, is sorely tempted, but I'm not allowed chocolate right now. Then tonight rolls around, a no delivery night. A parent of a former student and whose daughter is in class with DS asked if she could provide us a separate Hanukkah meal briscuit and latkes. I agreed thinking that we'd have my parents over for dinner and there would be plenty of food for all given the leftovers and the dinner provided. So when the doorbell rang and DS shouted that dinner had arrived, I figured I'd go downstairs and we'd have some briscuit and latkes. Apparently a family had mistakenly ordered for us tonight when they weren't supposed to, and again they ordered WAY too much food (2 full adult meals, 2 kids meals (mind you, I've only got one kid!), 3 side dishes, two caesar salads, a lot of bread, and another chocolate dessert). So we squared that away and the briscuit and latkes finally arrived and were eaten and were yummy. We fed the three of us, DH, DS and me PLUS my mom and dad and still had probably 1/3 of the meat left. I just got overwhelmed with food tonight and I suspect with everything else going on too. I hope they get things under control. Thanks for letting me vent here, this seems a super safe place to vent and I bet many of you understand the added stress of that on top of recovery etc... I think I might go into a corner and just chill for a while now, after I empty my drains. :) What does high blood pressure do to output on drains?!? Ha ha ha. -Judy",

For me, I had mammo, more in depth mammo, ultrasound, then stereotactic biopsy all in the course of about 3 hours. I suspect that my husband might have been allowed in the room for the ultrasound, but probably not for the biopsy, it's a surgical procedure, after all. Clearly, I knew the mammo results immediately - the tech was good and had the radiologist look at them right after she did them and then he came and spoke to me even and we proceeded with the other tests. As for whether or not this is cancer, at this point, who knows, but even if you get to a biopsy, something like 80% of them come back benign, so chances are low that it's cancer, but there is always a chance.

You'd think that after all these surgeries I'd be OK with it, but each and every time I'm still nervous. Luckily, at the out patient surgery center they let DH stay with me the whole time until they take me into the OR so he helps me not totally freak out. In the hospital they always kept him in the waiting room while they put in the IV. I like this way better. To everyone going on teh 7th, all the best, hope you all have quick and easy surgeries!",

Once you've had BC, for at least the following 3-5 years they'll monitor you more closely. I have a mammo 1x per year and then an MRI 1x per year so I get some sort of monitoring every six months. I opted for the UMX for a similar reason to yours - and also my surgeon said that she saw no reason to mess with the breast that was not showing any signs of problems. I too have dense breasts. Given all of the above, I totally get the symmetry problem. After the 4 surgeries that it took to get rid of the damn cancer, I've since had 1 more on the cancer side and also to clean up the abdominal incision and then I've also had 2 on the other breast - a lift and reduction and another modification to try to get them to match. I don't think that I'd do it differently if I had to do it again, but I totally get the symmetry arguement. I also only have one nipple right now, the other will be added probably this summer. Good luck with your decision, it's not easy, and is so very personal.",

As you can all see from my info below, I've been through a lot, but I'll spare you all the long tale. I'm having a revision to my left breast (not even the cancer side) on January 10. The surgeon has said that he thinks we can do it under twilight sedation instead of general. I'm happy because it's an easier recovery, but I'm also worried because I don't know what to expect from it, as I've never had it. I know exactly what to expect from general now. Best wishes to everyone in this group! If I can answer any surgery questions, please feel free to ask.",

I had three rounds of lumpectomy without clear margins.Two things, first the cancer cells don't look different when they're doing the surgery so the surgeon takes his or her best guess based on mammo, MRI, ultrasound or whatever other things they used, to figure out where to cut so that they get all the cancer but don't take more tissue than they have to.  Second thing, DCIS can be pesky, it'll not be continuous so there will be some and then a clear spot in the duct and then another spot of DCIS. Between those two, they do their best to get it all, but sometimes they don't. Some women opt for the mastectomy sooner than I did, but they can also do re-excision if you chose to go that route.  Feel free to PM me if you want to discuss more. Getting that news can really take the wind out of your sails.",

If you have a strong preference, I say go with that, but if not, then you have choices.  I chose to have a UMX instead of a BMX due to no eveidence of anything in the other breast. While I'm happy to still have one breast with feeling, a nipple, etc., I sometimes think that I'd have been better off with the BMX because I'm struggling with matching.  I've never felt like someone who cared much about appearances, and in a bra I look fine, but as I've told my friends, every morning when I get up and look down, the following is what I see:  Some of the difference is the missing nipple still to come, but it's more than that and that's why I'm having this surgery in January. Just more to think about - like you need more huh?",

The first time it happened it was a week and a half after surgery and my surgeon said that she didn't think it had anything to do with the surgery. The second time it happened just a week after surgery and she said it matched the area they used the scrub on perfectly, they haven't used it on me since and no horrible itchy rash.  It could be the adhesive or the scrub. But it definitely could be related to the surgery even this long after surgery. I hope you're not too miserable - I was very very uncomfortable. Hope it clears up soon.

I'd say go with whatever you think you'll want. If you're someone who sleeps so much better at home anyway, then I'd go home; if you would enjoy a nice night in a hotel then stay (you won't be able to take advantage of some of the amenities though-not hot tub, etc...).
