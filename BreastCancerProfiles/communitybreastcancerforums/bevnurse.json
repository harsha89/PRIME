I just feel so out of sorts, angry, sad, defeated, etc. but am perpetually working at keeping up the false facade to keep dh and kids comfy. I finally lost it with my dh this weekend because he still just doesn't get it (as someone else mentioned it was 2x4 (US equivelent) time) and continues to insist this will be the chemo that works and I will get  through it and life will continue as before...aarrrrgggh! Dear GOD it's like living in a make believe world and it is exhausting. I think Shirlann had a brilliant suggestion: Anti-depressants. I just cannot feel like this anymore and that is about the only thing I haven't tried yet! Well, as I said earlier, I hope you are in a better place today.

Well, I got the official word on Monday that my cancer is back in the same chest wall area (much larger area) only this time the onc passed it off as fat necrosis from my DIEP recon for 6 weeks. Fortunately 2 weeks later my PS went in to do a biopsy so we could see exactly what it was. So I start again...staging exams and treatment. This go round however is being described as long term (she won't say I'm Stage IV) with herceptin and abraxane. I had my MUGA and then first chemo infusion Wednesday. Post placement today and staging exams next week...dear GOD I forgot how this all takes over!! And now the wait for scan results, arrgghh. Of course the family line is \"it's only a set back\"(that has got to be the world's biggest understatement, not getting the job you wanted is a set back this is life and death folks), \"you beat it before you can do it again\"(really? If I beat it before why am I having to go through all this shit again??), \"you are so strong you will get through this just fine\" (no really I am that pile of jelly in the corner trying to remember what my name is). Oh yes, and my DH has once again shaved his head so that I can walk around with the billboard that says \"My wife has breast cancer and i'm being supportive\". It was sweet the first time now it's just irritating the hell out of me (of course in all fairness everything is irritating me right now!) It is so nice to come here and vent.

It really is amazing to me how much it helps to put all of the things you want to say but would be locked up if you did on a message board. It is so nice that you all \"know\" exactly what I mean and how I feel.  LuAnn, I have been thinking about why my onc wouldn't commit to saying I was Stage IV vs local recurrence. All I can come up with is the lack of scan results. She is probably \"assuming\" something is going on elsewhere which would make me stage IV but she can't say that because I haven't been scanned yet. During my last local recurrence (4/2006) the surgeon made the mistake of verbalizing her belief that there was already spread prior to scans and fortunately had to eat her words! And yes I agree with you wish, this continued increase in members just SUCKS!",

In my head I know this is not a death sentence but logic is having a really hard time being heard over the screaming meemees right now. OMG Mrs x, I had to laught at the eyebrow and eye lash comment but I am afraid my DH would really do it...one lizard looking person in the house is more than enough!! Thanks for the offer Jon but I decided to go with xanax instead...great stuff for hiding from reality and a lot less mess :). And yes, the plan was to add zometa if there were bone mets. OK, so I climbed down out of the crazy tree (thanks kimmytwo, perfect description) long enough to face the body scan yesterday! So major scanxiety, made my DH come and hold my hand while I waited to go in for the scan. I was trying to explain why the waiting is so hard so here are my analogies: ...Like playing Russian roulette and holding a half cocked gun to your temple for 3-7 days ...Like watching a really intense horror movie and you get to the scary part where you know the person should not (go upstairs, open the door, look outside...you get the idea) and you have to wait for 3-7 days to see what is behind the door Feel free to add your descriptions. But again thanks so much and big hugs to you all",

He is now home and done with his active duty requirements for the Army.  They do have access to the internet at most bases over there now and they usually get a 2 week leave about midway through the deployment. According to my son they asked everyone if there was a special occassion they wanted to be home for and tried to schedule them first. We got regular emails and phone calls...one or the other atleast every 2 weeks or so. He was able to check his my space account more often so I would sign on to see if he was checking in that way.  The other godsend was www.proudarmymom.com. These ladies saved my sanity. Tons of information and lots of support. Hugs, Bev ",

Are you kidding me? Do men really think that way? Is that all we become in the marriage, the sick person? Is fighting cancer a practice in self absorbtion? At times, absolutely. It's just like training for a fight or an athletic competition. It takes concentration and intensity to get through the surgery, chemo, radiation, waiting for scan tests and results. Without that focus we would lose our minds. Was it a great depiction of a cancer patient...no but hey it's not really a great depiction of womanhood, motherhood or friendship why do we expect something different? It's Hollywood folks, reality is a bothersome detail! That's entertainment. Hugs, Bev ",
