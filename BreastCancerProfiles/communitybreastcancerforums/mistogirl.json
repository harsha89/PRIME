I had fevers the first  3-4 days after my first 4 Navelbine treatments, sometimes with chills, flu-like aches and pains. I finally asked about steroids since I had done that with Halaven. I feel so much better having IV Decadron as a pre-med then taking the pills for 3-4 days. The day after I stop them the fatigue is awful....but I'll trade that for the weekend of fevers any time.",
