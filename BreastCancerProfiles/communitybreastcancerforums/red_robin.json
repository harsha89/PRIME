My score came back at 12 and oncologist suggests that chemo will be of little benefit; I will need radiation and will be on Tamoxifen for 5 years with the addition of zolidex injections for 2 years.  Can't work out if I should do the chemo just in case???  I've been trying to make sense of the test results document myself and am not sure if I understand correctly; there are two aspects - reccurence rate and chemo benefit...mine is 8% reccurence rate and it looks like a negative number on the graph for the benefit of chemo bit.  I'm almost interpreting that as there's nothing I can really do other than radiation and hormone therapy??  Am I stuck in wishful thinking brain??? Doesn't help that I was hoping to have another baby, in fact was trying to conceive when I was diagnosed (scary thought really!)  Chemo can cut my fertility by almost half! Arghhhh, what to do??????????????????? Red Robin",
