(Not to mention knowing it for myself so I can Google it over and over again so I can stare at the prognosis!) With the decision that chemo needs to be started immediately (on this egg-sized and EXTREMELY painful tumor) and surgery put off until chemo is done, I am left without absolute knowledge of my node status. Is my oncologist just going to make an educated guess as to my BC stage by the estimated size of my tumor and what my CT scan shows? Is this what everyone else, that has neoadjuvant therapy, deals with? I would prefer that we know the full extent of this cancer instead of guessing it by not being able to see possible node involvement on the CT scan. Then, after chemo, being told that if it had been there, it had been killed by the chemo. Am I nuts to want to know for sure, right now, the full and complete scope of the cancer in my body?

I had my bilateral mastectomy surgery yesterday afternoon and I'm pretty sore and unable to move my upper body. My question is for other mothers of young children that have had this procedure. Did you allow your young children to visit you in the hospital? I miss my 4-year old son so much right now but I don't know if him seeing me like this in the hospital will scare him. His father and I don't know if he should visit me here or wait until I come home on Monday and then he can see me after school. I'll still be bandaged up and have the drains in. I really miss my son but I won't even be able to hug him and I'm scared I'll cry in front of him if he gets upset. I want to do what is best for him. I would love to know what you other mothers did in this situation.
