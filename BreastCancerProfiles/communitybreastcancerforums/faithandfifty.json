      "Content": "faithandfifty wrote: I've just learned that today is Slonedeb's birthday!! She's received challenging news of further progression and is feeling especially low right now, following this news. I'd like to invite anyone & everyone who sees this to go to her 'thread' and post a greeting. Even if you don't know her -- I'm certain that she'd be encouraged to see well wishes from the community. A shower of greetings would be awesome. Her thread is under the section: Recovery, Renewal & Hope. Then go to: Prayers & Spirtual Inspiration.... then search for Slonedeb. One more thing. Her computer does not allow her to see graphics or pictures etc. So a flood of words are in order: wishes, prayers, poems, song lyrics, funny jokes -- anything that she can read would be fantastic. Thanks for your support of a couragous sister. Even if you find this well after her birthday, I know she'd appreciated some belated wishes as well. Edited to clarify how to find the thread.
