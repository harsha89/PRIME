When I asked for this, the side effects were manageable. I always feel symptoms 36-48 hours after treatment. It shall pass... it takes a few days. Sorry for the discomfort!

I will say, every infusion I have to take a day or two off work and it lingers through a weekend,,, so I will be talking to my dr about the exact reasons why he has me on this maintenance drug.",

So, oncotype aside, I believe, there are other factors which should be weighed prior to making a decision which is right for you.

Some of you who may have been following my threads have known I have been a little left of par when it comes to my recovery... I have had a number of infections which have made me crazy, and each time I get a mammo, a month later I get the infection symptoms... puffiness in the breast.. I went to dr yesterday because it was inflamed again... they say my scar tissue is thick, it is hard and I have lymphedema in my chest through my back... but it is not infection.(GOOD NEWS) At this point they are recommending PS for recon and to help with the scar tissue... I keep going back and forth on this as I am afraid of going under the knife and me being susceptible to infection. ANYONE else having to deal with this so far out from treatment?",

Because you are so close to finishing, I recommend you do daily self massages yourself to help the area, they say this can help alleviate long term side efffects such as mine. Meece and Sheila- I am crazy, but house hunting today! We are looking for a bigger place as we have outgrown our 1600 SF house! We are so excited! I'll keep you posted!",

They said the probability of a recurrence with a reexcision was the same as mastectomy. So, they did the reexcision, which I heard is more common than we think. Anyway, I wanted you to hear that the drs may say they will not take them and recommend the reexcision but I want you to rest assured if they do this that many of us have had this done the second time and got the clear margins. Keep us posted! BTW- I have been posting on another thread about back aches and anxiety, dr ordered a bone scan, had it done on Friday. I GOT THE GOOD NEWS my Mammo and bone scan are CLEAN!!! SO HAPPY! Now, tomorrow, I need to go in for my routine Zometa infusion, but I am one happy girl going in there with my good news, from here on out it is maintenance!!!!",

I am so sorry you have joined our CLUB :( I want you to know, you are in the hardest part of this whole thing... the scans, tests and more tests! Do know, whatever treatment course they put you on... you have us ladies to go through it with! I remember hearing the word chemo for the first time and dropping to my knees in the office, I was SHOCKED... I had a 9 month old baby at home and healthy otherwise... WHAT, I thought and HOW???? I felt like I was in a fog as I went through the PET scan, all the tests... after my first PET they called me back because they saw \"activity\" in my throat area... I had to retest, I just thought the WOSRT!... then the second scan came back good, I went through 8 rounds chemo (manageable, BTW...) 33 rounds of radiation and 2 surgeries... first surgery did not clear the margins... and here I am with shoulder length hair again 2 1/2 yrs post treatment! So, I share this with you to say, you have come to the right place! Ask questions... all those questions you forget to ask the dr and to ask ladies who have acutally experienced it. Best of luck... I will add this thread to my favorites, so please keep us updated Irish... and most importantly, allow others to help you right now... lean on your village whoever they may be.

If you are asking if you need help after a lumpectomy, my experience was relatively easy. I needed someone to drive me to the surgery and home after. I was sore for a few days and needed to rest but it was not too bad. I had a reexision the week after my lumpectomy because it did not clear the margin... in this instance, I had a partial mastectomy and I needed more help, as well I had the port put in for my chemo. If you will be going through chemo treatments, my hope is you have a friend in the area who can be your support system during it all. It makes a world of difference and physically, you can use the help. Have a good Thanksgiving everyone.. One more note, what different vitamins do you all take daily?",

I have some time under my belt but I still feel post traumatic stress at times, generally at night like the other ladies here have commented on. I take Ativan, anti anxiety when needed, not so often anymore. Cindy, So sorry to hear of your diagnosis, just know there are many ladies here who are steps ahead of you, so ask any questions and we can try and help you. Much like Susan, Pat, and Roseann, I just knew there was something about my lump... my ignorance, when they told me it was bc, I said lets do surgery cut it out.. NEVER in a MILLION years did I know or think of what the next year had in store for me... I remember my dr saying I would need to take some time to focus on my health and then he dropped the chemo bomb as I was not aware it was going to be part of my treatment, Needless to say,I am grateful for the treatment options and I am grateful I threw everything and the kitchen sink at it... it helps with the post traumatic stress and the nights when I panic it may be back... I always assure myself that I did everything to keep myself cancer free. Meece, I am going to ask my dr about the Oncotype when I see him next... maybe he did it and it is buried in my file... I just don't remember it. I do recall he said I was light estrogen positive... to this day I do not know what that means... I asked him about that at a later date and he said not to worry about it either you are ER + or you are not. BTW- Had a wonderful weekend in the 5th wheel with good friends and family, someone brought out a tequila bottle... I don't drink tequila but thought what the heck and took one shot, it actually felt so GOOD!",

I asked for a bone scan just to settle my brain... they said it is not necessary, I go for my routine exam in 2 weeks, if I still have it, I am going to ask again.

I will wake up each morning and take some time for ME, I will have a cup of coffee and reflect on the beauty of the day before and the prospects for the day.. I will not look too far ahead and I will not look too far behind... at this time, I just need to baby step back into my new normal. THANK YOU ladies, I send the biggest cyber hugs to you all, crazy how we are all connected but beautiful all in one. What did the ladies do before the internet... seriously, you all are who I relate to!... and I appreciate that you share back you feelings as I truly do not feel alone! THANK YOU, thank you!",

I got an MRI plus mammo at the one year mark as mammo did not catch my original tumor (One reason, I was 36 at diagnosis and did not have a baseline mammo to go from) The MRI gives me peace of mind. AS well, I am on 50,000 IU of Vitamin D per week. This is one pill, green in color, and I take it as my Vitamin D level is super low. I take daily Tamoxifen... and I, too get Zometa infusions every six months for my bones... I do not think I ever had a bone scan that I recall... not sure why the dr has me on the Zometa other than he claims it has benefits for early stagers! So, I do whatever they will allow me to take for prevention. I have a random question, when do we start counting our years out, is it after original diagnosis, after chemo/rad treatment? It confuses me. I was dx in June 2008, ended radiatin treatment in January 2009. Am I a little over a year out or less than a year? BTW- HAd my celebration of life party yesterdy, HAD A BLAST!!

So, they are thinking I may need a minor surgery to help get rid of the scar tissue.

They scheduled an ultrasound where we concluded it is scar tissue and fluid. I have recently been diagnosed with truncal and breast lymphedema.

I had never thought there were so many different types of bc and with that so many different treatment options. I had 8 rounds of chemo ACT... I am curious when and how the medical team decides who gets the ACT and who gets TC, who is the best candidate for a mastectomy and who is not... I remember begging to get my breasts removed when my first surgery did not clear the margins but two drs said it was not necessary. Anyway, I love that we all get to come on here and talk about our experiences... like many have said before me, I have learned more on these boards than I have in some of my appts. Good luck Aimee and Erika in the upcoming weeks! Come to the boards when you need support or questions answered. Meece- great PIC!

The kicker was everyone saying, honey you are sooooo young, this cannot possibly be! So, call me pessimist, but I FREAKED out today! My RO was very cool and said the same thing Jo has stated here along with some other ladies, rads comes with some life long effects, 2 of which I have picked up on! It can promote lymphedema as well as potentially create lung problems. When I had a PET scan in Oct., it showed something on the lungs, NOT CANCER, just what they say is typical lung damage from rads! So, I take my antibiotic and hope this all goes away!

Another question, I failt ounderstand, my first surgery 1.7 cm, had to have reexision where there was add'l 1.2 cm removed... cleared the margins... but barely... then they threw me into chemo... no mastectomy. They staged me as 1B, they never added the 2 tumorsizes together... but I have read on these boards that sometimes they do?!? Urrghh, this whole thing gets me so flustered! Do you have any insight on this? Thanks! Nicole",

I wish the human brain could allow us to \"forget\" woudln't that be nice :)",
