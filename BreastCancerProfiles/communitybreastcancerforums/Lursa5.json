DD & I had all we could do to keep straight faces while she was starting my IV.  Not sure I'm up for that kind of excitement this time. I think I'll spend my time thinking up one liners for when I come out from under the anisthesia. Any suggestions? Left mast.",

Next day had a vein break that cause me to go into ER surgery. Woke up w/another drain....no recon planned. ANYHOOOO, I gotta say that the drains have definatly been the most painful part of this whole fun & games. BS took my 2nd one out (the one she put in during ER surgery) on Friday and boy was I a happy camper!  While they were in, I just kept asking for pain med refills 'cause after they're gone...well, I personally felt as if I had 4 broken ribs. What a reliefe to have it out! I simply can not imagine having 4 drains as some women do! edited to add: BS said that broken vien and subsequent hematoma had nothing to do with drain removal so as not to scare anyone. It's a very rare thing, but something to watch for during recovery. I was swollen so badly in my MX site it felt like I had an extra person under my shirt. BP was so low, I couldn't walk or stand up..  Hang in there! It'll be over soon! (((hugs))) Lursa",

I just do what needs to get done. (((hugs)))  I had a pretty scary day yesterday. I wanted to post about it incase any one out there has the same thing happen.  First my mx...Lumpectomy w/SNB 4/7/09, Came back, margins not clean (nodes were fine, thank goodness!)......So, L MX 5/19/09, no recon but surgeon does not agree...She swears she knows a doctor that will do the recon even tho my insurance won't cover it. No, he's not in Mexico...lol.  Okay, so I go to see BS on Thurs, she pulls my drain, I'm tickled. It's the ONLY place that still hurts.  Yest Morn., I'm feeling a bit peekid....not bad, just not up too snuff.  I go to lay my arm accrossed the back of the couch and feel a 'pop' inside my chest, on the left side, just abouve mx site.  It was pretty high, but I figured it was an internal stich. A few min later, I stood up, and got that really dizzy \"You better sit down, RIGHT NOW!\" Feeling, you know?   Before I know it, I'm barfinng really hard (I hadn't eaten anything yet, so was just bile), sweating badly, and really shakey. When DH came in, I told him it was either a blood sugar crash or blood pressure crash. I thought I was okay, so I stood up and made it as far as the door. I just let momentum carry me to bed. I sat down for about 20 min, ate some soda crackers and drank a little gatoraid.   I called Bs, office told me to come STRAIGHT IN. I sighed and asked if they had wheel chairs downstairs. I knew I could never make it to 4th floor w/o help.   I told DH, and then noticed my MX site was getting rather uncomfortable. I asked DH if it looked right. He YELPED! (funny in retrospect) He said my MX side was now twice the size of my non MX side. I looked and HOLY COW1 He was right. I called the BS office back and said never mind. Was going straight to ER.   Do you know, I had to have DH call the ambulance? It's not 12 feet to the front door, but I could NOT have ever made it. Every time I stood up, I'd pass out  Turns out I had a hematoma. There was a veine off the mammory artery in my chest that just flat broke and I bled-out into the mx site. I had to have 4 units of blood. BS showed up (after being directed to the wrong hospital) told me that \"bleeders\" were hard to find, but I pointed right to where I'd felt that pop earlier. I was under for less than 2 hours but she fixed me right up.  Anyway, thought I'd post about it incase it happens to anyone else.   If I had not got to the hospital, it could have been it for me, but once there, they took good care of me.  When the ambulance guys checked, they couldn't find a diastolic pressure, only sistolic. I was cold an clammy, heart rate rather tackey, and when they tried to sit me up ( I was flat on my back on the floor at this point) I would pass- out again!  Ooops, sorry. Run-on post. I'm back home now. BTW< DOn't let the ambulance driver try to start an IV in the back of a rocking ambulance when you're dehydrated and no BP! Eeeek!.",

      "Content": "Lursa5 wrote: Hi All,  Just GOT to get this off my chest!  First, although the screen name I chose for myself is a Klingon and would never put up with BC in the first place, NOR any crap from a doctor, I am quite different.  I always say \"please\" & \"thank you.\" I seldom do not follow Dr.'s orders. If I don't, it's usually because it didn't get written down and I forgot.  I'm always smiling, cheerfull & positive.  I always ask how the Dr., Nurse, children, husband's or wives are before they can ask me. I'm never rude and VERY seldom ask for something more than once. If it's not brought to me, I assume I wasn't to have it for one reason or another. I go out of my way to not be a bother.  I NEVER EVER push the nurse's button. That's for people who can't do for themselves...meaning can't breath, talk or move. Saturday morning much of that changed. I was yelling at the top of my lungs  'AWWW COME ON! WHAT\"S TAKING SO LONG!' After pushig the nurse's  buttin 6 times in the last 90 minuets. I was crying, demanding nurse get Dr on phone. I was PISSED at EVERYONE In the hospital and with in 5 blocks around it.  I had not been feeling well Friday morning. I was not really sick, just not feeling well. I was sitting in the livingroom with DH & DD watching TV. I went to put my MX arm along the back of the couch and felt a \"POP\" inside my chest above the MX site. I assumed it was from an internal stitch and then remembered that after 5 visits to BS, I really didn't know if I had any internal stitchs. I never asked. They didn't tell. As a matter of fact, I didn't even know if I was glued, stiched or stapled.  A few minuets later I stood up. I immidiatly got that dizzy, you better sit daown RIGHT NOW feeling. In a few minuets, I was throwing up, sweating horridly and shaking. I told DH it felt like a blood sugar or blood pressure crash. This kept up for about 25 minuets. Finally, I was able to gasp for breath, wipe my face and eyes and breath for a bit. After resting for a few minuets, we had a load of people come in the front door. I know I must've looked awful so I excused myself and headed for the bedroom. I got about 4 steps and got dizzy again. I nearly didn't make it to the bed.  This had been going on for about 1 1/2 hrs and wasn't getting any better. I finally told DH I was calling BS. The office told me to come in right away. I sighed and asked if there were wheel chairs in the lobby. I knew I couldn't make it to the 4th floor even with an elevator.  I also told her I was stil in my pajama's and didn't feel well enought to change. STOP.... At this point one would think thaat that phrase \"I don't feel well enough to get dressed\" would have raised a red flag. NOPE. Just a cheery, \" That's okay. We'll see you when you get here.\" I started to take my shirt off...I was still sitting.on the bed..I noticed that my MX site was VERY uncomfortable. I asked DH if it looked odd. He Yelped! I was wrapped up at the time but after looking, I could see I was swollen up really BAD. I must've been awful sick to not have noticed before.  SERIOUSLY! It was like I had an extra person under my shirt! DH went out to start the truck and move it closer to the front door. I stood up, made it to the chair in the living room and went down. Luckily when I passed out, it was IN the chair and not ON it. When I came too a little, I told  DH that he'd have to call the ambulance. there was NO WAY I was going to make it to the front door.  He did. Usually it takes no more than 10 minutes for an emergency call to be answered. Friday was different. They were VERY busy and I lay on the floor waiting for over 45 min..I think...I was in and out of consciouness at the time. The ambulance guys had to carry me out of the house to the streatcher. Every one in the house was running around in a panick for that 45 min while I was on the floor and NO ONE thought to clear a path for the streatcher...oh well.  While in the ambulance, ON THE way to the hospital. BP crashed and dehydrated, the guy starts trying to start an IV! He stuck me in the back of both hands 7 or 8 times....if it was only a stick, no big deal but between bumps, and corners, he DUG for a vein. Failing that he tried on my non mx arm 4 or 5 more times....he actually had the driver pull over several times into a parking lot to try and start the IV. FInally, as we pulled into the hospital, I showed him my 'good' vien..on my mx arm. He said he was sorry, but any port in a storm. I wasn't arguing at that point.  When I got into ER, they didn't ignor me. THey got right to me. They tried to get my BP up by dumping 2 liters of sailine solutin into me in the space of 15 minuets and then wondered why I was asking for warm blankets. The nurse actually asked me if I could quit shivering so I wouldn't dislodge my IV. The tech just pointed the ultrasound at me and said \"Nope, NOT just fluid.  The attending called my BS and with the phone in his ear, stuck his head in the door and said \"When was the last time you had anything to eat?\" Well, I knew then that I was headed for the Operating room.  BS ordered 2 units of blood to get my BP back up. I've never had a transfusion and had absolutly no idea how much paper work is involved in blood. They started it in ER and when I was wheeled into out paitient surgery an hour later, they were still having me sign things. In OPS, I watched my new nurse spend another 45 minuets on paper work and it took 2 techs to go down to the blood bank and get it. I was in OPS for over an hour before they even started the IV for the blood! (I was told it's better to use 2 seperate lines....by this time I had 3 IV's going) .  At this point I'm still smiling and saying \"Nice to meet you,\" and \"Thank you for the excellent care you've given me,\" and \"Please may I have another warm blanket.\" Not to mention cracking jokes. The OR nurse came in to put my blue bonnet on and I said \"I wondered when you would get here with the party favors.\" She was distracted, I think because when she left it was 1/2 way on me, my hair was stuffed only 1/2 way up into it and it was covering one eyebrow. When my anistisieologist got there I asked him if my party hat was on at a rakish angle. I also told him he could save us both a lot of money and time if he's just send out for a bottle of vodka. I don't drink but he was not ammused by that. ..Okay, I didn't say they were FUNNY jokes. I WAS pretty sick.  CHANGE SCENES: Waiting for my BS. The nurse comes in and appologises saying they sent her to the wrong hospital!   Finally I get into surgery. BS tells me that this could take awhile as 'bleeders' are sometimes hard to find. Then it dawned on me....I hadn't told any one about the popping thing. I pointed right to the spot and said \"not sure what you're talking about but I felt a pop just here right before I started getting dizzy.\" She said \"Didn't they tell you?\" \"Tell me what/\"  \"I think you have a hematoma.' \"A what?\" I asked trying not to sound irritated. She told me it sounded to her from what the attending told her on the phone that I had broken my mammory artery and it was bleeding into my MX site. That made sence to me but I was a bit pissed of that no one had told ME! Because I could point to where I felt the pop, I was only under for about 1 1/2 hours. They took good care of me in recovery and after an hour there, they wheeled me up to my room. I aked if I could order dinner, knowing the cafateria would close soon. My nurse that was driving said she'd ask my floor nurse...More thank yous and good bye's, a few more jokes a couple of \"Nice to meet you's\" and I asked my floor nurse about dinner. I was still pretty high off the meds they gave me in recovery so I was laughing & joking with the staff. She asked me if was I hungry already. I said not yet, but I knew I would be and who was I to pass up a mean in bed?  She said tha BS hadn't left any orders so she had to call to make sure. About 1/2 an hour later I asked the floor tach when the caffeteria closed. He said about 3 minuets ago. I was starting to be not such a happy camper.   I even got more irriated when I found another drain back in me! Well, I could understand why it was there but it still didn't do anything to lift my spirits.  When it took the floor tech over an hour to get back  with the grape juice and ice I had requested,  and the night nurse came in and said that she was alone on the floor tonight so just be patient when I rang for anything, I sighed and knew it was gonna be a long night.  I had to ring and ask every time it was time for medication. The IV alarm went of for over 1/2 hour before I rang to tell her it was going off. My arm started to swell and I rang as I'd been told too, it took her 1 1/2 hours to get there. By that time my entire arm and hand was swollen so bad, the hospital arm bands were cutting into my arm. i WAS TOLD NOT TO GET OUT OF BED BY MYSELF BUT AT THE RATE THEY HAD DUMPED FLUIDS INTO ME, ALONG WITH THE 4 UNITS OF BLOOD, i WAS HAVING TO PEE EVERY TWO HOURS.  Ooops, sorry. Didn't mean to caps lock.  I was measuring the output myself and writing it down so neither one of us would get in trouble. I knew she had someone really sick in the next room so I tried HARD to be nice. But, by 7 am when I had rang for my pain meds so many times, I just LOST IT. It was shift change so there were now 7 or 8 people standing right outside my door laughing and talking as I was lying there in pain. I really wondered if any of them realized how irritating that is?   I tell you, I have never really minded going to the hospital but this visit really changed my opinion. WHY would they put only 1 nurse on the floor on a FRIDAY night when it had obviously been a very busy day? While I was waiting for DH to come get me, I heard 3 code blues and wondered if it was from poor care from the night before. I KNOW I would've been better off going home!  I am getting better now, but you should see my poor arms and the bruises on the backs of my hands. SO much was done that was not needed that only added to my discomfort. So little was told me that only added to my anxioty. I tell you, I've just about had it, and I've not even made it to cjhemo yet! If I couldn't vent on these boards, I'd be in big trouble, probably by now. Thank you all for listening! xoxo Lursa   .

I TRY to be honest when needed.....Funny thing, I've had no trouble telling any other medical personell about this. The ONLY time my Family doctor wrote me for opiates was after my second visit to ER. I showed up in his office w/o my teeth (I have full dentures and ONLY take them out to be cleaned when no one else can see), in my PJ's, bolting for the bathroom, and actually laying on the floor in the waiting room. He wrote me for clonidine? (hi blood pressure med that helps to block opiate recepters) and a BIG bottle of vicoden. I followed his instructions to the letter about tapering and was actually able to make it. I was in bed for 2 weeks tho! This is off of FIVE mg's of methadone! Granted, my taper off methadone was really fast. Usually the drop you 1 to 2 mg a week, but the prices at the clinic went up and I couldn't afford it. (no insurance here, either.) Was VERY surprised at the compassion of the ER staff. Very kind.   I sure was scared. When I quit the clinic, there was an older man...in his late 60's (no offence!) He'd become addicted due to chronic pain, like me. His SSI would not streatch to cover the increase in cost at the clinic. He wound-up dying from withdrawls. Then there was the kid who was trying to break his addiction to morphine and still keep his job & support his young family. He couldn't cover the increase either. He killed himself. I can sure see how withdrawls can kill a person. While I was going thru it, there were a few times I was afraid I WOULDN'T die...  I'm not afraid of getting addicted again....hell, I AM an addict, always will be....but I know I can follow DR's orders and taper off when needed.  My Anisthisiologist for my lumpectomy did a great job. I told her about the methadone.. I never got sick, had demerol in recovery when needed, my throut wasn't even sore from breathing tube. I sure hope I get her for mast on Tues. Again, thank you for all your support. Any time I have questions, worries, or just want to whine, this board and you Gals NEVER let me down! xoxo Lursa",

I'll head on over to the stop smoking thread & see what's up That's right, my addictions don't end at opiates. I am a hard core (1 1/2-2 pkgs a day) smoker. I am giving it up.  I've had 6 cigarettes since Tues. A lot of you may think that's a failure. I'm THRILLED! First time in 27 years I could say I'm quitting. You see, I am a triple-neg & nicotieine really cuts the effect of the chemo by more than 1/2 for me. So you see, if I am to live, I really MUST ! Room for improvement? Yes, and I shall take that room & CONQUR!  My spelling kinda takes the ummmph out of the drama, but you all get the idea. (Did I mention I HATE this spellchecker?) I challange you all to be honest and to come to these boards with problems and addictions you've been struggling with but have been too ashamed to talk about/admit. As you can see from the wonderful women who've posted above, there was NO judgement. Others who may be suffering need your stories, understanding & support. I'm tellin' you, if you gotta have BC, this is where it's at! xoxo Lursa5.",

I have a legit reason to take them but at the time had no insurance so took what I could get so as to stay on my feet and keep my job.  When I realized I couldn't get thru the day without them (by this time I had graduated from vicoden to percocett to oxycontin, the 40's that last all day.) I tried tapering off but got so sick. Finally, before I lost my job, house and children, I checked myself into a detox facility. Not much help there. It was mostly for homeless alcoholics. No one there had any idea how to deal with opiat addiction so after 72 hrs I checked myself out.  On the way out I picked up a brochure. It was for an opiate addiction clinic. After struggling with it for awhile longer, I Finlay went. Come to find out, it was a methadone clinic. What an easy way out! They made it sound so easy and pain free. After the weeks I'd been thru, I was all for easy. I found out later that as in the words of the great Dr. Gregory House, methadone is heroin without the high. I also found out later it's WAY more addictive than most opiates and it's extremely dangerous. I was on it for 3 years. Finally got sick of having to drive to the clinic every day so decided to go off. My councilor said I'd never do it. I dropped from 122mg to 5 mg in 2 months. After maintaining the 5 mg dose for a month, I decided it would be a piece of cake to quit. WRONG! I was in the ER twice.  I've been clean for over a year but here's the prob. My tolerance for opiates is WAY up there. After my lumpectomy, I took the percocett my BS prescribed but it may as well have been aspirin for all the good it did.   Now, if I tell her about this, it could go 2 ways. She could understand and write me for stronger meds, or get scared to death and write me for Tylenol 3.  I'm a week away from mastectomy and I've been struggling with this for quite some time.  Advice and opinions please?  thank you. Lursa5  I gotta say, the staff and the ER Doc were very kind and not at all judgemental. It's not enough that we do our best; sometimes we have to do what's required. Winston Churchill..

I haven't seen my BS yet, and most likely won't til just before mast on the 19th, but I WILL tell her then.  I wanted to add that when I was in the detox unit, I learned 1 thing. Addiction is addiction, weather it be alcohol, narcotics, nicotien or caffiene. Those homeless men were all people with real feelings, stories and families. The folks that worked at the detox clinic were a bit calloused but I heard stories of how a guy would leave detox and show up in the mourge the next day or so.   Anyway, thank you all for your support. It was just the push I needed to do the right thing. Huggs to all! Lursa",

I've never concidered it and probably won't but appriciated her concerne and told her givin her sterling reputation, I would go with her recomendation.  As for the pain pill addiction....It's always gonna be there. For those of us who are addicted, if you leave your perscription bottles out where we can see them, we have a devil of a time keeping our eyes off them. Doesn't matter WHAT'S in them.  I told my BC just as we were visiting before surgery. She had them give me a wee bit of morphine in recovery along with torridol. T'was very effective. THe anesthesiologist did a fantastic job as well. Not one bit of the shivvers or nausia. The recovry room nurses got me to my room quick, I think 'cause I kept threatning to sing 'Mac THe Knife\"  During my stay in Hospital, I was given 1 1/2 little tiney weeny vicoden every 4 hrs and an ice pack to get me thru that. It was effective but I was still worried about what she'd send me home with. It actually hurt more than I thought it would. WAY worse than my lumpectomy. No worries. Dr. Sharon is a kind woman. Sent me home with stronger perks as I told her my tolerance builds up so fast. She promised to work with me if I promised to follow her orders and not take 2 pills when she said just one. Agreed!  As far as there being a  forum for pain killer addicts w/ cancer, I don't know of any. Folks are scared to be honest about it. I am/was. I'm not a fan of N/A or A/A. but there is a methadone forum I spent lots of time on...mad.org, I THINK. Great people there. Methadone is something I've not made up my mind about. I've seen a lot of folks really helped by it. I've also seen a lot of folks ruined by it. I DO know it's NOT something you want to mess with unless you're under a doctors care. It can kill you that quick! Dang near killed me coming off of 5 mg after taking 122mg for over 2 years.  Honesty. That's the thing....If you're gonna get any help, you realy got to be honest with yourself as well as others. Then, there are those to whom one is better off saying nothing too.  I too had lots of things attack me when I quit the methadone. That's one thing I HAFTA say is it really is the best painkiller out there. Just real leathal if directions aren't followed to the letter. My back (which started me on the wonderful journey to begin with) came back with a vengance, neuropathy (yup!) my RLS that I had completely forgotten about...all kinds of things.  All I know is that I will always be ddicted to opiates. The recepters in my brain have ben all messed up by my abuse of them and won't ever be fixed.  I just knew I could be okay wiith that once I got thru the methadone withdrawls.  Anyone who wants to, and is not comfortable posting, please don't hesitate to PM me...unless it's about my spelling. I hate this spell checker..  Thank you again ladies  I have been taking 400-600mgs of ibuprophen along with my perc's and it helps A LOT! Feeling much better today, tho I don't think I'll go paint any houses. xoxo Lursa",
