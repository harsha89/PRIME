My clinical trial has gotten off to a rocky start. Bad side effects from the drugs -- a debilitating headache sent me to ER for CT and MRI scans. At least no bleeding in the brain, just a 'usual' headache SE. Then a few days later I developed a rash all over my body --- legs, arms, face and back which sent me back to ER. And nothing the docs give me seems to produce any relief from the ache in my chest. (Presumably caused by tumors in lymph nodes I have IBC). And now dermatologist thinks I might have shingles!! So I'm off the drugs for the trial until all this clears up. Trying to stay hopeful. Don't know how you ladies stay so strong. Need to work on mindset and be grateful for all the advantages I have.

Don't know if I have mets yet (CT and bone scan not until next month due to the craziness of the holidays) but my MO told me I will be treated as if I have mets. I started Xeloda yesterday and am anxiously hoping to find that it stops the spread of red bumps. I'm not sure if I really belong here, but nothing else seems to fit. Regardless of CT scan results, I'm going to be spending the rest of my life trying to keep this horrible scourge at bay as there is nothing that surgery can do for me anymore. Hope to learn a lot by following all your posts. ",

So it's on to Plan B for me but unclear what it will be. My MO mentioned two standard treatments gemzar + carbo (which it seems some of you are on) or Eribulin. I asked her if there was anything in a database which might indicate which way to go depending on my tumor's characteristics, but apparently there isn't. Were any of you offered Eribulin? I saw an article which indicated that Eribulin didn't have any better results than Xeloda. I'm hoping to get on a clinical trial for PD-L1 but don't know if I will qualify because I might not have 'measurable disease'. My MO thinks it might be my best chance since I'm still 'healthy' except for the cancer. Thinking of all of you!  ",

The second drug is classified as a targeted therapy , not chemo. Need to get more questions answered. Rosieo, Sorry that you're not feeling well. Try to keep your spirits up and find some joy in every day. That's theonly way I'm getting through all this waiting. Hugs. Anna",

Been here since 7:30 am and am being monitored like crazy. By the time I'm done hopefully at 5 I will have had three EKGs, 4 blood draws, countless blood pressure and oxygen checks. So no obvious SE yet. I guess this is the world of being a Guinea pig. Anna",

Hope you can find something that you can eat to keep your strength up. Hugs! Kaayborg, Regarding trials, The first time is the worst. Next time will be another marathon, but eventually all the extra tests should subside. The researchers take so many blood samples to see how quickly the drugs are being absorbed into my system. Talked to oncologist at end of day and to my relief, during the time I was waiting to start the trial there was only minimal change to suspicious areas in my lungs and the lesions in my chest wall. I have access to the radiologist reports but they really need to be translated into something a layman can understand. So yes, better to wait for MO to explain. Anna",

I don't have kids -- only two cats and they hate each other so I can't get a picture of them together unless they're fighting. Laurel, Julie and Kaayborg gave you great responses. Food is great (though I must admit one of my friends had no idea of what I liked -- the other asked me) for those days when you just don't feel like cooking and there are many. But what I think I appreciated most was cards and emails from friends just telling me that they were thinking of me. It can be a very lonely time. Hope that your friend has a relatively easy time with treatment and how lucky she is to have you as a friend. Anna",
