Lumpectomy, masectomy, double masectomy???  Any advice crom the veterans??  I am gathering as much info as I can, trying to do what is best, but what is best?  Any advice would help at this point.   Has anyone out there taken the leap and had the other breast removed when it appeared \"healthy\"?  Is that too radical? SOrry - going nuts over here.  Log in to post a reply",
