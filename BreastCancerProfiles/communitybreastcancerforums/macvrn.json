In my case, I opted for a double mastectomy. Even though, it was my left side that has the cancer, I decided for my right to be prophylactically removed just because I have a benign biopsy result years before my diagnosis. My husband would have had me do the lumpectomy with radiation. His reasoning was that mastectomy is a major surgery, more risk/complications, longer recovery and that if there's nothing \"wrong\" with my right side why removed it. The ANXIETY was the most propelling factor for me. Every time I would encounter some issues about my surgery/recovery (I went home with 4 drains), I would always go back to that time when I was first diagnosed and on the \"waiting phase\" and almost like having a panic attack. Those thoughts always gives me peace about my double mastectomy decision. Whatever your decision is you will encounter some challenges. This thing is laid down on our path for a reason, don't let it weighed you down. Keep enjoying life. God Bless You!",
