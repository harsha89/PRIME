I have had 3 of my 4 dense dose treatments and this last one nearly ended me up in the hospital and I spent hundreds of dollars trying to figure out why I couldn't catch my breath. In the end they never could tell me what was going on but I am not sure I can go through this one more time. I still have 4 dense doses of Taxtore left after my last AC on Thursday. My tumor was very small no lymph node involvement and I am beginning to feel like the treatment is worse then the disease üòè I talked to my doctor and he said it is totally up to me, that he really can't tell me what the benefits/repercussions are of doing it or not doing it. So have any of you ladies chose not to finish because of the side effects? Thanks and I hope everyone is having a great weekend!!
