My breast surgeon was very good about explaining what I have.  I don't like the way your doctor treated you.  I feel you deserve more of an explanation than she gave you. Personally, a lack of information causes me MORE anxiety.  If you do not have a family history, just close monitoring may be appropriate.  However, you may want to ask for a copy of your pathology report.  You may also want to seek a second opinion from another breast surgeon and/or an oncologist. As for me, I have been doing close monitoring since my mother got breast cancer over 20 years ago.  I have had several biopsies and it will probably continue.  I am tired of dealing with it.  Since my diagosis of atypical hyperplasia, I am pursing a preventive mastectomy with implant reconstruction (both breasts).  I don't want to date anyone while I'm going through these procedures.  Anyone I get involved with when I'm done, will be told at the appropriate time.  I'm well into my 40's and no one is perfect my this time anyway.  They are doing incredible plastic surgery these days so I'm not really worried. I am not suggesting this procedure for you.  Each woman is different and it's my strong family history that is a deciding factor here.  I just feel so \"done\" with these breasts that are causing me problems.  If I were you, I would seek other opinions and go frequently for monitoring.

My opinion.....after what you've been through.....you'd do great.  The nitty gritty bad stuff....you leave the hospital with drains and have them for about a week.  They are rather gross and you have to empty them.  You have to sleep propped up on your back at first.  You lose sensation and your chest feels \"numb\" on the surface. Some of this loss of feeling is permanent.  You can't use your arms very much at first.  I already mentioned you get constipated from pain drugs.  If you have expanders at first, your \"breasts\" will look deflated, lumpy and bruised.  Then when they start filling them up with saline, they get really hard and shaped funny. The permanent implants are very comfortable and soft though.  Some women are not happy with their reconstruction results and some women have complications.  I do believe getting a really good and experienced surgeon can cut down the risk of this greatly though. The good stuff:  most women do not find it to be that painful of a surgery.  The pain is usually easily controlled with pain killers.  You may be able to keep your nipples - ask about a \"nipple sparing\" mastectomy.  You may be able to change your size - go bigger or smaller.  You may be able to get \"perkier\" breasts if you want them.  You'll never have a mammogram or mammogram guided biopsy again.  (I just get yearly MRI's now).  You'll greatly decrease your risk of breast cancer; probably down to 2-3%.  Most importantly...you'll get piece of mind.  I'd be happy to answer any other questions as well:  1ocforce.kris@sbcglobal.net ",
