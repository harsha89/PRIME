      "Content": "Oct 13, 2015 08:07AM - edited Oct 13, 2015 08:08AM by Fearless1956 Chiming in with my experience with stereotactic biopsy.  I had mine done yesterday afternoon and it wasn't as near as bad as I expected nor did it last very long.  The worst part was the needle injecting the local anesthetic but that didn't last long.  All I felt during the procedure was some pulling and pressure.  Dr. held pressure for a good 10 minutes afterwards to minimize bleeding and then I had a pressure dressing and ace wrap placed.  I slept in the ace wrap and was able to remove it and the dressing this morning so I could shower.  Steri strips are in place and are to stay there until they come off on their own.  I can tell there is a little bit of swelling today because the left side of my bra feels fuller.  But, I'm having no pain at all.  The final biopsy report will be in by this Friday.  However, my breast surgeon went ahead and told me that she wanted to prepare me because she's almost positive that my biopsy will show DCIS, stage 0.  From all that I had been reading, I think I was prepared to hear that information.  She said there is still a chance that it will come back benign but she really didn't think it would.  She had consulted with the radiologist who read my initial mammogram films and the additional views that were taken before she did my biopsy yesterday.  If I'm going to have a diagnosis, this is probably the best I can have.  I've shed my tears and now I'll be ready to move on and fight this!   ",

I'm glad to know that it's being used with other types of patients and that some of the criteria has changed. As far as it being only for small chested women, that part didn't apply to me. I'm also fair skinned and I asked my RO about that from the beginning. I know how badly I sunburn due to my fair skin and I was concerned it would be similar, but she told me the fair skin wasn't a factor. Being able to have only 16 treatments was the greatest positive for me. And so far, 2 days after finishing rads, my skin is still doing OK and doesn't seem to be getting any worse (as my RO had \"predicted\"). The itching is still present but manageable. KateB79 --- How did your first day of rads go? I use the Miaderm also and find it to be very soothing. JRowe -- My center used the wedge also. As already mentioned by someone, the time on the table is minimal. I was usually in and out in about 15 minutes total (except on days I saw my RO or on days that an additional film was taken). What I hated was having my nose or other body part to start itching while I was on the table and I couldn't scratch. That happened several times and actually became kind of comical to me.",

I feel very blessed and I daily ask God to watch over each and every one of you as I know many of you are struggling in your journey. The one thing that we all share is the emotional aspect of having cancer. I feel like I'm a strong person overall & face daily life as normally as I can. That's what I want--for life to feel normal. But I know life will never be the same. There are still days that I find it hard to believe that I am a cancer patient. Days that it seems to hit me square in the face all over again and all I want to do is cry. So I'll go have a cry 😂 and then pull up my big girl panties and keep living.

They are great encouragement to me and remind me that this is a journey that so many of us are on. And, I read many of these posts, I realize that compared to the difficulties that many of you have endured, I am blessed and have no reason to ever complain. I'm fortunate that my cancer was found early (DCIS) and therefore, my treatment path has not been the same as many of yours. However, the emotional aspect of the realization of \"I have breast cancer\" is the same for us all. Even though mine was found early, I know that there is always the chance for recurrence (although I'm going to stay positive and continue to fight!). I have finished 14 of 16 rads treatments and am due to have my final treatment this Tuesday, Feb. 2. My skin has held up extremely well, much to my surprise since I am fair-skinned. I don't know if my dose is different because of early stage or if that has anything to do with it or not. My skin is pink and the most irritated place is under the arm. And overall itching. I've reacted just like I do when I have gotten a sunburn in the past. I used to get \"sun poison\" and got these itchy bumps on my skin and now have some of those with the rads. So, overall, I feel blessed that I have tolerated this without a lot of difficulty. When I read about the pain and problems many of you are having, I send up a prayer when I read your posts. You all are a great group of ladies and I feel like I know you from reading your posts. The support for one another on this thread is phenomenal! Thank you all for sharing your stories and always being a source of information and strength to keep on facing another day in the journey. I also want to share a special story of something that happened to me on Saturday. I attended a women's college basketball game with my husband and daughter at my daughter's alma mater. She was the previous manager for the women's basketball team when she was in college, and we are still friends with the coach. It was the team's \"Play for Kay\" game of the season. Each college's women's basketball team has one of these games each season. The games are fund raisers for the Kay Yow Cancer Fund (former NC State coach who died from breast cancer) with the organization's funds going to cancer research. Prior to the beginning of the game, the announcer was telling about the \"Play for Kay\" games and the fund. He then noted that the day's game was being dedicated to several women fighting breast cancer and I was one of the three women whose names he called out. It was such an honor and one of the most thoughtful things anyone has done for me. It brought tears to my eyes. After the game, the coach excitedly asked me, \"did you hear your name called?\" She was the one that had included my name in the dedication list. It touched me in a special way. Oh, and they won the game so that made it even more special!",

Mdoc524 --- Yes I started on Arimidex about 2 weeks ago. I've already been through menopause so the return of the hot flashes has been what I've noticed more than anything else. They are similar to what I used to have, mainly in the middle of the night between 3 and 4am when I wake up kicking off the covers. I had a couple of nights with some knee discomfort but nothing unbearable. To me, the se's with the medication are more than a fair trade-off if it helps to prevent recurrence.",

I finished day 3 today and am not noticing any changes at all. The technicians have told me that's fairly normal for the first few days. I don't feel a thing during radiation---except my arms hurting from having them above my head. I felt a twinge/muscle spasm in my middle back during the sim and I wanted to move to try and help relieve the discomfort but knew that wasn't possible. I'm not seeing any redness or swelling so far. Since my mom just finished radiation a week ago, I ask her a lot of questions. We both have fair complexions and I keep thinking I will respond the same way she did. Right now, it's almost like a false reassurance since there are no problems with radiation. In reality, I know that will change with time though. I may not always respond to posts or in a quick manner, but I enjoy reading the posts as they come through on my email. It's encouraging to read, knowing there are others sharing similar experiences (even if they are different in some ways. We will get through this stage of the journey!!!",

KateB79 -- as I mentioned once before, I love your positive attitude.  Your sense of humor in the way you look at your cancer journey is inspiring!  Who would have thought to compare the linear accelerator to a KitchenAid!  How funny (but true)!  Congrats on the purchase of your house.  That's just another way of saying you do have a future beyond breast cancer.  Good for you! Twnkltoz -- I have a cough that comes on at times that I hadn't really thought about it being related to rads but I guess it's possible.  My throat actually feels like it is tightening up when I cough and it's more of a hacking cough.  Are your symptoms similar?  I'm hoping my side effects from rads are all soon gone since I'm almost 2 weeks post completion.  My skin has now started turning darker in color and still having the itching but not as bad as it was initially.  No peeling yet either..........still slathering on the Miaderm.  My RO told me that when I see her again on the 23rd for a post-rads check that she will probably switch me over to Vitamin E oil for my skin.  Anyone who's finished with rads used that?  Hope everyone enjoys their weekend and finds a way to stay warm.  The high here in the Atlanta area over the weekend is around 40 and I have plans to be outside part of the day tomorrow----I'll be bundled up for sure as I can't stand the cold!  Hurry up Spring!!!",

I was able to talk to my RO this week and she helped to clarify some of my earlier questions.  She also told me that I may not see much color change until next week.  I will not be having any boosts.  She explained that my \"double dose\" during the 16 treatments covered all that I needed.  As I read all of your posts and see your \"signatures\" of diagnoses and treatments, I note that many of you have IDC.   I have DCIS and that makes me wonder if my overall dose is less than those of you with IDC, especially since I'm not having a lot of the side effects that many are having.   I have such great admiration and respect for those of you who are experiencing way more than I have so far.  My 80 year old mom is also a strong role model for me,.  She finished her rads about 2 weeks ago and is still healing (she is IDC, stage 2).  I love the support for one another that's on this thread and how you all stay upbeat and positive.  To me, staying positive as much as possible is the one thing that keeps me going.  That's not to say that I don't have my \"down\" times, but overall, I just try to keep pushing along on this journey and reading this thread always provides additional encouargement.  You ladies rock!!!!!  Hugs and prayers for all, Debbie",

Gardengirl -- Bless your heart. You have been through an ordeal recently. Saying a prayer that you get good results. Dorothy26 -- Canadian fractionation was developed in Canada and is approved for US treatment. It is a 16 day treatment plan that delivers higher doses during each treatment compared to the standard six weeks of treatment. From what I learned, it is used most often in women who have undergone breast-conserving surgery for early-stage breast cancer. Some of the other specific guidelines is for diagnosis after the age of 50, patient hasn't had chemotherapy, and no evidence of metastasis. Studies have shown low recurrence outcomes as well as good cosmetic outcomes. It was something I hadn't heard of before either, so I had to read up on it. I liked that it was a shorter treatment plan. I also like it that I don't seem to be having some of the skin issues that I read about here that so many have had. My worse issues are the itching and tender spot under my arm. My RO said the skin issues could get worse over the next couple of weeks before the healing starts, so I'll have to wait and see if that happens or not. Hope everyone has a restful and comfortable night. I have an early morning tomorrow with a need to be at work by 5:30 so I'm heading to bed soon. Prayers for all, Debbie",

The encouragement and support on this board is phenomenal. I wish there was a way we could all meet one another. I went to a breast cancer support group around my area one time and did not find it encouraging or helpful at all. I did find out about another cancer support group at the hospital where I work and went to it last week. I met a couple of ladies there who had been through breast cancer so maybe there's hope in that group. Through that group, I found out about a free weekly yoga class just for cancer patients that I'm going to try out sometime next month.",

I wasn't told much about what they were doing with the sim and my fault for not asking more questions about this. I see my RO on Monday, so I definitely plan to ask her. ctgal48--your info on your experience is very helpful. I realize we all respond differently but it helps to kind of have an idea of when to expect the changes. I will have finished day 9 a week from today and I was thinking that might be a time to start looking for changes in the skin. Thanks for sharing about the need to care more for the outside area of the breast. It makes sense for that area to be a little more sensitive to changes. I had already thought about under the breast being an area of concern. Guess I need to stock on up the corn starch since my boobs are rather droopy and beneath them doesn't get enough airing out. Suz-Q--thanks for sharing your story also. I haven't been paying enough attention to the underarm area and based on yours and ctgal48's comments, I now see that I need to focus on making sure I apply more cream there. I will \"lube the boob\" and buy cabbage this weekend to have it ready when I need it. I have found it interesting to read the comments about not taking the antioxidants also. It seems that has not even been mentioned by my RO or MO. Does this mean some of you have no intake of anti-oxidant foods either during radiation? I'm concerned about my nipple area and how it will respond to the radiation. My lumpectomy was at 12:00, right above the nipple (I have a nice little \"eyebrow\" scar above the nipple---plus a matching one on the right since I had a pre-cancerous atypical lesion removed at about the same area). Based on what I'm reading here about \"boosts\", my guess is that there will be targeted boosts to the nipple area at some point. I'm wondering if that will cause it to be more sensitive. I don't know if my 16 day treatment plan includes \"boosts\" or if they will be added on at the end. I'm glad I'm reading these posts because I now have even more questions for my RO on Monday. She was not there when I had my sim or the day I started treatments, so I really haven't had an opportunity to talk to her about the entire plan. I need to make a list so I don't forget the questions I have for her. Thanks to all for continuing to share your experiences. They are so very helpful.",
