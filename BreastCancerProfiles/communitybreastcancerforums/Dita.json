Is that the best use of a tool that was designed to allow everyone to communicate? Isn't the world's obsession with material wealth and trivial matters what most complain about but when someone tries to go deeper it makes people feel uncomfortable and free to judge.   Are we that far removed from the realities of life and death that we are not allowed to talk about it publicly? ",

My mets are to the spine but I was told that you can't radiate to many places on the spine because it damages bone marrow which you need if you later need chemo again down the track. Still new to this and lots learn. Teacher911 can I ask where you had your treatment and how many spots. I guess I ask because if you have one or two spots they radiate worth the intent to cure but if have any more they don't try to cure. Why is this?",

It might take some experimenting with the dose so you can get off to sleep OK but less Groggy in the morning. I take mine up to an hour before I go to bed so it wears off earlier. My body clock is all over the place too and I worry about sleeping my days away but we are sick and sleep is incredibly important. I have a sleep meditation mp3 that I use and it helps to slow the mind late at night so I feel more relaxed even if I can't sleep.

I had extensive bone mets at diagnosis and had no real pain. However the pain I have now is very specific,  I can touch the spot and feel pain but its not a generalized pain, its only on that spot. But since diagnosis I have been convinced of brain mets, liver mets and more bone mets and it hasn't been the case so our minds can create all kinds of problems that dont exist. You are talking some strong drugs that can cause bone aches. Speak to your onc if you are worried. Good luck rosestoses I hope its nothing",

There is lots of good advice here about some of the little things you can do to feel better and maybe tomorrow or the next day wont be as bad as today.   One thing I did read from your email is that you would like to have more energy for your children and you dont like the fact that you feel depressed.  I dont have children (f$*king cancer) but I do feel guilty when my partner has so much more energy than me.  And I feel like I should be making more of my time here.  I cant stop those feelings but I can say that its not our fault. You and your children are together and that is the main thing.  My partner is just happy Im here, regardless whether I want to spend all day in bed or not.  Im sure your children feel the same.  They will cherish these moments with you forever. When you sit on the couch and watch TV, make sure you watch something good and that you have good quality ice cream.  I hope you feel better soon",
