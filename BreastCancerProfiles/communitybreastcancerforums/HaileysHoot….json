I haven't based any treatment decisions solely on one score, however, when my medical oncologist told me my \"intermediate Ki-67 score\" played a piece in his reasoning for recommending chemo, I felt a personal need to learn more information about this portion of my pathology report. RubyRoo, I met with a new doctor today, and she is bringing my case in front of her staff of medical oncologists and radiation oncologists. She said they meet weekly to discuss each patient's course of treatment, which I personally found to be extremely refreshing, and appreciate that they take into account how each portion of the treatment plan affects the others. She said initially looking into specific aspects of the pathology report - particularly the hormone status (HR+ PR+), lymph node involvement (negative), Ki-67 score (~15%), and oncotype score (20) - there is no \"need\" for chemotherapy. She stressed that this is a personal decision. I have not yet received my copy of my oncotype test, but I see you have your own. Is there a way for you to see the estimated of recurrence with just tamoxifen (i.e. 16%) and compare it to the estimated risk of recurrence with tamoxifen & chemo (i.e. 11%)? Perhaps you can find that number (i.e. 5%) and write a list of pro's and con's - it always seems to help to see things visually in front of you. I'm not sure if this being a \"personal choice\" makes it any easier or anymore difficult for you. I've had a few other doctors ask me, how big of a gambler are you? I'm not sure if that helps or not. I've now been told by two doctors that tamoxifen is more beneficial than chemo because of the hormone status. The new doctor also told me results from the intermediate group should be released in December of this year (TailorX study), which will have more information on if chemo is beneficial to those who fall into this gray area.",

I'm 30 and newly diagnosed with stage 1A invasive breast cancer, grade 2. I just received my OncoType score, which was 20. I'm in the midst of switching oncologists for multiple reasons, however during my initial meeting with him (before the oncotype test), he told me he recommended chemo because of 1) my age (he said cancer tends to be more aggressive in younger patients); 2) my intermediate grade; and 3) my intermediate ki67 score. He initially told me I have a 15% chance of recurrence in 5-10 years, and chemo would lower that risk to 12%. I personally cannot fathom going through chemo for a 3% benefit, particularly when he mentioned tamoxifen is more beneficial in my case than chemotherapy. After receiving my oncotype score, he told me he still favors me doing chemotherapy. I've been doing quite a bit of research on my own, listening to presentations and discussions by research doctors, and reading results and pending clinical trials. Here is what I've found, and plan on discussing with my new oncologist when I meet her next week - The Ki67 score is the proliferation rate of which your cancer cells grow. The highest marker within my 1.8 cm tumor was 15%. Chemo attacks cells with a very high proliferation or growth rate - such as hair follicles or mucosol membranes. I'm not sure if chemo would \"get to\" my slower duplicating cancer cells, if there even are any present in my system (my lymph nodes were negative). I'm not sure if this is the reason there is still a chance of recurrence even after completing chemotherapy. One study I found on Ki67 (I can share the link with you if you are interested), split a range of cancer patients into 3 groups - Group 1 had a Ki76 range of 0-20%; Group 2 had a Ki67 range of 20%-50%; and Group 3 had a Ki67 range of 50% and above. Group 3 all received chemotherapy. Within Group 1 & 2, a Ki67 of greater than 20% correlated with recurrence. Within both groups, only those that were Her2-positive received chemotherapy. Over the course of 10 years, less than 10% of those patients with a Ki67 of greater than 20% had experienced recurrence. I've pulled the below from breastcancer.org regarding OncoType Scores: Recurrence Score lower than 18: The cancer has a low risk of recurrence. The benefit of chemotherapy is likely to be small and will not outweigh the risks of side effects. Recurrence Score of 18 up to and including 30: The cancer has an intermediate risk of recurrence. It's unclear whether the benefits of chemotherapy outweigh the risks of side effects. Recurrence Score greater than or equal to 31: The cancer has a high risk of recurrence, and the benefits of chemotherapy are likely to be greater than the risks of side effects. You and I both fall into the intermediate risk category, of which the benefits of chemotherapy are \"unclear.\" My oncologist tried to convince me that the ranges of these categories have changed, though that is only susceptible to the TAILORx study, which concluded that cancer patients with an oncoscore of less than 10 are safe to forego chemotherapy; the intermediate range is still in the process of being tested. From what doctors have told me, this is a personal choice - since nodes were negative, there isn't necessarily a \"need\" for chemo, but there is a (small) benefit regarding lowering a chance of recurrence. Where I stand personally, I'm not convinced chemotherapy is the way for me to go, and I have no intention of doing it. Perhaps if they told me doing chemo would inevitably \"cure\" me of never experiencing any cancer ever again, but they of course cannot say that. So I personally don't see the benefit in doing it when there is still a relatively similar chance of recurrence. I've seen and read cancer patients take the chemo, and cancer returns. I've seen and read cancer patients not take the chemo, and they've never dealt with another cancer. So to me it seems to be a crap shoot either way. If cancer is going to come back, its going to come back, seemingly regardless of what you do (in my mind - not to be pessimistic). I hope any of this helps. I'm happy to share what my new oncologists recommends as well. Best of luck, Hailey",

I'm actually meeting two new oncologists - a new one at my current hospital and I'm seeking a totally new opinion from another NCI designated hospital in my area. I will let you know if there are any discrepancies in their further recommendations. May I ask, what your \"gut feeling\" is/was? My gut feeling is that I do not need chemo. It always has been. I was very back and forth on my surgery decision (between lumpectomy and mastectomy), but I've been consistently adamant on not doing or needing chemo. I may have three doctors at the end of the day telling me this is their recommendation, but I don't foresee changing my mind on this. I became very emotional when the first oncologist told me he recommended chemo, and my response was no, I just can't do that. And he said, if I don't want to do it then I don't have to do it. So why would I do something I don't have to do? Have you revisited speaking with your surgeon or radiation oncologist about how other or additional treatments can benefit your risks without doing chemotherapy? This is something I plan on discussing with all of my doctors too. May I also ask if you have Lymphvascular invasion present or absent on your pathology report?",
