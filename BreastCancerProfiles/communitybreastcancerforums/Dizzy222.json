I went in about 2 areas of concern. 1 small nodule that developed in my mastectomy scar and pain in the rib area on the same side. They were very quick to look at the nodule, Ultrasound was clear and they will check it again next month. The rib pain didn't seem to raise much concern, she said \"we have time if it's mets, finding it now or later won't make any difference to your outcome.\" It's the second time since my diagnosis 3 1/2 years ago I've heard her make a comment like that about Mets. Everything I think I know about cancer is the earlier the better. Why isn't that true with Mets. If it was a bone met, wouldn't starting treatment sooner be better? I'm assuming once you have Mets it's already in your system but it seems to me if you let it continue to grow it would be harder to eradicate. If early intervention when you have mets doesn't change the outcome why do some people who discover they have mets with no symptoms start treatment for it. I'm clearly missing something here.",

She died 4 months after discovering her mets. They were everywhere by the time she was symptomatic. It just doesn't make sense to me to wait and see. But, I do trust my Onc for the most part, they have been keeping me going this long. It's sunny here today, I'll just go out, enjoy it and stop worrying about something that's out of my hands anyway. Thanks again for your input Chrissy. (hugs) back at ya.",

The first treatment for mets is the second best treatment available (because the best one didn't work), If you wait until you have symptoms that are affecting your quality of life, you get more milage out of the second best drug. When that stops working they try the next best and so on. There would be no point in wasting the second best drug on a minor problem. I'm actually Â starting to think I understand. Thanks again for your imput.",
