I have a lot of scar tissue that made my MRI light up but they said it was good.  They were only looking for cancer and saw none.  Depending on how you personally scar up it is possible for your scar to connect to other tissues and feel/get bigger.  I scar very well so most of my scars do not have huge lumps under them but I have known people who do just that.  They get more scarring under the skin than on top.  Kind of like a scab inside but of scar tissue.  I think that most radiologists can tell the difference and that is why your screening might be clean.  They found no cancer and that is what they are supposed to look for. They may mention scar tissue or they may not because that is considered benign and usually they do not note it....at least that is how it has worked in my case.  I would relax unless your gut says otherwise then there is no harm asking questions and digging further it is your body.  If you have already had DCIS I understand and am sure you are nervous so it might be good to see someone to relieve your stress.  Vickie",

I am curious because I know I have scar tissue from implants etc. and am being scheduled to have a MRI. Shap, As I mentioned above I have scar tissue and I do BSE's.  Eventually you will learn what your scars feel like underneath.  You can start now in feeling around getting used to it.  Some docs suggest you massage your scars/incision, once they are closed, so that they will not be as hard.   Just like your breasts before your biopsy with regular BSE's you will get to know them and notice any change.  Hope this helps, Runalot",

Bottom line is that we all need answers what ever our condition and it should'nt take a year..even multiple months.  However, what should happen and what does are two different things.  When it is not obvious what the problem is unfortunately its going to take a while. Angel, I saw the doc for follow up and of course she said it could take a couple of months for us to realize whether the implant removal solves the problem of the pain and thickening/roping.  I figured as much.  She did put in and I have a mammo scheduled for end of May.  I asked about the US because I usually get one every year with the mammo because the girls are so dense and she said that they do not do screening US here.  I said what?  She said unless the rad here sees something needing to be second checked.  The rads here are in my opinion not the best.  So I am wondering what makes them so much better here that they do not need to follow the standard  back in the states. I guess they can see amazingly through the snowstorm that others can not.  I will get one one way or another though  It is my right to full care. Vickie",

It is the first time since the MRI and I am not sure what she will want to do next.  The only thing I can think of is to have her call or e-mail the radiologist and see if he will look again and if there is gross amounts of scartissue and he just did not note it because it is not cancer related.  However, I think that any kind of thickening is suppossed to be on those reports though? What to do?  I want to close the door on cancer but my gut wont let me stop yet.  I have enlarged not huge nodes under my arm and some just slightly enlarged in the clavical area on that side that were not there prior. They do not really get worried abut them here till they reach 1.5 cm (thier criteria) mine was last measured at 1.43cm  like I said not big but not normal either.  I always thought that my breast pain swelling and shooting to the armpit was from the breast and maybe causing the swollen node could it be the other way around?  Could something be wrong with the node and it is causing the breast problems? (MY wonderful Hubby presented that Q)  OMG if not to make things worse the pea size lump I wrote about having excised in September has grown back.  It is under my aerola and a very hard bb feel to it.  The doc when he took it out said he could not get all of it as we were not in the er but a steralized room for local procedures.  He did not want t risk infection by going any deeper.  (the tissue he removed was mild chronic lobular inflamation is what the path said.   Which is good I guess I am no pathologist...no BC.  But it is back in most likley the same spot and about the same size now.  It has taken about two months for it to get this size each time.  Oh well I just wanted to know if anyone out there has had thier MRI reread by a different facillity and how to go about it if you did.

Thus finding more early cancers rising the cancer #'s.  The lower income people may receive less benefits or are not willing to pay for the procedure to find out.  Even if there is a symptom they may find it hard to pay the doc when all their money is going to put food on the table.  Thus less cancer reported... not necessarily less cancers.  They may be walking around with it because they did not get the mammo or can't afford it.  I have seen a few people writing and upset because they desperately wanted breast help and could not get some one to help them because they did not have insurance or money.  These ladies look up and call place after place.  Really it is to each thier own on whether or not one worries about mammo radiation.  I am not going to stay out of the sun as I live on an island.  I am not going to stop eating meat because of the hormones.  (I like meat and I think the protien is worth it)  There are so many things that can and I am sure do harm us.  Just weigh your priorities and beliefs.  If you do not want the mammo then do not get it.  If you do then do it.  I do it because I can and while I do it I remember those that can't.

Then there are my great aunts (3 of them), Great grandmas etc was not enough.  I have a variant but it is not considered to be important.  I hope that others who want to get past the constant chaos have better luck.  So right now I am on my second round of antibiotics for swollen nodes in the armpit neck and clavicle.  (but no technology can see anything wrong with my breasts) What a mess.  I know that some women feel a loss when they have the mastectomy and I am not naive and saying I wouldn't but it would be a relief.  Debbie let us know how it went and how you feel when you are well enough.  Vickie Runalot",

Leslie  I am sorry about your mom I know it was many years ago but if she died of BC then each time you go through a biopsy/lumpectomy I am sure it brings back some pain.  Why do you feel you are a worrier.  Isn't that what we all do about this stuff.  I think everyone I know who has been effected by the disease worries about it.  It reminds us that we are not immortal.  I think that the worrying works both ways.  It can make you really appreciate the things usually looked over.  It is stress...period.  I look at it this way... each time I have a lumpectomy I am out of the loop on my life.  The first week is all about the waiting/ stress.  Then depending on how big the lump was your daily exercise routine is out the window.  I run, so each time I get cut I am out for two weeks minimum.  Docs do not want stitches to bust.  Plus it can make the scar worse.  I am very tired of the hold button being pushed on my life.  If it was every once in a while maybe every five years a scare o.k. I can really deal with that but it has been constant for about 4 years.  In between the surgeries are the extra ultra sounds, mammos, and Dr. check ups.  It is just getting old for me.  That is why I am considering getting rid of the girls.  I am done with children so I do not need them for breast feeding.  Really they are just accessories...they are required to be there (lovely and plump) by society they are not a medical necessity.  I am not sure what I will think when it actually comes down to the decision day but those are my thought for now.  Just rambling on to let you know it is o.k./ normal to worry about it.  I am sure you and I are not the only ones  Vickie",

They can not link my problems to anything else really.  Right now the doc is thinking that maybe my implants I have had for 4 years are hitting nerves and causing the pain.  However that does not cause swelling or swollen nodes and an on again off again rash.  They are just pulling ideas out and trying things to see if they work instead of sending me to specialists with the right equipment to rule out IBC.  My breast is swollen and hurts all the time.  They have me on pain meds and even the stabbing pain breaks through that.  My nodes are not huge but they are swollen under my arm and I even felt them for the first time in my abdomen the other day.  My doc said that it was because I was so skinny.  I wish :)  I am 5'4 and 120ish.  I have been smaller and never felt lymph nodes in my pelvis area before.

Thanks again!  I will post again next week after talking with the doc",

They should read all the threads where people list thier stories and symptoms.  Learn how they are different in most all women and not as text book as they think.  I bet if they did that they would wonder a lot more about the woman who presented with \"atypical symptoms\".   Oh, and who ever mentioned the receptionist who needs a clue...I am with you!",
