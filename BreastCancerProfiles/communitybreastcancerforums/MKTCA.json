      "Content": "Dec 29, 2015 08:41AM - edited Dec 29, 2015 08:43AM by MKTCA Hi everyone, I hope that everyone enjoyed their Christmas. I've been putting my surgery off. I needed the time to research, find out options and just want to know what I'll be facing. Coincidentally we were doing some construction work in our home during the time of my diagnosis. So I was stressed out. I also wanted to pretend to have one more normal Christmas before I face the \"C\" demon. Now I'm scheduled to have a lumpectomy next Friday, Jan. 8th. After that I'm suppose to have radiation therapy and tamoxifen. Even after all my research I feel like the medical world still prescribe what they prescribe to all DCIS patients. It's very frustrating. In addition, now my oncologist is telling me that the size is much bigger than expected from original path report from the biopsy, reading from the MRI. So all these tests are just guess work then. What can I do to prep for the surgery? Is there anything I need to bring with me? Mine will be an outpatient procedure? The Dr already prescribed pain meds which I've already filled. Anything would be helpful and greatly appreciated.",
