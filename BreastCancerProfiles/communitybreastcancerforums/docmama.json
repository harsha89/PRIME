I can almost hear the click click click of the roller coaster car approaching the top of the hill - soon I'll be plunging downward into all my usual chemo SE's. Only good thing is the knowledge that in a couple of weeks the car will start up the hill again and the SE's will diminish. Getting tired of all these ups and downs though...",

I just got word from my surgeon and plastic surgeon that they want to schedule my surgery on January 6, just 3 weeks after my last TCHP on December 16. I don't know why I'm having such a hard time with this but it just seems really rushed. #5 for some reason seemed a bit harder than the others with fatigue, awful diarrhea and runny/bloody nose. I hope and pray that the last chemo doesn't hit as hard so my body can prepare for the major onslaught of surgery and reconstruction. Oh how life has changed, huh? But this is my new normal, going to work every day and trying to brush away the fog of chemo from my brain, double and triple checking my work to make sure I don't make any mistakes. I'm rambling now, so I'll stop. On a a lighter note, my husband's Christmas gift arrived yesterday. He got me a big beautiful electric recliner complete with USB ports for charging my tablet and phone. This is to help with my post-mastectomy recovery.   My daughter is at FSU, son is at University of Alabama. Big game today, Alabama against University of Florida! Roll Tide and Go Noles!!",

I took the day off from work because I had an appointment with my Plastic Surgeon this morning, so I had the afternoon to do a bit of Christmas shopping. I was browsing the aisles of Marshall's when I saw walking towards me an old friend that I hadn't seen in a couple of years. Normally I would have stopped and chatted and caught up with her, but to my horror my first instinct was to lower my head and dart in between the crowded racks of clothes. I had one of my scarves on my head and although I had a nice sweater on, i'm still uncomfortble with my \"chemo\" look. Has anyone else had this type of reaction when out in public? I really hope she didn't see or recognize me! On a lighter note, my last TCHP is on Friday, yay!!",

There is also a special drink that is taken the evening before the surgery as well as the morning of called ClearFast available on Amazon too.

The beauty of this trial for us is that there is no placebo arm - everyone gets Nerlynx. In fact, the investigational product for this trial is Immodium.

I think it would have been easier to have my surgery right after my initial diagnosis while I was still numb from the news of my cancer. The thought of surgery terrifies me. I'm also continuing with a year of Herceptin after the TCHP and mastectomy. What I'm trying to say is it's ok to let go and cry, even if it seem it's at the drop of a hat because I'm right there with you! Most of the Trolls movie soundtrack makes me burst into tears!

I'm not sure what surgery your having, but my breast surgeon was the one that put mine in 4 months before performing my mastectomy and I still have it while I continue the herceptin until September. The port is really no big deal and such a relief to have for them to both draw blood samples and infuse the chemo through. I feel awful that you had to go through that last night!

What my husband and I are doing is going to Spain in late October/early November with the vouchers I got a few months back on American Airlines for volunteering off of 2 flights in the same day (it was a business trip so i hadn't even paid for the ticket in the first place). I wound up with $1,200, enough to cover our flight! Enjoy your celebration Dennyj, whatever you call it (I like the Holy Sh*$ name myself). You kicked butt this year! We all did!! Woo Hoo!!!!!! I have a funny story from the other night that I think most of you will appreciate. My husband and I were at a restaurant and as our waitress approached our table (from behind me) she said loudly \"Good evening Gentlemen!\". She turned all shades of red when I turned to her and smiled sweetly! I laughed with my husband afterwards and told him that we are now officially a gay couple, lol! A few months ago this would have cut me to the bone, but now I can just laugh it off. It's not her fault, and I guess i really do look like a man from behind :) Besides, I kick butt remember?",

He has been involved with one of the studies that just concluded. He would prefer for me to wait to start it as there is still data coming out on the details regarding the exact protocol for prescribing. This data needs to be parceled out for each individual patient. For example, I'm hormone receptor negative but HER2+, node negative and I also received Perjeta in addition to Herceptin. The women in the trial had many different factors; about 52% were also hormone receptor positive and had positive nodes. Anyway, he wants to wait a couple of months before he makes a decision whether this would be good for me and doesn't want to jump right in. Apparently the diarrhea is a major issue with this medication. We have a window of 1 year following the last Herceptin infusion, so there is a bit of time to wait. I would rather take a breather anyway from all of this and enjoy my trip to Spain in November. Good news is that I thought I had 2 more Herceptin infusions after today, but it turns out that I only have one! I've been able to move my exchange surgery & port removal that was originally scheduled for 9/11 to 8/28. Blessings to all! We are all traveling this road together remember, and no matter what stage of the journey can all lean on each other for support. Have a wonderful weekend y'all!!",

The song \"True Colors\" just brings me to tears and reminds me of my husband and all of the loving gestures and sacrifices he's made for me since my diagnosis.

My poor husband is bending over backwards to make things easy for me, bless his heart, and I love him so for it but half the time I find myself wanting him to stop hovering over everything I do! I've still managed to keep working at least 35 hours a week, and since I have a 45 minute commute each way I take advantage of the alone time to do most of my crying. The shower is another good crying place. The one difference between us is that from the very beginning we discussed and decided on a double mastectomy, even though my tumor was confined to my left breast and was never even palpable. So many people would ask me at the beginning \"what stage are you?\" and it was such a pain to have to go into the whole explanation of neo-adjunvant therapy. Going through chemo first and then surgery can mess with your head; I've thought so many times that it would have been easier to recover from the mastectomy and go through chemo at the same time. Having surgery looming over my head all these months has been tough and it's being reflected in my emotional state. But we will get through this together - I'm so very grateful for this community of women. First thing I do in the morning and last thing at night is to check these boards to see how everyone is doing. Thank you my friends!! Angie",

I know there has been a lot of discussion about the use of minoxidil for chemo induced baldness or chemotherapy induced alopecia (CIA) regarding the possibility of losing all your hair again once the minoxidil is stopped. I've been using 5% minoxidil every morning since my next to last chemo treatment. My hair has grown back well, and grew back rather quickly PFC and continues to thicken, but then I'd always had a very thick head of hair before my diagnosis. I work with a dermatologist (I run her clinical trials) and she was the one who recommended I use the minoxidil in the first place. When I read here your concerns of hair loss after its discontinuation I searched online and could only find a few anecdotal accounts, no solid research. My doctor let me do a literature search on her computer and I found 3 studies using minoxidil: one studied hair loss after discontinuation in male pattern baldness (most of them did lose any hair that had grown in) but this does not hold true for CIA because the mechanism of hair loss is different. The others found no evidence of increased hair loss after discontinuing minoxidil for CIA. This is an excerpt from an article that appeared in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology from July 2012: The mechanism of action of minoxidil on the hair follicle is unclear. Perfusion studies on the hair follicle are difficult and do not necessarily correlate with skin blood flow. The drug has been shown to directly affect matrix cells.57 A common limitation to the use of minoxidil is the requirement for daily application. Premature stoppage will result in loss of any benefit achieved. In most hair loss, this requires lifelong application. Fortunately, in CIA, application can be discontinued once normal hair growth has resumed approximately 1 year after the final chemotherapeutic treatment. For hair loss, some dermatologists currently recommend the off-label use of minoxidil 5% concentration regardless of sex. Even though the article says that you can use minoxidil up to 1 year PFC in patients with CIA, I'm going to stop using it when I finish the bottle I'm currently using (probably in about a month). I'll let you all know if I experience any major hair loss, but I'd doubt it will happen .",

As I said in the post, I work with a dermatologist and she (and other providers in our practice) all said the same thing - Chemotherapy Induced Alopecia is quite different from androgenic or male-pattern baldness. The new hair growth for patients with CIA does not fall out after discontinuing minoxidil. I found some clinical trials on the subject and mentioned them in the 4/1 post.

I had to travel this weekend for work; first to Dallas for one meeting on Friday and then another in Austin on Saturday. The company put me on the first flight this morning out of Austin to return home. That flight was overbooked, so I volunteered to give up my seat for $500. They put me on another flight a couple of hours later. Of course, that one was overbooked as well so you-know-who jumped up and volunteered herseat again, this time for $700. When I got to the gate for the later flight they put me on that one was also overbooked. But i think they took pity on this obviously exhaustedBC survivor and gave me the last open seat in FIRST CLASS! Now my husband and i can fly to Spain to celebrate the end of my chemo and port removal at the end of October. I'm tired, but it was well worth it, don't you think? Well done, American Airlines, well done!",

In case any of you haven't heard, is this medication was just approved by the FDA for women with HER2+ breast cancer and it seems to help prevent recurrence. It's a pill that is taken for one year following completion of treatment with Herceptin. My MO has been involved with one of the studies that just concluded. In a nutshell what he said was the he would prefer for me to wait to start it as there is still data coming out on the details regarding the exact protocol for prescribing. This data needs to be parceled out for each individual patient. For example, I'm hormone receptor negative but HER2+, node negative and I also received Perjeta in addition to Herceptin. The women in the trial had many different factors; about 52% were also hormone receptor positive and had positive nodes. They also varied greatly with the type of chemotherapies they received. Anyway, he wants to wait a couple of months before he makes a decision whether this would be good for me and doesn't want to jump right in. Apparently significant diarrhea is a major issue with this medication. We have a window of 1 year following the last Herceptin infusion, so there is a bit of time to wait. I would rather take a breather anyway from all of this and enjoy my trip to Spain in November. Good news is that I thought I had 2 more Herceptin infusions after today, but it turns out that I only have one! I've been able to move my exchange surgery & port removal that was originally scheduled for 9/11 to 8/28. Blessings to all! We are all traveling this road together remember, and no matter what stage of the journey can all lean on each other for support. Have a wonderful weekend y'all!!",

I'm glad everyone is doing well post-op. Win-chimed, it's good to hear from you, now just pending Marimucho to check in for the January 6's to be accounted for! I've been home since Sunday afternoon, and my sister made it in to Fort Lauderdale Airport without incident, although my other sister who picked her up had a hard time because security was sooo tight! It's been crazy goings on here at my house since I've gotten home though! We have a lovely stomach bug going around (vomiting and the big D). Started with my daughter Sunday morning, but she was able to make the 7 hour drive back to Tallahassee (sophomore at FSU) after my husband hooked her up to an IV here at home. Middle son drove back to University of Alabama Sunday as well and by the next day was knocked out with the bug. His girlfriend had to take him to the ER in Tuscaloosa for IV's as well. Monday my husband and sister (the one who flew in) got sick. Oldest son started vomiting last night. Ugh!! I've managed to stay healthy so far. This morning everyone seems better. I had a home health nurse come to the house to check my incisions on Monday, was told they look fine. No one came by yesterday though. My PS and BS did not want me to wear any type of compression bra, just a couple of 4x4's on the incisions with one piece of tape and gauze/tape on the Jackson-Pratt drains' exit sites. PS stressed NO PRESSURE on the incisions! Still managing the pain with just Tylenol and Ibuprofen thank the lord. I have a little \"holster\" on my waist to hold the drain bulbs (ordered it on Amazon, $12.95 prime) and it has be a godsend. All 4 bulbs along with the excess tubing fit in it well and are hidden under my clothes. Sleeping in my recliner quarantined from the rest of the household, lol! I got some awful news on Monday. My younger sister had a breast biopsy on Thursday (day before my BMX) in a abundance of caution because of my diagnosis. It was just a small calcification, no palpable lump. It came back positive - DCIS grade 2. She doesn't have her receptor results yet, but the consensus seems so far that she will be treated with a lumpectomy and rads. Youngest sister has had an \"area\" on her last 2 mammograms that her Gyn has been watching and now she is freaking out. She made an appointment to see my Oncologist next week. Oldest sister (there are 4 of us) hasn't had a mastectomy in 10 years, but has one scheduled this coming Monday. The strangest thing is that my MO had been saying all along that I didn't need to get genetic testing done because there were no first-degree relatives with BC in my family, although both my parents each have a first cousin with the disease. The day of my last chemo a month ago I asked again about the genetic testing and it just so happened that the representative from the COLOR test was visiting and I was able to have the test done that day. It is a saliva test where you spit into a tube and it's mailed off to be tested for about 11 different types of genetic cancers (breast, ovarian, colon, pancreatic, etc.). This only costs $298 opposed to a couple of thousand for the blood test. I got those results back on Monday and I came up negative for all the cancers. Now I'm doubting the reliability of the test and will be seeking out a genetic counselor. Whew, and I thought 2016 was bad!! Anyway, sorry for the long rant. All my prayers go to those who had surgery in the past few days, Rosebowl16 today and the rest of you scheduled next week. God Bless you all! Angie ",

He tried to drain it, but apparently couldn't find the pocket of fluid so he left it alone in order to avoid any possible infection (he said he likes to leave them alone generally because they act as natural expanders of the skin on that side). He pushed 100ml more saline into my TE's and I feel like a little girl (remember Mike Meyers on SNL? No? - ok, I'm really dating myself, lol). I have nice perky A cups now that make my big post chemo belly look a tad bit smaller. I gained about 10 pounds, now I have to really try hard to lose that plus 15lbs more. Back to work tomorrow, then another Herceptin infusion on Friday. Arggh, I can't wait for all this to be over! Glad I have you gals to see me through.  Cheers! Angie",

My hair fell out, but I really think that it was due more to the Perjeta than any of the other 3 - you'll have to ask your MO. There are cooling caps that you can wear to decrease the chance of your hair falling out. It works for some people, not so much for others. I chose not to use one because of the cost and also because I didn't want any little cancer cells to hid up in my hair follicles and come out later to taunt me, lol. My hair is really coming in now (6 weeks since last chemo) even with the continuation of Herceptin until September. Look to see if anyone has started a chemo group for February or March; you'll find lots of information there. ",

I've had it in since the end of August; it was inserted about 3 days before my first chemo treatment. It felt strange at first, but very little pain and the procedure to insert it was not a big deal. After my BMX almost 5 weeks ago (hard for me to believe) it feels strange, as if there isn't a lot of subcutaneous fat left around it, so now i'm more aware of it vs before the BMX. They will insert it on the opposite side of where you had your lumpectomy I believe. It's not a big deal, and it's nice to have them draw all those tubes of blood from it. Ask your MO to give you a script for Emla or numbing cream and put it on before you leave the house for your treatments. I put a big band-aid over it and that works out great, although the stick for the chemo catheter doesn't really hurt that much either without it but it's nice to have.",

Hubby and I went to see Robert Cray and Boz Scaggs last weekend - I even put on one of my wigs! Fun show, it was a pretty old crowd though, lol. In April we'll see Red Hot Chili Peppers in Miami, and I just got word of a tour coming in July with Steve Miller and Peter Frampton - love those guys!! Last year we flew all the way to Montreal to see Sting and Peter Gabriel, that was a great show. Funny story: a year ago I was reading my emails and I saw a ticketmaster presale for the Red Hot Chili Peppers - or so I thought. My brother in law is a huge fan, so I called him and my sisters and told them about the concert and how cheap the tickets were. Everyone got all excited, and in no time I had all my sisters and their husbands all jazzed up about the concert, so I bought 8 tickets. The next day, I looked more closely at the email confirmation I got back. The concert was actually for the Red Hot Chili PIPERS - a bagpipe band that does covers of rock music. I don't think I'll ever live that down! PS - We had a blast at the Pipers concert!",

DaniCalifornia, the chemotherapy agents target the body's rapidly dividing cells, which are cancer cells, but also healthy cells like hair follicles, nail beds and the GI tract. That's the reason for the hair loss, nail changes and GI problems such as diarrhea and heartburn. I had both thumbnails turn dark, almost black. Also I have little dark \"lines\" going from side to side on each of my other fingernails that seem to correspond to each cycle of chemotherapy, and I think my left toenail is lifting. I just kept nail polish on them during chemo. If you go to a nail salon for your mani/pedi's, you won't be able to go once chemo starts because of the risk of infection, so make sure you get it done before the first round. This is my thumbnail at chemo #4. The dark area got bigger as the nail grew out.  ",

We paid out of pocket for it but it was $298 as opposed to thousands for the blood test. It tests for about 11 different types of cancer including BRCA 1 and 2. If you are positive for anything, all your first degree relatives can have the test done for $50. After my sister was also diagnosed with BC a few days before my BMX, we decided to submit again for the BRCA blood test. I had it drawn at my last Herceptin infusion and the lab was going to wait to send it in until they got word from my insurance that it would be covered. I wanted to have that one done as well because they will save your serum and test it down the road in case any new genes are discovered for cancer, which will offer some peace of mind hopefully for my other 2 sisters, my daughter and my niece. My COLOR test came back negative, and it took about 6 weeks for me to get results emailed directly to my inbox. My doctor got the results after 3 weeks.",

We found the same issues with fuel and with lack of food on the way back - many of the restaurants along the interstate were closed as well as the gas stations. Luckily my husband was able to fill his tank in the town just north of us so he is set for work for the week. We were pleasantly surprised to find the power had just been restored about an hour before we got home! Since we were without power for 4 days everything went bad in our refrigerator and freezer. I won't even open it up until Thursday to empty it out because garbage pickup isn't until Friday. I don't want to attract flies and have the smell in our garbage cans. Lots of branches down and one palm tree felled in the backyard, but thank the Lord our house is intact. Back to work this morning and then clean-up this afternoon when I get home. Counting my blessings! I hope everyone else in Irma's path is safe and sound.",

I had the thoracic epidural in for almost 48 hrs, and I'll tell you, it kept me very comfortable. This is a new protocol for mastectomies that my husband is developing at his hospital (he is an anesthesiologist) and it is growing more and more popular across the country. It minimizes the need for narcotics, I've only taken Tylenol and that was mostly for the sore throat from that stupid tube those darn anesthesiologists put in, lol. Seriously, you should ask about the anesthesia you will get and see if it is possible to have a thoracic epidural during and after your mastectomy. I'll keep you posted on my need for percocet later tonight, but I've been off the epidural 12 hours and am still pain free. I also have good news, the surgeon removed 2 nodes - both negative! Also my breast tissue no longer showed any signs of carcinoma so it seems I may have pathologic complete response, I'll know for sure when the final results come in. I had targeted therapy using TCHP and will continue getting Herceptin infusions for another 9 months. Breast cancer research is truly remarkable and making great strides! I hope all the women who had surgery on 1/6 are now home and recuperating. Marimucho, I hope all is well with you, your sisters are with you! Good Luck to next week's warriors! Angie",

Like the song says, we will Rise Up! My husband was playing this song yesterday while I was getting my Herceptin infusion, but he was listening because it's become the anthem for his lifetime favorite team, the Atlanta Falcons, who are playing the Patriots tomorrow in the Super Bowl. He's been a die-hard fan since he was 9 years old and has suffered through many losing seasons. Pardon my NCR (not cancer related) post! Fingers crossed for the game!! So Rise Up ladies! We've all got each other's backs.  And here is the song to inspire everyone's day! Kisses to you all!  ",

I am very interested in the Tamoxifen discussion, as my sister will soon need to decide what type of hormone therapy she will go on. She is 56 (DCIS stage 0) and is not really sure of her post menopausal status due to a uterine ablation she had about 5 years ago - no periods since then. She saw her MO yesterday for the first time and is still confused about her options. They will do blood word to determine her menopause status so that the AI's can be considered as well. The usual protocol is to finish radiation and then start the hormone therapy, right? I just want to be able to advise her gently without overwhelming her with information. Yesterday I realized something interesting. I had to give my Driver's License to the check-in desk at the hospital where I met my PS. The gentleman behind the desk looked at my picture and said it didn't look like me anymore. I'm traveling in April and wondering if I should get a new DL picture taken to avoid any issues with TSA (besides getting a letter from my PS because my TE's and port are likely to set off the metal detector). What do ya'll think?",

I ordered a Treadmill desk for my husband for Father's Day (the kids all chipped in, I paid the difference) and when I went on Amazon this morning to post a positive review I noticed the price had dropped $48.

I completely understand your concern regard this As our prices do changes instantly where we are unable to help you with the price difference Me: I don't understand. Your company should honor the price difference, especially if it occurred within the week. Other retailers will do the same and refund the difference if it goes on sale. Why shouldn't Amazon do the same?

Me: Yes please I'd like a refund of $48 for the Walktop desk I ordered for Father's Day. The price dropped in less than a week Gokul: Oh, if this is a price change issue. Then, i'm sorry we can't honor the price . Me: You can purchase Whole Foods for 34 billion dollars but cannot refund a woman suffering from breast cancer currently going through chemotherapy $48?? This is ridiculous. Target would honor this, Walmart would honor this. I am a loyal Amazon customer for more than 15 years. I feel I deserve the obvious refund of $48!! Gokul: I'm really sorry, we won't be able to offer the refund. The system won't allow us to do any concession. Me: I would take the amount in a gift card.

I know he took a skin graft from somewhere on my belly to make the areola and said that I will probably need a tattoo as well to help define it more. I had liked not having to wear a bra under t-shirts and was not totally convinced that nipple reconstruction was right for me but yesterday my husband seemed so pleased when the surgeon was marking my breasts and abdomen before the surgery that I know this was the right decision for us and our marriage.

He's been planning for this I think since the moment I was diagnosed. I'm getting a thoracic epidural which will stay in place at least 24 hours after the surgery in order to minimize pain and the need for narcotics. He's had me on an exercise program (which sadly I have not really adhered to) and special nutrition drinks to bolster my immune system. While he himself will not be my anesthesiologist, he's hand-picked one of his partners to be in the OR with me. I'm blessed to be in such good hands. Also, my kids will be able to be here to see me off to surgery but will be driving back to school on Sunday (one is at FSU in Tallahassee, the other at the University of Alabama - Roll Tide!). Sunday evening my mother-in-law and sister-in-law fly in from Atlanta and my beautiful sister from Santo Domingo arrive to help take care of me (read pamper and cook, lol).

I guess it depends on how much fat the breast surgeon is able to leave behind.

That way if you're working, you can miss Thursday, work Friday and have the rest of the weekend to recover. I was able to work during chemo but with a bit of a reduced schedule (6 to 7 hours a day rather than 8). You can do this. It can suck some days and depending on what kind of chemo you get your hair will fall out. There are cooling caps that can help minimize hair loss you should look into it. Accept all offers of help - meals cooked, cleaning, etc. You will be surprised by the outpouring of support and prayers. Finally, the 3 months really do fly by. BeachbabyK and I still have to complete one year of the Herceptin infusions every three weeks to complete the year of chemo as we are both HER2 positive. This too will fly by, I'm sure.

He only put 80cc's of saline on each side but boy oh boy are they bothering me! At least I can feel them again, lol. I got home today and saw a post on Facebook that was made by my oldest son. This child has been going through a rough patch, but with lots of encouragement and love from us I think he's starting to turn the corner. He is free-lancing as a copywriter now and finishing up his degree. Here is his post: Years ago, I worked for a company that'd send me out to bars & restaurants to host trivia nights. I'd show up with a speaker system, my laptop, little white booklets and a handful of pens. Most people would half-heartedly play, or they'd just sign up so they could hear me call out their joke team name (something like Chief Queef). It didn't really matter to me, just a way to make a quick 50 bucks. My longest run at one place was this dive bar in the middle of nowhere, it literally bordered nothing but Everglades and retirement communities. And without fail, every week, a couple would come just to see me: a really sweet short woman, and her quadriplegic husband. I can't begin to tell you how much they loved each other; I learned through many conversations over a summer their life story. They got married as kids and lived all over the country. They had kids, saw them grow up and make families of their own. They made each other happy, the whole shebang. Then he developed multiple sclerosis. The disease would have ruined any normal person's life, but you couldn't tell by this guy's smile and demeanor. Always quick to crack a joke about his situation in front of others, despite the visible struggle it took to get him from their van into the bar. And his wife was there the whole time, with nothing but a smile on her face. And today, after years of not seeing them, they popped into my head while I was driving. I had to pull over so I could cry a bit. I used to think they were the strongest couple I would ever see, until this past year. My parents went through hell and came out the other side with the devil's horns mounted on a board. Love is the ultimate team-building exercise, so find someone that'll catch you every time.  That's my boy.  Angie",

I had to battle traffic for almost 2 hours to get to my Herceptin infusion this morning (usually takes 45 minute to an hour), but I made it finally. I drove myself and forgot to mention that to my MO for him to drop the dose of IV Benadryl from 25mg to 12.5 and it didn't occur to me to ask until after it was infusing. Had to have an extra large Cuban coffee before I left the hospital. Then I had to drive north to another hospital to meet my PS about my possible TE leak. He couldn't tell for certain if it is a leak, but wasn't too concerned. I'll just have to have more frequent fills in order to keep the skin stretched. He put in 60cc's today, so I'm at about 250cc's total. Farmdream, I do get pain, especially in my back between the shoulder blades after a fill, but Ibuprofen seems to do the trick for me. They don't really bother me that much at all, I actually have very little sensation in my breasts (or should I say my foobs) since the BMX. My PS had me on fills every 2 or 3 weeks, so maybe you're getting the fills too close together? I'm sorry you're having so much pain! Now I'm off for a yummy nap! See y'all later!",

We've all had our anniversaries recently, what a strange thing to look back at the fear and angst that brought me searching all over the internets until I finally found all of you and with that a great measure of peace. How amazing to be able to walk along this difficult road of treatments and surgeries together with all of you magnificent women and share our experiences with one another. Such a blessing! I just have one surgery left, which is nipple reconstruction. I must admit that i'm on the fence about this one. I like not having to wear a bra and I fear that the new nips will show through most anything I wear. My husband seems to really be in favor of it, although I don't think he'd admit it. The year is coming to a close and our deductible will soar up to $7,000 January 1st so I'll need to have it scheduled soon. I am considering entering a clinical trial for Nerlynx (for HER2+ BC) to help prevent recurrence. My MO is not very much in favor of it because of the SE's. I just want to give it a try and not have any regrets down the road. I found the trial on my own (luckily it's close to home). Anyone else on this board taking it or considering it? Well, we went to Spain and it was wonderful! Barcelona, Cordoba, Granada, Toledo, Madrid and the Rioja wine region. Beautiful weather, lovely people and delicious food and wine. I can't wait to go back  ",

I'm surprised you didn't get a call or text from the Dr. the day before confirming your appointment as that seems to be the norm these days. I say it's their fault, not yours! I hope that you can still have your surgery on the original date of 12 January, but if it's delayed use the time to thoroughly research your type of tumor and the treatment options open to you. Has your medical oncologist discussed the pathology report with you? My surgeon also gave me an option - just remove the affected breast or remove them both. I opted for the bilateral with immediate reconstruction because 1, I didn't want to have to deal with the worry over the other breast (mammograms/ultrasounds, etc.) and 2, I wanted as much done during one procedure as I could tolerate. That will include tissue expanders with subsequent implants. There is so much information on this site, use it to your advantage. And remember we are all here for you! Angie",

I'm so glad I was able to brighten your day with that little comment - what can I say, my son is a fledgling comedian (he really is, I lose a lot of sleep over that one, lol). I will be 3 weeks post-op this Friday - stayed in the hospital 2 days and was home by Sunday afternoon. I think what really helped me in my recovery was the thoracic epidural that stayed in place for 36 hours. My surgery was at the same hospital where my husband works as an anesthesiologist. He used me as a guinea pig of sorts to get this epidural protocol approved for all mastectomy patients. This also included special nutritional drinks to increase my immunity taken 5 days before and 5 days after surgery. I had 4 drains (2 each side) that were removed on day 10 and had a SNB done on the affected side. Mobility hasn't really been an issue and my plastic surgeon had me \"walking the wall\" with my fingertips 1 week post op. The only discomfort I'm feeling now is an occasional sharp pain at the SNB site if I make a quick move. I'll see the PS this Monday, and hopefully he'll fill the expanders a bit more. He initially put about 120 cc's into each side which is like a small A cup. I hope your surgery goes well tomorrow! I'll be praying for you. Angie",
