And I do have people around me that love me but I am use to being the strong one. I am use to being there for my kids. They have been great. I use to have long hair and after it was coming out so bad, I took the clippers and finished it. My kids think that it is something. They love to rub my \"fuzz\". lol. And it makes it easier to wash. Good luck to everyone and I hope everyone have a good day today.",
