We come to accept the things we can not change.  We take every single blessed moment to heart, and appreciate all the little things that we never considered before.  Sunrises are more beautiful than we ever noticed.  The touch of our loved ones hands is more meaningful.  Our dog sitting on our lap is more comforting.  The blue of the sky is bluer. We no longer feel that we have time to be petty, judgemental, conceited, vain, or demanding.  Our attention focuses to sharing all the love we can with everyone we can for as long as we can.  We no longer are concerned about 'getting ahead', or 'having the most beautiful home', or even with how much we can shop and buy our clothes and shoes.  Suddenly, all the wordly things drop away, and we are left with a deeper understanding of who we are as a person, our true selves, and how strong, resilient and special we each are.  I love myself more today than I ever have, and in loving myself, I am able to love those around me more also. I feel for those of you with young children; but don't ever think that you are doing them an injustice or taking something away from their childhoods by having cancer and going through this... they are learning from you every day.  They see your strength, your courage, your willingness to battle through FOR THEM, and it will shape them for the rest of their lives, no matter what your outcome is.   Live each day to the fullest.....and always count your blessings; as much as we think we are miserable in our condition, there are always those who are far worse off somewhere in the world!! Off my soapbox now....",

Since hair and skin cells are some of the most rapidly reproducing, (and therefore, the normal ones that become collateral damage to chemotherapy drugs which are targeting rapidly growing cells in the body), your hair all over your body will come back faster/more again, legs, underarms, etc.  But, after a while, it will settle back to normal.  I still have some chiny chin chin hairs that I have to take care of with tweezers... but, maybe because I'll be 60 this year too ! ",

I use my MBC as a tool to educate people.  I do not dwell on the absolute negatives when I talk about it (that my chances are 1 in 2 that I will not live past 2 years as I have a very aggressive beast), but I take that line that I will be forever on some form of treatment from now on, to CONTROL the disease, there is no cure.  I also do not try to dump all my symptoms and side effects on people, but just tell them that chemo can cause some problems, but that I am handling them the best I can and I am taking every day as a gift and living in a state of joy to be here.  I also use humor to lessen their discomfort (My hair doesn't know if it's falling in our out right now, but it's only hair... most men don't have any either).  I post my 'chemo days' on FB and laugh about how it's time to go sit and get poisoned and that no one knows the fun I'm having sitting in a chair for 4 hours, etc.  My friends have responded with great enthusiasm and support and always give me a 'go girl!\" back. You should see the responses I get from being honest with people..... they go from being politely indifferent (oh how are you doing dear?) or \"clueless\" to suddenly seeing my life as I do... a gift that I am handling in my own way.  Their concern and support then becomes much more real and then, if I do need some sort of support from them, even if it's just to ask for their prayers, it becomes something they want to do and not just \"lip service\" to someone with a disease they don't understand.  The old saying is true.... just walk a mile in my shoes. BUT, there are also people who just don't get it and are always a pain to be around... LOL.  Face it, you don't need any negativity in your life; avoid them. If you have just been dx'd Stage 4, you may need some time to get used to your own feelings and fears too, so don't feel bad about hiding out for awhile... but do know that there are a lot of really caring people out there who will make you feel better by being part of your life and don't become a recluse.  Look at all of us here in this wonderful community !!!  We are here for you at any time you need to talk or vent!  We are all sisters in this fight.",

If this was your primary dx and at stage IV, I would do all that I could to fight the beast.... radiation to breast included. ",

I started the taxotere and thought that it was a breeze, but it too is becoming cumulative.  BUT, other than the increasing tiredness and some redeveloping taste/food issues, it's still not as rough as the A/C was, but the A/C was only bad for the first 5-6 days for me (I still think the neulasta is what makes the A/C suck, but my blood counts were above normal, so it works!).  Hey, I still played with my rock n roll band every weekend!!  You'll learn to adjust your schedule to fit your treatment schedule and the effects. You can do this fine!! And you have great support.   One thing I've discovered about myself.  I'm more flexible than I thought...

I've gotten myself down to 1 Diet Dr. Pepper every other day.  I'm trying to cut down on the coffee too... one a day at the most.  We don't eat a lot of sweets anyway, I've been doing the \"no carb\" thing for 3 years, so desserts/cakes/donuts, etc aren't a problem. The pork/bacon will be hard too, but turkey bacon/sausage isn't bad if you cook it right.  For my life and the life of my DH, I can do this!  I have found Stevia in the market now, and it's ok; it's VERY sweet, so you have to go carefully with it! YES, stating positive thoughts out loud is important!  All of the books and 'gurus' on the subject from Joel Osterman to Dyanetics(sp) tell us that what we speak can become manifested.  I also believe strongly and try to practice NEVER saying my negative thoughts out loud.  It's very hard... we all want to gripe and moan and groan, but negativity breeds negativity.  You ever have any friends who absolutely never had anything positive to say?  I had one, and I had to leave the friendship because her negativity about everything was a total energy drain on me and I was becoming ill from the relationship.  As positive and affirming I could be, I couldn't change her negative outlook on life and everything in the world. Since cancer hit me, I have become conscientiously aware now of those in need around me.  It's a hightened sense of awareness where before cancer, I went along my merry \"I'm ok, so you must be ok\" way.  I try to 'pay back and pay forward' whenever I can, that's why I got the band and all our musician friends to do the benefit.  And you know what?  Now they are all talking about doing another one!!  Cheryl:  I LOVE the idea of the Valentine tree... but don't forget Shamrocks for St. Paddy's Day ! ! !",

RE: Port... my surgeon told me right out front that he's going to leave my port in for 4-5 months AFTER I finish chemo.  He said they are secure and don't need to be flushed out if they're not being used except maybe every 6 months, and I think it's a 'precaution' sort of thing in case something pops back up (which it WON'T!) or if you have some other side effects, like from the radiation or something.  Anyway, I'll have my funny little thing until around August I guess.

Ok, we all know that just when we think things are going along fine and all, something rears it's ugly head (yes, Kristina knows!).  Ok, all this whole time on chemo I've had terrible constipation, taking almost a whole week to get my system 'flushing' again.  Well, for some strange reason, this last chemo session on Monday caused the opposite!!!  I've been afraid to leave the house, much less the bathroom!!  YIKES.  I don't think it's a virus or anything, because I don't feel bad at all, just everything I eat or drink comes right back out shortly with a vengeance!  Oh well...

Sisters:  Hey, did you read the news about Aspirin and cancer?  Seems like that good ol' little white pill is helpful in cancer prevention AND treatment.  I've continued to take my low-dose (81 mg) aspirin throughout treatment, except on the days of chemo or lab because it made me bleed a little more.  They are saying that studies in mice prove that it helps the chemo fight the cancer better, and also that aspirin keeps the cancer cells from 'hiding' in the body better for prevention.  They did studies the last couple of years that showed that it helped to prevent colon cancer, and of course, we all know the benefits on the heart and cardiovascular system.  SO ladies, if you can tolerate aspirin ok (no allergies or bleeding ulcers, etc) start taking the little boogers!  Link to article: http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080307/hl_nm/cancer_aspirin_dc_1 This also goes along with what I read in that book by Philip Quillen and 'beating cancer with nutrition'.

My opinion (for my 2 cents), if you two love each other, then you need to have an honest discussion about it, and not let your ego/feelings get in the way.  You have to understand that even if he does love you unconditionally, there still may be some feelings of uncomfortableness over your scars, etc.  Some things just bother people, like surgeries and disfigurations, and it takes awhile to 'get used' to them.   I had an uncle with throat cancer and he had a tracheotomy and voice tube... I don't think I ever became comfortable around him, it always bothered me a great deal to look at that (I was younger though, it probably wouldn't bother me now as much). And as far as touching, he may just be afraid of hurting you or something by touching you there!   Just talk..... be open and honest. ",

Our Whimsapalooza II cancer support benefit was very dissappointing.  We only made about $750 which is less than last year, but the biggest disappointment to me was that only about 4 of the WHIMS members showed up, none of the doctors and only the two main nurse coordinators who stayed for 1/2 hour.  The ladies didn't even support their own event.  I'm a little disgusted with the Abilene group.  You'd have to live here to understand... Abilene is home to three of the strongest \"church\" colleges in Texas...and everyone is very \"religious\", but to the point of being very hypocritical.  I'm not knocking church or religion; I'm very spiritual myself, but the dogma that is practiced that excludes even stepping into a club (and it's the nicest club in Abilene and Abilene is non-smoking too!) for 45 mins to support your own support group is amazing to me to understand.  Even Christ ate with the lepers and the sinners....  Well, enough of my soap box.  I'll let them do their own benefit next year.... It was hours and hours of work for me and I poured a lot of my own money into it and I'll let someone else head it up next year.   Am I chewing sour grapes????

(ha)  No mouth sores yet; my oncology nurse gave me a big glass of ice chips and I had to totally freeze my mouth off before and during the adriamycin infusion.... she said the 'frozen mouth' reduces blood flow to the mouth tissue and the chemo doesn't get there as easily because of the reduced blood flow.  Makes good sense to me.  Anyone else get this ice treatment during their sessions?  Is it working? (Also they told me about the 'red pee' too; I would have totally freaked first time I went to the bathroom!! ) Monday coming... new week...new challenges and opportunities.  Remember, when you are feeling your lowest, someone somewhere is thinking of you and lifting you up.   That's so awesome.",

Levine, MD - Restrict all vitamins and supplements unless approved by physician. - Nothing raw!   = only exception is bananas, recommend 1-2 a day especiall for patients receiving cisplatin containing regimens  = all vegetables hve to be cooked or steamed  = fruits (except bananas) have to be baked or cooked; baked apples are tasty and very healthy too  = no salads or tomatoes  = no raw onion, Garlic with extreme caution - Dairy   = all raw and unpasteurized mild products should be avoided      - raw milk, buttermilk and cream cheses and unpasteruized soft cheeses    = hard cheeses are fine and are recommended    = yogurt - on the ones that have LIVE cultures (not prepared with live cultures)  Know of only two brands: \"Stony Field Farms\" and \"Dannon\", use the Dannon regular, not fat free.  This is also true for frozen yogurt;  no ice cream, unless it is soy or rice. = Other sources of protein: Boost or Ensure, recommend at least one or two a day, they have the perfect proportion of essential amino acids, simple sugars, fats as well as some vitamins and, most important, minerals that are essential for healing.  If nothing else these can be used in cereal instead of milk.  Many patients substitute their morning chocolate drink with the chocolate \"Boost\".   Also protein mixes from health food stores are fine unless they have excessive vitamins and amino acids. - Meat/Fish   = all well cooked - Avoid greasy and spicy food - Limit alcohol and caffeine - Use stool softeners two to five days after chemotherapy (docusate sodium, \"peri-colace\")   = anti nausea meds can cause severe constipation; milk of magnesia is preferred, avoid senna based products and 'bulk' laxatives.",

(Don't do this when shampooing, it is too long for the shampoo to sit on the hair and will dry it out).  There are some electric vibrating devices that have a scalp massage attachment, has little nubs all over it, feels great but tickles too. Exercise:  Cardiovascular exercise, again, increasing blood flow all over the body Eat nutritionally (I think we are all trying to do that)! FACT: Hair grows slower in cold weather!!  Wait for spring and you'll see a difference! Karen R:  Great on starting the next phase: Radiation therapy!  Ulla: Glad to hear you are on #19 and just now getting red. My onc told me it takes a couple of weeks usually.  Yes, it feels like a sunburn, even if you're not red; that's why we have to be so careful of our skin.  She gave me some Auquafor..it's made by Eucerin and sold in drugstores, it's like vasoline though.  Don't know if I can handle that on my skin!  I use a natural/organic lotions from Burt's Bees...one that is rather stinky but is amazing, \"Healthy Healing, Carrot Nutritive\" (the bad smell goes away after it absorbs), and \"Thoroughly Therapeutic, Honey & Orange Wax\", it's great too, but very thick and hard to get out of the bottle (it's the wax, I'm sure!)  I'm going to keep using these with Aloe Vera gel.",

Here's a LOVELY thought I got in my email... Thank you ALL for being in the fabric of the quilt of my life!!! GIRLS IN MY CIRCLE   When I was little, I used to believe in the concept of one best friend, And then I started to become a woman. And then I found out that if you allow your heart to open up, God would show you the best in many friends. One friend is needed when you're going through things with your man. Another friend is needed when you're going through things with your mom. Another will sit beside you in the bleachers as you delight in your children and their activities. Another when you want to shop, share, heal, hurt, joke, or just be. One friend will say, 'Let's cry together,' Another , 'Let's fight together,' Another , 'Let's walk away together.' One friend will meet your spiritual need, Another your shoe fetish, Another your love for movies, Another will be with you in your season of  confusion, Another will be your clarifier, Another the wind beneath your wings. But whatever their assignment in your life,  On whatever the occasion, On whatever the day, Or wherever you need them to meet you with their gym shoes on and hair pulled back, Or to hold you back from making a complete fool of yourself .. Those are your best friends. It may all be wrapped up in one woman, But for many, it's wrapped up in several..  One from 7th grade, One from high school,  Several from the college years, a couple from old jobs, On some days your mother,  On some days your neighbour, On others, your sisters, And on some days, your daughters. (And many days, the October 2007 Chemo Girls!!) So whether they've been your friend for 20 minutes or 20 years,   Pass this on to the women that God has placed in your life To make a difference.  ",

I can sleep/rest most of the day before having to go back to Abilene on Sat. night.  Shoot... I was really looking forward to this.  It's my fault, because I wrote JULY 26-27 on my calendar .. but it's in June.  DUH!!!    I think on Friday night at the mall where we're playing, I'll get donations for my 'walk' and see if I can't raise some $$ !!!  At least, at 1:30 in the morning it's going to be COOL and not 100!!!!",

I am going to make it again!\" and thank God for seeing you through it.  Don't ever feel guilty for feeling 'pissy' or blue.  WE HAVE THE RIGHT!   But, we don't have the right to lay around in that feeling and let us swallow us up though.  Keep fighting, keep your eyes on the next day..the next week, and just like all those who have gone before us, we will make it!!  We will heal, we will continue to live and love life, and we will be stronger women for it.

Today I am HUMAN again !!!  I will survive!!!  (dancing like Donna Summers.....ha) Ulla:   Give your body time to heal.... be patient, it will get better!  It has undergone a huge attack, not only the surgery, but the chemo too.  Take the days that don't hurt and be glad for them.  Take the days of pain and file them away under, 'the next day will be better'~ Unfortunately, now that I feel better, I have a PILE of work on my desk to get to.... ugh...",

LOL  I thought I was going to get four rounds of A/C and four of Taxotere.  BUT, yesterday I was informed I'm getting 12 weekly rounds of Taxotere, so I won't be done with chemo until end of February.  What makes that ok?  My onc said that they have found that using 12 reduced doses weekly with less steroids and no neulasta needed has far less side effects than the 4 big doses of Taxotere given every 3 weeks.  So... I'm ok with that.  I felt fine yesterday and very good today.  I'm sure this stuff will be cumulative, like they all are, so I expect I'll pick up more s/e's as the treatments go on, but I think this will be SO MUCH better than the A/C.  I didnt' even have \"steroid loopies\" yesterday.  Course, they give you a bunch of benedryl...so I slept all the way home.  LOL Coach and Hotmedic:  We seem to be close on cycle.  I'm reading your posts carefully to see what's ahead for me! Kristina, Karyll, Deb:  PRAYERS daily double dosing for you!!!  I'm so sorry you are having hard times and all these complications!!!  I actually feel guilty for feeling good when so many of you AREN'T!!! Lori:  Thank you for giving us a head's up on that....we'll be better prepared.  It's common after big weddings or other big life events too, you know, all the tension, stress, etc that you live with for weeks, and then bam, when it's over, CRASH. Hate it:  Hang in there honey!!  I met a lady yesterday who absolutely dreads/fears her chemos, and she's got a lot to go (ovarian ca).  When she gets there, to distract her from all the anticipatory panic, she puts on a sleep mask that she sprays with one of those 'relaxing/calming' scents that doesn't make her sick and plugs in her mp3 player and she says that way she can 'go into her own world and not be in that place' for a few hours.  Try anything to distract yourself.  Tell the nurses to squeeze a little lemon on top of your ice chips to make them tastier.  But, they do work... I never have had a single mouth sore...they are worth it!!! Hugs to Evy and Ulla and all the rest and hope I got everything right!!!!   Cheryl:  My cold has hung on for 14 days now... just that naggy old lingering cough.  Hope yours goes away faster than that!!",

I have a little story to share.  I met a beautiful lady just last week after chemo when I was getting my oil in my car changed.  I say beautiful, because her little 1/2\" of fuzzy hair was just a little longer than mine is now.  After introducing ourselves and both telling that  we have breast cancer, she told me she was diagnosed a little over a year ago.  She was in the last part of her chemotherapy about 6 months ago when she started having severe headaches and they discovered it had metastisized to her brain....even during chemo!   She has three tumors in there.  She told me that she prayed for three days and nights before she decided to make a trip to the Cancer Center of America in Illinois.  They paid her airplane ticket and she spent two weeks there undergoing all sorts of tests.  She was actually leaving the next day (last Tues) to go back with her son and have brain surgery.  They told her that if they could get most of the tumor out, then they would begin chemo again and with their other treatments they can give her a lot more time; even beat it.   As I was listening to her, I was found myself wondering what I would do if they found it somewhere even before I was done with all my treatments??  What would I do?  I hate chemo!  I have thought before that if this comes back, would I go through all this again?  I was watching her face as she talked, and all of a sudden, she grabbed my hand, almost like she KNEW what I was thinking, and she looked at me with the most radiant look in her eyes, and said, 'I don't know what the future holds, I don't know if they can cure me or not, but I believe in them and I trust in my Lord to help me through each and every day that I have left, and I realize that I may have a few months, or a few years, but I also know that I could be killed in a car crash or have a heart attack and die tomorrow... and whatever it takes, I want to be here for my children and my grandchildren until my Lord tells me in true spirit that I have fought the good fight and it's time to let go\".    I couldn't do anything but give her a big hug and tell her I'd be praying for her too.  And I have been, every day.   And I'm praying for each of us too, and Kristina has been moved to the top of the list. It's a long story, I know.. but I just know that she was right.  I see it in the chemo room and in my WHIMS group too.  I see the people who are going through it all again...for the third or fourth time... and who STILL HAVE THE COURAGE to go on living and fighting!  I see Julie, who weighs about 80 pounds and doesn't have hardly any internal organs left because of all the surgeries she's had in battling ovarian cancer for the past 10 years... but... she's had 10 years and she's still going!  And she laughs, and she loves, and she lives and she says, \"Every day is a gift from God, and I celebrate it\". Dearest Kristina:  DON'T GIVE UP.... and don't give in to the thought that you haven't beaten it.... just say you haven't beaten it YET!!!  ",

Cheryl:  the SNOW!!  I miss big snows (but not the cold).  When I was small in Colorado, my dad used to throw us off the porch into the big drifts and then pretend he was cold and going back in the house and we would be yelling and screaming, then he'd come dig us out and 'save us'.    I love making snowmen too!   BUT, I also understand about not being able to go anywhere either!!   Folks are saying this is the last of the bad winter.... we'll see.",

LOL)  It is getting too warm for wigs and hats, and now that I have a tiny bit of hair, they actually itch and sweat more.    My step-sons were here for spring break a couple of days this week and they loved my hair, said I really looked \"COOL\".   So, I've decided to go bareheaded next week when I put on my big annual Ob/Gyn state meeting as well.  Most of the doctors on my board know I have bc anyway; it will be a surprise to the others, but, hey, they are doctors, and they are the sweetest in the world.  Everyone loves their Ob/Gyn, right?   Besides, I have this great t-shirt to wear on Saturday (informal day) that says \"I'm Too Sexy For My Hair\".  :))) EVERYONE HAVE A BLESSED EASTER AND MAY GOD'S LOVE SURROUND YOU AND FILL YOU WITH RENEWAL AND GRACE!!!",

We had a great weekend; had a 'roaring 20's' themed wedding with about 100 in our back yard.  I'll have some pictures posted on my webshots page soon with the band's award show and you'll get a kick out of it.  It was a lovely wedding and they all looked so cute in their red flapper dresses.  BUT, I'm pooped and it was a lot of work.  Next time some one asks me if they can get married in my back yard, I'll think twice about it!

Our bad cold snap is over... back in the 50's-60's again.  I feel for all of you in IN, KY, TN, OH... I hope you all have power and are staying in snug and warm!!  Two days of 14-24 here is impossibly ridiculous for Texas!!!   Living in Tucson would be really nice............ LOL!!!",

Hotmedic: You poor thing!  Are you getting any bone marrow boosters?  I hope you feel better quick with the transfusion.  Are you getting steriods too?  As a nurse, you know that the mood changes and lack of focus/concentration, jumping out of your skin can be s/e of those.  I get it real bad the first week after my treatment.  I make it a point to take a walk, slow and steady, around our block (2.7 miles...some block!), counting to 100 and then singing a song, and back and forth, except on my neulasta days when I'm a couch potatoe and don't care.  The exercise is good for the seratonin levels (and the constipation too!), the concentration on counting helps me focus, and the songs, well, I have to learn them for our band.  LOL   Seriously, try some mild exercise, even if you have to buy a DVD or VHS.  I know I'm blessed to live in Texas... today the temp was 86.  Gotta love it.  (Ooops, sorry you cold northern people dealing with winter coming on!) MsFris: Welcome!  I'm going to stop griping about all my trips to Abilene now (45 mins)... and again, my hat off to those of you with children at home going through this!!  I agree with Lori G:  Just reading all the posts gives me laughter, a boost, companionship, blessings, hints of what to do for my s/e, and mostly gives me a reason to stop thinking just of myself and dwelling on my problems and concentrate on those who are having more difficulty, which makes my prayer list very long every night  (a good thing when you can't go to sleep!)  Treatment #3 Monday.  I've got chemo brain; I know a couple of others are going Monday too, but can't remember who.  I'm going to have to start a notebook!",

But I can't even tolerate thinking of them now. I have incredible indigestion no matter what I eat or drink.  I'm only hoping it clears a little by Turkey Day! About the trouble breathing/heart racing... I get that too, and I'm not sure what it's from, the neulasta, the chemo, the steroids, or all of it!  I just sort of all a sudden need to sit down and rest, like I hit a wall suddenly. I went \"nekked\" at the club with the band last night... no wig (it was so hot in there anyway), I just put a couple of temporary tattoos on my head, it was fun and got a lot of laughs, especially from some of the 'biker' guys who shave their heads too.  Chins up ladies!!  Another week is starting, and we'll get through it just like last week!",

Last A/C treatment yesterday, and LAST neulasta shot today !!!!  HOORAY.  I feel like I've graduated...or almost (after the next couple days on the couch).  Next on to Taxotere.  Thanks, Kara, for saying it's not too bad.  I've heard it's not like A/C. Karyll, tell me what happens with you as you will be starting before me. Ulla:  Good for you.  I have found having the \"BIG C\" has been very liberating.  After facing your own mortality, and knowing that you will beat it or beat at it with all you have, then you find that you don't really care what people who don't know you or don't have a clue about you think.  They don't matter.   I was in Cracker Barrel over our Thanksgiving trip, and there sat another lady with just a bit of 'new fuzz' coming in (post chemo).  I took off my hat, baring all, saluted her, and we both said \"God Bless\", and had a big smile from everyone sitting around us.  I have not had any 'shocked' or uncomfortable reaction from anyone, because I always look them in the eye with a huge smile and a laugh.  Who can respond negatively to that? Cheryl, so sorry about your aunt.  My mother had lung cancer and they didn't do chemo either, but she was so debilitated and had so many metastesis that the chemo would have killed her before the lung cancer.  We all agreed it was for the best not to treat it.  And, I'll be with you and the chicken soup/applesauce for the next few days... that and baked potatoes are all I can tolerate for about a week.  Belated Birthday wishes Debbiel!!  Kristina:  Bless your soul!!  If there was a S/E Queen, you get my vote!  But, once again, you will come through, and they can't get your spirit!!  My eyes have been very gummy/runny too, and although I have some left, it's a trick to put on mascara each day...feel like I'm painting each lash one by one by one.. LOL  I've been told to be careful of eye makeup; make sure you are using new mascara/shadow.  Because you have lost some of your eye's protection (the lashes) the bacteria from old mascara/etc can move in. I'll be on the couch next couple of days... neulasta and this darned cold.  It's not bad, but you know how the congestion/cough, etc, makes you feel ... on top of the chemo.   UGH. HUGS to all the rest of you, I love your postings and even when I'm not up to responding, I read them all diligently and with the warmest of feelings!!  It's amazing how much I feel for all of you and we're still almost strangers, just getting to know each other....!!!",

It has also proven helpful to people with any type of chronic illness, such as arthritis, M.S. or fibromyalgia. The Lebed Method is fun, easy to do and helps participants to: Check with your cancer services and see if there is a chapter in your area! Hope those of you in the blizzard area are ok.  Talked to a friend in Kansas who was without power for 6 days.  UGH!!! HUGS for now.... Praying for everyone !!!  Where is ULLA????? ",

I was mistaken about the followup scans every 6 months.... other than at your doctors discretion, they are not recommended unless you prove symptomatic during your check ups and physicals, which should be done every 3 months for the first 2-3 years, then every 6 months.  This makes sense as all these tests (MRI, pet scans, CT scans, xrays) have their own risks (even causing cancer) over time.  But the followup complete physical exams and mammograms are very important....don't miss them. The current recommendations from the American Society of Clinical Oncologists (which I hope your oncologist is a member of) for followup of breast cancer patients can be found at: http://jco.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/full/24/31/5091 It's kind of some scientific talk, but you'll understand what they are saying. ",

Re: Lumpectomy vs. mastectomy.  It is a very individual choice, and has to do with your diagnosis and family history, etc.  I have no breast cancer in my family, I had a very small lump (too bad it was in my lymph glands that far, but...) and the receptors, etc, were negative.  So, the trauma/healing time of a mastectomy wasn't really a logical choice.  Lumpectomy was the best solution.  However, I did consider it for a moment; it would be nice to believe that if we cut those things off the cancer would never return.  That's not cut and dried either; the cancer cells are already floating around in our bodies (that's why we do chemo and radiation) and they can land and grow anywhere.  I believe more in having faith that God and medicine are curing me and I won't battle this ever again, and I also believe that it's important to NOT LIVE IN FEAR of it returning.  Fear robs you of your life and your spirit, and even though I will be diligent and watchful in the future, I refuse to let this rule my life from now on. To those of you who are facing reconstruction and new boobs, I applaud you for enduring yet more surgeries and healing and I am there with you in prayer and thoughts as you continue this journey of wholeness.  That's what it's about, becoming whole again in whatever manner we chose for our individual selves.  We each know what our own \"personal wholeness\" must be.

People come in and out of your lives for many reasons.  You never know what little thing you do or say will have a major impact.  We always think of  only \"influencing\" people we are around a lot, like our families and close friends.  You never know when a total stranger will be affected by something small, or, who will affect you.   Little story here:  When I was finishing chemo, I heard one of our popular radio DJ's (a gal, Tiffany) on the local Classic Rock station (Hello! I'm going to listen to anything else when I play in a rock and roll band?? ha)  She was saying how she had a big scare that week, found something and had to go have a biopsy, was sweating it for four days, all the anxiety, etc, her mom crying, and waiting for the reports.  She wasn't asking for any pity or attention, she just wanted her listeners to know why she wasn't her usual crazy self on the air (she's a real hoot!)  I casually emailed her a little note about staying positive, realizing that most biopsies are negative and a little about my journey, etc.  I honestly don't remember exactly WHAT I wrote her, I just wanted her to know that someone cared and was praying for her.  The next day, she reported that the scare was over and everything was alright.  Now, jump ahead a couple more months.  This DJ is one of our band's strongest supporters.  She will talk about us on the air, tell people to come see us, talk about where and when we're playing, etc, and she comes to all our shows.  She doesn't do that for any other band.  All this time, I thought she really loved our band (she does, by the way..ha) but last night she told everyone that it was because of me and my little email...she said she'd never been so touched by a total stranger and that she would be in our corner forever.    I was awestruck, and the power of one simple little action was brought home.   This revelation came at a very important time for me.  I lost a very special friend (my son's fiance) who was killed in a car wreck on Friday morning.  We are in terrible grief here; my poor son lost a very special woman, and I lost a very special friend.  She was an amazing woman who gave and gave and gave and took no s**t from anyone.  She was 4'10\" of grit and grace, she's been a prison guard for 18 years, had 3 children of her own and adopted 3 others, and was an inspiration to everyone who knew her.  Today, instead of grieving deeply, I am committed to taking a few choice 'actions' that she gave to me, and continuing to pass them forward to others I may come across... she would like that very much. Thanks to all of you who have given me so much too...!   I want to see pictures of the new redheads... :))",

(still haven't figured out where the batteries go...) and then I'll start the new duo first week of January.   I'll check in here, and believe me, I'll be listening to your advice and asking questions!  I wish all of you, and your loved ones, a very blessed and Merry Christmas/Holiday Season (see, I'm politically correct!)...

It IS possible to get more mets while in treatment if the treatment isn't working.  I was on Xeloda and Gemzar and Navelbine, and my disease progressed, but only in my bones where the initial recurrence was, because they just weren't effective.  If she's is on first chemo (recent dx and first treatment) it is highly unlikely that she will develop mets this close to diagnosis, if her primary scans were clear.   Fear is our worst enemy in this disease... we fear that every ache and pain is \"more cancer\".  Even after treatment stops, whenever we have our repeat scans, we are fearful of what might turn up.  Living in fear is not living at all.  Living with hope and courage and faith will bring much more peace of mind, and will also affect your body.  We are what we think...if you think you have more cancer, chances are down the line you will.  BE POSITIVE.   Your friend will be ok.",

BUT, sometimes it can be permanent\"...so, get them on it fast.   I'm having it in my fingers and toes and I've only had 2 treatments.  I have lots of family with diabetic neuropathy so I know the symptoms.  Hands/fingers feel 'funny', like kind of waxy coated, but at the same time tingly and hyper-sensitive.  It can progress to not being able to hold things or feel things you are touching (very late stage). The kicker is that all the steriods they pump you with can cause some numbness/tingly feeling in the hands too... so don't panic, but the steriod induced tinglyness goes away in a couple of days.  I get it in my legs for 2-3 days after steroids and it makes me feel like I have 'restless leg syndrome\".

Karen R:  Good deal on the 'sling'... I'm headed that way myself, but hope to get all this chemo/radiation done and have it next year.  My insurance company already has me 'red-lined'...LOL    I worked for one of the top urogynecologists in the country for 20 years, and I'll be headed back to him to have mine fixed. Hubby is home sick today with me... we're trying to sleep, but sinuses are so bad we can only snort and cough and gasp.  They put him on antibiotics, and I'm calling my onc to see what I can do.  The good news is that there is also a very bad diarrhea/vomiting virus going around town too.  Who can say, \"how much more fun can we have??!?!?!\"  I'm staying in bed....",

Terry:  Yes, get walking!  It will help your stamina and energy.  Keep it up for as long as you can.  I had to stop after my second A/C treatment (just felt too drained!), but now that I'm on Taxotere, I'm back to step aerobics and pilates class again!  I'm feeling my \"MOJO\" come back. Linda!  Thanks for the heads up on coloring hair too fast... my hubby's been asking when he can have his \"redhead\" back.  I'll just have to tell him to be patient! Ulla!  Hope you feel better soon... I know you feel better on the steriods, but believe me (I have an aunt with Lupus) you would NOT want to be on steriods for long term!  Many worse side effects!  Ladies:  I just had the best informative meeting with our women's cancer group tonight.  A gentleman from our area who was dx'd with non-hodgkins lymphoma throughout his body (over 40 egg sized tumors) a year ago and who is totally in remission today.  His personal faith message was wonderful, but his focus is on nutrition to keep cancer from coming back.   I will provide some of his  information in future messages, but did you know that cancer feeds on sugar?  I did; they even give you a big dose of sugar before your PET scans because it 'highlights' tumors growing. (message here, stop eating anything with processed sugar, switch to Stevia/honey/raw sugar in small amounts)  Also, cancer hates oxygen... the better you breathe (big deep breaths in and out, pushing that ol oxygen throughout your body) the worse cancer likes it!   There are some cancer treatment centers that are currently doing trials on oxygenation chambers where patients with metastesis sit and breath enriched oxygen air a couple of times a week....results are looking promising. Amazingly, I believe that God was speaking to me about my diet even before my cancer diagnosis.  This past summer I starting studying and reading about alkalyzing/Ph diets and I attempted to switch a lot of our diet to healthier eating (we only have red meat once a week, two meatless dinners a week, lots more veggies and fruit, etc); now I am hearing daily more and more about the subject of nutrition and health.  Even Montel Williams has reduced his MS symptoms through his new diet (new book out) Go figure.....I'm 55... hope it's not too late to teach an old dog new tricks! Brochitis is getting better with antibiotics... I agree... sick and tired of being sick and tired!",

I need to put a new one up, the benefit we did where I let everyone sign my head/neck/shoulders was in December.  It was fun! The sugar thing is TOUGH.... But, if you can cut back as much as possible, that's the key.  Cancer feeds on sugar; therefore, the less sugar you eat, the less food the cancer has.  I do enjoy my hot cocoa... I just buy the sugar free one.  I am using the Stevia a lot now; I'm getting used to it.  And most of my 'sweet' comes from fruits and a little bit of honey.  When I get a real craving, I get a teaspoon of p-nut butter and honey and slowly lick it... MMMM.  The nutrition guy and several others told me that as you 'get off the sugar' wagon, it gets easier; your body adjusts and doesn't crave the sweets anymore.  I find that easy to believe, because my M-in-law is diabetic, and after a couple of years of 'no more sweets', she never wanted any anymore and just doesn't have any cravings! Lori:  glad to hear from you, and that your sister is doing good!  Prayers work, I swear by them!  How is your radiation going? I went back to step aerobics tonight after missing a week because of the bronchitis, and they kicked my post-chemo butt.... I'm going to take some Aleve and go to bed.  I want my MoJo back!!",

It's a rock and a hard place that our country has us in as far as insurance/medical care.  Even if you find a good job with good insurance, they may still deny you because of a 'pre-existing' condition!!  It's crap.  We have the best health care in the world, and it's so full of holes and problems that need fixing!!  Talk to your cancer center about possible solutions.  Maybe there is a job at the hospital you might be interested in.  My experience has been that the medical profession 'takes care of it's own'... even if you have a 90 day or so period without insurance with them, many times they will 'comp' you some of the services if you need it. Also, the medical field is one right now that isn't suffering from layoffs and cutbacks!  I don't know what job you did before, but there are lots of jobs in the medical profession; clerical, technical, even just cooking and housekeeping services, the gift shop, etc.  Some hospitals even have tuition assistance for on the job training too like nurses aids, lvn's, or school that you can attend to become more technical, like an ultrasound tech or stuff.   Glad to hear you're doing better hon... despite the Taxol and the night pee pee breaks.. LOL  This too shall pass ! !   Get that puppy trained!",

I'm going to keep being patient.   But I'm glad to have my 'red' back; I didn't like the grey at all!!   I LOVE LOREAL!!  Yes, this Thanksgiving is very special.  Last year was a fog really; surreal like Karen said.  The whole process was like being in some bad dream at times (especially the steroid days...LOL)  Please pray for my friend, Susan, from my WHIMS group.  She has ovarian cancer.  Her mom (71) moved down here about 8 months ago from Ohio to help take care of her while going through chemo and surgeries.  Her mother was then diagnosed with ovarian cancer in early October too!!  She had her surgery in Dallas about three weeks ago, but she didn't make it; she had a heart attack and died a week after the surgery.  Susan is an only child and is left to deal with the house in Ohio, her mothers affairs, and her own illness on top of losing her mother.  Please lift her up in prayer.   Whenever you think your life sucks.... a bigger vacuum cleaner shows up, doesn't it. I know my October Chemo Girls...(My Sista's!) prayers work..... !  I've seen and felt them!!!   LOVE to all of you!!",
