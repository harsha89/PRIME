I was recently diagnosed with breast cancer April 15, 2010.  From that date to now has been a big blur.  What happened to April? After my mammo and ultrasound and the final biopsy that confirmed my diagnosis I've been non stop preparing for this battle.  First met with my surgeon and then my oncologist.  They have decided the best approach to this is to first start chemo then surgery.  I went last Tuesday to have my port put in, and I will begin my first chemo treatment tomorrow (Thursday May 6).  I'm scared to death of course just as many of you were as you faced each of these hurdles.  However, I am a believer in the power of prayer.  And I do know in my heart God in control of everything that happens in our lives.  It might always be what we would consider the best for us.  But there is always a reason for everything.  Up to this point in my life there have been many battles with one thing or another, those battles only made me stronger to be able to face this valley I'm preparing to walk through. I am so glad I heard about this website from the Susan Komen message board.  Soooo many survivors stories there.  I truly can relate to so many of their stories so far.  So as I begin this chemo journey I looking for friends that have or currently beginning this journey also.  All of this is so new to me I'm not positive yet of the cocktail.  I do remember my oncologist using the initials ACT.....every 2 wks , 16 wks.  I'm really looking forward to talking to anyone and everyone as we battle this.",

My daughter told me about reading the information on the cool caps to prevent less of a hair loss.  I'm checking with my onco today when I get there....but I will also be sure I keep the ice coming strong.  I have a tendency to get fever blisters and canker sores pretty easy.  So I want to ward off those things as much as I can.  In fact I don't know if it is the stress over everything or if it had something to do with the MRI and PET, but I did get a fever blister, thank goodness its now healing and has gone away.  I swished my mouth a little last night with some warm salty water because I was bit the side of my mouth while eating and I didn't want that to start the cankers. Its terrible that we all had to meet because of this monster, but I'm so glad God provided this group as support.  I thanked God this morning for the earthly angels and the heavenly angels he has placed around me through this.  You girls have a good day and stay strong!  I'm leaving now to go set with my new special friend....\"The White Recliner\".  Why couldn't they have made it pink or blue with cushions?  Infact why don't they even add some BLING to the room?  Maybe I will put that in the suggestion box.....Love you girls already....Have a glorious Day....DonnaDoodle50",
