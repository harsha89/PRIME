      "Content": "Feb 15, 2018 04:39PM - edited Feb 15, 2018 05:14PM by Sharrose I just wanted to share, I have had nausea after radiation treatments to my left breast the entire time. It starts 15-30 min after treatment, It is mild but last an hour or two. I have had no other side effects. My doctor said, he has had only two out of fifty patients with this but our description is the same. He said he would now include it in his list of possible side effects. I have just two more treatments to go out of 35.",
