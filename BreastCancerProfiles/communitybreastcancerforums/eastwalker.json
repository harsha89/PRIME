She lives in Hawaii and we are trying to assist her from long distance. A couple of questions for you: 1) For those who have done this, what is your opinion about the effectiveness of a remote second opinion? 2) How does someone locate a ccc that a) specializes with stage 4 breast cancer patients, and b) is a 'good' one? 3) How does one evaluate the results that a ccc has with their stage 4 patients, e.g. are there any web sites that provide this information? Thank you in advance for your thoughts and opinions. Enjoy the present moment. Log in to post a reply",
