However, I guess if it would deliver fast pain relief in case it's needed, that would be okay. Did everyone have a tube put into their breast? They suspect a interductal papilloma but are going to put in some kind of marker. Does that mean I will eventually have surgery to totally excise the lump? Or do they put that in just in case it is not benign and I have to have surgery? ",

I had the core needle biopsy two days ago and it was not at all painful (just like everyone said). The doctor just called and gave me the results....a fibroid, fatty, benign tumor. I am super relieved. I was told that if I wanted to be super, super careful, I could have a followup ultrasound in six months but that the radiologist wasn't even recommending that. Thanks again for everthing.",

I am having a core needle biopsy done next week and am very nervous that they will find something else. I know all the statistics but am still nervous, not sleepy, agitated,etc. I have questions about it even if (hopefully) it is an interductal papilloma. Do they always surgically remove the papilloma? If so, how long does it usually take between the biopsy diagnosis and surgery? Is it just a lumpectomy or more? I realize a lot of the answers depend on just what they find and what my particular doctor recommends. However at this point, I am just looking for some answers that might calm me down. I do much better when I know what I am up against. THANKS>",
