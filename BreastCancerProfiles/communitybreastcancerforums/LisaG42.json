My Lupus is at full flare right now, and I pray That I have the strength to fight it all. I have been taking it very easy (which is so hard for me to do!) Thank god for the pain meds! I took a shower this morning, and my bandage came off, and oh  my what a terrible scar this is going to leave! I am just lucky that we went on to the ER that night, beacuse my best freind pointed out if I would have went on to bed, I would have bled to death. I am going to switch Drs, I have no trust in this one at all now. The office did try to compress the hemotoma, but they said it had clotted, boy were they wrong. Like I said I am glad to be alive right now. I will post the Path report as soon as I know. Thanks again for all the wonderful support this board is giving me! Lisa",

Well about 7pm that night my breast was bleeding, and the hematoma was the size of a grapefruit. Went to the ER where the breast dr on call tried to drain it, and before it was over I had to have emergency surgery! The mammatone cut through a blood vessel, and I was bleeding to death. They had to put me to sleep, and caurtirize the vessels. I had to have three units of blood during the surgery (about a 4 inch incission). I am now scared to death about the cancer spreading. My lupus is fully active right now, swollen lymph nodes, fever, and my hair is falling out real bad again. I am so angry with the Dr. I will get my biopsy results back Monday. Has this happened to anyone else? Sorry to ramble but, I feel like I am living in the twighlight Zone. Lisa",
