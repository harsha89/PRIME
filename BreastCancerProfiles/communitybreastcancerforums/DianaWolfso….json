I'm not the most medical savvy person but I have to say it was written in a way that I totally understood. Some of those other books out there are too technical for me. The stories meant a lot to me and I really related to Madey and Lisa because they didn't test positive for BRCA. I learned so much. The website is www.previvors.com.   Bless you all! ",
