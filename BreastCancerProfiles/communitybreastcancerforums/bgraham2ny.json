Fear not.  I had my first chemo treatments 2/11/08 and I was very stressed out over it.  But I have been so fortunate thru all of this.  I had a port put in a couple of weeks ago, only for the fact that they cannot use my left arm for bp, iv, draw blood, etc because of the lymph nodes (20) they removed.  And the right arm wouldn't be able to handle all the treatments.  But anyway, I had not one symptom after the first treatment.  My Dr. gave me a ton of nausea medication and it must have helped.  Then once between treatments, she gives me a shot to boost the white blood count.  My hair isn't gone yet but maybe after the next treatment in 2 weeks.  I'll let you know.  Good luck with yours and I pray it goes well for you.  We've been through enough already, huh?",
