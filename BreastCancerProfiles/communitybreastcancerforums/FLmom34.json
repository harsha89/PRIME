      "Content": "FLmom34 wrote: 34 in Florida, no history BC in family and mom has 5 sisters wow. Almost a month ago I noticed my left nipple was little red, inflamed and tip was almost raw. Didn't hurt or itch and no oozing. I used some coconut oil and went to obgyn he gave my nystatin. Used for a week then saw my breast specialist (I had a benign fibroid in other breast so I am established patient) he gave me fast once over and said here's a new cream. I was upset at his two minute look, I really think he thought I was being ridiculous but the change in color is pretty obvious. So I went to my dermatologist. He agreed it was red and by this time, 1 week ago my areola was now a bit red. He said keep using the cream. I went back today because I don't see any change, I am allergic to many steroids and think cream might be making worse. So he gave me a natural ointment and in two weeks will do biopsy if I want. He thinks dermatitis says he see a lot and mine is not horrible. I am just an anxious person and want it better NOW, not this cream and that cream. Back up to a month ago. I was at a wedding outside 90 degrees in silk dress no bra and wonder if I just irritated the nipple then the cream is just maybe too harsh. I am allergic to singular, Bactrian and prednisone. I recently had a clear mammogram and breast MRI just last week as a follow up to my benign fibroid. So, that is all good news. Just looking for comments or suggestions :) Anyone with Paget's similar? Or anyone that had redness and used something that finally worked? Log in to post a reply",

I have called every day to see if earlier appt, but he's booked. The redness around the areola went away, it was definitely the cream making it worse. So for past 10 days I have gone no creams but the very tip of my nipple still looks very different from the other. So, glad I am having done. My husband's 20 year reunion is next weekend, hoping I have good news before then. Every time we have a trip or something planned, I get hit with something the day before :/ Every. Single. Time. New2bC: just curious did you have any underlying tumors?",

Originally he was just going to biopsy the gland area on the areola but my original concern was the tip of the nipple, so to appease me -he did both.  Little sore now :/ He also gave me an antibiotic and new cream.  Results in a week although my sister in law works at the office so hoping I can maybe hear sooner.  He could tell I was concerned/nervous and tried to ease me by saying he is fairly certain now by looking at the pattern its a glandular tissue issue.  He says the glands look inflamed and red. so we will see. More waiting but at least its done.",

      "Content": "Jun 1, 2015 07:42PM - edited Jun 1, 2015 07:44PM by FLmom34 I just want to say I can totally relate to your \"it never ends,\" and it what it does is just feed into your health anxiety. I am 34, the last 7 months I have had so many health issues or scares and \"incidental findings,\" results in multiple MRIS, breast ultrasound/mammograms, cystoscopy, CT scan and more!! After a negative biopsy in one breast in April I started to have swelling pain in the other right above my breast. Mammogram OK but because I had all sorts of issues they did a breast MRI came back fine. Turns out I had costocondritis which can mimic breast cancer concerns. Took 8-10 weeks to feel better. Now I have this red spot on my nipple and some rectal bleeding and I swear I have Paget's disease and colon cancer, although hemmroids and dermatitis seem more plausible. I too am seeing a therapist but I couldn't make this stuff up if I tried. It has been one thing after another. Start taking vitamin e 1000 daily and primrose oil it will help your breast health, it shrunk my fibroid and cyst. Then there are less lumps and bumps to worry about. See a chiropractor and ask if it's possible to be costocondritis? Stress will make it worse and come and go. My primary care swore it was an infection and had me on 3 rounds of antibiotics and then 800 mg ibuprofen for pain (might be why I am having bowel issues stuff is hard on your stomach) I am just hear to say I get it and know how hard it is to deal. I went to my breast specialist about my nipple sore and he almost laughed at me, it's nothing he said. I was so mad, it isn't nothing I went to my dermatologist and he's like no it's red it's inflamed, most likely dermatitis. I feel that when they know you have anxiety they push you off a bit. Keep pushing them or go somewhere else. If the second and third opinions agree with first, rest assured Good luck !",
