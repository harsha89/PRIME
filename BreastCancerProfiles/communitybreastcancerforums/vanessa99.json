I am also having her do a keratin infusion again.  It only lasts until I wash it, but I think it looks so much better straight and smooth. poodleluvbug, my hair started to show that it would curl at about 5 months pfc - I think it was about an inch long. Irr4993, The back behind my ears are the longest pieces.  The bangs and areas surrounding my face grew the slowest.",

Sunny, your hair seems to be growing much faster than mine did at that stage.  I am on Tamoxifen, which may be slowing it down. Goldie,  I can't wait to have length like yours.  Are the curls easing up at all?  Some women have said their hair reverts to its pre-chemo state after 2 years PFC.  In any case, I think you look great!",

I am 13 months pfc and have a very curly mullet.  My hair was curly and long before chemo, but this is much more difficult to tame.  It took me a full year to grow the bangs to my eyebrows.  My next goal is a ponytail - hopefully by spring.  I wore my wig to work up until early November.  I've had some interesting comments.  A couple people actually asked me \"What made you do it?\"  They did not know I had gone through bc treatments.  I just said, \"For a change\".  I was not expecting this question.",
