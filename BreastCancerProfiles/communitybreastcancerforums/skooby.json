Sadly we were told by the doctors that they have found breast cancer cells in her collar bone (lyph nodes), chest wall an also liver. What are her chances of survival? What is her her life expectancy? I cant seem to get a straight answer so would appreciate an honest answer. In genral how does her prgnosis look Many thanks  Log in to post a reply",

She has some on the bone (back) and chest wall an collar bone although ones in chest wall an collar bone reduced. She had fluid on the lung suggesting spread there. Her cancwr not herceptin based so options limited. Doc not willing to try radiation ablation therapy. She on Cepcitamine and now this is in combination with Venerobin as Cepcitamone according to doc having very little impact. Im a little confused as to what to do if this combination treatment doesn't reduce the tumours.  She has some pain on her back and bones and sometimes her liver. this we are hoping is related to the combination chemo. She is remarkably cheery and in good spirits. More than anything what else can I go to aid her treatment? She is having reiki and althoug I was a little sceptical, she is hppy an smiling after the treatment so if its not doing any hard, I haven't got a problem.  What is her situation saying now? we both wanted to live baroad. IS this a realisitc dream? Thanks for ll help, please be honest as possible as thats what I really appreciate. I know no clear cut anwers but genral truths etc would be helpful -many thanks ",
