My images were so bad the surgeon and onc had no doubt that it's an advanced BC, but 2 biopies came as DCIS, had the third one on the 10th. Yes, it's still BC but a way different. Accepting the dx and reconciling yourself with it is the hardest, but it'll be easier after. It's great you found this site, you can get all support and understanding here. I also add my prayers for you to be in that 5%!!!!",

Thanks a lot for all of you for sharing the experience, the nurse in the chemo room even thought that I was a nurse myself because I easily understood everything she was talking about. I think we can do those chemo teaching classes after being on this site. Welcome to all new ladies and good luck to everybody!",

This is what I did with mine anyway... I'm kinda person who asks a lot and I really don't like doing something I don't understand. My onc. even said that after my appointment his tongue was hurting",
