My mother-in-law was diagnosed with breast cancer that was bonemetastasis this March. The size of the main tumor is 5cm√ó3cm after 6 times radiation. We are concerned that whether now removing the main tumor is a better treatment for her or not, since we heard that there is a likelihood that removing the main tumor may accelerate the spread of breast cancer. Is there any person has similar experience and knowledge about this risk? I really appreciate any advice. Thank you all. Log in to post a reply",
