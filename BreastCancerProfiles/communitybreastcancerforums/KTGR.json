I did, but then I did things to comfort myself: walking, baths, eating really well, reading, meditating, and yes, crying. I have three girls, a 10 year old, and two 4 year olds. One of my twins has cerebral palsy. Bad things float through your mind; let them float OUT of your mind. Don't get ahead of yourself. Birad 4a odds are really good to be benign. Deep breaths. Take care of business and take care of yourself.",

It turned out to be benign, a radial scar, but i had to have it removed with an excisional biopsy to find out. So, with you being in the Birad 3 category on mammogram and ultrasound, I would say there is a high likelihood of your lump being B9 based on statistics associated with those scores. Even a Birad 4 is often benign, but still needs to be biopsied. The problem with an MRI is that is is highly sensitive yet not specific, and there are a lot of false positives. It's a great tool, but not perfect. I would try to take a deep breath, know that the odds are in your favor, and go one step at a time. Good luck. Karen",

It was a b9 radial scar. I had a core needle biopsy, which turned out to show fibro-cystic changes, stromal fibrosis and one other B9 finding. However, because what the CNB found did not explain the Birad 5 concerns, it was called discordant and I had to have an excisional biopsy. Both radiologists who saw my mammogram, ultrasound and biopsy report still felt that I had cancer before the excisional biopsy. Sometimes they're wrong, but I am grateful that they were so diligent. Your doc may or may not be wrong (but she might). I felt the fear you feel now. I hope the absolute best for you. Take care and take one step at a time.",

I'm happy to have a specialist following me. Perhaps a meeting with a breast surgeon/ specialist would help you and he/she would be able to address your concerns. ",
