What did help me was realizing that even if it is bc it's usually very treatable. I keep telling myself it's not a brain tumor or something really bad. I have to put it in perspective. In your case the fact that they don't see a tumor is a good sign.many things can cause distortions. Take breaks from thinking about it somehow. Tell your kids your sorry but your just crabby. I've been snapping a lot lately and my blood pressure was 140/97 today!",

They didn't tell me too much but said it doesn't look like anything bad. I guess we'll see. They put a microchip by the nodule so in the future it will always show up on mammograms and such. Don't worry that they got you in fast, the second place I called got me in quick too and I don't think it was because of what was on my report. I'll be thinking of you Thursday! Results typically take 2-3 days.",

Do you use deodorant with aluminum? Not implying this is at all related I'm just curious because for years I had lumps under my arms and burning. Nothing showed up and the lumps would come and go. I switched to an all natural deodorant and never had lumps again. I think the deodorant with aluminum was affecting my lymph nodes. Did they do an ultrasound of both breasts and under arms? Maybe ask. I'm going to have them do my left side too. Who knows if there's something there because the nodule on the right didn't show on mammogram twice.",
