Thank you! lynn61- I agree it will be easier once the plan is in place and I know exactly what's to be expected for me. Working and keeping busy has helped tremendously. And thank you for the advice, you're absolutely right \"stay in the moment.\" I will remind myself of that any time I start to get ahead of myself! :) Thank you ladies and may God bless you and keep you!

My fiance was the one who found a lump...located in my right breast. So I had a mammogram and Ultrasound done. The Ultrasound revealed a suspicion in my left breast. The radiologist looked it over and told me he felt no need for concern as it didn't \"look\" cancerous to him. Nothing further was done. Mind you, this took place in April. At a regular visit with my family Doctor we discussed these tests some-what and he felt that the \"suspicion\" was cause for further review. He said and I quote, \"This is your life we're talking about.\" So he referred me to an Oncologist who felt the same as he did and scheduled me for an MRI.

My next appointment with her was that Thursday where she told me that the Pathology report confirms it is indeed cancer. BUT the report and samples were sent to the Mayo Clinic for further review. I'm not clear why they were sent to the Mayo Clinic except that she said \"they are the best in the world and they look at Cancer all day, every day and you want the best in the world to review it.\" My next appointment with her is next week. She will then go over the Report with me and I assume a treatment plan. She said the report normally take about a week to come back, so hopefully she will have it in hand to discuss with me. I'm still in shock and quite surprised because I was honestly not expecting these results to come back as cancer since the radiologist told me in April he saw no need for concern. It's now more than 3 months later and I'm told I do in-fact have cancer but with no plan yet. So on top of worrying about having breast cancer I'm concerned now too that it's been untreated as of date and has it possibly spread by now!!",

When I met with my Oncologist on Thursday she said that my pathology report confirms that I do have cancer.

I have an appointment scheduled with my Oncologist for next week to discuss the report and I assume a treatment plan. I'm confused to why the report was sent to the Mayo Clinic.

I am so new to all of this and have so little information right now....until this Thursday.... and I hope questions can be answered for me then since I have been waiting so long already. Thank you, that relieves some of my stress to know that it may not have made much difference as far the delay goes. She didn't give me much information on anything except to say \" I don't have the Pathology Report in hand because it was sent to the Mayo Clinic but do you want me to tell you now what I do now for certain\" and of course I said yes. I can see I am going to need to educate myself on these terms and everything. I've done some reading I do know Grade 3 is fast growing. I don't remember about the HER2 and all that. Ugh...I just feel so much in the dark right now. It's hard to wait, I think I am going to ask her if I can record our visit so that I do not forget anything and certainly ask for copies of everything. This site has been very helpful and I am so glad that I found it.",

I am still in shock and still find it un-believable. I think I will be asking for some anxiety meds soon, as I find myself going thru all kinds of emotions right now. One minute I feel okay and able to accept this and the next I feel panic. I lost my Mom to cancer 10 years ago, she was only 56 and diagnosed with Lymphnoma. She passed away 16 months after diagnoses. I'll explain a little more of my story to this date and what has occurred up until now. I'm 41 years old. My fiance was the one who found a lump...located in my right breast. So I had a mammogram and Ultrasound done. The Ultrasound revealed a suspicion in my left breast. The radiologist looked it over and told me he felt no need for concern as it didn't \"look\" cancerous to him. Nothing further was done. Mind you, this took place in April.

I wonder if you could share with me how your treatment has gone, and where you're at now. And the side effects you've experienced with your treatment. Just anything you can tell me about your experience would be so helpful to me right now and what I'm about to face and go through or feel. I realize all treatments and medications are different.",
