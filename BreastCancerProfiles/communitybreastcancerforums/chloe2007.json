There was shock right after the mastectomy but that went away quickly for me. I wore the bras I got in the hospital with a soft stuffy for several weeks until my sensitivity went down,then got several pocket bras and a prosthesis. I love my prosthetic breast! It amazes me even to this day how much of the feeling of having breasts seems to come from the pectoral muscles, which luckily I still feel fully. When I have my prosthesis in I don't feel like I'm missing a breast, other than of course no sensation of a nipple. I do still get anxious though if I run into people without my bra and prosthesis in (like neighbors outside) - I feel very self-conscious at those times. I have a wife who has been a wonderful support for the whole ride so that has certainly helped too.",

I know I could still consider it but it just hasn't been anything I wanted or gave much thought to. Is there anyone else who has this same mindset? I know the majority of women give it more consideration than I have...but just wondering if anyone else shares my less common preference?",
