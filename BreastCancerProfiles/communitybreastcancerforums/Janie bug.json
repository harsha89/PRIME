In Surgery and on my way home by 11 am. I even stopped by Sonny's BBQ and got something to eat. I am sore today but other then that I feel pretty good. I took Pain meds yesterday but none so far this morning. I have an appt with the PS today. Suprised it is so soon after the surgery. I hopt he takes the dressings off and I can see my new squishes(spelling). Blessing..A gallon of water a day!!!!! Wow I do good to dring 4-5 glasses a day. I also know what you mean about getting use to the TE's I hated them but I was starting to forget that they were there sometimes. Wishing you loads of luck with the diet Cookie....So proud and happy for your weight loss. Keep it up. You have inspired me to start exersise again. 14 pounds in a week WOW!!!! Good luck with the bottle of Tamox. I have been on it for a month and a half and am having some of the SE, hot flashes are the worst though. Chrissiline.... I am happy you let your boss know what a \"jerkwad\" (hehehe love that name) he was. And I hope he contuines to feel like a jerk. Sometimes people need to stop and think before they speak.

Going to see the MO on Wensday so I will know then if I need chemo. I will also be getting my second \"fill up\" for the TEs that day also. The first one was not to bad, I took my PS advise and took a mucle relaxer and a pain pill about an hour before and it worked out pretty well.

The NP told me that I could go as fast as I wanted to or as slow as I wanted. She told me about a pt that wanted/got 120cc each time, because she wanted to get it over with but I think that might be a little much for me d/t the unpleasent tightness of the 60cc fill up. She also told me that after I reach my goal I will then have to wait 4-5 wks before I can do the exchange surgery. I am looking forward to that. These TEs are uncomfrotable to say the least.

She did tell me that she would have recommended 4 doses of Chemo if  the oncotype test had not been done. Because of the 3.2 cm tumor that was removed. The size was the only reason though. It was er+++/pr+++, grade 1. This kinda worries me. She told me that with these results there was a 4% chance of recurrence over the nx 10 years and that it most likley would not respond to chemo. Because of my sisters death at 48 last year from BC (TN, neg nodes, Bmx). 1 year later it was back with mets to bone.  I am of the mind set that I should throw everything including the kitchen sink at this so now I am very confused...
