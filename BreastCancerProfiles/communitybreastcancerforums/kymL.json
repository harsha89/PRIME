For me, the local anesthesia and wire placement hurt a bit, like a bee sting, but in my case the mass itself and the area (just under the nipple/areola) have been tender anyway. Last Friday the anesthesia nurse called me and we went through meds, etc. I asked if I could take klonopin to help me sleep the night before and she said yes, no problem. I'm glad I did or that might have been one of the longest nights of my life. But...  I agree with the others:  the anticipation is worse than the actual procedures. The surgery was a breeze. I was given Versed and fell asleep. I woke up fairly easily and went home a half hour after the surgery. I recommend a soft gel, small ice pack that you can put in your bra for afterward if you can locate one. Now on day three of recovery and still a little sore but it's starting to look a little better and less swollen. The waiting for the pathology report is the worse in my case. I'm one of those \"lucky\" people who had a false negative core biopsy so I had no choice but to have the surgery. I will know what we're dealing with by tomorrow. Good luck to you! And cinvee, good luck to you, too!",

If benign, you have lost a minimal amount of breast tissue. Excisional biopsy removes the entire mass and that's the way to go for a smaller mass. Of course you should ask your surgeon about his/her preference in your particular case. I don't know about the ALH. Best of luck to you!",

Can you tell your surgeon or your pcp how anxious you are, and maybe get something to take the edge off? My doctor gave me some Klonopin and I haven't had to take many, but it really helped before my biopsy and now with the waiting and difficulty sleeping. About the changes you notice in the shape of your breast:  I don't think you can tell benign from malignancy based on these changes. Any kind of cyst or tumor, depending on size and distance from the nipple/surface is going to alter the shape. After the core biopsy I had a marked dimpling in my areola, and now after the excisional biopsy, I have the orange peel dimpling that you see in pictures of inflammatory BC. This is as it should be; my breast is inflammed from the surgery, and the mass is now gone. And it was small (less than 1cm). Last night my husband said he's not worried; he knows I'll be ok, no matter what. I said, \"what if it is cancer?\" And he said, \"yeah, what if it was\"? I'll find out today. But if it is cancer we'll just deal with it. There will be treatment and then we will move on from there. It will be ok. I think cancer scared me so much because my dad had it twice and the second time it killed him. That was inoperable lung cancer. My situtation is different. Managing anxiety is difficult but it helps to write and get feedback. And Klonopin is awesome. It'll be ok whether it's cancer or not. Your surgeon sounds like a winner.",

I've been reading through a lot of topics and posts the past few days and really, first, just want to say thank you to all who share their experiences and feelings. Your stories are very helpful to me as I feel overwhelmed with medical issues right now, and most recently- or at least more worrisome - the prospect of breast cancer. I thought I'd wait and see but then this waiting is hard so I'm jumping in. Very recently I found two lumps under the areola. Monday I had an ultrasound and mammogram. One lump was a lipoma-like nodule that was nothing to be concerned about. The other one, well, the US tech spent at least 20 mins on that one compared to the 3 mins she spent on the lipoma. The radiologist called my doctor and they agreed I should have a core needle biopsy, which she did immediately. She also put a titanium pin in the area and did a repeat mammogram with that in place. So now I'm waiting. Waiting. Everything was so tense and fast on Monday and now I'm in limbo/obsesso land, scouring the internet and learning everything I can. I'm an information person. It helps me channel my anxiety. And boy, have I learned a lot! I'm pretty tough. I have RA (diagnosed 2 yrs ago) and I was hospitalized a few times this fall for pericarditis, pneumothorax, Afib, and pleural effusion. I also had an US of my thyroid, and I've been referred to a surgeon for that. Somehow that one doesn't scare me as much -- it just adds to the overwhelm. And questions. I have prednisone-induced diabetes and I'm going to be on the heart meds through February. How does all this work? I feel like I'm falling apart! I think that the pathology report on the breast lump isn't going to be benign. I know I could be wrong. But I just have this sinking feeling that, by the way the radiologist was so concerned, that there's something wrong. So I wait. This afternoon I'll see my rheumatologist and have him check on the computer to see if the path report is back, although I do trust my pcp to call me as soon as he gets the report, as he promised. So hello to all of you, nice to meet you, even under the circumstances of our aquaintance. Thanks for being here. I'll post when I know something. Log in to post a reply",

From what I've been reading about various types of tumors, I know the irregular borders are a concern and the microcalcs may or may not be. You are young! I hope it's benign. blackcat, you are right. What is bothering me is lack of information. Especially because excisional biopsy is a lumpectomy, so I'm getting the same surgery I would get if it were malignant for certain, but it could be benign. And it is just under the nipple -- so does that mean that in order to get the proper borders I will lose the nipple, so instead of a lumpectomy, I'm having a mastectomy, for something that could be benign. I am also immunocompromised so do I have to do this thing inpatient? I have a lot of questions for the surgeon. I know the wise thing to do is probably get rid of it. Better safe than sorry. I have an appt with the surgeon on Tues morning at 9:40am and it can't come soon enough. She will examine me and go over all the mammograms, etc. and cover all the possibilities. I talked to the nurse at my pcp's office about all of this including my anxiety. She's going to ask the doctor about getting me some xanax or something. At least then I can take them to sleep. And maybe take the edge off this awful sense of dread. I can't stay asleep and I'm getting cranky. :(  Thanks so much for your responses.",

I'll take your good vibes, thanks, and send some right back to you now for this biopsy. I don't know what to think about my situation. Instead of a pathology report, an US report, and a report of the biopsy, I have three identical reports with very uninfomative mammogram and US \"findings\" in which said findings are not really described in any diagnostic way. addendum: \"The pathologic diagnosis of benign breast tissue is discordant with the imaging findings. Per Dr. [...] the patient is to followup with a surgicalconsult for an excisional biopsy of this area.  Ultrasound guided needle localization can be performed.

Maybe I'm imagining this but I feel a tiny something on the other boob now (right side). It doesn't hurt and it feels just like the lipoma on the left side, so I guess I'll just mention that to the surgeon at my appt tomorrow morning. I'm glad my husband is able to come along for the consultation. He calms me. This lump on the left that they are worried about hurts. It's not at 3'oclock, either... it's at 5 o'clock (I wonder if they didn't just miss the real mass). And the area is weirdly lumpy and hurty now -- not just a discreet hard pea of pain. I guess there's inflammation still from the biopsy. I wonder what makes a mass hurt like this. I haven't been able to find out anything about it. Have you had pain with yours? I'm making lists of meds, doctors, and questions then heading for bed. Will update asap.",
