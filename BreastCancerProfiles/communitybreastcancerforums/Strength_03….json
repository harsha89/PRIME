I am 23 years old and practicing as an RN! 4 years ago I started to have sharp bee stinging/pin pricking pains in my left breast. I also began to notice an inverted/retracted nipple. Doc sent me for an US which showed a fibroadenoma. Anyway I feel because I was young I was really not taken seriously at all. My doctor always dismissed my concerns and never recommended anything. Over the past 4 years my US showed that I have nodules/lesions all of which appear benign but again my doctor never felt concerned. I also have a family member (blood related) who was diagnosed with Lymphoma 2 years ago, with the mass found via mammorgraphy. Actual diagnoses was confirmed following an excisional biopsy as the core was not showing definitive results. In the new year I just felt something wasn't right, my left breast felt very heavy, nipple retraction worse and the bee stinging pain was getting out of hand. This time I could feel sort of a lump it felt almost like peaks and valleys. I went to do another ultrasound and this time they say my lesion has grown to 3 cm so they recommend an US Guided biopsy. I went to have my imaging repeated and the radiologist was great-she actually listened to me and didnt just dismiss my concerns. She said that it was a pretty big chunk and from the images she did not think it was cancer but will biopsy it to be clear. She mentioned it could be a massive fibroadenoma or mentioned phyllodes tumor. Has anyone ever experienced anything similar or have the radiologist mention it didnt look like cancer but was? I just feel like no one has been thorough until now. Given so many years gone by I just wanna make sure nothing gets missed. I understand they cannot just say whether or not its cancer off imaging. Im awaiting my date, she mentioned if the biopsy is not sufficient they will likely remove the whole thing but the pathologist will decide. Log in to post a reply",

I'm just glad they're finally being thorough it's nice after being dismissed by my family doctor for so long. I'll be getting the date today for next week!",
