During treatment I did a lot of thinking on the Celtic warriors I'm descended from and I wore or carried my family tarten into every treatment. When it was all over I worked with a Celtic tattoo artist to design the tattoo you see on my profile and written under it is \"Chan go foill\" which means \"Not yet\".  Good call! You were really close!",

I was so anxious to get out of wigs before summer that I dyed my hair jet black when it was only about a half an inch long to help make it look thicker, and ditched my wigs. Going dark when it was super short really helped get me out of wigs sooner. Then I went brown as it grew out, then back to my usual dark blonde. I'm 11 months out of chemo now and coloring ASAP didn't hurt my hair at all. Is there anyone out there who actually damaged their hair by dying it too early, or is this just the repeated advice of a well-intentioned stylist who hadn't actually been through treatment?",

I too was worried, but my oncologist reassurred me that this rarely happens and it is usually to very elderly women with thinning hair. I got a full head of hair after Taxotere and it's way thicker and nicer than it was before. Heck of a way to get a perm, but we earned our thick curly hair!

It's about 50/50 dark blonde and grey with no color. Very salt and pepper looking. The shade I used here is Wella Color Charm #811 with a #20 developer. Both are available at most beauty supply stores. I did have some trouble getting rid of the brown color I had in when it was really short. I had to use a lightening bleach, then a #30 developer. Now I can used a gentler developer to get this shade. I also use Wella Color #711 and #911.",
