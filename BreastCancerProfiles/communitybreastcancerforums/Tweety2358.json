I have many tumours on my liver. that are near 5 cm. started by being a very aggressive breast cancer. Had my left breast removed back July 2011. Since then I have many new tumours that have grown on the left chest wall. Cancer has now spread to bones, liver, sternum is where I'm starting to have pain . plus my tumours on the chest are starting to bleed. Doc has just given me my last treatment of Xeloda. This stuff is the worst I have had. When the Doc gives me the prescription and says this is a pill form this chemo. I remember laughing and saying ok.....this is really not going to help much. well it was the worst side effects I have had on any of my chemo's. And I have been on chemo for 2 years now. My time is running out....this treatment is no longer helping. I'm in palliative care now....I'm not affraid, have made peace with myself. To be honest I'm getting tired of this body....I wanna go home.. I have a wonderful family 4 gorgeous grand babies that I spend most of my time with now......my life is rolling out in front of me..... I'm on the right path!....the only thing I do NOT want to have is pain.....I want all the pain meds I can have!!!....lol  Hang in there girl friend.....I'm here to chat anytime. you r never alone!  Hugs & kisses, Cathy ",
