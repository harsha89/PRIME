I weaned off 2 months back and about a month back I noticed one dimple in my left breast in inner lower quadrant only while bending or flexing... ultrasound is clear .. around that area ( not exactly below the dimple), there are some milk ducts.. my doc gave medicine to dry off milk as she feels there could be galactohhrea .. no mammo no mri... ANy suggestions from other members on what further I can do to find the reasoning of this indent?     ",
