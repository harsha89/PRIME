I had morphine in the recovery room.  Once I was back in my room, I had Demerol.  I could choose 50mg by mouth or 75 mg by IV; the nurses let me choose which I wanted each time.  Unfortunately, I ended up having a reaction to Demerol the next morning and had to go on Darvocet anyway (I'm allergic to Lortab and Percocet), but in your case, you should have had stronger meds. I know hospitals have to have certain policies, but that thing with the pump sounds ridiculous.  Perhaps some letters to the hospital board could help remedy this situation.  A doctor leaves an order, but the nurses aren't allowed to follow it?  Please.

Since then (June 2009) I've had four scares of recurrence, but I don't regret not having the extra surgery.  As I said, it was a good decision FOR ME, and I'm at peace with it.      I wish I could give you a definitive answer.  I wish we could know that doing this, that and the other would be a sure thing.  But that's just not the way it is for us.  I'm very sorry that you're facing this, and I pray you can reach a decision with which you're comfortable. Love, Artemis ",

I don't like flying in general because I tend to panic if I feel that I'm in a place where I can't leave if I want to.  I have Xanax to help with that, so I think I can deal with flying except... ...I'm afraid of lymphedma.  So, my question is, how reliable are sleeves and wrapping for prevention when flying?  I was reading some other threads, and several of you ladies mentioned the need for a glove as well as the sleeve.  Should I tell my therapist I want one?  She said to use the sleeve and bandages for flying; she never mentioned a glove. I'm trying to decide if this trip if worth the risk.  Honestly, it's not really worth it to me, but it means a great deal to my husband and other family members.  On the other hand (heh..), they will not be the ones having to massage and bandage if LE develops. So, do you know of anyone who got LE after flying even if she wore a sleeve and bandages?  Thanks so much! Artemis DD ACx4, Tx4. BMX 6/1/2009. Tamoxifen: 2009-. Rads 28/28.

I know that \"extreme temperature\" can trigger LE.  I know that activities should be done in cooler parts of the day whenever possible.  However...I have season tickets for the University of MyState's football games.   Game days in my southern US state are HOT and HUMID.  The temps are usually around 95 degrees with very high humidity.  Games last 3-4 hours.  Most kickoffs are between noon and 3:00. Even pre-BC, I made sure to stay hydrated at these games, and this year my seats are in the shade which will help a great deal.   So my questions are:  should I think about getting LE sleeves before the season starts?  How good are they at actual prevention?  Might I be ok to not wear sleeves?  Or am I a fool to try going at all? Thanks so much, and hugs to all. Artemis DD ACx4, Tx4. BMX 6/1/2009. Tamoxifen: 2009-. Rads 28/28.
