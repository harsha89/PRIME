I can feel a lump, but since it is painful I assumed that it would not be cancerous. That is mostly what I have heard about painful lumps in the breast. Sometimes, I can hardly think because it bothers me so much.",

My ultrasound report stated that there is a 5 mm nodule consistent with lymph nodes would correspond to the mammographic abnormality.  There is also a benign appearing 1.4 x 1.7 x 0.6 mm lymph node.  The impression from the radiologist was that a decision for biopsy of any palpable masses will have to be based on clinical grounds.  Also stated that there is a subcentimeter nodule consistent with intramammary lymph node 3 o'clock left breast.   I am not worried about any of it being cancerous, I am just in so much discomfort that I would like to remove the whole area.",

I do not know that it is in the sentinel node, just in the area where I saw that the sentinel node is located. It is located on the left side of my breast close to the underarm, but not under the arm. I do have another lump that is underneath my arm in the area right above my armpit and a place that is painful on the left side where it feels like my ribs are. I guess I need to find a doctor to get it all checked out.",
