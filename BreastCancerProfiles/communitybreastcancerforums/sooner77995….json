That\u2019s why it was easy to schedule things and I felt relaxed (and would have remained relaxed if it wasn\u2019t from my physician sounding rather anxious). I\u2019m going to work on remaining positive :-). Thanks!",

      "Content": "sooner77995 wrote: I accidently deleted my other posts :-(. So sorry I'm a newbie trying to get use to this forum. Help! I was A-Okay until my doctor called me immediately after my U/S to confirm I scheduled a biopsy (she didn't call after the mammogram). When she called she started mentioning some shadowing was seen on my U/S, etc. (although that's not noted on my U/S report). I am thinking it's merely a fibroadenoma (as the radiologist verbally told me after the U/S but once again didn't note on the report) but thought I'd share for feedback to calm my nerves. Backstory: OB/GYN wrote an order for a baseline Mammogram 06/2018 to be performed 09/2018. I ended up scheduling for 11/2018. 11/14/18 Mammogram: Abnormal MAMMOGRAM FINDINGS: The breast parenchyma is heterogeneously dense, which may obscure small masses. Right breast findings: No suspicious masses, calcifications, or areas of architectural distortion. Left breast findings: There is a well-circumscribed round mass measuring 17 mm in the upper outer quadrant 3 cm from the nipple, anterior depth. This is most likely a benign cyst, but warrants complete sonographic evaluation on a baseline exam. IMPRESSION: Right breast: Negative. No evidence of malignancy. BI-RADS 1. Left breast: Well-circumscribed 17 mm round mass warrants complete evaluation with ultrasound on a baseline exam. Incomplete. BI-RADS 0. 11/15/18 - Received call to schedule U/S 11/19/18 Ultrasound: Abnormal FINDINGS: There is a hypoechoic mass with a lucent center in the left breast 2 o'clock position, 3 cm from the nipple, which corresponds to the mammographic finding. This measures 1.9 x 1.0 x 2.0 cm in maximum dimension. Walls are smooth. No other solid or cystic masses are seen. IMPRESSION: 1. Hypoechoic mass in the left breast 2 o'clock position for which ultrasound-guided biopsy will be scheduled. Recommendation 1: Biopsy is recommended of the left breast. ACR BI-RADS Category Code 4 - Suspicious U/S guided biopsy schedule for 11/21/18 & my OB/GYN has scheduled a Mammo Post Bx Diagnostic exam of the Left Breast. Log in to post a reply",
