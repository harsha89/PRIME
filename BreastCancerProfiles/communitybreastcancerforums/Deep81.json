I was diagnosed with breast mets to the lung 3 weeks ago and yes it was a shock but now i live each to the fullest and I am looking forward to meeting my niece/nephew next year! I will not let doctors/statistics make me think i have limited time here. I am visiting a Naturopath Oncologist this week for alternative therapies to help kill off the cancer cells lingering in my lungs. Apparantly alot of patients like us with Mets have had succcess with these therapies. But we have to make sure they do not interact with the chemo regime we have been assigned to. Maybe a thought for you to consider perhaps? I havent come across your regime but research as much as you can and also see if you can talk to other patients in your hospital who are currently on it?

Proactive is around $40 over here in Canada, but the Benzoyl P on its own from walmart is about $10. I would say talk to your doctor abt it as he may prescribe something stronger like clindamycin or erthromycin.",
