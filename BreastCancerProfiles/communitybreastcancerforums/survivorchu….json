A fine needle biopsy was ordered and it came back positive for malignant cells. I have been feeling them for a while however it was difficult for the Dr. to locate while doing normal physical examination of the breast. I insisted that I sit up and then she felt it. 8 years ago I had IBC and a mastectomy was done on right breast. Lymph nodes now enlarged on left side.",
