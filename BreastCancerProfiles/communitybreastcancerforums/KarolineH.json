I had my surgery on May 28, 2013 and for me sleeping was near impossible. I found the couch with my pillows to be the most comfortable. Also my Dr prescribed Zanax to help me sleep. Honestly I had a lot of pain but I am happy to say today I feel great. I did go to Physical Therapy which was a huge help. Make sure to do your exercises after surgery; it's so important.",

Please feel free to ask me any questions that you may have. I haven't started holiday shopping yet but I just started planning my wedding! I was diagnosed right after my engagement so I put off planning due to anxiety sadness...7 months later and I feel great! I still get anxiety but I take my Zanax and I get rest and feel better.",

I was worried at first but the more women you speak with or threads you get on you will see it is so common and helpful. Keep asking questions and posting your concerns, fears, anger lol. We are all here to listen and help as best as we can.",

I see how much softer and fuller my boobs are becoming. My skin is also not as raw or thin (not sure what the correct word is) now. After each surgery I was so itchy for a few days and my skin was so thin I did bleed a few times so I had to be extra careful. I feel like my nipples will be my Christmas present lol! I will provide details as they come! I'm so happy for you, your partner and your kids:) After going through this I am so grateful for my FH. I feel like we have been together through better/worse sickness/health..it puts everything into perspective. Soriya- so happy to hear your finished with chemo and getting ready for your surgery. Try to not worry about infection. Keep your bandages on and take your antibiotics. You can and WILL enjoy Christmas with your family. I won't lie I was in pain but the pain meds work and once I stopped taking them I found that Tylenol worked wonders too. If you have a bad day, post! Look in the mirror and remind yourself that you are beautiful, strong, courageous and here! a little wine also helps if you like it:) Carebear- I have the same type of couch and I found it to be the most comfortable. It was also much easier if I was alone and had to swing my legs up and down to push my body up. It's a great core exercise! I still take Zanax when I need it. Some days can be hard but it's not often. With surgery coming up I get anxious but this time around I'm more excited. Aviva- I agree with you. Infection and/or problems are the exception and not the rule. I KNOW I have been lucky and will continue to post support on the boards. I see how easy it is to move on once your past the hump. If it weren't for all the women who keep posting and helping us newbies I would have been much more scared than I was and I am so thankful for all the support. In the beginning I was afraid to post questions because so many women are going through much more than I am. It didn't feel right to me but I realized that these amazing women are more than happy to listen and help everyone. Ashna- glad to hear your chemo is done and your surgery is scheduled. Keep us posted. I'm glad to be part of this board and I agree with bobogirl; let's keep updating on everything. The good, bad and the in betweens!",

I went with silicone round implants 550cc's with the help of whippetmom (who is an amazing resource to all). I was diagnosed right after getting engaged and put my planning on hold out of anxiety fear you name it. I just had my pre surgery testing today for my nipple reconstruction which is on Dec 3rd. All in all I have been lucky with no major hiccups but it has been difficult at times. Finding this site and posting concerns or questions has been a blessing! Just \"lurking\" at times can put you at ease. Just remember to always post what your wondering or thinking; there is always someone here that has gone through it too. I wish I had posted earlier but I was hesitant. I am 7 months out and I feel great for the most part. My wedding date is set for November 29th, 2014 and I am having fun planning now! It gets better, I promise:)",
