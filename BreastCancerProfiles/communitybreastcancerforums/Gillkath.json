My next tx is next week (Oct. 17) and I'm dreading it.  But we do what we have to to try to beat recurrence.  Good luck to you. Laurie",

Also, a tip that I came across here in these boards (and which was confirmed by the Neulasta representative at my oncology office) is to regular Clariton (not Clariton D) for the Neulasta bone pain.  I am going to try that for my next tx which is next Thursday, October 17. Good luck with your tissue expansion -- how many have you had?  My PS filled mine partially at the time of my surgery and I have had only two other fillups.  I am staying small chested as I chose not to have an implant placed in my one remaining breast.  (My 16 year old daughter doesn't understand this as she thinks that it is the one time in my life that I can get bigger boobs!)  Laurie",

I attended a conference on breast cancer yesterday and one of the lectures I attended was on breast cancer and the environment.  It was fascinating -- One of the reasons for increased cancer is endocrine disruption.  Well, one of the main causes for this is the amount of estrogen that is in everything.  That's not to say that everyone will get cancer from this but if you are predisposed to cancer (like we ladies are) this can be very bad for you.  Did you guys know that the government does not monitor what toxins are in our personal care products -- like makeup, deodorant, etc.  I have a link to a website which I can't list here but if you have estrogen positve cancer you might want to visit the site.  MY MAKEUP HAS ESTROGEN IN IT!  Very bad for me.  If you go to google and type in \"skin deep cosmetic database\", the link should come up.

Hi Mary Jo --- what number treatment is this for you?  After my first treatment, I went to my daughter's soccer game because it was an outside event and I knew that I didn't have to be as careful as with an inside event.  If you get the Neulasta shot, I think that will also bring your white blood cell count back up. Hi Ellen --- I can't imagine going through this with a little one.  I, on the other hand, have two daughters (12 and 16) who are into every activity that you can think of, so I am constantly shuffling them around.  I have had to make other arrangements, though, for the days immediately after my chemo because I am just too tired to run them around.  At least when they come home, they can pretty much fend for themselves if they need something. Good luck everyone.  You all are amazing people! Laurie",

Urbie, you are doing the TC combo, right?  Same that I am doing.  I also take a senakot tablet for the first few days of chemo, too, to keep from being constipated.  Do you do this?  My treatments go like this:  The day before chemo, I take Decadron in the morning and in the evening, then I have my treatment and I take Emend and Decadron that day; then for the next two days I take Emend.  What are your usual treatments like?

Toys -- I loved Creepy Crawlers -- you poured this goopy stuff into this metal plate with shapes and baked it in this oven.  I also loved spirograph.  We also had the first of video games called Atari, I think it was. Jingles -- Oh I wish I were an Oscar Meyer Wiener, that is what I'd truly like to be, cuz if I were an Oscar Meyer Wiener, everyone would be in love with me!  Stay-free Mini Pads  -- No Belts, No Pins, No Mess! Favorite Childhood Memory -- I guess Christmas Eve my whole childhool life was the best of times for me.  There was just something magical about it -- we'd hang our stockings up on our stairs and just lay there all night waiting for Santa to come.  We'd also make Christmas cookies and listen to Christmas music.  These are traditions that I have kept up with my kids. Thought I'd add this one-- Worst Thing I did as a Kid -- In my school, the teachers would count how many children had brought in milk money for a mid-morning milk.  She'd write the number of kids who had bought milk and the delivery person would leave the exact number of milks to equal the number on the board.  Well, for some reason, one day (and I was a shy child) I decided to play a joke on the teacher.  She left the room, and I marched to the front of the class and erased her number.  But, being only in second or third grade, I wasn't very smart about it.  I must have put some really large number up there, like 100 (we had only 20 kids in our class) because she noticed the difference right away.  She confronted the class and asked who did it -- I never fessed up to it.  So then came the threat of no recess unless someone confessed.  Much to my surprise, one of the other students (whose name I still remember) raised his hand and said that he had done it.  Do you know, to this day, this still bothers me!  Well, we got to go outside for recess, except for this little boy! Can't wait to read what others have to contribute! Laurie PS -- I really am a nice person!",

One of my favorite things to make around Thanksgiving is pumpkin soup.  Sounds a little wierd, doesn't it, but it is so good and easy to make.  If you guys want the recipe, let me know.  My finicky girls even like it. I also have a recipe for thanksgiving leftovers.  It is called something like thanksgiving leftover shepard's pie.  It has a layer of turkey, a layer of gravy, a layer of stuffing, carrots, and it is topped with mashed potato.  I'm sure there is something else in it but I just can't think of the others.  It is a great way to use leftovers before they go to waste.  I'm happy to provide that recipe as well. For Thanksgiving, we will be going to my in-laws house and I'm very excited but also very worried that it will be emotional.  His family is very large and there will be about 30 of us there.  I haven't seen them since I began chemo and I know I will be the center of attention -- I'm hoping I can hold it together. Have a good day ladies. Laurie PS -- How long does it take for hair to start growing back after the last chemo?",

I do agree, though, that I am so much more nervous about facing my next tx because of my severe reaction to tx #2.  I also have had red skin everywhere and a rash, to name a few of my side effects.
