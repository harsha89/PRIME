I wasn't expecting anything as barbaric as shoving a hose down my insides without anesthetic (except where the tube was inserted). It was the most painful thing I have ever experienced. Anyway that was last September so onward and upward. I am heartened by your good results on Taxol. My next step is to get a port put in before chemo starts. I really didnt want one as I get a lot of scar tissue with even minor surgery, but my veins are done in at this point. Our situations seem similar except I am her2neu negative so am not getting herceptin. I wish you continued improvement. ",

I didn't really want a port because it would be a constant reminder of my cancer butb you all are  right - it was so much easier than an IV.  I do have a hugh bruise from the IV used during the port insertion though, which makes it obvious why I need a port ;-).  I'm writing this at 4:40am and I haven't slept yet because the anti nausea drug (zofran ) causes insomnia. Hahaha I wasnt a good sleeper before this anyway. I'm supposed to take it 3 times a day but I think I will cut it down to twice. I am also taking dexamethasone (sp?). I'm counting on the taxol to shrink my liver tumours and reduce the ascites in my midriff area. I also think the bone mets in my sternum is growing again. It was originally stopped by radiation back in May 2013. Take care all",

In my situation, there is a differ radiologist each time I have a scan so I can't even be sure they are measuring the tumours the same way. I guess the reality is that major changes WILL be visible to everyone. Good luck going forward. ",

I had NED for 6 years then bone pain in my sternum was eventually diagnosed in early 2013 as bone mets and CT also showed small spots in my liver and fluids around my lung. I was put on tamoxifen for 5 months but the pleural effusion increased til I had to have over 2 liters drained. So my onc took me off that and put me on Afinitor and exemstane. After 4 months CT scans showed increased size and number of liver mets ( though everything else seemed stable) so now I'm off that and will be starting chemo in mid march -taxol and xgeva. Also been taking prednisone which has tamed my horrible cough. Mentally I am feeling pretty good and my physical symptoms are  shortness of breath (may be more from the effusion than bone or liver mets) and a heavy weight feeling in the liver area. Sometimes I also get back pain but Tylenol takes care of it and it only lasts a day. I've been meaning to join this group for many months and sure could have used support during Afinitor which had horrible side effects. Anyway, I hope to give and take support as I continue this journey and was glad to see a topic specifically on liver mets as I do consider this my most serious challenge. Thanks all for listening as I know you all have equally great challenges to deal with.",
