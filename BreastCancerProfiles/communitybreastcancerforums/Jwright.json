After 2 yrs of a mystery illness, high BP (resting heart rate was 114-120), severe breathing problems, extreme fatigue, nausea, recurring cellulitis, sores on my chest, I discovered from a new PT that the pump was overloading my heart. Now I have a stack of Dr bills I can't pay and have been unable to work. The frustration of not knowing why I was sick was worse than enduring cancer treatments. I found this forum to tell my story and see if there is anyone else out there who has experienced this nightmare. After discontinuing pump use, my health has greatly improved.",
