Then the adriamycin and Cytoxin.  Discussed my SEs with the MO - headaches, dizziness, and heart palps all caused by the steroid (dexamethasone). I also take this in pill form twice/day on days 2 and 3 after chemo.  The MO said I could cut down on the steroid to once/day to see if that reduces the dizziness and headaches.  I hope so, on the other hand, the nausea will have a better chance of setting in.  I have compazine and zofran but have only used the zofran twice. Very thankful for that too, but I am such a huge wimp when it comes to headaches.   Has anyone had any side effects from the compazine?   Thanks everyone!",

I have not had any surgery yet, I am waiting for the MYRISK tests to come back to help me decide what type of surgery - depending on positive markers. Everything has been happening so fast I wanted to make sure that I selected the right type of surgery for ME. I felt that the medical personnel was assuming automatic mastectomy. Perhaps that's because the node biopsy was positive. I don't know. I haven't read anywhere where someone has had a node biopsy in addition to the breast mass biopsy. I was hoping for the lumpectomy surgery, chemo and radiation, but a recent CT Scan found another mass approx. 2cm in size. It's very deep near the chest bone and very high on the breast. The oncologist is almost certain now that I will need a mastectomy. MRI next week will give me more details on this issue (I hope). In the meantime, I opted for the neoadjuvant chemotherapy 8 treatments every 2 weeks. 4 A/C then 4 Taxol.  Next week, I am getting a port inserted on Monday, a breast MRI on Tuesday, 1st chemo on Thursday, Neulasta injection on Friday. It's going to be a busy week, but thanks to this forum, I feel that I am better educated and ready to deal with the side effects. Thank you all!",

I receive nausea meds via IV before the chemo and that has helped tremendously - I have literally not been sick. The worst side effects I deal with his generally headaches and constipation for about 3 days after chemo (not to mention hair loss). You may one to ask your oncologist what nausea meds you will be prescribed. To ease your mind more, you may want to consider a second opinion - it can't hurt. Also, my treatments are on Thursday so I have the whole weekend to recover and by Monday I actually feel pretty good. Stay in touch and let us know. Hugs :)",

The first one was the worst and it was mostly headache, dizziness, sleeplessness and constipation but I personally think that most of it was the steroids. My MO let me reduce the steroids to 2 after the second treatment and then I only took 1 after the 3rd and this has helped a lot with the head issues. If you are also getting the Neulasta shot, a trick I found with the Clariton-Pepcid-Ibuprofin cocktail - take this the night before the shot and use the Ibuprofin PM (I used Walgreens brand). It certainly helped me sleep after the treatments. The constipation wears off on the fourth day after treatment. I have had no nausea - the meds they give me prior to chemo (Aloxi, EMend,Decadron) is working perfect for me. A couple other SEs you should note (from my experience): 1) Mouth sores. Although I don't have sores yet, my gums are tender and I feel that I could have an outbreak at any moment. During the chemo I read in this forum that you should chew on ice or a Popsicle. Chew constantly during the chemo part of the therapy. I do the baking soda mouth rinse followed by Biotene two, three or more times a day. 2) Nails. I apply NutraNails and Sally Hanson Cuticle/Nail oil a couple of times a day. No discoloration yet (I have all my fingers crossed). Hope this information is helpful. Knowledge is power.

The side effect of Neulasta is bone pain so my MO told me to use Clariton-Pepcid-Ibuprofin cocktail to prevent the bone pain. As far as the ice thing, I can't say that it does prevent mouth sores, but I haven't had any yet - but don't wan't any so I chew, chew, chew. Just be preventive and use the mouth rinse every day.

I am also doing 4 treatments with the AC, but only 4 weeks of taxol every - 2 weeks but I now have Thanksgiving week off. Woohoo! I too am having surgery after chemo. I can't imagine going through this after surgery like so many other ladies on this forum. I feel very fortunate that my side effects to the chemo are pretty minimal. As far as laxative - I tried the baking soda treatment. Google it. I have to tell you though - it worked for me. Worked almost too good. It was pretty immediate - have an open bathroom on stand=by. Good luck",

It's very heart-warming to see them finish and brings me comfort to know that I can finish too! Ilovecoasters, those are really strict orders and makes me wonder why. I just asked my MO to approve me for air travel and he didn't seem to think it would be a problem. I travel a lot for work - but haven't worked since March and the medical bills are starting to pile up. If I get this assignment, I will be traveling every other week for work through February and will be doing the chemo treatments when I'm back home. I will find out tomorrow if I get this assignment. I will definitely have to be diligent on airplanes regarding germs.",

I hope things are going well for you. I tell you though, Taxol has been rougher on me than the AC. The bottoms of my feet are very painful making it hard to walk. I have numbness in my fingers on both hands. Taxol Rash - little red bumps that don't want to go away. Constipation that lasts over a week. I only have 2 more and I pray the SEs don't get worse!

Bilateral Mastectomy and ovary removal at the same time (BRCA2 +). Different surgeons for each procedure. Both are female - which doesn't really matter, but somehow that brings me comfort. Will find out if I need radiation after the node biopsy. Reconstruction will be at a later date. I'm still having SEs from Taxol - last infusion was 1/27/15. My feet are still very tender to walk on, I'm still getting a few red bumps every now and then, and the neuropathy in my fingers and toes. Hope everyone else is getting through the lingering SEs.",

I was wondering if it was the store-cut FRUIT I had eaten the day before that may have caused it. Did you eat any raw fruit/vegetables?  Maybe coincidence - but probably the chemo. However, after investigating the reason why one should not eat RAW fruit or vegetables during chemo, I found that it may contain a lot of bacteria. In fact, this is what I found on the breastcancerwarrior.net website: \"avoid all uncooked, unpeeled foods. That means NO LETTUCE\" and \"while on Chemo or Radiation, say goodbye to green salads, as well as all unpeeled fresh fruit or veggies and eat only cooked, or thoroughly, seriously scrubbed and then peeled foods, and if a food can\u2019t be peeled and can\u2019t be cooked, then don\u2019t eat it.\"",

The xrays showed that it was a little twisted or bent or something like that. But it still works so we will leave it as is for now. I am posting a picture (I hope it doesn't offend anyone).

Not sure if it helps, but it sure can't hurt - right? I have also broken out in little red bumps - the Clariton seems to help with these. I am wondering the same thing - has anyone found something to reduce the numbness? I found a new group on this site called \"Weekly Taxol group\" and was just perusing some of their posts to see similar issues from Taxol. Also, I was just reading about Vitamins B6 and B12 might help. Something safe to consider but I need to read up on it more and check with the MO.",
