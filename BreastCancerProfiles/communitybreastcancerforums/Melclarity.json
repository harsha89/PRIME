My hair TOO has foundits original part, really weird huh?? BBwithBC45 - That is so great to hear of your success with cold capping, awesome!!! Phalia - I did alot of research and my MO said it depends on your Chemo regime as to success. Its not recommended for BC treatment here, as most Chemo used you lose every hair possible on your body. Cold capping doesnt work. We also don't ice fingers or toes to save from neuropathy. Eventhough I was horrendously ill through Chemo, I didnt suffer any neuropathy at all, my nails became a little fragile, but never looked different at all. Everyone is different. There is controversy with the cold capping that Ive read on different threads here, I'd do some research and do whats right for you. :)",

I got through AC with eyelashes and eyebrows in tact, a few weeks into Taxol I lost my long eyelashes, like Peachy, I too thought I'd escaped it. Ive noticed no movement with eyelashes yet but a little is happening with eyebrows. Ive just bought baby shampoo and am starting today.

Its very successful and I know of people used it for treatment of bowel cancer...but its a differen chemo regime. My Oncologist said if I did just Taxol it may work, but the FEC I used no hope. My Oncologist didnt recommend it either because he said it isnt very successful. Maybe some of the other ladies may have other info..cheers",
