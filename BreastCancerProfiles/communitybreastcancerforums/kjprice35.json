    "Content": "kjprice35 wrote: I woke up last Tuesday with a bright red angry area on my right breast. It was the entire length of my mastectomy scar and an inch or so above and below it. So, basically 8 or 9 inches long by 3 inches high or close to the entire breast! I freaked out and am still concerned that it may be a reoccurance or IBC.  It was such a large area, came out of no where, and it was so very red hot.  I called the breast clinic and they made an appt for Thursday but that was all they could do.  I have implants (silicone) so I was concerned that it may be an infection so I called my PS. My PS was out of the office for the week but his partner did call me in some anitbiotics, sulfa meds, and antibiotic cream.  He asked that I come in the next day and when I did he said he was fairly sure that it was contact dermatitis but I have done nothing new, changed nothing, nor had I come in contact with anything new or different than normal.  I had a reaction to the sulfa meds so I took a Benadryl and didn't take any more but continue to take the clyndamicin. Also, the cream made me ITCH like crazy and seemed to aggravate the other breast so I discontinued it after 24 hours. Once I discontinued it the area on my left breast that was aggravated and itchy gradually went away so I'm assuming that was the cream.  On Wednesday the red area on had lightened up to a darker pink but both breasts were aggravated and itchy (from the cream) and at that point I called the breast clinic and told them that and they switched to appt to that day. So I went in with what looked like a rash on both breasts but that wasn't in reality what it was/is. I had an ultrasound at the breast clinic and the Dr there said he thought I was fine (he didn't even look at my chest or the area involved!).  He based his diagnosis on the ultrasound only and gave me absolutely no answer as to what it was. I got very angry and he finally said he could bring me back in 2 weeks for an US... I asked him why I would come back for the same test that showed absolutely nothing so he begrudgingly said that we could make it an MRI if that would make me feel better.  I told him it was better than a repeat of that visit. The left breast is back to normal and, as of this morning, the right has faded to a very faint pink flushed color.  I am having pains in my arms along with muscle fatigue. I am also having some continued itching, burning, and shooting pains in my right breast and serious pain in the center of my chest still on the right but almost between the two. That pain feels like its just below the surface or on the bone?I had an MRI in the fall last year because I saw a spot on my bone scan that was brighter than the rest.  The radiologist said it was a hemangioma but only after I insisted on the MRI to look at it. I have had and continue to have pain under my right shoulder blade right next to the area on the spine where the \"hemangioma\" was/is.  Am I just being a hypochondriac? and really, how is it possible to not be concerned? Any one else have any of these issues? Log in to post a reply",
