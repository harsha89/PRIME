When she started on AC in November 2015 she was at early stage liver failure. It was scary and very hard for her and the family. She was 39 at the time. 4 Dose dense AC treatments (very difficult for her to handle) and 12 taxol treatments (soooo much easier for her to handle. As she would say she was able to live a more normal life on taxol, sleep 12 hours a day but could go to Costco and drive kids around during the day). Along with the weekly taxol she also received herceptin and perjeta every three weeks. She had number 12 taxol a week ago and had a scan. The results were no signs of damage or cancer in her liver. A few little stable bone mets but going from liver failure to no signs of cancer in her liver is amazing! The AC gave a 40% reduction but the taxol took it out completely. The mental game gets better also. That is our experienceI hope it gives you hope because there are a lot of women who have survived for years and years! Hang in there",
