How long will the scan last?  Being that exposed for any period of time is  like torture for me.   How do I handle this?  I am just about at my max.  I sat in the school's pick up line today and cried.  I felt like a fool.  I just want to know if it is or if it isn't.  I truely believe that knowing either way will make things so much easier to go forward from, but how do I know when they have done enough to rule out C all together?  Sorry for the ranting, just needed to get it out there.

(with an approving smile), call on monday for scheduling.  I think too many woman are passive when it comes to trusting doctors.  I couldn't even imagine taking the \"wait and see\" approach.  He flat out told me, when I asked, that it is possible for there to be something there that a mammo and US missed.  So, spread the word Ladies!  Be proactive, take charge of your well being, educate yourself and your friends and family.  Don't stop looking until you are given a 100% dx.  A YES or NO, not a \"it's probably ok.\"  because women have had \"a very slim chance\" dx and then it was.  Even if it is only a 2% chance of anything,  obviously it happened to that 2%.  OK, enough ranting.  My middle child had friends stay over for his 11th bday last night, and I think they have found a new room to destroy.  lol  I need to go. I have never met any of you, that I know of, but I love you all.  A room has been built in my heart to hold each of you there, and only you know the password. Log in to post a reply",
