They could put big , nasty Pharma out of business overnight! I was dx'ed with Stage IIa DCIS/IDC, ER+   PR+ no nodes in August 2000. I had four rounds of AC, every three weeks. Had chemo on Thursday afternoon, was off Friday and went back to work on Monday. I had the flu-like tiredness, bone pain from Nuepogen injections, diahrrea (sp) and constipation - all of which could be treated.I had 35 rad tx'ment.  Long term side affects: still alive and healthy, haven't had to shave my legs in 11 years, chemo brain (that's my story and I'm sticking to it) and some neurapathy (sp). I have no regrets for doing chemo.",
