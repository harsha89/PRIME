I was diagnosed Stage IV a year ago (stage 3a the year before that), and just started TDM1 a few months ago along with a low-methione diet. My tumors have shrunk significantly!!! I have 28 tumors in my liver, as well as lymph node involvement in my stomach, esophagus, and left aorta. The lymph nodes are barely detectable as of my last CT scan, which was 2 months ago. So after only 2 treatments of TDM1 and strict nutrition, I've shown significant improvement!!! I've since had 6 treatments, and can't wait for more good news soon! I specifically joined this forum to talk about TDM1,and so I could comment on the constant nose drip! That has been my only SE. I actually think that's the Herceptin, as I did a year of Herceptin in 2015-2016, and had a constant runny nose the entire time during treatment. It stopped when I stopped the Herceptin, but kicked right back up again almost a year later when I started the TDM1. I mentioned it to my MO, and I said it's not listed as a side effect, but that I keep reading about it on TDM1 boards, so now he's going to ask al this TDM1 patients about it! Any hoo, a regular antihistamine was not cutting it for me, so he found me a nose spray fro Rhinorrhea unrelated to a cold, and it's a life changer! It's just a nose spray for constant nose drip unrelated to anything, basically. So I just hopped on here to tell you about it because having a constant runny nose is the worst! It's called Ipratropium Bromide Nasal Solution. It's by Bausch + Lomb. (I don't work for them, and have no affiliation with them whatsoever...I just want you to know you don't have to live with constant nose drip!!!!) :)",
