She developed a nasty hematoma on the 9th day after an amazingly well recovery in the hospital. She had had taken her drains out at that time but the surgeon put one back in after the hematoma. It used to produce about a good 50 cc every day until they decided to take out the final drain.  She's been feeling heavy in the area of the lymph node dissection, with some itching (which she explains more like something very irritating) and some pain from time to time. The wound itself seems to be healing pretty well without any signs of infection. Now fact is, she has a little lump-like mass just where the lymph nodes under the armpit were but it really looks like a fat tissue. That's what the surgeon told us as well. He prescribed lidocaine (sp?) as well and I hope it's going to get her some relief at least.  I don't know when are these sensations of feeling heavy and irritated by clothes and the arm around this area going to disappear. I've read it might take months, true?  Thank you all for trying to read this and please excuse me for the bad English. Writing from Sofia, Bulgaria. P.S.: My mom is going to turn 66 on the 24th this month (lucky, eh?). I'm 25 myself.

Tumor markers in the range but in the high borderline (she tests for CA 15-3 only), scans for liver, bone, lungs, kidneys and sight of surgery - OK so far.  She went for the second in raw DEXA scan in late January, which showed a minus 6 % loss of bone density. Oncologist was thinking at first to keep her on Letrozole and add Bisphosphonates to reduce the bone loss. A month later though a comission of oncologists decided she switch on Tamoxifen (Nolvadex).  Question is: What would she lose with this kind of a switch which would put her out of the possibly to go back one day to any AI's?  Is Tamoxifen and a Bisphospohate (pill every month) combination the better one than the AI?  As far as I know, osteoporosis is an inversable process with the right treatment...  Thank you so much in advance, and bless you, A thankful daughter from Bulgaria :) My mom's data: Surgery 11/15/2012 Mastectomy: Left Dx 11/16/2012, ILC, <1cm, Stage IA, 0/18 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Hormonal Therapy Femara (letrozole) Log in to post a reply",
