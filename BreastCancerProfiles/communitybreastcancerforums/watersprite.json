What am I risking? What have been your experiences? Up until this week it's been mostly numbness in my toes and finger tips which cleared up by the weekend. This week has been worse. Here it is Saturday and and I'm still numb And tingly. Even my chin is a little numb and that was gone days ago in previous treatments. Did I read correctly that this can get worse for up to two weeks after the last treatment? Good news is that when I take the B6 twice daily, I can tell a difference within and hour. Maybe my imagination that it works so quickly. ;-) I know the information I need has probably been posted on these boards before. Please forgive my impatience with finding it and Thank You for your help.

Has anyone else gone this route. I finished 3 of 8 yesterday and so far so good. This is Much Easier than AC!
