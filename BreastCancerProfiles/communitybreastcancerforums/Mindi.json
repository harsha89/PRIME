    "Content": "Feb 19, 2011 03:24AM - edited Feb 19, 2011 03:31AM by Mindi After 8 months of chemo (had to change from AC + T protocol, with 2 tx remaining, to carbo/gemzar for 6 cycles) I had a modified rad with axillary dissection on February 2.  Reconstruction will be done in about 6 months when they do the prophylactic MX on the other side. I have 6 weeks of radiation to get through first. The pain wasn't really that bad and easily managed with hydrocodone/APAP 5/500. The drains were more of an annoyance than anything (they came out 2 weeks later). Remain diligent on the physical therapy and lymph stimulating exercises ... the skin tightness becomes manageable. Remember the old adage \"use it or lose it\"? Good luck everyone and stay strong!",
