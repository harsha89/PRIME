I had my mammogram and ultrasound today and they couldn't pinpoint which duct was bleeding but the doctor said they would do surgery to remove the duct. I fear that since my ultrasound did not show the duct affected by the papilloma that they will have to take all of my ducts....did anyone have that experience? I have a consult with the surgeon tomorrow, and I have so much information and questions swirling around in my head. During the mammogram and ultrasound they also found a fibroadeoma, which the doctor that read my ultrasound assured me was probably benign but they want me back in 6 months for another ultrasound. Do any of you have experience with these? My maternal grandmother had breast cancer in her late 30's and ovarian cancer and passed away when she was 42. I am 33....and all of these things together have me very concerned. Any words of advice would be so helpful! Thank you!",
