I was diagnosed in Jan 2009 stage IV, er/pr+, her2-, bones, liver, lungs and am currently in second round of treatment with Xoloda, Tykerb, and Xgeva. The only progression has been in the bones, all other areas have shrunk or they are not sure if was cancer at all besides the primary breast. I haven't been on forums for a long time. Just can't seem to find the time, but I know it's important to connect and learn and share. Consider Buon Gusto in Brighton- best darn italian food ever!!",
