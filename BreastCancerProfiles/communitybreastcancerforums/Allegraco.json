I was diagnosed with suspected 1 cm Radial Scar and just recieved patholgy which was negative I'm happy to say. Will have it removed in two weeks as my Doctor is not happy with the shape or size and I'm good with that. It's hard not to worry I know but on my report it did say with a BIRAD of 4a it was low risk so take some comfort from that if you can.",
