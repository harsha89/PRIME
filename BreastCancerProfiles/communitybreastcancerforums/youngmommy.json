Are you having neo adjuvant chemo or you already have had surgery?  Did your MO mentioned any benefits of weekly over Bi Weekly in terms of effectiveness of Taxol (other than the side effects?)  I understand that weekly is better than every two weeks in terms of side effects, but as per the chemo protocol of M D Anderson, dose dense AC followed by dose dense Taxol (every two weeks) produce best results so that is what got me confused. Thanks for your time and the info.  Wish you a very Happy and HEALTHY new year 2012.  ",

I will be starting with the first dose of Taxol on 12th Jan.  I just finished 4 dose dense AC and feeling very fatigued and tired. My blood counts are doing okie so far (with the Neulasta shots after every AC cycle). I am glad that I will not need any more of those as they caused a lot of bone pain. Thankfully weather has been good in south florida (except for today when it dropped down to like 45 in the morning. And thank you all for providing the pointers on B6, Glutamine and L Carnatine. I spoke with my MO and she was okie with me taking all of those during the Taxol treatments.  Thanks much once again for sharing the information in such tough times. I hope you ladies had a wonderful New Year Eve. Wish you and everyone here on these forums a very Happy and Healthy new year.  ",

      "Content": "youngmommy wrote: Hello Ladies, I am new to this forum. I am 29 years old and was dx with TNBC on 30th October. I had a 4.2 cm tumor and was recommended Neo Adjuvant chemo followed by Surgery and then Radiation by the multi modality group at the cancer center.  I started Neo Adjuvant Chemo on 14th Nov and since then had 4 dose dense cycles of AC (Adriamycin and Cytoxin). I would be starting Taxol in 2 weeks and is given option of either 12 cycles of weekly Taxol OR 4 cycles of Bi Weekly Taxol and I am unable to decide which one should I opt for.  As I understand weekly taxol has been proven to be better than tri weekly (every 3 weeks) and if the same data is extrapolated, weekly should be better than Bi weekly too. But this study was done in Adjuvant settings (Chemo after surgery). There probably are no studies that are done in Neo Adjuvant setting or may be I am unable to find one.  So I would greatly appreciate if you knowledgeable ladies can provide some valuable opinion on my question. Wish you all a very Happy and HEALTHY New Year.  Young Mommy Log in to post a reply",

I understand that weekly taxol has lesser side effects compared to Bi-Weekly (Neutropenia for sure is more common with BiWeekly), but Dose dense (every two weeks) is more effective and is also suggested my M.D.Anderson chemo protocol in the neo adjuvant settings. This is why I am undecided as to what should I opt for -- weekly with lesser SEs or BiWeekly which probably is more effective. Thanks,",
