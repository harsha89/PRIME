I guess they are just lymph nodes, which I thought had been all removed, but evidently still have some floaters. I think I strained my arm carrying a ream of paper around a store for while and that triggered it. It's all I can think of; how sensitive is that? We'll be watching for reactions or evidence of new disease forever. Pretty much life goes on, but this is always on theback burner. We have a gorgeous fall day here, actually the longest stretch of beautiful weather that I can remember. Today might be a good day for dd and kids and I to go to the Pumpkin Patch.

My hand feel full and stiff today also. Otherwise, no nausea. Theresa, The AC made me a lot more nauseas and I was very weepy on it. Haven't been on the Taxol long enough to know if the weepy will be different yet. Some of it is everything we have been through and I find my coping skills go way down at night when I'm tired. Hang in there the first few days are the worst and then the symptoms begin to lessen before the next treatment. I'm hoping to avoid weight gain like the rest of you. It has been fluctuating some, but since the beginning of the diagnosis and all the surgeries I've had I've lost around 35 pounds. I'd like to lose maybe 15 more and go with the lifestyle changes. I have some arthritis and high blood pressure and I know my body would really appreciate the changes, as would my husband. He is at his high school weight and has been very disciplined about it over the years. I made it through treatment yesterday without tears, actually the entire day. That's pretty amazing for me. I was at the clinic for 7 hours. Is that how long it take the rest of you? I do start with blood work and then the doctor's visit and finally, the treatment. It's a long day. Congratulations to those of you finishing and looking at completing the reconstruction. There is a light at the end. That's an encouragement to those of us still in process.

We are so relieved things are returning to her new normal. You can see pictures on FB. I love you girls! ",

My husband said he'll let me know when it's long enough to consider stopping. I've never had short hair in my adult life. Mine is also very thick. I have some sort of rash going on the site of the mast and rads. They put me on meds for shingles, but they don't think it looks like classic shingles. I saw three different drs. on Monday. If it isn't gone or much improved by next week, I will probably have to have a biopsy to determine what is going on. That has raised my level of concern. We went to a cancer support group last night that I think we will continue with. They were very supportive and caring; I think it will help my husband with how he processes all of this also. I've started some training for school already and our new curriculum isn't going to be much fun. All teachers teaching the same subject in the district are expected to be in the same place at the same time. Grades 6,7,8 have the same type of consumable workbook for each year, by the time they get to me, in grade 8, I'm afraid they'll be sick of it. I thankful to have a job, but am very concerned about how this will be implemented. Also, starting 10 hour days seems like it will be a lot. Do you all feel back to normal? I'm 2 1/2 months past rads; I thought I was coping better. I think this \"rash\" has me more undone than I thought. ",

Also, my MRI showed suspicion of the right breast that would have to be monitored. I see a lot of women on these boards going back in for a propholactic second surgery due to the stress of constant monitoring. I feel more peace knowing that they took as much as possible, minus the few stray cells. There was a concern after the surgery when I had to have radiation that the tram could fail. I was fortunate and that didn't happen, although that side did shrink a bit. If you have more questions that I can help you with, you can post here or PM me.

I was dreading going, but I am very glad to be done. I unfortunately had the same reaction to the pre-meds again today. But, got through it and am DONE. The nurses came and sang and brought me a little cake to celebrate. My husband and a friend took me out to dinner to celebrate. It does feel good. The next few days, will be more bearable knowing it will be the last time through on this. Hurray! I have found out that when I go for follow up appts. with the onc, the onc surgeon, and the PS in March they will be doing a follow up bone scan to check for what what glowing in my hip before I began chemo. I'll find out what the team of drs. recommend for radiation and the oral chemo meds. I'm some afraid of them, esp. tamoxifen from what I have been reading. The studies I've read show they really do benefit the chances of reoccurance so onward to what lies ahead. I get so scared thinking about all of this and how out of control it all is. All I really want to do is spend time with my family and close friends. I wish sometimes that I didn't have to work and truly could just be with the ones I love. That doesn't appear to be an option. I've been fortunate to be able to take off the days when I haven't been doing well, working only 3-5 days out of every two weeks and able to keep my full pay and benefits. I know they think I'll be back full-time after this last round. We'll see how the energy levels go. A lot of the things that seemed important before don't seem so much anymore. I just know there a lot of people I care a lot for and they have become even more important to me. You precious ladies here as a support group are right up there at the top. Susan",

I am so wanting to be done being cut on and put under. In the last 10 months, I've been put under 7 times. Let me know how the tattooing goes, I'll do mine later this year by someone that specializes in tattooing permanent make-up, etc. I'd even like to have eyeliner done, but we'll see about that.",

Did you ever find some support to help you some as you go through all of this treatment? I truly hope so, it is hard enough without little ones and a husband that has his own issues. Let us know how you are doing when you have the strength and the time. (((HUGS)))",

How long after rads did your onc say it takes to reach the peak from the tx? I finished rads yesterday. I really was a November chemo gal, so my hair is probably a month behind all of yours. I'm hoping for the curl; I've never had that before. I'm not liking the mousy color that it is though. I get my port out in a week. I was nauseated from the anesthesia putting it in, so am wondering about it coming out, but am ready. We are supposed to leave for Colorado the next morning, so am hoping it goes quickly and well. Are most of you doing the tamoxifen? I know Ulla is struggling, how is it for others? That's next for me. I did read the advice to Ulla to start with smaller doses and build up and think that's what I will do. Keep posting ladies, it helps keep me going. Happy spring to all.",

During that chemo cycle, I wondered if this day would ever come. I see some of you on the tamox boards and wish everyone well in whatever phase they are in. I was told yesterday that I don't need to see the oncologist for three months just for check-ups to make sure the disease stays away. That was a long time in coming. The PS has some tune-up work to do and then I think I'm done with this initial phase, hopefully to never return. I'm getting my hair touched up in a week or so, and then I will post my red hair. Our treatments must have emboldened us and had us step out. I'm hoping for the Jamie Lee Curtis look only in red by fall when I enter a bldg. with 900 middle schoolers. Congratulations to everyone here and how far we have all come on this journey. Especially, those of you that have done public speaking as an encouragement to others. Bravo!",

I, too, am doing a Relay for Life this year. My first one. I still have several swollen lymph nodes that we are \"watching.\" I am supposed to have some surgery to fix part of the TRAM flap in July, but the insurance is quibbling... so we'll see. In a way it would be nice to not have another surgery.  Hope everyone can enjoy life this summer to the fullest.  ",

It appears my system did not handle the CT scans and the chemo well. I now have Chronic Kidney Disease stage 3. I had to go off of all the Nsaids for arthritis and watch what I eat for potassium, phosphorous, and limit protein and dairy. Not much left when you consider everything that has soy, also.  We had a wonderful weekend with friends celebrating the Fourth. Saw two excellent fireworks displays. Times like those are encouraging in the struggle. Of course, there is always the family. My daughter and her sons, ages 5 and 10, are living with us, so there's a lot of life and activity going on. Hope you are all holding your own in our ongoing fight against this disease. I think of you often; we are close to the 3 years out mark. That first year during chemo this seemed impossible. Keep up the good fight! (((hugs))) Sue",

I just don't do well with anti-depressant types of meds. I know some people have had good results with it. Hopefully, you'll be one of them. Looking forward to that five year out mark when we all get together to celebrate. It makes me smile when I think of it. It will be a blast. I, too, am thankful for each of you and everyday that we can be NED and living life to the fullest. Three years ago we all wondered if we would ever be out among the living again... and here we are.

They were very concerned that the tram would fail due to the radiation. I came through it fairly well, but the radiated side did shrink some from the tx. I didn't know I would have rads until after the SNB. The tram is a terribly difficult surgery. I was fairly large breasted and was glad that I had something there when I was done with it all. I haven't had nipple recon yet. If DIEP is an option at all for you, I would consider that. Also, I had ILC and the lumpectomy didn't have clean margins; it also has a higher incidence of becoming bilat. These factors influenced my decision. Make sure your surgeon has done a lot of these. Just changing surgeons took the surgery time from 12 hours to 7 hours. If I can help you any more, let me know. ",

I had it done at the same time as the bilat mast. I chose that because ILC has higher risk of being bilat. I do have the scaring, but I now have a flat tummy and the breast size is about a 36c. I will have the nipple recon and tattooing l later this year. Mostly, I am happy I went this route. The only other route I would have considered would no recon. Actually, my first choice would have been the DIEP recon, but I would have had to travel to New Orleans for that. It is a much easier recon.",
