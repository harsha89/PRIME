I am concerned. Something is DEFINITELY different in my left breast.  I feel slightly frustrated because I initiated the visit to the Dr before the surgury in April - I felt pressure and weird feelings and the small tumor.  But I felt because I am relatively young (37 at the time) and in excellent health that medical people looked at me as skeptical and rushed me along.  But then they found the phyllodes.  Anyway, nothing for me to do but wait until October.  I wonder if any other people with phyllodes tumors feel anything?  The things I feel drive me a little nuts because they are constant reminders.  Hope all went well for you. ",
