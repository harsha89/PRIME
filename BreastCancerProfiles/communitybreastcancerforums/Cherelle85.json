Here goes nothing- Since my last child was born(not exactly sure on time frame) I have been having full aches in my left breast. I didn't think they were anything, but recently that area has become more sensitive with & without touch. Something just feels different. So googling doesn't provide much & I have scheduled a checkup with my gyn. But I wanted input from you all. What were your signs? Was there a dull ache? Did it feel better to apply pressure? I have no swelling, no 'orange peel' texture. I'm scared/nervous/worried! Thanks all! Log in to post a reply",
