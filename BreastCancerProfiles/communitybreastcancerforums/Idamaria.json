Tumor size 1.3 cm Code: Go to meet surgeon again on Tuesday she said my choices are they need to remove another tumor, if that is cancer then I have to have masectomy or if not she will go in and remove more tissue on the tumor they already removed as I do not have clean margins and do the node removal at that time. The do not think they can do Sentinal node biospy as the tumor they removed last week interupted the lymph flow so Surgeon want to remove all lymph nodes under the are and one other tier of them at the time of surgery. I am scared but hopeful as if no lymph node involvement I will be at Stage one. My tumor grade was 111 so she said I will need chemo and radiation. Anmy suggestions for questions to the Dr on Tuesday. Thanks Log in to post a reply",
