Healthcare today is a schizophrenic contradiction between trying to save money and trying to give the patient a good outcome. As both a former healthcare provider and TWICE the partner of a breast cancer victim, I retired so I could spent the last ten years studying molecular biology and cancer biology. Don't get me wrong, between the last time and this one much has changed and I can see it in the best of cancer centers then and now. Monoclonal antibodies have been quite a wonder when applied to cancer and to rheumatology alike. But far more mind bogging has been the stem-cell hypothesis by which stochastic stem cells (cells that reproduce themselves) proliferation, consisting of less than 1% of tumor burden, are deemed the cause of metastasis and these are deemed so able at DNA repair that they are STIMULATED rather than KILLED by radiation therapy. Yes, yes, I know the literature showing statistical benefit from radiation therapy. But that's the mathematics of the blind, not the mechanistic understanding of the wise! Statistics has led us down a lot of roads that took millions of clinical research $$ off a cliff, sometimes even through fraud by originally well intended academic clinicians that could not accept the mathematical failure of their end points. So, here we are 2015, forty plus years of the War on Cancer and we have two highly respected oncological researchers, Tomasetti and Vogelstein telling us in the highly reputable journal SCIENCE: \"These results suggest that only a third of the variation in cancer risk among tissues is attributable to environmental factors or inherited predispositions. The majority is due to 'bad luck,' that is, random mutations arising during DNA replication in normal, noncancerous stem cells.\" So, one would ask: if stem cells are stimulated rather than killed by radiation; and, if we know so little about cancer stem cells as to deem it \"bad luck\" that some cells undergo mutation, epigenetic acetylation of genomic aberrations originally methylated, etc, what can you as a radiation oncologist tell us about, let us say, what damage you may do to a cancer of the breast knocked out (almost??) by neadjuvant monoclonals and surgery but possibly stimulated by radiation therapy? I fear that those of us \"in the know\" may be no more in the know than the victims and their families and as such cannot be so categorical in our tutorials.We're back to the old adage: \"Don't describe it until you've tried it.\" Burning is an inflammatory condition that provokes cytokines and chemokines that FEEL LIKE burning. All the effects of radiation therapy are described as possible 10 to 15 years post radiation therapy in the consent forms. You might try to explain why. Is it killing \"bad guys\" that clears the \"reeeaaal bad guys? We don't really know except for the stats....and then for any one of us, patient or loved ones, it's all a matter of N=1! Isn't it a bit of quibbling when you say that radiation doesn't accumulate but its effects could accumulate to manifest 10-15 years later? We've been at war with cancer for quite some time. In that time some of us have been at war with the Viet Cong, with alQaeda in Iraq and with the Taliban in Afghanistan too. As one close to all those \"wars,\" I feel that we may be loosing the one on cancer for the same reasons as the other three: idee fixe! Our thinking gets comfee and well remunerated in certain practices that we really can't argue for so we just wave our WHITE coats instead of red cape to calm the bulls that want a cure now! Medicine has been turned into a work horse instead of a scientific art. That is why so much of it is now put into the hands of Physician Assistants and Nurse Practitioners. In my first experience, every visit to the cancer center was with the oncologist, now-- though my wife pays the co-pay to see a specialist, she only sees an oncology nurse with a hard to fathom alphabet soup of letters behind her name. And how a radiation oncology gives her a weekly look-over that would make you scream bloody murder if your mechanic spent that much time with your car at its 10,000 miles check-up.  Kind words sandwiching a pompous correction is not what one expects from a companion through this deadly journey that scares the patient to death. I always thought that all oncology radiologists should be made in residency to look over and over and over and over again to the films from Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Radiation was merciful only to the dead. Of course, I didn't stop my wife from getting her current course of radiation therapy, but I do have something of a jaundiced eye towards the oncologist who could only say, \"yes that too is possible\" to EVERY ONE of asked questions, and then she disappeared. If I spent eight hours cooking and sucking on a brain, you can bet that I spent all the time after dealing with the deadly swelling of the brain. So, the least of those who fights my wife's cancer should not be the one least there, n'est pas? The fault is not of the physicians for, since residency, they learn that you are there, EVERYWHERE, or you are out of the next year in pyramidal residency years. So, little wonder that when the $5 million a year administrators give you a whole flock of patients to manage, you're bound to be rather formulaic. But we must make the effort to understand that a patient's MISinformation is a desperate grasp at illusory straws by a drowning fellow human in excruciating pain and fear, neural inputs that dfry one's every mental compass. That they need to grasp at these only speaks of how much medicine grasps at straws while trying to keep the insurers and administrators from saying: \"NO MORE!\" It was not long ago that physicians prescribed the same things our \"mis\"-informed correspondent in this blog prescribed. I'd say that-- at the very least-- she may be as misinformed as we were not too long ago. When I got so desperate that I wanted to understand the disease better than I wanted to understand the patient I knew it was time to retire. I recall when I was a medical student I had been diagnosed with a leukemic disorder. I came back to the USA and saw a hematologist that I can only call a \"Jewish sage.\" When I asked him how long I had as I didn't want to go back to Europe to suffer miserably just to be buried with \"MD\" on my tombstone, he said: \"How the f--- do I know. But I'll tell this, that if you don't go back I'm going to charge you for all this care.\" Later when I came back to America, I told him that what kept me going was his frankness, to which he replied: \"We must always remember before whom we stand.\" This is different from all the cancer patients I saw in clinic in Eastern Europe, for whom we could do nothing but they were fodder for papers to be submitted \"in the West.\" Now, decades later, it seems to me, cancer is being treated more like in Eastern Europe than by my hematologist. Indeed, especially radiologists, must remember BEFORE WHOM WE STAND! ",

Therefore, a closer individualization of care is needed rather than a rejection of the desperate grab of patients at straws such as \"natural care.\" Would it not be better to admit how little we know (note the Tomasetti and Vogelstein quote) and then give more time to individualized the patient-oncologist interaction? If we go back to Hippocrates, care was standing by the patient, not treating her like one of a herd of unfortunates. Downplaying the side-effects of natural \"therapies\" patients grasp at and offering little more instead is NOT the answer. What's needed is more time to be reassuring and persuasive....to explain HOW and WHY so the patient can feel that her cognitive state is as interesting as her disease. The authority of expertese is eroding so in the end we will be left with deciding whether you are a statistical lab rat or a companion in a journey to the oncologist whom, in the final analysis, is not much less blind than you. Therefore, personal caring has to go with the un-sureness that comes with the therapy. That means doing MORE for LESS patients as some oncologists do. Empathy is needed to create trust as expertise that knows what to do is not really available as we once thought it would be when we started the War on Cancer!",
