Talk to your Dr about a muscle relaxer if it's too painful, and take your pain meds on schedule so the pain doesn't get ahead of you. Warm, moist heat is also great.

I knew when I left that they hoped they might have news as early as today but certainly on Monday and the radiologist told me that they always try to follow patient wishes for notification but typically give results over the phone.  Her biggest worry was whether or not I'd rather have the weekend to regroup or hear on Monday when I could spring into action.  I weighed that carefully for about a second and said call me on Friday if you have them (really, the NOT knowing is the worst for me...). Had barely gotten home from the biopsy when my PCP called and suggested I make an appt. with a breast surgeon (he had the recommendation of who and why all ready for me), even though the pathologist report wasn't going to be ready for a day or two.  So, I did and they were lovely, with the understanding I would call and cancel if it was benign. Shortly after talking to the radiologist today, their patient care advocate called and they are going to call the BS office and try to get me in a little sooner (it's currently scheduled for the 19th) but that might be up in the air depending on their schedule.  She was also terrific, gave more information (like it matters now...NOT...but BIRAD was 5) and even gave me some advice on handling the red welts from the bandage strips.  She also mentioned that the BS would likely want to do an MRI. So, that's it.  Vascillating between numb, tired, and worn out.  Have some anxiety (and PCP gave me his blessing on taking Xanax when I needed it) but am sort of in that phase where now that I know what's really happening, it's actually a little more bearable.

In addition to Maud's contribution, just a couple of weeks ago there was a CBS report about the lack of consistent margin standards across the nation when doing excisions, and I have read on these boards where some surgeons and/or pathologists are fine with one margin number and others require more or less.  So, no excuses for poor patient care--but that could potentially account for the differing opinions of what consists of a \"clean\" vs. \"positive\" margin.

She ordered the scan (and a brain MRI which I am having tomorrow) when I was complaining about persistent back pain and headaches at my August visit. The findings/impressions state, ...Suggestion of upper lumbar spine, probably L1, metastatic focus. MRI evaluation of the lumbar spine recommended... So, I guess the question is what do you think are the odds of the spot being something OTHER than metastases? These are the same radiologists who found my relatively small IDC and every doctor I have seen (including at MDA) thought did an outstanding job of detection, so my level of confidence in their credibility/expertise is quite high.

There are a lot of unknowns in my family history and if I've learned anything over these last 10 months it is that every dx is unique with lots of personal variables. To your questions: My insurance denied genetic testing when I was first diagnosed and, as it appeared I was a garden-variety early stager, I didn't pursue it due to the cost. I was 55 at dx but, like many of us, was told the cancer had likely been growing for many years before it was large enough to detect via mammography in my relatively dense breasts. I had two spots in my breast and a positive node so, while unlikely to have had it spread, I did realize that it was a possibility. If it turns out to be confirmed mets, I kinda suspect it might have been there all along. I have been on Femara since May 1 and it very well may have already helped! I had no chemo or rads. My mom was diagnosed with BC when she was 59,and has also survived colon and lung cancer. I have never had medical information on my biological father's side so have no idea what may be lingering there. Sending you hugs and hoping you will not stress too much over this. We all are truly unique and the odds really are in your favor right now!",

First of all, please accept my deep regret that your DD is having to go through this and at such a young age. Having you to turn to must be a real comfort. It sounds as if your DD's medical team is terrific and seeing positive results from the chemo is wonderful. I cannot answer specific questions regarding her IBC or chemo but hopefully someone will come along soon with that expertise. Regarding the reconstruction, it sounds to me that you have not yet consulted with the plastic surgeon? S/he should definitely have an opinion about the timing of the reconstruction and will hopefully consult with her breast surgeon and MO regarding their thoughts on any potential radiation to the breast skin area. Beyond that very important conversation, I would say that anything that makes your DD feel as good about herself as possible is never crazy to consider. With luck, she will be here for a very long time and feeling attractive is a morale boost for anyone. Just make sure to have all the necessary conversations around possible complications with future treatments in mind, and consider her stamina, ability to ward off potential (but hopefully unlikely) infections, and ability to cope with any pain. You might want to read some in the reconstruction threads, as well. If the PS wants to use expanders, there may be some pain issues you will want to be aware of and discuss. Please keep us posted and let your DD know we will be thinking about her and sending hugs to you both.",

As for continuing to bring up the request for no node removable, once it is all agreed upon with the surgeon, may I suggest that it get mentioned to everyone who checks (nurses, anesthesiologist, PAs, and surgeon again) the day OF surgery. My surgical nurse made it clear to me that she had my back in surgery and asked me to reiterate things like the need for strong anti-nausea precautions, etc. The more people who know what the decision is, the less chance for a mistake. You might also ask the surgeon about what her protocol is if she changes her mind during surgery and feels she has to remove any nodes. Just so you're all clear.

My husband has been pretty terrific about not saying stupid stuff but had some earlier experience with melanoma (was told it was stage IV but they were wrong....whew) so is a bit more sensitive.  What I am noticing is that my dx affects him very differently and I'm trying to find the balance between my need to spill everything new I learn to him and his need to sometimes talk about something other than my BC.  He doesn't process things like me (geez...lol) and truly just shuts down when he gets overloaded.  We're inching our way through this together, though, and learning better communication skills as we go.  I can't help but feel that sometimes I'm having to take care of him when I'd rather be stomping and crying, but then I remember how I felt when he was dx and try to apply some of the same courtesies.  Be patient and hopefully your husband will turn out to be your biggest support and cheerleader.  Until then (and after), you know we're here for you (and you, too, sandik) to vent, cry, and rage to.  Hugs!",

If plastic surgery is in your wife's future, Dr. Mark Villa is mine and I also adore him. Even my local radiation oncologist had heard about Dr. Villa's work and thought I was very lucky to have him. I was so NOT impressed with the oncologist they assigned me (she may have been fine technically but had a really terrible way of relating and pretty much blew through my appointment as if I wasn't a challenging enough case for her attention...my sister accompanied me to all my appointments there and felt the same way so I knew it just wasn't me). Fortunately, we have a very good, comprehensive cancer center locally and I get my oncology treatment here. If I were to go back to MDA for onocological issues, I would request a new MO. MDA is huge and very patient oriented so you will be in good hands. They really try to make the most of their out of town patient visits so don't be surprised by rapidly changing schedules to accommodate the testing and doctors they want you to see. You will likely start off with a breast surgeon appointment and go from there. Bring some portable entertainment (I did a lot of reading) and have your wife carry a shawl or sweater as many of the waiting areas and exam rooms can be very chilly. I am sure others will be along shortly with their recommendations. The best of luck and good wishes to you and your wife.",

      "Content": "Ysa wrote: Began to realize yesterday that my anxiety levels were rising and have done the Xanax route (last evening), the self-talk route, the try-to-focus-on-something-else route, and still feeling pretty icky.  It's really kind of stupid and my husband characterized it well when he said that our minds are \"GO GO GO\" and the world responds with \"slow slow slow\".  I just feel like my life is on hold right now until I finally get a freakin' return phone call from MDA.  So, thanks for letting me vent and if you have anything you think might be helpful, please feel free to share. After meeting with my local BS in January and a local PS on 2/2, we all decided I would be best served going out of state for surgery.  MD Anderson was highly recommended and, after a variety of phone calls, etc. on Thursday, I found out they were in-network and there should be no problem with me getting my BMX and DIEP.  I called early Thursday afternoon to make an appointment, was told there was an appt. available in a \"couple of weeks\" and asked if I wanted that one.  I said yes and was told someone would call within 48 business hours.  I was a little iffy regarding the gal who took my name and phone number (she didn't know if they took my insurance but thought they did, didn't give me any specific date for \"a couple of weeks\", questioned my phone number which has the same prefix--different area code--as theirs, etc.)  Nothing happened on Friday (I was home all day) so, on Saturday, I went ahead and filled out their on-line self-referral form and noted in the comments section that I had called and didn't want them to get a duplicate referral.  Their form asked a TON of questions that I didn't get asked when I first called, so I thought that was good. On Monday morning, I got an email from someone screening my form noting that I had already been assigned a patient access specialist so they were deleting my form.  I emailed back and told them that I hadn't heard from anyone so was just trying to be thorough.  They emailed back and said that they had notes that the PAS had tried to call me on Friday but \"couldn't get through\".  I was home on Friday, all day.  I have voice mail and call waiting (that goes to voice mail if I don't answer the call waiting).  But maybe someone copied down my number incorrectly. They did at least also provide her name and a phone number to try to reach the PAS.  I turned around and called my PAS (still early Monday morning), got her voice mail, and left a very nice message that I was sorry she had trouble reaching me, repeated my phone number slowly, twice, and let her know that I would be out of the house between 11-1 their time for a doctor's appt. but would otherwise be home.  Her outgoing voice mail did indicate that they return calls by the end of the next business day but I was kind of hoping I'd hear from her yesterday, anyway. Got home from the dr. and had voice mail waiting from someone else but no other calls while I was gone.  And no call by the end of the day, yesterday. I think I'm usually a really nice and considerate person, try to be really patient, get assertive when necessary, but realize we are often dealing with overworked folks, so I've been trying to reconcile myself to waiting but it's getting harder.  To minimize my anxiety, this morning about half an hour after they would have started business hours, I called, got her voice mail again (with the same \"return calls by end of next business day\" message) and very nicely said I was concerned that she might be having troubles getting through to me so repeated my original (home) number AND gave my cell number and email address, noting I would be home all day. So, it's now 3 hours later and all my best intentions to wait this out and not be a pest are evaporating.  It's probably exacerbated by the fact that I'm waiting on getting this information from them before making several more appts.   I have to travel from Albuquerque to Houston for this first appt., don't know how long I'll need to be there, and want to make sure I'm not double-booking things.  So, I'm on hold.  And it's driving me nuts.  And I think I'm probably being unreasonable and know all the logical reasons this is driving me nuts (and probably shouldn't be), but guess I finally needed to release some of the pent-up anxiety in a safe place. Honestly, in the back of my mind, I'm also thinking about my mom, who finally has her oncologist appt. today to find out what are her next steps for what is likely to be lung cancer (PET scan showed a big hot spot in her lungs--she's already had breast and colon cancer).  My only sister had planned on going to MDA with me and hanging for as long as needed through my time there and recovery at home, but now I'm worried that she's going to start feeling conflicted about whether she should be with my mom or me if things start overlapping.  Okay, so maybe I'll take a small dose of Xanax.  LOL Still, thanks for listening and I'd love to hear your thoughts, especially if you have had any experiences with MDA (good or bad at whatever stage),  Thanks!!

After meeting with my local BS in January and a local PS on 2/2, we all decided I would be best served going out of state for surgery.  MD Anderson was highly recommended and, after a variety of phone calls, etc. on Thursday, I found out they were in-network and there should be no problem with me getting my BMX and DIEP.  I called early Thursday afternoon to make an appointment, was told there was an appt. available in a \"couple of weeks\" and asked if I wanted that one.  I said yes and was told someone would call within 48 business hours.  I was a little iffy regarding the gal who took my name and phone number (she didn't know if they took my insurance but thought they did, didn't give me any specific date for \"a couple of weeks\", questioned my phone number which has the same prefix--different area code--as theirs, etc.)  Nothing happened on Friday (I was home all day) so, on Saturday, I went ahead and filled out their on-line self-referral form and noted in the comments section that I had called and didn't want them to get a duplicate referral.  Their form asked a TON of questions that I didn't get asked when I first called, so I thought that was good. On Monday morning, I got an email from someone screening my form noting that I had already been assigned a patient access specialist so they were deleting my form.  I emailed back and told them that I hadn't heard from anyone so was just trying to be thorough.  They emailed back and said that they had notes that the PAS had tried to call me on Friday but \"couldn't get through\".  I was home on Friday, all day.  I have voice mail and call waiting (that goes to voice mail if I don't answer the call waiting).  But maybe someone copied down my number incorrectly. They did at least also provide her name and a phone number to try to reach the PAS.  I turned around and called my PAS (still early Monday morning), got her voice mail, and left a very nice message that I was sorry she had trouble reaching me, repeated my phone number slowly, twice, and let her know that I would be out of the house between 11-1 their time for a doctor's appt. but would otherwise be home.  Her outgoing voice mail did indicate that they return calls by the end of the next business day but I was kind of hoping I'd hear from her yesterday, anyway. Got home from the dr. and had voice mail waiting from someone else but no other calls while I was gone.  And no call by the end of the day, yesterday. I think I'm usually a really nice and considerate person, try to be really patient, get assertive when necessary, but realize we are often dealing with overworked folks, so I've been trying to reconcile myself to waiting but it's getting harder.  To minimize my anxiety, this morning about half an hour after they would have started business hours, I called, got her voice mail again (with the same \"return calls by end of next business day\" message) and very nicely said I was concerned that she might be having troubles getting through to me so repeated my original (home) number AND gave my cell number and email address, noting I would be home all day. So, it's now 3 hours later and all my best intentions to wait this out and not be a pest are evaporating.  It's probably exacerbated by the fact that I'm waiting on getting this information from them before making several more appts.   I have to travel from Albuquerque to Houston for this first appt., don't know how long I'll need to be there, and want to make sure I'm not double-booking things.  So, I'm on hold.  And it's driving me nuts.  And I think I'm probably being unreasonable and know all the logical reasons this is driving me nuts (and probably shouldn't be), but guess I finally needed to release some of the pent-up anxiety in a safe place. Honestly, in the back of my mind, I'm also thinking about my mom, who finally has her oncologist appt. today to find out what are her next steps for what is likely to be lung cancer (PET scan showed a big hot spot in her lungs--she's already had breast and colon cancer).  My only sister had planned on going to MDA with me and hanging for as long as needed through my time there and recovery at home, but now I'm worried that she's going to start feeling conflicted about whether she should be with my mom or me if things start overlapping.  Okay, so maybe I'll take a small dose of Xanax.  LOL Still, thanks for listening and I'd love to hear your thoughts, especially if you have had any experiences with MDA (good or bad at whatever stage),  Thanks!!

Scuttlers, thank you so much for the info on the bus/rail alternative.  Whenever it is, I had planned on going a day early so should be relaxed enough to navigate that. Come surgery time, my sister and I were hoping to grab a queen room with kitchenette so we were not stuck eating from restaurants all the time, so it's nice to know there are grocery stores within the Rotary's shuttle proximity.

On a related note, I was a little stunned at them saying that I should be prepared to stay in Houston for 5-7 business days for the initial consult stuff, not to mention that they routinely re-run the pathology on the original biopsy and it could cost me out of pocket between $250-$2500 if insurance won't cover all or part of it (I refuse to stress that one).  Thank you all, again, for the support and venting allowance.  You made a difference in my coping today and that is priceless (as are you!).

Am going to hope for (and ask for) a surgery date no earlier than at least later in the week of 3/19 so I can actually get a hotel room for my sister (and then the two of us).  Thanks, again, for all the tips and reassurances.  Still anxious but now it's about different things (and more manageable) and I think it's interesting how our anxiety just switches focus as we journey.  Back to lurking.  Light and peaceful healing to all. P.S.

      "Content": "Ysa wrote: Some specific-to-MD Anderson surgery questions from anyone who can answer.  Thanks in advance! I plan on a BMX with flap (hopefully DIEP) reconstruction immediately, if all goes well.  So far, my local BS and PS feel that should be possible.  The questions come from that perspective. 1.  I have been told (locally) that I may be in the hospital as long as 5 days and then sent back to the hotel for another week or two for recovery and follow-up with MDA.  My local BS and PS both indicated that MDA would probably want me to stay locally for up to 3-5 weeks and it's possible I'd still come home with a drain or two (my local BS will remove any drains).  Did anyone have that kind of experience and can share some insight as to how it went? 2.  Did MDA release you from the hospital with any kind of camisole or compression garments?  Were they good or did you change them for something more comfortable?  I want to know what I might have to have on hand. 3. If I'm going to be recovering in a hotel room that first week out of the hospital, is there somewhere I can get a wedge pillow (either from MDA short-term or rent from someone...or even buy a cheap one locally)? From the DIEP boards, if I don't have access to a decent recliner to sleep in for a few nights, getting in/out of bed and sleeping comfortably appears to be greatly enhanced by having a wedge pillow.  I've got one ordered for at home but can't imagine trying carry it in luggage. 4.  Will the travel service also make arrangments for my sister since she is the one who will be with me during and post-surgery until I can go home?  She needs the same consideration for movable travel dates/no penalties and will be traveling with me on the plane so was curious. 5.  Post surgery travel (or recovering in a hotel) tips? Thanks, again, to all.  I think I finally have the biggest, most burning questions out there and can start to relax a little.  Everyone who helped on the other MDA material was phenomenal!  Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes, courage is the quiet voice at the end of the day saying \"I will try again tomorrow\".

I don't have a good answer to your question on the seeing vs. feeling other than to give you my experience.  I can feel the fribrous tissue in my breast whereas my tumor and another suspicious area are actually too small (or too deep and small) to feel (not palpable).  They were both found by mammogram and the biopsy on my first tumor was done using ultrasound.  The second area would have had to have a stereostatic biopsy due to its location and size.  Hopefully, someone with good knowledge and experience can give you a more satisfactory answer!  Sending hugs for comfort.",
