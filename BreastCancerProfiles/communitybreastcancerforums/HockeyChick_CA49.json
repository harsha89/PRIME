Spread to one axillary lymph node. 2.4 cm lump - Grade 3; ER-/PR- (bummer) and still waiting on HER2 status. I'm still numb. There is no cancer of any type in my family or any health issues really. The women in my family all live to be 90+. I am the first to get cancer. LN involvement is my biggest concern right now. Hopefully it hasn't spread further. I don't know how long I've had BC. Didn't feel it. Next up - CXR and abdomen US, bone scan. Waiting to get into an Oncologist. Probably starting chemo in 2-3 weeks, then surgery, then radiation. Current chemo regimen is AC-T, but I guess that could change depending on the results of the other tests. I live alone. My family is out west. Luckily I have good friends around. My life is going to change pretty drastically over the next year. Hoping to be able to continue working during chemo but from home. Not sure how that will play out. Ironically, I work in oncology research.
