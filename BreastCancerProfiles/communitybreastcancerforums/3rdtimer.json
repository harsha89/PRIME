I've been reading the other articles posted and they have helped. This will be my third time dealing with breast cancer and hopefully my last :)  My questions are.... I would like to hear from other people who had immediate reconstruction and what they went through and what to expect. I haven't been able to talk to anyone who had this type of surgery.... only articles. Any information would be greatly appreciated. Log in to post a reply",
