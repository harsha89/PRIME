Things have been a little crazy between all the doctors appointment..they had me on semi-bed rest and thank God my water level around baby went up so, I will be home for another week.  They will induce my labor on Nov. 11th and will have port put in at the same time.  I will then go for my second round a few days after being discharged from the hospital.  The onc.  said they may have to do a stronger dose of a/c.  I have been having  sharp pain in my breast and found a new lump about 1 1/2 weeks ago..we have been monitoring it and it continues to grow.  It is almost as big as the first 2 lumps (3.5cm & 4cm) together.  Its feels like half my breast is one big lump.  I cant wait to have my son, and then do MRI because I am so worried that it has spread especially since onc already told me I'm not in the beginning stages of BC  (sorry for venting)! I am bald now...partly by my own doing, was tired of shedding so I brushed out the lose hairs and DH shaved my head! I was happy with doing this as I had control.  I've even gone out bald, as I am a ponytail type person and chose to go with out a wig!  I am back to feeling better, if only until next round.  I will keep you all updated, now that I will home for most of next week. Okay ladies now that I ranted a bit (alot) I thank you all for your thoughts and prayers as you are always in mine!  ~Evy~",

Well, ladies I learned be careful what you ask for, not to long ago I was thinking about stopping my chemo, but continued with it because I knew I had to, not only for me but for my family.  Well now, I had the MRI and thank god it was nothing more then some back thingy my doc explained, but then I started heart palpation, and they sent me for a MUGA test...it shows my heart was weakened by the chemo, so I am now on a month long break, NO TAXOL NO HERCEPTIN!  My onc says we will start in a month if my numbers go back up, but my cardiologist says I can never have the herceptin.   I guess I should what I say!  I took the test on April 30th, and was leaving the next day to go back home to Jersey for the breast cancer walk...my doc didnt want to ruin my trip, so she kept tellin me the results weren't in.  Today I go do an echo to confirm the finding of the Muga and then start heart meds.  Ladies if you have any sort of heart palpataion to chest pain have it checked!!  If it wasn't for the rapid heart beat I was having and a little chest pain which we all thought was anxiety they would of never found the weakened heart problem. Well ladies Im off to the doctors, I send my love and big hugs to you all!  I will be back later!",

I hope everyone is doing ok after there chemo round and dealing with all the nasty side effects. Well things with me have been ok...it could always be worse....I met with a high risk pregnancy doctor who wants me to go ahead with the second round of chemo on 10/29 (just what I want to do on my b-day) and deliver the baby the week of nov. 12th.  I notified the Onc of this and will go ahead with round 2.  As if this is not enough to worry about, plus being super tired and now my body aches, I thought I felt another hard spot on the same breast...I just have to keep an eye on it, due to the pregnancy and have it rechecked next week.  I did my blood work and will find out the results today I hope.  I havent started losing my hair, but I keep telling myself Im ready for it...Im not so sure though.  I havent had that melt down yet, or good cry, Im trying to stay strong but it is wearing me down..it seems that my chemo plus the whole bc thing is all I think about now adays!  Its like I found out im ER-negative HER2-positive, and some ki-67 unfavorable and I cant stop trying to find more info out.  I guess if I keep my mind busy I wont break down!  Well ladies I am sorry to be such a downer today!  I read all your post and you guys give me strenght to keep going on this long road!  Blessings to all and Oct. chemo girls you are in my  thoughts and prayers everyday!  Evy",

Well I will be doing round 2 of chemo this tuesday....and I will be rereading all your post because I have only retained about 1/4 of what Ive read today...sorry its all these darn drugs, but I love all my special sistas and thank you all for your thoughts and prayers...I swear I could feel all the good vibes and each and everyone of you while I was in there, and it gave me strenght knowing that I had you beautiful ladies pulling and praying for me, in this bitter sweet time!

My dh is being so supportive I try not to put to much more on his plate...and my inlaws are always supportive and my family is Jersey and they are taking this so hard, I end up calming them down and supporting them, that they freak out over everything! Please know that even though I am just venting I am still thinking of you all, Linda, Kristina, Debbie, Kara, Karyll, Karen, Cheryl, Karen, Alishar, Lori, Ulla and everyone else...sorry having a blank moment!  I thank you all more then I can every express and luv you guys!!  You have been so supportive I don't know that I could make it on this rollercoaster without you guys!  I thank God I found you ladies!  Sorry this is such a long post! Big Bear Hugs ~Evy~",

THANK YOU, for letting me rant, for being there when I needed and saying what I needed to hear!  Thank you for making this miserable journey that we are on, one that I did not have to do alone....and being blessed by finding all of you!  Each and everyone of you have touched my heart in this process and I dont know that I would have been able to make it without you!  I love you guys more then words can express! Well its been two months since I had to stop chemo, and my heart is back to normal, according to my stress test.  My Onc wants to start chemo again and so do I (never in my life would I have thought that I WANT to do chemo)!  The stupid Cardiologist wont call her back..she has been trying to reach him since Thursday.  I really dont like this guy.  My kids are doing great, Arianna is now 6 and is enjoying summer and her friends...baby Lennon, is doing awesome..he is now 7 months..how time flys and goes slow at the same time...he is moving and growing like a weed, he eats like no tomorrow, love the water, and most importanly is HEALTHY!.  I cant believe its been 8 months since we all started chemo, and how we have all found some great friends and people that have touched are life in a special way...a way that I am sure we all hold precious and close to our hearts...ok hear I go rambling so I am off, to check on Lennon. ~Evy~",

My percs did nothing!  Nothing helped I had family pictures last monday aneI got sick as soon as pictures where done!  My DH wanted a family portrait before I lose my hair. again we went Monday and I barely got thru it but I dod.  My kids have been great I have a 9yr old daughter and 4yr old  son. I cut my hair yesterday me and dd went to get hair cut and I like it :) I am ready for it fall even though I am having a hard time emotionally with it seems harder this time.  I didnt have any mouth trouble before but now the tip of my tongue feels like its blistered just feels off.  My tongue has a split it in very weird!  The other se I am having that I didnt before is the vision change.   Sometimes its like everythinf is blurry or smokey foggy.  I have bad eyes to begin with and stopped wearing contacts after first dx.  I am thinkging as much as I dont want more appointments I have to go see eye dr.  For those worried about heart damage with AC it can happen and you need ot report all changes.  I am presently not doing herceptin because my ef is down.  I have an appointment Tues. with my new cardiologist going to talk to him about putting me on Coreg. I was on it before and my ef went up but I was stupid stop talking it and didnt see a heart dr. in a while I had just started seeing this guy right before get dx again because I wasnt feeling right for some time. ",
