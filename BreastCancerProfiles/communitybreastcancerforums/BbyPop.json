They said all they found was fluid under the skin and they think I have a skin infection and to see a dermatologist. They refused to biopsy me even after hearing my concern about IBC. I asked if they have seen IBC before and they told me \"thousands of times\" which was strange to me since it's rare. They told me they would be able to tell if I had IBC on the ultrasound and just didn't seem very educated about IBC. Telling me that no one gets misdiagnosed for skin infection with IBC because it's easy to spot. Made an appointment with a dermatologist for Thursday where I will be asking for a skin punch biopsy just to rule out IBC. I really do hope this is just a skin issue but I do not feel comfortable with playing the waiting game with my breasts looking like this. Thanks for listening - will continue to do updates.",

      "Content": "BbyPop wrote: Okay so I'm 22 married with 3 kids (2 step one biological). I'm morbidly obese. E cup breasts. I'm worried about IBC. Symptoms: Purple splotches on both breasts, peau d'orange skin on both breasts, occasional sharp pain in breasts, pain in right armpit, neck, elbow and hand pain. Last weekend I was using the restroom when I stood up and looked in the mirror my top had slipped down and reveled two BRIGHT purple splotches on both of my breasts on the side next to my nipple and in between my cleavege. About two inches big on my right side and an inch and a half on my left. I ran and showed my husband freaking out and we googled of course seen IBC or mastitis. I pumped for 3 weeks after my daughter was born March of 2017 and that was all. Almost got mastitis and it was red and painful lump. Eventually got it to go away with hot compresses and massaging. What I am experiencing now is nothing like that. I went and seen the nurse practitioner last Monday, didn't have much to say other then didn't feel any lumps. Referred me to a local breast center for a diagnostic eval. Tomorrow 11/6. It's been a little over a week since I noticed the purple splotches and peau d'orange skin. Since then I have gotten a constant pain in my neck, armpit, shoulder, elbow and hand. I noticed that sometimes when I am sitting it makes me splotches a darker color and then when I get up and walk around they become slightly lighter. I had a cancer scare earlier this year for a tumor that was found on my liver, did an MRI and determined it was benign. I am just so worried about my breasts. I'm so worried for my family I am the \"rock\" in the family. Gonna be doing updates. Log in to post a reply",
