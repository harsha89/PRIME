I was due for mammo and ultra sound the end of November and decided to wait until the first week in January also. I have ALH too. Hopefully they won't find any more calcs. but I'm the nervous type also, so I worry. Happy holidays and see you back here in January with a clear report! Hugs Sashie ",

My radiaologis recommended it but the surgeon said it was a good idea but also said I could just have a mammo in six months to check it out. Thanks Sashie",

I am thrilled it was benign but the more I read about this condition the more I get scared. Now they want to do an excisional biopsy to make sure they is nothing else there. I have read different things on the internet some saying excisional is standard of care some saying not necessary. The procedure means more mammos and more radiation. I already had had quite a bit of radiation in the last 2 months with the regular mammo, then magnified views, mammo stereotactic and now they want to do wire localiztion excisional biopsy. I keep going back and forth between should I have the procedure or just wait and see. Very scared, Sashie Log in to post a reply",
