My radiologist did a biopsy right then and there ... but he told me that he is only able to do it that way because he doesn't accept insurance.  He said that many insurance companies will not allow for an u/s, additional views or biopsy to be done on the same day as the mammo because they fear that they will be ordered \"as a matter of course\" rather than in response to what is seen on the first image.  So, don't be concerned if you can't get a biopsy today, but be sure to get one scheduled if it seems advisable to have one. Best to you.",

I had my chemo at 40.  I am an employment lawyer at a big company that was doing lots of layoffs last year during my chemo -- so pretty stressful and requiring me to make lots of decisions.  I got 4 AC and 4 Taxol, dose dense.  I scheduled my chemo on Thursdays, with a shot of Neulasta (or something like that) on Fridays.  I usually took my chemo day itself off, but no other days regularly off.  I had quite a bit of nausea -- about 10 days between treatments.  I also had severe reflux during the Taxol treatments.  My blood counts remained generally good which kept my energy level up. For me (and it isn't the right answer for everyone), working helped me feel \"normal.\"  I didn't want the breast cancer to define me and I didn't want to sit at home and feel sorry for myself.  Looking back on it, I can see that there were days when I felt pretty glassy-eyed and had trouble focusing.  I think this was largely due to the anti-nauseals I was taking (Ativan, among others), rather than the chemo itself.  A short leave might have been a good idea.  But selfishly, I didn't want to do it. My onc would repeat the same mantra to me week in and week out:  do what you feel like doing.  If you feel up to going out to dinner or working, do it.  If you feel up to a visit from family, do it.  Of course, he always followed this with the 3 things that (I can only guess) *he* likes to do -- \"go to the movies, drink wine, have sex!\"  LOL. So, if you feel like continuing to work feels \"right\" to you, do it.  But don't be afraid to take a little time to yourself, too.  Sometimes 1 day at home is worth 3 in the office.",

I specifically asked the surgeon if there was any reason to consider a mastectomy in my case and she said no.  She said the outcome for my dx was the same for mastectomy as it was for lumpectomy and radiation. That being said, this can be a decision about how you want to approach this and how you feel about your breasts.  You may be able to avoid the radiation if you do a mastectomy vs. lumpectomy -- does that matter to you?  Where is the lump and how large are your breasts?  Some drs recommend a mastectomy if a lumpectomy in your situation would result in not much breast left.",

It's an online system where he can input the characteristics of your cancer and get information about the benefits of different therapies (chemo, radiation, tamoxifen, etc). My dr did it and shared the data with us. I had a high oncotype score, so chemo was indicated, but just seeing how much of a difference each therapy would make was helpful in making a decision, too. While each one only knocked off a small percentage of recurrence, it was important to us to get my recurrence rate down to the single digits. DH is a big \"numbers guy\" so it really helped him to see the data. You might ask about this. Best wishes to you in deciding what treatment to get.",
