We did receive the mammo narrative though, and this is what it says: There is a lobulated mass in the anterior aspect of the left breast upper outer quadrant, approximately 3 cm from the nipple. It measures approximately 3 cm in the AP dimension, 3.2 cm transversely, and 2 cm in the crandiocaudal dimension. On tomographic imaging it's margins are mostly smooth and circumscribed although lobulated. There are no calcifications associated with the mass. No other breast abnormalities are demonstrated. No skin thickening or lymphadenopathy. This description is different from the sonogram description (completed before the mammo) which said the mass was \"a solid, heterogeneous, irregular mass with lobular and somewhat angular margins and exhibits blood flow\".. The sonogram description also said there is a good \"transmission\" through the mass. We will continue to try to put this out of our minds as I know it will be at least another 8 days before we know anything from the biopsy, which is scheduled Tuesday. Thanks again for the nice words!!",

I know that you probably already realize how much of an impact your calming words have on folks, but just in case you don't, they have an enormous impact. djmammo, thank you for your technical expertise. It's pretty awesome that nowadays we have the tools at our hands to get a professional opinion by simply posting online. We received the biopsy results, and the tumor is b9. The only worry that I have now is if the baby was exposed to any radiation from the mammogram. I've done a lot of reading, and it seems to me as though most of the studies indicate a very low fetal dose, maybe on par a cross-country flight. Again, thank you, and I wish the best for your future MTwoman.",

She is 6 months pregnant and we are enormously stressed right now. She only felt the lump for the first time about a month or so ago. The doctor did say that it had characteristics of both cancer and non-cancer, so I'm not sure what to think. Could a solid, immovable, irregular shaped tumor grow that fast? Is there a possibility it could be a benign condition? She is 35, and as I mentioned pregnant entering the 3rd trimester. She has a biopsy scheduled for this coming Tuesday, and we are having a hard time sleeping or just about doing anything other than worry. Any words of advice you have would be greatly appreciated.
