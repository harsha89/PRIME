I need to hear from others who have been successfully treated for liver mets, what chemo worked for them, if they had any other treatment.  Was your liver enlarged too? Any information you can share will be helpful.  I live in Mass, and am thinking about going to Boston for a second opinion as I can't take much more of this. Thanks!!!!

Best to you, Debra",
