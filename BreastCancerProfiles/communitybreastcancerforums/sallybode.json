    "Content": "sallybode wrote: My mother and sister had breast cancer which started from under the arm. My doctor is sending me for a biopsy and to see if there is an abscess underlying my armpit. The swelling is tender and visible from the outside. Some of my family is very supportive. My husband isn't, but he's that way on anything that happens to me. I am going to have a complete physical, they're doing a blood panel first and since I get a lot of bladder infections, I am on antibiotics now for that. It does concern me. I am getting migraines since beginning the antibiotics. Perhaps I need to switch to another med. Surgery is going to call me and set the appointment to do the biopsy. I hope they call soon. Not knowing is a nagging concern inside of me. At least knowing what is wrong will help to decide on a plan of action. I'm nervous and scarred. Log in to post a reply",
