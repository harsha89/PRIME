Then pain came back and I needed pain pills.  With the SNB I had pain that didn't go away.  It isn't as bad as it was -I can stand to be touched- but it is still uncomfortable when touched.  The best advise I was given was to wear a sports bra -a size large- to bed to help support the girls from moving too much when I sleep until I am well healed.  I still find myself needing some support, but I try not to wear anything too often due to radiation. I hope it gets better for you.",

But Thursday & Friday I am wiped out.  I come home so tired I make it to the couch.  Work has been extremely stressful since October.  I am a mid level supervisor and we are required to spend time on all 3 shifts. To add to this I don't sleep well. I am often awake for 2 - 4 hrs a night. I am thinking about workin part time to aleviate some of the stress.   If I do that, I can delegate some of my duties & hopefully sleep a little better. Right now I am  adjusting my schedule to make up for the time I have to leave for treatments (easy to do with our reqirements).",

I just finished 16 of 36 today.  My skin is looking good.  I was having pain inside the breast that was uncomfortable, and when I talked to the onco nurse she reccomended Aleve twice a day.  That worked well.  At the cancer center here we are seen by the RO every Wed. He looks at our skin and is available for any questions. They provide all the creams and ointments needed based on how the skin looks.  For all of you just starting out.  Radiation isn't as scary as it seems.  I'm a worrier so I, like a lot of us here, had a hard time sleeping the night before each of the 1st appointments.  I hadn't found this site yet, so I didn't have any idea of what to expect. The worst part so far is the drive each day.  Not too bad really. The best part is, there is an end, we just have to be patient and take it one day at a time. YEA!!!! for all of you that are finished  So glad to hear your done.  God Bless you on your path to health. I don't post very often. I mostly come read what every one has to say.  So often you girls have posted just what I need to hear. It's either what I'm feeling and I feel validated or someone has answered a question.  I'm glad I found this place.",
