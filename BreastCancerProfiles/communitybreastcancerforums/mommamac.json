It is now 23 weeks since last chemo and i still have no eye brows, or eye lashes. It took a month for my eyes to stop watering. My hair is 1/2 inch in some places but mostly about 1 1/2 inches. It seems like forever. I am not a fan of hats but need to wear to keep my head warm now that winter is upon us. I used to have very thick coarse hair--mostly brown with some grey. Now it is baby fine mostly grey with some brown LOL",

I wanted both off right away, but my surgeon would only do one at a time. He wanted the cancer part looked after before doing the other breast. I knew I did not want recon. I have several reasons for getting the other off but my Doctor says I can do that at any time with no cost. I am in Canada so maybe it is different here. I am big busted...never really liking my boobs so I am looking forward to teh day I am flat.",
