So I understand how you feel - the guilt. I am a newbie when it comes to cancer, especially breast cancer. My expertise is in dementia and I am a facilitator of a local support group. There I tell families guilt is a waste of time and energy. You are doing the best that you can to navigate through life and this disease. I say the same to you Melza.
