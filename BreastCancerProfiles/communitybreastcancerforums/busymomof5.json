Last week I wore a bandana to my son's lacrosse game. Everyone has seen my wig and they seem comfortable with it. I do not think I am being paranoid but I believe people avoided me when I had just the bandana on. I have never worn it to a school event, just around the house. After watching the video, I do believe that the wig is to make other people feel comfortable. It does not scream \"I am in treatment for breast cancer!\" I have set an end date for the wig, June 10th. My hair is very blonde and is still sparse in places and very very short so I do look kind of bald but I am going to wear it proudly!",
