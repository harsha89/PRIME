I've had quite a few MRI's and while the contrast can be hard on your kidneys, I don't refuse it. I have healthy kidneys tho and just drink a ton of water after to flush everything out.",

I've had three excisional biopsies on my right breast.  One, I lost 1/3 of the tissue due to a huge radial scar and papillomatosis.  MRI indicated it was probably DCIS so huge margins were taken but it wasn't cancer.  This was in 2011. Another big lump last fall in the same right breast.  I had just had my annual MRI a month prior so I blew it off.  Saw my surgeon for my mammo/ultrasound a few months later (that had been scheduled).  He took one feel at it and wanted it out (which I did last spring).   It was at the 9:00 position close to my armpit.  Turned out to be PASH.  Well, fast forward today.  The dang thing is back, bigger than ever.  I just want to scream.  I'm an RN and I work with this surgeon (he's a friend of mine).  I saw him for an appt in September for a follow up for an issue on the left and he felt this area and said it was probably scar tissue but was iffy about that and said I could go for an ultrasound if I wanted.  I said no.  I have one scheduled in four months for my annual crap anyway.  Well, now it's growing and way more distinct and not just a dense area.   How many of you have had a recurrence of PASH?   SOOOOOOO FRUSTRATED!!!!!!!!!!",
