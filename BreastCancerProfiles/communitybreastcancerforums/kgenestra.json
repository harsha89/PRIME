I have had a chest xray a mth ago had a ekg and blood work which was fine. I am 32 years old is it to early to get a mammagram? I had a breast exam two months ago for my physical and nothing was found. I don't feel lumps the best way to explain it is pressure above it could it be mucular? I went to the chiropractor the other day said something about pectoral found a knot near my rib while he was doing a pressure point I am supposed to go to him today to see if it helps and it didn't before I do not want to keep bugging my gp. I am at my wits end Log in to post a reply",
