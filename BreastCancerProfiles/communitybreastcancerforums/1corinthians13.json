    "Content": "1corinthians13 wrote: hey, not sure if anyone will read this or respond but here it goes. Started with a breast infection. Right breast had enlarged cyst to size of baseball. The cyst drained at home, major pain all in breast n right side of body. Had to call 911 as the pain was debilitating. Treated w iv antibiotics 1 dose n sent home. My breast was extremely inflamed, red, had \"holes\" that er thought pus drained from, i said no pus came out of nipple not sure what those hole marks are. Burning in ribs and breast. On and off antibiotics for 6 weeks to no avail. Several er visits n prescribed pain meds. Sent to surgeon. Pain started in left breast day before I see surgeon, pain stretches from breast to armpits to shoulder blades. Burning up n down my spine n as of yesterday burning in both arms. Experiencing extreme fatigue and weakness. Hard to walk or do much else at times. Other days I get in a few good hours. Had to quit working n going to school as things have gotten so bad for me. When first seeing surgeon he wanted to jump in and cut open my breast for this lump that is connected to my nipple. I said no cause if it is cancer that is not a good option I will wait for mammo n sono. Had mammo and sonogram this week. Explained to them left breast just started. N all other pains. Lumps found in both. Sono was done n the lady told me to wait for Dr as he may want to look at it. So in comes the head guy. He redoes ultrasound, measures etc. Then asks me questions about changes in my breast. I started taking pictures everyday as my breasts are constantly changing. Some days dimpled, others larger, nipple changes to much to list. Obviously discharge. So, he asks to see them n he said he wants to schedule me with surgeon to have punch biopsy. My appt with surgeon is Monday.... Is there anything else that can cause all these issues? All my symptoms 1. Weakness 2. Fatigue 3. Enlarged breast 4. Discharge. 5. Burning up spine 6. Burning in arms 7. Burning in breast 8. Painful tender breasts 9. Constant changing ofbreasts dimpled, weird texture around nipple 10. Nipple changes 11. Pain in ribs shoulder blades seems like extreme sometimes and unbearable bringing me to tears. 12. Can't lay on my sides as both breasts hurt with underarm pain and laying on side makes it worse. 13. New formed lumps that were not there before all this started. 14. Nausea and vomiting 15. For a few months before this started I was eating like a horse n losing weight n my friends were jealous. I was eating triple what my friends were n losing...... 16. Nipple turning inward towards other breast. Living in Colorado so smoking marijuana is legal. I have found a strand that takes the pain n makes it tingle, I can eat n not get sick when I smoke. So smoke at night when the kids goto bed n eat. Some days my friends have to pick up my kids as I'm too fatigued n in pain. This all sucks. I pray I don't have ibc......but I have all the symptoms plus a few more. Hopefully its something simple n not cancer at all. I'm not scared of cancer. I just want a diagnosis on something so I can kick ass at whatever is going on w me. I am a fighter, stubborn n persistent. Hoping for the best, preparing for the worse. Gonna kick ass at whatever happens. Frustrated right now as the pain is being treated not the root cause. I just want a diagnosis whatever it is. Waiting sucks as I'm ready to fight. Prayers welcome. Log in to post a reply",
