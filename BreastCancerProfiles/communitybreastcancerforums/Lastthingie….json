I have just completed all the surgeries in my profile. While I was going through it, it felt never ending. Like a long tunnel filled with endless MD appointments, medications, pain, significant physical changes, along with a huge emotional toll. But it is over for now. No complications, terrific reconstruction result. I never doubted my treatment decision but it was not easy. It was accomplished with the intense support of my family and a excellent team of providers. Feel free to PM me.",
