I did not know this at the time of my last visit with the surgeon, otherwise, I would have asked her if this implant burst during surgery or was burst prior to surgery, like maybe during the core biopsy. I know that it is NOT typical for implants to last 35 years, but mine did!  My left one was intact when they removed my left breast. Don't know if this helps, hope it does.",

I'm 7 weeks post-op, simple, bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction.  My fills include 100cc at time of surgery, 100cc 3 weeks post-op, 2 weeks later another 200cc and the next fill-up was scheduled for yesterday, but, the doctor just filled up the left one with 200cc because it looked like it was leaking.  Her exact words, \"It looks empty.\" I had phoned the day after my last fill, concerned because I could tell that the left one was leaking but the doctor was in surgery, so I asked to speak with the nurse who was unavailable but would phone me later.  When she phoned, she told me that it's typical for tissue expanders to look uneven, she wasn't grasping that this was not a matter of uneven, it was a matter of deflation! I'm so upset right now, I don't know if I'm making any sense, I can't think straight.  I'm scheduled for a replacement surgery 2 days from today.  I'm upset about having to go through another major surgery only 7 weeks post-op when I'm finally starting to feel better and see a light at the end of the tunnel.  I'm upset because when I asked the plastic surgeon's office manager, \"Who is going to pay for this?\", she bluntly said that the insurance company would.  Yeah, but I have to pay my 20% copay since my deductible has already been met and who's going to reimburse me??? My husband is livid, he is so angry, he's talking about suing the manufacturer. Can anyone here help me, your experience, your feelings, your 'happy ending'?  Please.  I think I need to go cry now.

Dr. Talbert was my breast surgeon and Dr. Theobald is my oncologist - both were contracted with Integris, Talbert (at that time) was contracted with Mercy, where I had my surgery. I think you are in good hands if you follow farmerlucy and okiemomof4's advice for doctors. Good luck from a fellow Okie!",
