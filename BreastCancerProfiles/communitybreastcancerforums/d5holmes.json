Your grandmother is family history.  I think this whole issue is quite frightening and it took me months to come to decsions.  If you were positive you are much more likly to develop another cancer.  Wouldn't it be better to remove the problem and lesson your risks?  Just my 2 cents. I would also suggest you look at the force network: www.faceingourrisk.org.  The board is very helpful and I have met a lot of nice women. ",
