Now experiencing shortness of breath for almost 2 weeks, which I have seen my PC provider for. D-dimer lab result is slightly elevated but CT and PE Study of lungs is normal. BNP, PFT, EKG all normal. Is there anything I should be concerned about from a Breast Health perspective? Last screening mammogram was in July and was normal. momof4va Log in to post a reply",

After two needle biopsies and one surgical biopsy all results are benign although my BS has recommended I see a MO to discuss whether or not medication is necessary since my body is producing atypical cells. Not sure I feel about medication. How do they determine who should take meds?",

I now need a MRI guided biopsy to check out #2 before I have an excisional biopsy to check out #1. To me,  this seems like a lot of testing for benign atypical cells. Anyone else have this many steps before a final diagnosis? Is this normal? momof4va Log in to post a reply",

Here is their response: so no cancer. good news. if you have additional risk factors, like family history, then the MO will discuss tamoxifen perhaps. ADH is a marker for risk. taking it all out doesn't make that risk go away.",
