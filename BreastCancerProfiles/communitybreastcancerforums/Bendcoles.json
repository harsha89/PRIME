I finish rads on my left breast this Friday and then I see my GYN Monday to talk about whether or not I need a hysterectomy. Then in Dec I have a follow up mammogram and MRI because I have 2 cysts in my right breast. I just feel like it's never going to end - the anxiety of it all! Not a fun feeling!!",

Being newly diagnosed is bad enough. Trying to figure out all these new words is bad enough. Deciding the best course after the biopsy and MRI is bad enough. But to hear from someone who is supposed to support you that you don't need to die twice - well, I'm speechless as to what to say to her now! Why can't people just let you know how much they care about you and that they're there for you ... to support you and pray for you? Why the stupid comments?

      "Content": "Bendcoles wrote: I plan on sending this to my GYN, surgeon, rad oncologist and oncologist. ~ Diane TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: My name is Diane Cole and I am 48. I am a daughter, sister, aunt, cousin, sister-in-law, wife and mother. I teach preschool Sunday school, work part time at my church and do daycare in my home. Why am I telling you this? Because to you I am just a patient or a case number. To some I am a car or house payment. I have survived my husband�s infidelity and the birth of our 2 children by c-section. I have had to talk to doctors about a heart murmur, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, chiari malformation of the brain, hip dyplasia and seizures as well as things like leg braces and wheelchairs. This past month I have had a follow up mammogram, talked to my gynecologist about microcalcifications seen on that mammogram, let a surgeon I just met cut into my left breast to do a stereotactic biopsy, gotten a diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive ductal carcinoma, had an MRI on both breasts, had an ultrasound on both breasts and had surgery for a lumpectomy and a sentinel lymph node biopsy. I have had to look up words I�ve never heard before online. I have talked to my surgeon, gynecologist, a radiologist, an oncology radiologist, someone from the Sara Fisher breast cancer organization and an oncologist. I have waited in rooms half naked so someone can come in and inspect my breasts. I have waited in the oncologist�s exam room for almost an hour without anyone coming in to let me know he is running behind! I have had to tell that oncologist that I don�t appreciate being treated in such a manner because it lets me know I am not respected. Common courtesy is something his office needs to learn. I have accepted his apology. I have heard that some of my tests have come back and others have not. I have learned to play the waiting game. It�s a game I do not enjoy. I have been told that I have been discussed at something called a breast cancer clinic on Thursday mornings. I hope by them discussing me they learn something to help someone else. I will know soon if I will need radiation with hormonal therapy, chemotherapy or a combination of all or some of these. This journey is one I never signed up for. It is a rollercoaster ride I want to get off of. But here I am � on the ride anyway. Some of you will take this ride with me. Some of you will just hear about the ride. I hope no one else ever has to go on this ride but I know better. So here I am and I hope after reading this you will be a better person on the ride. I hope I will be too.

All of this means I don't need chemo. I go Friday for my simulation at the cancer center and I'll start radiation after we get back from our Ohio vacation the end of August. Then I'll go on tamoxifen afterward. The waiting is the hard part and I'm glad that part is over, at least for now.
