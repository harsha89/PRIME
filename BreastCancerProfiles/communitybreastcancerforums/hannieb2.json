I found a lump in my left breast about 6 months ago whilst breastfeeding my daughter. The doc said she thought it was a blocked milk duct and not to worry. I've since stopped breastfeeding and its still there. Its in the lower part of my breast, feels quite smooth almost egg shaped about the size of the tip of my finger. I'm panicking as I haev two small children to leave behind. I have an appointment with a private clinic tomorrow so hopefully will know but in the mean time I can;t help but google it!! x Log in to post a reply",

I've got to back this afternoon for a ultrasound to determine whether or not its a cyst. I am so relieved! I'm definitely not going to take life for granted any more Take Care xxxx",
