I entered all my information regarding diagnosis and treatment in my profile, and I'm surprised that it's not reproducing with my post like I thought it would. Is there something I need to change in my settings?",

It was particularly interesting to me what you had to say about acid reflux because that is a problem that I have separate from breast cancer and chemotherapy. So I will have to include that in my talk with the doctor regarding vomiting. It is interesting, but I'm not actually nauseous. I feel fine and then suddenly I feel like I'm going to vomit.",

Also, thank you for the guidance on how to include my DX in the Sig line. I'm not very happy with the care that I'm receiving right now and I think I've got to make some noise one way or another to get things going in the right direction. Two things that happened today really Disturbed me. The first is that my oncologist who I met with two or three times before starting chemo apparently didn't write any notes into my file. Given my language situation, I think that's unacceptable. Secondly, when the guy inserted my IV into my hand he was not wearing gloves. Later, when he was changing my bags for the treatment he was wearing gloves. I want to make sure that the non glove wearing doesn't happen again. Maybe I need to carry my own gloves? It seems like really bad procedure to me...",
