We serve a miracle working God and HE is our Great Physician...and all He wants us to do is pray and believe...and from this day forward, I will be praying for excellent results for you, Hannah! Don't ever forget that the Lord loves you dearly and does have a plan for you life.  I have had cancer myself.....2 years this month.  I thank God that He was with me every step of the way.  There were days when I felt so alone and my faith was weak as my body was weak...but I just had to keep telling myself that GOD is in control and that we don't go by our feelings!  I know God will never leave you...He loves YOU SO much...please don't ever forget that. You have a wonderful mom there to help you along.  I had no one (as my hubby left me about a year before I was diagnosed with cancer)....but, God never fails us!  I had my treatments and I am cancer free today, Praise the Lord.  I tell you, what He's done for others...He WILL do for you!!  Keep the faith, dear..and keep your eyes on your physician, NOT the physical condition you have...ok?  He's smiling down at you with tears of pride in His eyes...and He \"will\" see  you through, every step of the way! God bless you and yours, my dear, and I pray that God will give you the desires of your heart!! Love and cyber hugs......... Cinderella - Charlotte",

However, my family talked me out of it, and the surgeon said that the pain would be too much for me to bear and I could have it taken off another time. I am cancer free and I thank God for that. Since then, I've seen my onco and he, too, talked me out of having my right breast removed.  Right from the start, I wanted them both removed...and I even had surgery set up for the other one to be removed when I had to cancel due to what my onco said! I have, again, made an app'ment to see the surgeon to have righty removed.  How I \"wish\" I had it done when I wanted it.  It would be behind me by now!  I'm almost 60, and I just fear facing this again as my mom, her sister and mother all had breast cancer so I'm high risk.  It was the worst thing I've ever went through!  I plan to stay flat...I don't care really.  I am divorced and I  have no desire of having another man in my life (unless a miracle occurs...lol).  So, having no breasts at all is not an issue...and I'll have peace of mind, and it will be much more comfortable for me as it's SO uncomfortable being lop-sided. Anyway, this is what I want and I guess it all boils down to a personal decision.  I don't think there is any right answer...it's up to you!  How I wish I had listened to \"me\" from the start...but I know there will be better days ahead!  I am cancer free and I feel okay, except the fibromyalgia I battle with and the side effects of my cancer meds. Other than that... I'm great! I'm so enjoying my kids and grandkids and I revolve my life around them.  :)  God's blessings to all!! ",

I thank you ever so much for sharing.  You're all SO beautiful!!  I am seriously thinking of having my other breast removed and go flat as well.  Again, thank you SO  much for sharing!  I wish I was as skinny as you gals.   I was at one time, but I don't know what happened.  Actually, I do... sickness and life.  I also battle with fibromyalgia and that's not fun. I have the same symptoms from my cancer meds (fatigue and body aches/muscles)...as fibromyalgia does, so I am getting a double dose. I tire so easily and discovering I cannot do what I used to and it's devastating.  However, THANK YOU GALS!  What an inspiration and God bless you all for encouraging some of us \"thicker\" gals... LOL. I LOVE seeing the pics and I can't wait to be flat!  This one-sided lop-sided feeling is getting to me for sure!  Until the next time.... be well!   :)",
