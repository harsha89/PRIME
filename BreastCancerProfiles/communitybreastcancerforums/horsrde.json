The right ovary contains a 4*5.3*4.0 cm cyst with a few thick septations.  This cyst has enlarged since previos exam.  The complex right ovarian cyst has developed more prominent septations and soft-tissue components. This may represent a neoplastic lesion.  Surgical removal is suggested. What do you think this means??  more bloody cancer??  anyone out there with experience with this stuff............ HELP............  trying not to freak out again!! Log in to post a reply",

And doctors, all they seem to tell me is \"we don't know\",  \"we don't know what is going to happen to you because you where diagnosed with b/c so young\", \"we don't know if you should have your ovaries removed, because we don't know what the long term effect is on some one under the age of 40 doing this\" .............................. there is so many \"I don't know from doctors\" that I am starting to feel like a test subject- the \"let's see what happens to her test\"....................... sorry for venting!! But I appreciate everyone's feed back!! ",
