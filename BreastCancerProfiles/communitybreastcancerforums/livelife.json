Seems that three courses of radiotherapy plus three courses of chemo have made my right sided rib bones prone to fracture, even though I am on biphosphonates- I think they will always be weak. Must remember to fall on my left hand side in future. Wishing good health to you all at this Christmas time and for 2015. Always good to take it a year at a time  Natalie x",

Kayh,Doronet, Mouse 6694, Shel, Menevermind,Brenda, Toyah, Ccnani, Annamary1 and Cafelovr I will be thinking of you being brave warriors- are you using positive visualisations as your chemo goes in. I had neuro linguistic programming with my previous treatment (2003) and the guy taught me to work through positive visualisations as I had the treatment- I think it is a good thing to do. I imagined powerful golden bicycles coursing through my veins when i had my treatment the other week- I also imagined having 2 large angel wings wrapped around me.  Philippa , Melinda41and Justmealicia I think you have just had treatment- hope you get through the next few days ok. Coolbreeze- when did you have your expander put in? I had mine put in 10 weeks ago and actually braved going on the treadmill this evening I did 10 minutes gentle running wearign 2 sports bras- it felt ok- and hopefully will feel ok tomorrow. Welcome to the new girls- deedee22 and oscarsmum- I hope you find the friendship and support as helpful as I have. Reading about a few of you having problems with nasal issues has helped me over the past few days- mine feels like it has been peeled inside. Melinda41 I quite like my denial times- running on the treadmill tonight was one of those times. Being scared is ok too- as we can work our way back to not being scared. I started with a bit of lymphoedema in my right hand the other day- so going to see the  lymhoedema nurse tomorrow. Love to you all. XXXX",

Are you making sure that you are eating penty of protein and vitamins to encourage healing. I eat Manuaka honey- it has very good antibacterial and antiviral properties so that might help. I read in the paper yesterday that berries- raspberries, blackberries, blueberries as well as being good anticancer fruit can regulate estrogen levels- which sounds like a good thing for us estrpgen positive girls- they recommend 40 grams a day. Another article discussed how in Austria onc Docs are giving breast cancer women who are pre menopausal high  dose biophosphonates to reduce risk of breast cancer spreading to bones- think it is an osteoparosis drug. I will be asking about it at the hospital next week. Got an itchy head and hair started to fall out- just a bit yesterday- oh well- got 'Jade' and 'Tori' ready. Love you all all xx",

I know it is such a personal decision but like Mouse and Cafelovr, think there is a strong case for getting rid of them. I feel 100% feminine and curvy, I think the tissue expanders helped with that. My new reconstructed boobs match each other and are squidgy- like they used to be in the old days.... I mean way back in their glory days, about 20 years ago. I know it's a bit extreme but I almost think that every woman should have the option of bilateral and reconstruction- to minimise them having to go through a cancer journey. I haven't got out of my pyjamas yet as only a few days post op but can't wait to show the world my 'new girls'. Have any of you read about taking aspirin 75mg enteric coated, there is some research that suggests it stops metastesis. In the UK there is research recommending this for bowel cancer and breast cancer. I am popping one of these little tablets every day. The supplement Q10 is supposed to be good for breast cancer too.  love to all xxx",

The project that they are working on is to set up a data base in England of women who had radiotherapy before they were 30 years old and therefore at risk of breast cancer (which is what happened to me). Is great to be able to make a difference, the plan is to make sure these women get access to screening so if they do start with breast cancer it will be detected earlier. Unlike me !!  Is amazing to think that this special group of women are still in touch after 4 and a half years.",

Been looking forward to catching up with you all but had a headache so waited for painkillers to kick in- which has taken about 6 hours. It is amazing isn't it- normally if I get a headache a few painkillers and I am back to normal after 30 minutes. That is one of the good things about sharing with you all- you read about sisters thousands of miles awaywho have exactly the same issue- Brenda, Alicia- which is good (in a not so good way). Hope I haven't got you all worried about the non dairy thing- Shel and Brenda after reading the book  where it was mentioned I did try and read more of the science but didn't get very far. I am sticking with it just because it has me eating in a much healthier way- I think I would be sat here eating chocolate and cake 24 hours a day otherwise. It was frustrating in the book by Jane Plant that she didn't say whether her breast cancer was estrogen positive ( or oestrogen... UK spelling). Talking of food instead of stuffing my face with choclate I stuffed my face with a bag of spicy crisps ( uk word- think you might call them chips???- fried thin potato snacks?) this afternoon- oh my goodness they slashed my mouth to ribbons !!! I was wondering how many of you are taking time off work- I noticed a few sisters- melinda, me nevermind, mommy2two- talking about going to work. I have been off since my surgery Septemeber and probably wont be back until Summer 2010- after chemo and next mastectomy. Out with my children tonight to see a comedian doing a massive gig, he is called Michael MacIntyre, he has just made it big in the UK- he might have some stuff on Youtube. I think humour is a great help in these not as funny as normal times.  Welcome kayh- I was only welcomed myself on Monday/Tuesday (allowing for our international time span) and here I am on Wednesday feeling so very much part of the group. I think this group of friends are people we will never forget. Enjoy your day- which ever part of our lovely world you are in. livelife/natalie xxx",

Doronet thanks for mentioning the back ache with neupogen- I thought it was just me- I have been feeling like every other vertebrae has been taken out. My wigs are Rene of Paris- they must be doing well with the UK and USA markets- I have a longer one for when I want to feel glamarous and a shorter one (Tori) for day to day practical time- in nice mid chocolate colour.Still got my hair- not sure how much longer though- will pop up to hair dressers and get a an inch and half cut- after reading through your experiences. Doesn't it  make a difference learning and sharing from each other. Coolbreeze I hope the thoughts of all the happy days you had with your dog are easing the pain. My much loved rabbit Dylan had to be put down a few weeks ago- I knew that he couldn't have been more loved. Just got a new baby rabbit Peaches- he is angora soft- he comes in the house for an hour- last week he ate through the phone wire !! I send you all my love, especially the warrior princesses who are recovering from treatment over the next few days.xx",

I can see the light at the end of the tunnel now re chemo- one lot this Wednesday then one more on the 17th Feb. I am getting a bit excited about the last one. I wasn't going to be given an radiotherapy as intense radiotherapy 20years ago for lymphoma is what caused my breast cancer- but as they didn't get a clear margin when they did the mastectomy they have decided a small, weaker course of radiotherapy might be a good idea after all. I am going skiing in Austria first. I get tired for about 10 days post chemo- seems to be a day longer each time- so not skiing till 21 days after last chemo. Those hot flashes are an experience aren't they- it's like someone has just turned on a radiator inside your body. I am just reading Bernie Siegel's latest book- faith, hope and medicine- it's quite good if you're looking for an extra bit of encouragement. i find his meditations quite good to listen to when I am having my chemo.

Everyone is in bed, including the puppy - so a good time for me to catch up with you all. It was good to read your postings this morning but somehow writing back seems better at night when the house is quiet. I love your inclusive poem BrendaSharon, thank you. Melinda41 great news about your scan, I had practiced receiving a bad news result so many times that I am still getting used to the good news that I have no spread beyond lymph. Reading about trying to get hold of the best medication sounds similar and different to care over here in the UK. We have a National Health System which means that part of our tax goes to our health care, private health cover is very much the exception/luxury item over here. So instead we all get the same, the cheapest !!!!!!! I am fortunate in that I am being treated at one of the two leading cancer hospitals in the UK, yet even here only 6 people have had their chemo via a port- via a venflon is the norm. As a result our survival rates on cancer as a result are much lower than in the USA- not that I intend to let cheap medication lower my personal chance of survival- a warrior spirit and God in the battle will make up for cheap medication. I was wondering if any of you are using any special dietary approaches- I have skim read a book by Jane Plant who advocates dairy free and use of soya. I have read around on the science which seems to be inconclusive- so have decided to give it a shot- dairy free meaning that I have to get my food kicks from health alternatives rather than a quick fix with chocolate or cake. I am having a bit of soya but not gallons of the stuff. I feel really healthy on this plan. She advocates not eating meat in the active phase of cancer- but I am having a little. In terms of medication I haven't even heard of enmed, sounds good though. I am on ondasetron/zofran- which seems to do the trick. I am on those immune boosting injections too doronet and know what you mean about seeing them in the fridge. I give myself my injections- in my fatty tummy roll- it's not so bad there- I kind of pinch it up and slowly put the needle in. I do it at bed time then sleep off the side effects. In the UK we have District Nurses who come and visit you at home to do these- but I would rather do it myself. They are coming tomorrow to flush my hickman line- cheap version of a port, it is a central line with about 6 inches of tune sticking out from my chest. I am at a fancy do on Friday evening- hope it doesn't waggle out !! I am trying to get some tape to make my boobs look even, need to drag my old saggy one off to the left so that it matches my rock hard right new boob. oh well if I am odd at least I will be unique. Good night my new friends xx",

Thanks for explaining Thanksgiving to me- CCnani and Cool breeze -after I had posted it did dawn on me that it was probably something to do with the Pilgrim fathers- but I didn't know about the role of the Native Americans. Melinda41, I feel so naive now about my question regarding the cost of the immune boosting drug neulesta- I am shocked by the cost. I am on neupogen- which I guess might be cheaper- but I still have a 3 week gap between treatments. My bone marrow is shot to pieces by the chemo I had 6 years ago for lymphoma- so the Docs knew I had to have it this time. I managed some treatments last time without it though. Brenda I agree that taxotere seems quite brutal. With my lymphoma chemo- I had 4 drugs every 2 weeks and it took 4 months for half of my hair to fall out. The other half never fell out. This time two weeks and more than half gone.  I have felt much more tired this time too. I hope that you are soon improving after your latest treatment. Annamary1, Omarsmum, SLV/Sherri, BeccaS,jkwick74, Portergirl99 and Shara D I see from the roster that we are all down for treatment this week. I plan om making the most of the next few days of freedom from side effects. Everyone's comments on cutting their hair have been so helpful in preparing me for this 'rite of passage'- last night after washing my hair it turned into a matted birds nest that just had to be cut out. My husband did the top and sides, my daughter did the back. We had a good laugh as it made me look like a punk rocker- about 3cms of spikey hair. I will be thinking of you all on Thursday and will have a little Thanksgiving celebration in my home. Ccnani. I can't wait to see your pic- you are such a mother hen to the group along with Brenda- it will be lovely to see what you look like. Cool breeze how fab is that wig- stunning Wishing you all good days and restful nights xx",

I suppose even though we are in difficult circumstances that no onw would choose we do have alot to be thankful for- all the advances in the treatment of this disease-( that have given me an extra 20 years so far ,since my first diagnosis of lymphoma), all the love and care we have been receiving from our family and friends and of course the wonderful support we are getting from being in Brenda's gang. I always fancied being one of the Pink Ladies in the Grease film- now I feel that I have that with this group. I would like to thank the sister who mentioned taking a light sleeping tablet if needed- I took my steroids too late the other day and only had 2 hours sleep -so last night- chemo night took a light 'sleep helper'. 9 hours pure restorative sleep. Which was great as I have a very dear friend flying over from Ireland this afternoon -so want to be rested so I can enjoy our few days together.  Shara D could you let me  know abit more about vit D  and vit C or where to look for info, especially the lymphoma related stuff- i haven't heard that before- so am very interested. Mabelle- I have read fab things about exercising- 3-5 hours moderate exercise a week throughout our treatment -seems to increase our chance of survival by 50% -so dear sister warriors- get out there walking, skipping, dancing  GrandmaMickey- quite a few of us are on white cell boosting injections- neupogen or neulasta- last time I had chemo- 6 years ago- I had to fail my blood test a couple of times before I got put on them- so this time I was 'lucky' to get them first time. I think they increase the nuetrophil count but not the lymphocyte count. Yesterday i found out that my lymphocyte count was low- so I just need to be alert for picking up a viral infextion.  Mouse 6694 good tip re sitting at back of cinema. We still have to live life don't we.  Becca S- I would definitely get a wig as an option- I wear a silk scarf at home but when i go out i wear one of my two wigs-same colour- completely different styles. They are chocolate brown so different to my normal colour- but that is one of the fun things about this journey we are on- there are some light hearted moments that we can make the most of. Yesterday at the hospital this woman thought that I was in my late 20's -i am 43- that is what a difference they can make. CCnani- I send you my love and look foward to hearing from you Mother Hen. Love to you all xxx",

I was sorry to hear your news Sue...this is my third 'episode' of cancer- so I know a little about your situation. the first two times were lymphoma. I treat myself to something big after each time. The first time was a trip to Australia. the second time a trip to Australia and yearly ski holidays to Austria, this time I am going to the USA !!!!!! When I got home from hospital today there was a letter on the doormat saying that I had won a scholarship for nurse's study trip to Boston, Cleveland and New York.

My breast cancer has come back as skin secondaries not far from my mastectomy scar line. Had surgery last week- looks like someone has carved their initials in my side. Start carbaplatin and gemcitaine in a weeks time. I have googled skin metastasis/secondaries but can't find much info. If anyone has come across any information could you let me know. The Doc's are calling it stage 4, I prefer to think of it as stage 3 d (just adding a new sub group to the usual classification system). A friend of mine a few years ago told me that her Doc missed her recurrence when 'it' came back near her scar line- so as soon as I saw these spots I knew to make sure that I got them biopsied. The Docs were sure that it was something and nothing. So I am glad I persevered. Other than that I feel great- just a bit tired. I took 10 months off work last time, but this time I am hoping to work from home and just go into work when I want to. I teach nursing and am very well looked after at the University that I work at- so I am lucky in that respect. Looking forward to being able to share news of good progress with you over the next few months. Natalie xx",

Before 'this' I ran with a great gang of marathon runners- now they run and I cycle along with them. Ccnani where is your photo ?? I have just posted mine- it was taken 2 days post mastectomy in the hospital garden. Will change to a wig photo soon. Hair well on its way out- wore my short wig for bike riding today- was delighted that it didn't blow off. I get the manuka honey from the supermarket but they sell it at the health food shop too- which is where i get the lovely almond milk from. Melinda 41, I am curious as to whether you could pay for the neupogen shots outside your insurance? I am in the UK so our funding is different. If we go private for any aspect of our health care we have to pay for the whole lot of treatment. Interesting to read the postings re H1N1 I will be asking my Docs about that next week- over here our family are encouraged to get the vaccination too- is it the same in the USA? Australia? Thailand? When is Thanksgiving? Can you tell I am a Brit? If you let me know I will make sure I enter into the celebrations. Did it start by giving thanks for getting rid of the English ??? think you need to teach me about this celebration !!! For those of you struggling with steroid induced insomnia- my info leaflet suggests taking one dose in the morning and second dose at lunch time- thought it might help. Happy Weekend to you all ",

Had one dose of taxotere and cyclophosphamide, via a Hickman line on the the 4th Novemeber. Think ports get used more over in the States, but we are not quite there yet in the UK. Treatment every 3 weeks for 18 weeks, next one 23rd November. Had mastectomy 8 weeks ago, got an expander in, another mastectomy planned post chemo. This is my third treatment for cancer, my breast cancer seems to have resulted from the radiation I had 20 years ago for Hodgkin's lymphoma, had lymphoma 6 years ago too. I know this might sound a bit like I am feeling sorry for myself... I am not, I have felt positive each time. Just thought it would be a good place to start... aware that my on-line chat sounds very British ie. stiff... I am sure I will loosen up as time goes by.

In tracksuit now- so no body tape needed. Will try the clarytin recommendation next cycle of neupogen- thanks for the tip . Happy Weekend to you all xxx",
