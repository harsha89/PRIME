The radiation is what caused the collapse, sigh...but some doctors do different things, maybe doing it the way you are doing it would be better? I hope everything goes well, are you doing implants after the expanders? Or a flap surgery?",

About halfway thru the treatments my expander collapsed, but was still in tact and would hold some fluid when we did resume fills. I opted to not replace but to proceed with reconstruction. On 6-29-18 I had reconstruction with implants the cohesive gel kind. Everything was going great when after 6 weeks my radiated side incision came open about 4 inches across the front. ugh...Had to go to the ER to get stitches and then back in surgery on Monday to remove the implant and clean everything out, no infection only inflammatory tissue? My PS says at least 2 months before we can put the expander back in and then a few months after that replacing the expander with another implant?? So just wanted to know if anyone else had any issues that far out from reconstruction and any ideas on doing anything different like a flap surgery instead of implants? I am a very active person with my job as a vet tech and I also have a small farm, so I am outside and busy all the time. So not sure which option I should do, but considering all of them at this point. thank you Dx 4/11/2017, IDC, Left, 2cm, Stage IIIC, Grade 3, ER+/PR+, HER2- (FISH) Chemotherapy 5/20/2017 AC + T (Taxol) Surgery 11/17/2017 Lymph node removal: Underarm/Axillary; Mastectomy Radiation Therapy 1/25/2018 Whole-breast: Breast, Lymph nodes Hormonal Therapy 3/21/2018 Arimidex (anastrozole) Surgery Log in to post a reply",

MY TE expander collapsed when I went thru the radiation and we opted to not replace and just proceed with the reconstruction, but I am thinking I should have replaced it then but just didn't want to do another surgery but now it looks like I will be having 2 more, My expander never did fully expand after the collapse so my skin never really got the chance to slowly stretch out? So I am not sure if that was the problem but we will see, hope all goes well with yours",

He was able to go in and remove the previous scars and some radiated tissue and it does look good. So most likely in a few months I will have the implant put in. That will be one year from when I had radiation so hopefully this will go better. How is everyone doing?",
