Good luck to the rest of the ladies here!  (no I am going to rest my head some more)",

I am hoping they will pull the drains (keeping fingers crossed!) ",

I too was off prescription pain meds within a few days.  I have even gone a couple of days with no advil or tylenol at all.  It definetely gets better.  Getting confortable for sleeping is my biggest hurdle right now.  I spent my first night in a real bed last night with TONS of pillows to prop me up, it was better than the couch, but not by much  :) \"Good luck\"to all those still waiting for surgery and  a big \"heal fast\"  to those of us in recovery from surgery.",

I know my PS said that how much skin you have left from the MX plays a big role in imediate reconstruction.  He generally won't do it because of that reason.  Most ladies want to stay the same size and  it would put way to much pressure on the stitches and could compromise the skin that is left.  They don't want the skin to die  as that creates more problems Best of luck to all of you!!!   ",
