After examination She has referred me to the hospital for a breast check/ mammogram. She has told me I should receive my appointment in September. Two weeks later I have discovered a small , tender lump under my right arm pit. Should I go back to see my doctor ? Has anyone had a similar experience? I\u2019m a little bit worried after discovering this. Any help would be so appreciated, Thanks Log in to post a reply",
