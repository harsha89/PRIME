    "Content": "sandy1810 wrote: I had a lumpectomy for an invasive ductal carcinoma last year in February, 06. It was in the category of 100% survival rate so I did not think much more about it. But now, last Friday I had a mammogram that showed two suspicious spots on the chest wall and looked smudgy the radiologist said. Also the other breast is now showing inversion of the nipple which previously was not like that at all. I will have a biopsy on June 25th next Monday. Meantime I am having a hard time with worry. I think about it all the time, just about constantly and I have done a lot of looking things up on the internet. I wonder if anyone can give me any information about this kind of situation. I think if it is malignant it must be a new cancer as the original cancer was small, clear margins, clear lymph nodes and estrogen sensitive. I had radiation and take arimidex. i am 68. Can anyone help me? Log in to post a reply",
