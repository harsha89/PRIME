Everything in my body screams that more than one drink for you is very bad but I did it anyways.  I just get to the point where i feel like I could do everything right and still have a reoccurence.  How the heck are we supposed to live like this..it just sucks.  Most of the time I'm doing pretty good then bam not so good.   How can I look to future when just making it thru the present is so difficult.",

      "Content": "katyand4 wrote: My mom has been diagnosed with IV breast cancer (unofficially).  She was suffering from back pain for quite some time and went to docs week before xmas.  They did xray, xray led to MRI and then they did mammo, ultrasound and bone scan.  Extensive mets seen on bone scan along with mass in right breast.  Knew she was having back issues but quite honestly never registered that it might be breast cancer that spread.  Kicking myself now that we didn't get her to docs sooner.  Mom lives with me, kids and hubby.  We have just recovered from my own treatment that was finished in 2012 and now here we go again.  I am watching my biggest fear play out right before my very eyes....scared for my mom, scared for me and so scared for my kids.  Siblings don't realize how close to home this is hitting, trying to keep mom healthy (in so much pain with back), trying to keep myself healthy, raise four kids (24, 22, 19 & 11)  and a nephew (19), do the books for our business and keep hubby happy. My big kids have been wonderful but still feeling like way too much on the plate...you girls get how I'm feeling.  Please say a prayer for my mom...meeting with my oncologist today see where we go from there.  Be well.  Katie It is okay to have a bad day.....just don't string them together!
