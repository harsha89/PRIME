Maybe longer than I can remember. Please don't judge me for not seeing a doctor yet but I am a hypochondriac and i have anxiety so I am super scared to go see a doctor. Whenever I go into a hospital my heart rate reaches high 120's. Anyway this itch can be bad some days and others not a thing. I do have a section on my left areola that itches the most and skin constantly is dry and flaky. I also have it around my right nipple but it is a very small area. Both breasts itch but it is the left one that concerns me the most. I take very hot showers. I love hot water and I use bath and body works shower gels which I love as well. I also hardly ever moisturize my breasts and I sweat a lot. My concern is that this is something that doesn't seem to want to go away but that could be in part to me not using anything on my breasts. Also I have scratched a lot which has made that section on my areola kind of dark. There is no history of breast cancer in my family that I know of. With issues like this to me age means nothing as anything can happen at any age. I have no discharge, no burning, swelling or pain. Just that itchy dry patch on the left one and the small itchy area on the right. Please if you guys could share some insight I would appreciate it. Thanks Log in to post a reply",

Just wondering if my symptoms mimicked anyone else's or if anyone was going through the same thing as myself. Always feels good to know you're not alone. I'll muster up the courage to go hopefully sooner rather than later. Thanks again",

To be honest I haven't tried anything so of course that's why I'm still dealing with the same issue and freaking ourselves out only makes things worse. I hate hospitals and doctors but I just need to suck it up and go. I wish there was a cure for cancer or that it never existed.",
