    "Content": "SimplyAudrey wrote: I recently had a myofibroblastoma resected from my right breast.  Sure enough, LCIS in adjacent tissue.  My docs are playing with calculators and report an assessed lifetime risk from 15 to 20% to greater than 85% - they don't see eye to eye evidently. NO family history.  Mine is a \"Tumor Board Poster Case\". SERMS are not an option - had a blood clot from OCs.  So, do I play the hypervigilant waiting game and do the digital mammogram/MRI , or do I pick door number three and go agressive with a prophylactic mastectomy?  Throw a known anxiety/panic issue (treated) on top of it and I'm a mess.  Whatever I do, Marvin the chain-smoking Anxiety Monkey that's jumping on my shoulder needs to go back in his cage.
