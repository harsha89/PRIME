    "Content": "belindarev wrote: I had my mammo (on my left breast) and was told they wanted to do an ultrasound because of dense tissue (I had Stage 1a in the right breast two years ago).  The ultrasound showed that a lymph node under my left arm was swollen (2 cm x 1 cm) and had a coating around the outside and that they could not rule out metastatic cancer.  I am waiting for the results from the fine needle biopsy and I am terrified.  The cancer was so small 2 years ago (only 0.8 mm) and I am only 45.  I read that swollen lymph nodes could be caused by an infection (this is what I am hoping for) but I am so worried since my Dr. specifically mentioned cancer.   Belinda Dx 1/10/2012, DCIS, Stage 0, Grade 3, 0/0 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Dx 3/5/2012, IDC, <1cm, Stage IA, Grade 1, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
