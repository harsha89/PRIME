It's quite soft on top, but there's a section underneath the skin which feels harder. It's not on my breast, but close to (not in) my armpit. It doesn't hurt to touch, but it does when squeezed. There is nothing else unusual on my chest, and they look like they always have other than the lump. There's no history of cancer in my family. Should I be worried? I also have anxiety, so it could be nothing. I've recently started exercising more, and I was thinking it might just be due to heat or friction Log in to post a reply",
