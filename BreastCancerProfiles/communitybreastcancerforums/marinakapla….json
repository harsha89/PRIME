I've completed 3/4 dose dense AC treatments, most of my hair fell out on days 15-17 (about 3 weeks ago) and  I shaved off the rest with an electric razor, but the rest hasnt' fallen out and shaving it turned the remaining strands into prickly, painful stubble - I've been hoping it would all fall out and I'd have a smooth head (which I hope is more comfortable than this stubble). After I'm done with AC I'll be on Taxol for 12 weeks - someone please tell me it will all fall out soon and I'll have a smooth head and not have to deal with this horrible painful stubble any more - or should I shave it again? this time with a real razor?",

So now I exercise (at home) 7 days a week for an hour a day on the eliptical at highest resistance and the treadmill at the highest incline (3.5 mph), as well as yoga 2-3 times a week and power-walking outside whenever possible. I've done this every day since I started chemo except for the 3 days following each infusion (those are my nausea days). Well my onc was right, exercise has really helped me avoid fatigue. I find that if I'm feeling tired and really want to just go and have a nap, I'll get on the treadmill or the eliptical instead and it makes me feel perky, happy and energetic and totally gets rid of the fatigue!! If I do give in and go have a nap, I wake up tired and irritable! I've also continued to work full time and I think that the exercise has enabled me to have the energy to keep on working. I'm on the dose dense regime (AC every 2 weeks for 8 weeks, I'll be starting taxol Feb 23 every week for 12 weeks plus herceptin every 3 weeks for a year).",
