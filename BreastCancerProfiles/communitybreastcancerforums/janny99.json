Kittycat ~ The little one in the picture is my 2 year old grandson...I almost didn't put this photo on because my face is so puffy from the Decadron, but I loved that he had to have a sleep cap on like his \"mom mom\" as he calls me.  We involved him in the whole process of my hair falling out and leading to the buzzing what was left.  No 'biggie' to him.  If you ask him where my hair went, he says, \"in the vacuum cleaner\" very matter of fact....gotta love those little ones.  R711 ~ Even though my posts are kind of \"blue\"this week, I have actually tolerated the weekly Taxol/Herceptin infusions quite well.  So don't let my being kind of negative right now scare you.  The biggest problem for me is the fatigue, and I think that's why I've been a little crabby, I'm just soooo tired.  I have a few GI symptoms, the worst part is the chemo diarrhea, but my appetite is pretty good for the most part. Cheyanne ~ I think an antidepressent is a good idea.  I take a low dose, and it helps me cope with all that we are going through....and we are ALL going through A LOT!!!! TMarina ~ I really pushed it too hard with work these past few days, and I am not going to do that anymore.  I was soooo sick when I finally made it home last night, I think the worse that I have felt since I started this June 7th.  My oncologist filled out paperwork for intermittent FMLA while I'm undergoing chemo...if I need another note each week to only pull two 12 hour shifts rather than 3 or 4, then I will do that...I think my job is safe for up to 3 months. I cried for the first time during my 6th round of chemo today.  I had an agency nurse, who was nice, but I didn't know her & I was used to my \"Team\" of Oncology nurses, so that made me uncomfortable.  Plus, I asked her if they were going to do a PT/INR because they increased my dose of Coumadin last week, she didn't even check and said \"no\" I didn't need it (I had a blood clot from my port, hence the blood thinners).  I really didn't feel well, and when I asked her to get me a prescription for something stronger than immodium for my liquid stools (which the NP told me to ask if I needed it), the nurse told me I didn't need it and to keep trying the immodium!!!  I am dehydrated, my BP was only 82/60.  \"HELLO\"  assessment skills???  I also lost 5 pounds this past week, this is not normal for me!!!  I know my usual nurses would have at least checked with the MD or NP to double check what labs I might need, or see if they want to give me a prescription.  I was so upset!!!  Then my ex called and asked if I was feeling better today (I was a little bit better) but that made me cry even more.  I was told to ask the nurses to check to see if they would give me fluids, and this nurse kind of ignored that....so, when my infusions were complete, I asked her to run in the rest of the flush bag (at least), which she did.  I felt soooo out of control!!!  Then went to the free head covering shop at the Cancer Center, and the volunteer just stayed in there with my daughter and I.....acting like she was worried that we would take too much stuff!!!  (2 scarves, 1 turban).  Talk about uncomfortable.  When I've gone in there before, they just say take whatever you need, that's what it's for.  Plus, I have donated extra wigs that were given to me, about 30 turbans, and a few other items that were given to me that I can't use.  Arrrrgggghhhhhh.   OK, now that I've been a negative Nelly, we did end the day on a good note with my daughter and I enjoying a nice lunch together (her 23rd birthday was yesterday) and did a little shopping where I bought a couple of scarves and 3 hats.....getting addicted to the hats!!!  OK, that's enough rambling for today....just need to get out of this slump!!!! God Bless you all!!!  You are all amazing women!!!  Wish I had some of that strength....Hoping for an awesome week for everyone with minimal SE's.  ",

The thing is, I was getting excellent feedback from all of my co-workers, but my boss was angry that it took so long to get through.  Sorry, this had to be dealt with, not gonna die for my job...literally. Sorry, I needed to vent.  If I were you Kitty, I would definitely take care of YOU first when you have your hysterectomy!  If (God forbid), I go through this again, I am going to choose not to work.  The working was really good for me, but the stress of dealing with bosses who lack compassion is not healthy.

Taxol & Herceptin, this was the first of 9 weekly treatments, then 1 week of rest followed by FAC every 3 weeks X3.  I think I did pretty good, but have to admit I was pretty scared.  They ran all of the meds in pretty slowly to watch for any adverse reaction to the drugs.  I also found the other patients getting their chemo were wonderful resource filling me in on where things were, how the heaters and massagers work in the chairs, where the bathroom was etc etc etc...the nurses were professional and kind.  So, I have to say for a day that I have been so afraid of, it was okay.  They did warn me that the SE might not show up too much for a couple of days, and that I will mostly feel quite fatigued...  It felt good to get this started, I'm still nervous, but at least the show is on the road!",

I got my tattoos for radiation last Tuesday, I will have my 'dry run' early this week. I made a comment on my FB page about getting my 'first' tattoos ~ OMG the response was too funny...I had to then explain that they were the size of a freckle & for my radiation!  Maybe after this is all over, I will consider getting a pink ribbon tattoo (or maybe not). I, too, am nervous about developing lymph edema.  I tend to have a little more swelling in my arm on the mastectomy side, and worry a bit about it.   Thanks Binney4 for the info.  DesignerMom ~ I am trying to get some walking in, but 40 blocks!?!  Wow!!!  I 'graduated' from my Physical Therapy...with the understanding that if I am experiencing a lot of fatigue with the rads, that I can restart anytime within the next month.  I loved it!   I don't write often, but I try to keep up with every ones posts....sounds like the mood is a bit more elevated as we get closer to finishing up tx.  Has anyone started Tamoxifen yet?  I received my prescription, but they told me to wait until I get the 'ok' from my radiation oncologist...I guess some of the docs want to wait until after rads.

Well, I guess I should say TODAY I have decided not to do it....I'm going to sleep on it tonight, I may change my mind by morning.   ",
