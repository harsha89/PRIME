S Stayton - I had no problem with port insertion, but my nerves were regenerating at that point from breast surgery, so actually the port was probably less sensitive than the rest of the chest.  Compared to the breast surgery, the port was a breeze for me, but it's different for everybody.",

I actually work in a hospital that specializes in cancer they have a breast center one with the first 3D mammo in our region. I'm just concerned if I should continue to work during treatment. I'm so exhausted now I can't see how I can but I have to or no money or insurance. I go to dr in morning so maybe ill deel better after I see him.",

They say if I don't need chemo before I have sugery I will more than likely have a double mastectomy Jan 8th or 10th. unless something on t6he scans come back bad. I have ups and downs.  my son turns 21 on the 8th so he said do it then mom. get that alien out of you. just wondering how many people have a lump in arm pit too that is very sore?  its been there a while and I agree with theothers every new pain or current pain i think its the cancer eating away.  I will say my right breast is bigger. Like its starting to swell. The alien does feel bigger but could be where the biopsy was done.  from what I understand they are going to test the lymp nodes at time of surgery so he only have to take out the ones affected.   Hoping he doesn't want to do it before since that would be a longer wait. When you are told its very aggressive and Im going on vacation tomorrow in the same sentence from the surgeon it's a little nevere racking ans well as fight insurance for other test.  but as far as I know its all done and just waiting on the rest of the results so they can  get a game plan. smethot I understand how you feel totally.  We will get through this together.  I honestly have been throught this with family and friends but its a whole new ball game when its you.  Also how did I loose control over my life in a 2 second span? it is upside down and sideways.. As much as I love my three kids and 2 grandkids and husband I truely feel this is me now. I cant do this for them. time to be selfish for a change and do it for me. I need control.. ",
