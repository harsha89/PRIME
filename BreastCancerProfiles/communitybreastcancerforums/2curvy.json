The nurse told me to take Claritin D the day before the Neulasta, and day of, and the day after. This supposedly helped with the pain. However, I did experience alot of pain in my legs and upperback, espcially after the first shot. The subsequent shots caused much less pain that I was able to handle, sometimes taking Advil. Good luck to you!",

The good thing about triple negative is that it responds very well to chemo, and generally, if it doesn't come back within 3 years, then there is a good chance that it won't come back. There is a whole triple negative board here.  Just scroll down and you will find it.  Good luck to you.",
