Been looking for a job and I have my first interview set up for Friday afternoon.  The job sounds really great and is only like 10 minutes from my house.  Wish me luck! I missed the hot-flash/Tamoxifin discussion.  I'm lucky in that I've been taking Tamox going on 3 months here and have yet to have any side effects.  I asked my onc. if that meant I wasn't metabolizing it.  She says no.... it just means I'm not getting any SEs.  So I consider myself lucky there. So right now I have not too many lasting problems from my BC ordeal.  My scars are small, my hair is coming in nicely (I believe I look \"normal\" at this point)... I just have some tenderness still in my radiated breast which I assume is normal.  Looks like I survived! Abbi",

I've lost most of the hair \"down there\", but again, there's a little hanging in.  I too have to shave my legs every couple weeks or so.  I have very little left in the way of eyebrows/lashes, but enough to see where to fill in the eyebrows and enough that I can get a little mascara on the lashes. I have noticed the last week or so that the stubble on my head is starting to get longer (gee, I good 1/8 of an inch or so!) and there are some new hairs sprouting up.  My onc. said it would start growing in on weekly Taxol, so maybe he was right. I have to get my driver's license renewed in mid March, so I'm hoping to have enough hair by then to be topless.  I don't wear a wig, just scarves, so I'm not sure what I'd do about my license pic if I'm still bald.... do you suppose they give you an extention?  Oh well, no sense worrying about that until March, huh?",

How did you handle the cancer issue?  Were you up-front about it?  I'm going to start interviewing at the end of March (we're going to Florida mid-March.... Yippee!!).  I obviously look a little \"odd\"... my hair is still pretty short to look like I did it on purpose. I want to be honest with a potential employer, but in the same respect, I don't want to ruin my chances because an employer may be worried about time I'll miss for appointments, tests, etc... KWIM? Just curious how you handled it. Paxton - you and I have exactly the same schedule left.  I'm fairly burned, but not too bad.  I'm very generous with the burn cream she prescribed and my moisturizers.  I'm hoping that since the boosts are so targeted, my really sensitive areas (nipple and underneath the breast) will get to start healing after the last 2 zaps. No cracking or peeling of my skin (yet), just really red and itchy!  Nothing like an itchy nipple, ya know?! Abbi",

We had an exciting night last night.  DS (16) wakes me up at 11:30 pm to inform me that the kid's bathroom is flooded.  Sure enough, there's a couple inches of water on the floor, out into the hall carpet and it is \"raining\" through my kitchen ceiling below! So we clean up, mop up, try to find the problem (no luck) so DH shuts off the water and decides we'll just call a plumber this morning.... So this morning as we're getting ready to call the plumber DD (13) confesses that she overflowed the bathroom sink last night but didn't want to tell anyone because she was afraid she'd get yelled at!!! So today I'm calling around looking for someone who does drywall repair.  I'm probably going to have to replace a good portion of my kitchen ceiling.  Kids!!!! Abbi",

As far as the fear of the cancer coming back, I think that is perfectly normal.   My mom (a 22-year survivor) says that will lessen as the years go by.  She says the first couple years, every ache, paid, lump or bump you may have you think is cancer. She was telling me that, for years, her annual mammogram on her remaining breast has just been a routine.  This year, she was sitting in the waiting room and was really nervous.  Having me go through this all brought it all back to her as well. When I get those dark thoughts, I remind myself that cancer is something pretty much beyond my control.  It already got control of this past year of my life.  I refuse to let it control the rest.  I worked too hard to live to live in fear.

We had a neighborhood progressive dinner last night.... you know where you go to a different home for each course?  Well, anyway, we hosted the first house for appetizers... 40 people.  Probably 30 of these people I'd never met before.  I was talking with one lady I do know well who was asking me about how I was doing.  People who didn't know I'd had cancer were shocked!  I guess my VERY short hair looks like a choice.... that makes me feel good. My hair is very curly and maybe about an inch to an inch-and-a-half.  What I really could use are bangs, though.  The back and sides look \"normal\", but no one would choose to cut their bangs this short! Anyway, I got a lot of \"you're so braves\" and \"I can't believe you'd host a party 4 days out of treatment\" and \"you look so great\"..... good for the ego!! I don't get hot flashes.  Probably means the tamoxifin isn't working, but I try not to think about THAT and just be thankful that I don't have hot flashes to deal with. Just hang in there! Abbi",

Be generous with the cream.  I had Silvadine cream that wasn't doing too much for me until the nurse informed me that I needed to apply it like spackling... good and thick. I never had blisters or anything though.  Hope the War Zone cream works for you.  You'll be surprised how fast you start to heal once your treatments are done. Hang in there! Anyone else from this group still in treatments?  I'm hanging out here at the finish line cheering you all on and I ain't leaving 'til we ALL cross the line! Abbi",

I'm BRCA neg as well, though no one can tell me that with my maternal grandmom (44), mom (45) and me (44) all having BC there's not a genetic connection - they just don't know about our gene yet.  I do worry for my daughter, but hopefully she'll be very diligent about her health and find it early if she does get it. Anyway.... enjoy being DONE!!!  I feel really good, if only I wasn't so darn tired.  I suppose it takes time.... Abbi",

No hair dryer, no flat iron.... I'm NEVER going back to long hair again.    Now if the curls will just stay..... Everybody's headed to Florida it seems.   Remember your sunscreen, gals.... we've already been cooked enough! Paxton, hope your back feels better.  If it's not one thing, it's another, huh? Methusala - Financial crap does seem to come in bunches.  We had a period a couple months ago where all the cars seemed to be costing me money at the same time, and my daughter flooded the bathroom and taxes were due and......  just hang in there, things will turn around. Good weekend to all!! Abbi",
