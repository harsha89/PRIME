I am about to have a dbl/mast with no reconstruction this Monday, the 25th of Jan., and look forward to the eventual feeling of \"breast free\" and not \"breastless\".  I plan to have plenty of boobless days.  I have thought of vests in the winter and blouses over tees in the summer.  I look forward to getting on this blog again.  I am not looking forward to the recovery time, and probably radiation following, but hope to eventually get back on here.  I am so impressed and encouraged by all that I've read here.  Thanks so much, Latricia",
