My best friend, across the world, is having a follow-up biopsy after the first one came back inconclusive. I will recommend this site to her. You have all been so great, a true inspiration. Not just in the way you all cope with this monster, whether it's threatened or real, but in the way you reach out and support each other. You have all made me SO proud to be a woman.

      "Content": "kel44 wrote: Hello I feel bad coming on to this forum where people have genuine health problems, when mine (as far as I know) are just in my head. But I am driving myself insane with worry and dedicating way too much time to internet searches, so I figured it was best to just ask people who really know rather than trying to find a forum posting from someone with exactly the same symptoms as mine.  I had a core needle biopsy three days ago. Prior to that, I had had a mass (wouldn't say lump because it's very flat and ill-defined), like a layer of slate, for at least two years now. I have quite dense breasts and the mass has always been put down to that. Five years ago, when I was pregnant, a huge lump appeared between my left breast and my underarm (about 6 cm across). It was clearly visisble to the naked eye and VERY palpable but it didn't show up as anything odd on the mammogram and was presumed to be normal breast tissue. It went away. Since then I have had yearly mammograms, although I'm only 41 with no direct family history (apart from great grandmother and two great aunts, who died of breast cancer). About two years ago I noticed an odd mass in the upper outer? quadrant of my left breast which, like I said, is flat and quite extended (about 3cm long).  It was not picked up on the yearly mammogram but they spotted it easily on the ultrasound and said it looked like fatty tissue (lipoma). I was told that if it was still there in six months, they would do a biopsy. They didn't, because the next time, it was still the same and I agreed to wait another six months. This time (a month ago), they said it had grown. To me, it is actually less palpable than before but I have been having some changes lately to my whole body (periods every two to three weeks, less changes to breast tissue with periods) that may make it less obvious. In fact, my breasts feel as thought they have emptied in the last few months, despite gaining weight). So, I wasn't too scared when they called me back in. I wasn't even convinced that the mass was still there! The results won't be in for around three weeks, apparently. But then I started thinking (dangerous) and I am worried about a problem I have been having in my left hip for the past six months. I was hospitalised with really severe hip pain over Christmas. MRI, CT and xrays but found nothing. They did find a 2-3cm nodule close to the left hip suggestive of \"Adenopathy\" but this was not investigated further, since it was only described as an incidental finding. The pain subsided after around two weeks but it continues to flare up at night. It feels like it is very deep within the joint. It's not there 90% of the time during the day but it does come on occasionally. I have to assume that this is unrelated, since there is a high possibility that the breast lump is benign anyway but it is worrying that all these things are coinciding and I have been very tired lately with a nervous twitch in my left eye that won't go away no matter how much sleep I get. I have had periods of really bad night sweats for the last six months but this tends to come and go.  Could a lump that grew that slowly (and doesn't even feel as noticeable to me these days) possibly be malignant?  Does my experience of the hip pain (acute then low level night-time pain continuing for months) sound like it could be related?  Thank you for any advice you might have. The wait is going to be agonising. 3 weeks!  Sam Log in to post a reply",

Have had a busy day getting ready to go back to work after two weeks off for Easter. That will really help to take my mind off things. It's a very stressful job but I'm actually glad of it at the moment.  Ariom, I think you may be right about the early menopause. All the women (on both mum and dad's sides) had very late menopause, 60+!, but I do seem to have all of the symptoms and I'm perfectly happy not to follow in their footsteps! I will of course come back and let you know how I get on. I'm really hoping the doctor was just playing it safe by saying three weeks for the results...to avoid people calling with \"you told me it would be a week, where are my results?\".   Thanks again, Sam",

It's hard when the rational, optimistic part of your brain seems to shut down and just leaves you with doom and fear. I'm sure both of our hip pain symptoms are unrelated but the alternative is just so terrifying that I think your brain goes there to prepare you for the possibility, however remote.

And I have heard nothing from the doctors. It's now two and a half weeks since biopsy and they did say it would take three to four weeks to get an appointment to discuss the results. I really am hoping (assuming) that this is good news...surely they would call straightaway to offer me an appointment if it was bad news?! Since I am now more hopeful, I was wondering whether to just go and pick up my report from the hospital. I think I can. I did it a while back with some MRI results for my back. The only problem is that B9 or not I will need some help working out what the results all mean. Will you ladies give me a hand with that? I could be here for another two weeks waiting for the appointment and I just need to know. If it's good news, that's great. But even if it's bad news and I don't have the benefit of being able to talk it through with the doctor in the way I would if they give me the results in person, I don't think there's ever a good way to receive that kind of news and here in Spain, where psychological/emotional care is not a strong point, I can't see there being much difference in hearing bad news in person and reading it on a piece of paper! ",

It seems as though, even those who really don't think they are very strong, turn out to be heroines when life requires them to be.  BC asks that of you. I really can't believe that all of these many hundreds of women on this forum are so strong and empowered by coincidence. It feels like BC brings this to the fore. And from the very little you have shared with us, it appears you are one of those women who was really strong before all this started, so you're already halfway there! I look forward to reading about how you lick this SOB! Big hug.",

I'm not scared, just need to know what I'm facing either way and move on. But I am anxious, if that makes sense.  Anyway, I noticed that a couple of you were based in Spain and I wondered what your experiences had been of the services here. I've been here for YEARS and am fluent in Spanish. I've had kids here and two other minor ops and I have always been so impressed with the care I have received but all of a sudden I feel very unsure. When it comes to something as important as this, I suddenly find myself doubting the medical profession here. Like, even if they say it's B9 I won't believe them. Now, I'm not sure if that's because they are \"foreign\" doctors...never bothered me before...or whether it's because I just know instinctively there is something that is not right. It's hard to describe without sounding odd but this mass has a \"presence\". I can feel it doesn't belong and despite having had lots and lots of lumps MUCH bigger and superficially much scarier, this one is \"there\" in a way that I can't really define. I don't even need to touch it. I can feel it. Anyone else feel that? I know Spain does actually have a good record for BC treatment but what have your experiences been (those of you living here) of the diagnostic process? And for anyone else living outside of their native country, did/do you feel like running home?  Thanks for listening. Sam x Log in to post a reply",
