My ca153 is now back to normal levels thank G-d but after the last few infusions I get bad headaches which last a few days and leave me feeling weak. Also my eyes have become blurry and when I saw the eye doctor he said my eyes were very dry. With all the creams and drops I find myself struggling to see clearly. My doctor does not want to reduce the dose nor space them out yet, so I wondered if any one had similar experiences and kadcyla still worked for a long time even at a reduced dose or more spaced apart. Thank you and be well all",

I had a chest nodule biopsy which was positive so the onc said it was in my lungs but not as a tumor but as lymphangitis. After being on THP for about 4 months my CA153 was normal and my scan was almost clean so i stayed on HP and added zoladex and letrozole. I only ever felt out of breath when i went on holiday and was walking the mountains in very hot weather. Then in March this year i felt out of breath and really not myself but no one picked up anything until i collapsed with pneumonia (?) but in the end it was a pericardial effusion and I had almost a litre of fluid drained. Thankfully that's resolved now and the cardiologist has discharged me other than my 4 monthly echos. With brain mets would tumor markers be high as mine have come down to normal thank G-d? As for the supplements i take i saw a complimentary cancer consultant in the Hospital for Integrated medicine here in London and he said i was taking a good mix of vitamins, minerals and herbs. He added some homeopathic stuff including Iscador drops. I cant say i take the supplements 100 % of the time i would say more like 95% as sometimes i decide i need a break from them and i also see a naturopath who changes the supplements every so often. I find taking them whilst on treatment helps me feel good and able to manage my busy life. Maybe i will also ask him if there is anything which could be causing the headaches. thanks again - i find these boards really helpful!  ",

I have continued to take some supplements over the years. Recently I asked him for a referral to the homeopathic hospital for amongst other things acupuncture and he told me that he had terrible back and shoulder pain after using every painkiller which didn't help he tried acupuncture and after 2 treatments it was gone. So now he believes it has some place in medicine and I should do whatever I need to feel good",

As for the headaches i've probably had them on and off since i'v started but the last 3 treatments were bad so much so that last week's started before the treatment and painkillers helped a little but when i came home from the infusion and the next day all i wanted to was stay in bed - i felt like after my first dose of docetaxol totally knocked out. I am not on another other medication from the dr but am taking supplements and homeopathic prescribed by practitioners and have been doing acupuncture the lasdt few months to help the various side effects i was getting. Has anyone had their dose lowered or the frequency altered and had improvement in their side effects?",
