I get a mammo every year and never expected a call back as no one on my mom's side of the family, nor any of my sisters, have ever had breast cancer. We have had colon cancer, lung cancer, liver cancer, stomach cancer and ovarian cancer...never breast cancer I had my normal mammo on the 9th of May. A few days later I received a call that I needed to go back in for a diagnostic mammo of the right breast because they saw some microcalcifications there. While in for the diagnostic, they discovered a small lump on my left breast near the arm pit so they did a diagnostic of that as well. I never expected anything to come of it, thought they'd tell me to come back in 6 months for a follow up...but today they called and want me to do the stereotactic biopsy of the microcalcifications on the right breast and a sonogram of the palpable lump on the left. I am worried. My doctor said it could be DCIS and very treatable, but I heard that sometimes the lumpectomy also requires radiation. I was rated a BI-RAD 4 which means that the microcalcifications are 'suspicious'. Does anyone know the likelihood that these are normally benign?? Is this a fairly normal occurrence? Also, I hope you get your biopsy results soon. I am not diagnosed yet, but I am also very worried!",
