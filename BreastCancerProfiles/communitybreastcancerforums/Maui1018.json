It helps so much knowing Im not the only person that goes crazy with anguish in this situation. My mom is a nurse (and an absolute angel,) and since my docs office was taking so long, she sent an order from her clinic for me. She just told me to call them and check... so I'm about to do that... I guess I'm procrastinating a little right now:| So hopefully they will get me in soon aND tell me something. Does anyone know how long it takes to get answers after an ultrasound?",

      "Content": "Maui1018 wrote: I am 30 years old and do have eczema as is. A few months ago I developed a severe, consistent itch on right breast around nipple. It persisted for a few weeks, then went away, then came back. Because I was almost consistently scratching around the area, and worried I was checking for other changes more than once a day. Then last week there was a semi-hard. Grape sized lump around 6o'clock under right nipple. I have extremely small breasts to begin with (barely an A cup) so the lump was very apparent and did appear overnight. The lump can be moved under the skin a little. The same nipple has become extremely dry and the itchiness continues. After a doctor visit, I was referred to an imaging place for an ultrasound. That was 2 days ago and the imaging place has yet to receive the referral and call me to schedule. I'm freaking out in the mean time. I have two little boys and feel like I'm a horrible parent right now bc all I've been doing is worrying about this and googling every thing under the sun to try and get some answers. I am panicking so bad and have turned into a hypochondriac about everything. My mom said she had a fibrocystic breast in herdon't see any benign breast conditions that seem to cause the itching. There is no history of breast cancer in the family. Anybody else experience similar symptoms, and also what should I expect from the ultrasound? Thanks. Log in to post a reply",
