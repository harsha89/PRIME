You can click on \"Lingerie\" and then choose the kinds of bras you're interested in. They also have different kinds of breast forms, including some fairly light ones. That's the main brand we have around here in Australia, so I don't know what else to recommend. ",

I've been taking Pregabalin (Lyrica) for nerve pain since my surgery but yesterday my doctor said to increase the dose from 50mg twice a day to 75mg twice a day. I'm getting worried that I will stay this way and the pain won't go away. I don't know how long the increased dose may take to work. I remembered that hypericum (St John's wort) oil is good for nerve pain, and since I've got some, I plan to rub that on my chest soon. Does anyone have any other ideas?",

Another idea is that there are quite supportive non-underwire bras out there, so investing in some of those could be good. Amoena and Anita are well known brands of bras that have pockets for a prosthesis. There are also polyester filled soft prostheses that are more comfortable to wear soon after surgery than silicone ones, which aren't meant to be worn for at least 6-8 weeks after surgery. I hope you find some good solutions that work for you.",

I didn't see any other bruising but I did have a plastic dressing for 2 weeks, so there may have been other bruising early on. I'm sorry you still have bruising or maybe a scar on your chest. Arnica is meant to be really good for making bruises better but if it's a scar, other things may help, such as rose hip oil. I hope it goes away soon. That's a lovely photo of you, by the way!",

I think I look much better flat than I looked before, although I was planning to wear soft forms after surgery. Since I developed nerve pain after 2 weeks, I haven't been able to wear them and now I'm a lot more used to being flat. I'd still like to have the option of wearing forms at times but since it's winter here, it hasn't been too much of a problem so far.",

My PMPS is also less bad than it was and I've been able to reduce my Lyrica from 300mg per day to 200mg per day so far. Reducing the last amount made my body feel stressed so I will stay at this level until I feel more relaxed.",

No, I'm not working out with weights but I do some stretching and self massage of my chest. Why do you ask? I find using a menthol gel on my chest helps, plus I see an osteopath every 3 weeks and I don't have limited movement from surgery. The Lyrica I'm taking (150mg twice a day) limits the amount of pain but doesn't make it go away.",

I recommend using moisturiser to help your skin and also massaging to help healing and avoid scar tissue. I have learnt that surgeons often don't focus much on after care, so it would be good to follow other people's experience on this forum and whatever else you can find out. If you're not sure, you could Google it. I was given printed pages before my surgery that said it definitely helps to massage the chest area after surgery.",

I wish you the best in finding treatment that works for you. I have felt less sore since I worked out that rather than putting a little cushion between me and the seat belt in the car, it feels better to have the cushion on my side to make the seat belt stick out and not touch my chest.",
