Now, I'm not going to lie, the first year was rough but it more emotionally draining than anything physical (xanax helped!!!). I had surgery first, fertility treatments, chemo, then radiation. My doctor told me I needed chemo for three reasons: my age, the size of my tumor (4 cm), and the aggressiveness of my tumor (Grade 3). I handled chemo relatively well. I was in fairly good shape, had no other medical issues, and was young. I also handled fertility treatments and radiation well. I was also lucky that I had no node involvement. While none of it was fun, it was totally doable. I'm very sorry you have to go through this. :( I chose a lumpectomy with radiation for a few reasons. One, I was really attached to my breasts despite the fact that they were clearly trying to kill me...lol. Seriously, though, I liked them. They weren't too large or too small. Two, I didn't want to lose feeling in my breasts. Three, the outcome was the same with lumpectomy with radiation as it was with mastectomy. Four, I didn't have the time to take from work for the recovery it would have taken for the mastectomy. I mean, I would have taken the time if I had to but financially it would have been much more difficult. Five, once they are gone they are gone...as opposed to a mastectomy which I can always have at a later date should circumstances change. Six, recovery. After everything I was going through, I wanted an easier option. A lumpectomy was a piece of cake. A Mastectomy is so much more involved...more time, more appointments, more pain, more help, more money. I don't regret my decision. I just have a slight indent in my left breast from where the tumor was and my scars are barely noticeable. I'm happy with my decision and the results. Whatever you decide or whatever your options are, it will be the right decision for you. Good luck on your journey.",

As to the statistics...I defy the odds.  Less than 4% of women under forty get breast cancer and I got it (36 yrs old at diagnosis).  I had less than 1% chance of being BRCA 2 positive after my BRCA 1 came up negative and I got it.  I had less than .05% chance of being first generation BRCA 2 positive and I got it.  Therefore, 18% chance is huge to me...LOLOL.  I remember my genetic counselor told me not even to get the BART test after my BRCA 1 came up negative because the chance I was BRCA 2 was so incredibly small.  Only because my insurance paid for it did I get that test.  She actually told me that my situation changed how she dealt with her other patients.  She now recommends every get the BART test if their insurance can cover it no matter how small the statistic. I had a lumpectomy before my genetic testing came back so I only had a lumpectomy.  My doctor told me even with the gene, the statistics for survival were about the same for lumpectomy vs mastectomy.  Although a lumpectomy does have a slightly higher percentage of recurrence (which, of course, means I'll get it ). Even if I had known I had the gene, I'm not sure I would have opted for a mastectomy.  Because, like you, the drains scare me.  And not having feeling in my breasts would scare me.   I love my boobs...even though they are clearly trying to kill me.  It's like an abusive relationship.  ",

I have to say nothing was as bad as I had feared.  I virtually had no pain through this entire process...and I had a lumpectomy, node removal, port installation, chemo, radiation, fertility treatments, etc.  I never had to use my vicodin prescription.  Of course, I didn't have to have a masectomy, either.  But everything was very manageable.  The only thing I semi-relied on was xanex.  I was so TERRIFIED in the beginning that xanex (and some ativan) helped me sleep, show up for chemo, and do the surgeries...lol. Being scared to death is normal.  I would look into some anti-anxiety meds (and before my diagnosis I was too scared to take any kind of medicine...my how things change).  It really does help in the beginning.  And the beginning of this journey is the absolute WORST part.  It really does get better.  Good luck!",

I suppose the lucky thing about having grade 3 is that it responds well to chemo.  It's the small things that make me happy.  Ha!",

In my case, my tumor died...so it filled with blood making it large enough for me to detect it.  When my doctor biopsied it, he originally thought it was a papilloma since the needle filled with blood which mimiced a papilloma. So, did my immune system recognize the cancer cells later and destroy them?  I had bronchitis months before and drank a ton of green/white tea along with taking mega doses of Vit C/D, etc.  So was it my immune system or did I take something that killed them?  Because I didn't have the lump then.  Did anyone have a dead tumor when they were diagnosed like I did?  Because, if it didn't get that big, it could have spread before I knew it.  I was 36 with no family history...and the kind I have is aggressive. I also have the breast cancer gene (BRCA 2) and my onco dx score was high.  But why did my body kill the tumor given all my risk factors?  I ended up having 4 treatments of chemo as a preventative.   Obviously, chemo didn't kill it.  I also wondered why I need radiation if the chemo went all over my body.  Wouldn't the chemo have targeted the cells?  They say secondary cancers are common after one has cancer...because cells know how to mutate.  But if I had the gene, didn't it know how to mutate all along, in which case is chemo effective at all?  Because even if it kills everything, my cells already know how to mutate.",

Ha! Mine was a grade 3.  They told me the younger you are, the higher the grade.  Usually. But everyone has given you great advice.  The worst thing about chemo was the dread prior to it.  The anticipation of the unknown was so much worse than the actuality of it all.  And there are perks...I got a fabulous wig and can walk out the door in 20 minutes flat.  With nothing to shave or blow dry, I feel like a man.  LOL!  I'm going to miss that when my hair gets longer.  And my wig doesn't react to the humidity unlike my real hair.  I love it!  Although, in the beginning, I did get slight headaches from the tightness of it.  That eventually went away. I also went through fertility treatment since I didn't have children and didn't know if I'd get my period back.  Let me know if I can help you. I wish you much love/support/good vibrations on this journey.  *hugs* ",

However, considering they have breast cancer genes out there that they haven't identified, whether you had/have the BRCA gene or not, I'd think about having them removed. Heck I have the gene and my parents tested negative.  So I have no family history.  When I tested negative to the BRCA 1 gene, they told me I didn't even need the BART test.  I only did that because my insurance paid for it.  I'm  glad I did.  I would have kept my ovaries and may have been lethal.",

Good news was that something it my body killed it or starved it...lol. It's normal to be scared.  After the aspiration, they sent me down the hall for a bilateral mammogram.  I practically ran out of the doctor's office imagining the worst.  Everyone here knows how scared you are.  It's a terrible state of mind to be in.  I'm sorry you have to go through this. It may just be a papilloma which wouldn't be that bad in the grand scheme of things.  I know it's a small comfort.",

My attacks also come right before bed time, if I wake up in the middle of the night, or from a situation (MRI, surgury, etc). I used to take xanax just to get me to chemo, and then they included Ativan in my chemo cocktail.  I was bad.  LOL  In my opinion, you do what works and what you need.  Period.
