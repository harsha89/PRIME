My sister was diagnosed with breast cancer when she was 40 (negative for the gene testing) and I am 36. After ultrasound they find an lesion with ill defined borders and size measuring 1.3 x 0.8 x 0.9 . I'll have a biopsy with a needle next tuesday and I am so worried. Does anybody have any similar experience. Any comment is appreciated.Thanks a lot. Log in to post a reply",
