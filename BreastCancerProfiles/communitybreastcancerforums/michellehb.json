I'm just not going to fret about not getting rads - I should be grateful my rad onc is not going overboard and trust his advice. It was so long ago the memories are vague, but I do remember radiation was no picnic. I had it to my whole chest too with stage 1. And they took out my spleen as a 'precaution' which has posed its own issues. Good thing for kids today these things are no longer the standard protocol. On a light note, my husband is from Southern Indiana. We still own his family home down in Bedford, so we get there quite a bit. It's lovely country. Glad you are in good hands with IU.",

My BC was also likely caused by my radiation for Hodgkins at 13 yrs old, 33 years ago. I was told the same, not a candidate for radiation, so I did the double mastectomy even though my BC was only in 1 breast. My dx (4/14/2009) was IDC, 2cm, Stage 2a, Grade 3, 2/14 nodes, ER+/PR+/HER2-. I did 4 cycles of Cytoxan/Adriamycin (started 6/25/2009), and now doing 4 cycles of Taxol, and possibly Avastin on a clinical trial. My radiological onc said radiation is a gray area. If your nodes were negative, then no question, no radiation. With 1-3 positive nodes there's research that suggests there is benefit with more radiation. But there's also risk, my radiological onc says, with increased chance of lymphadema and tiercery cancers, like leukemia. Since I only had a small amount of cancer in those 2 nodes, he's leaning toward no radiation. If you google, you can find the stats, which scares me about not getting it, though can't say I'd look forward to the radiation again.",

My head is swimming too. My breast surgeon and oncs told me I need to be aggressive with + nodes and grade 3. I got 2 opionions, and 2 quotes on recurrence if I did nothing - 30 and 52 pct. Both are too high. With chemo of ACT +  tamoxofen, it's more like 20 pct. I think adding radiation knocks off a few more points, but not much. Not as good as my Hodgkins odds, but something I got to live with it. One of my issues is that I had the radiation at such a young age. Chemo was also not part of the protocol at the time, so the radiation dosage was big. I have to figure that I wouldn't have gotten BC w/out radiation. My radiation onc put it into perspective for me, though. He told me Hodgkins used to be very deadly before deep penetrating radiation was invented. It bought me the 33 years, and now I will fight again! Thank god for all the advances with BC that our odds are good. My sis is unfortunately battling ovarian cancer where the outlook is grim. And get the irony, she has the BRAC1 gene, and I do not. You can' tell me radiation wasn't a factor here! I'm sorry that you are not so happy with your oncs. I'm being treated at Northwestern in Chicago and can give you other names if it's anywhere near you.  It's really nice to have someone to share with - thanks for writing back.",

In my case, also no history of BC in the family, but my sister, who I recently lost, had ovarian cancer. In my case I was negative, but here's the irony, both sisters got the gene. If families are small sometimes it just doesn't show up. I found the advice quite helpful, especially since it factors into decisions I have to make, like whether I need to remove my ovaries.",
