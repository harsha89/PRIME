I'm probably going to skip the olive oil -- I like to cook with olive oil, but I don't really want to smell like it, you know?  So since I'm going to have to buy something, I'm trying to pick the \"best\" one, but of course there's no data comparing jojoba oil to avocado oil or whatever. So I'm coming to the experts! Did anybody use plain old oils during rads?  What kind?  Did it seem to work?  Thanks so much! Drea Dx 6/24/2008, IDC, <1cm, Stage I, Grade 2, 0/1 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I rummaged thru my bathroom and discovered unfinished bottles of apricot kernel oil, and sweet almond oil with vitamin E.  There's not much left of either, but enough to get me started.  I think I'll start with those and see how I like them, then if not in love with either, I'll buy some other sort.  Best, Drea",

There's actually a local place that specializes in wigs for cancer patients that seems very cool... I'm trying to decide if I can deal with at least trying to go there.  One issue is that they have a web site, and though they have many of the wigs I've been thinking about, they are like $100 (or more) more expensive then prices I've seen online.  And I'm afraid I would feel too guilty going there, taking up their time, getting their advice, choosing something and then saying \"Thanks, I'll think about it\" and coming right home to order off the internet!  Normally I am all about supporting local businesses.  If it was a price difference of 20-40 dollars I would just consider it a fee for the personal service and do it... but $100-140?  Sigh.  Well, I will let you know what happens... I can't thank you enough for all the advice & input though!  More reviews welcome, of course! Take care, Drea",

      "Content": "Drea wrote: (Cross-posted to the YSC boards... sorry!) So I found out on 8/7 that my Oncotype DX score is 25 -- not \"high\" but high enough in my (and my onc's) mind to justify chemo.  I'm 90% sure I'll be starting Taxotere/Cytoxan on 8/21 -- have an appt on 8/14 to hash out the details.  This evening, I am freaking out abou the wig thing, spending way too much energy on it.  No doubt to distract myself/give myself the illusion of control. But, I'm hoping I can impose on you all yet again to help me figure this out. Although I think I will go bare or use hats/bandanas most of the time, I feel that I need to have a decent wig to wear to clinicals (nursing student) and possibly work (I work in registration at a hospital -- often the \"first face\" a patient/visitor sees). Yet I am totally unnerved by the idea of going to a wig place and trying to pick something out with a well-meaning salesperson helping me. I have a vision of trying to be polite as one big-hair poufy monstrosity after another is foisted upon me, my facade of dealing-so-well-with-all-of-this slowly crumbling. Also, my real hair is very thick, I can't figure how a wig is going to look anything but silly on me before baldness. I would really like to just buy something on the internet like a normal antisocial Gen-X'er and be done with it. I have managed to figure out that I want a monofilament, synthetic wig, and that I don't want to pay more than $300 or so. I even think I'm buying it from www.wigs.md because they have one of the better return policies. When it comes to actually picking an actual specific wig.... I'm going round in circles. If you are a wig-wearer (or even wig-owner-who-decided-wigs-aren't-for-her), and especially if you have a mono synthetic, could you please tell me: 1. The brand & model of your wig 2. What you think of its quality, passability-as-real, feel, etc. I think that if I heard that a particular brand seemed to make most people happy/sad, or if a particular model pops up a few times with good reviews, or if everyone says \"Feh on Henry Margu,\" or something, that will maybe make my decision a bit easier? I'm hoping at least. Thank you all! Best, Drea Dx 6/24/2008, IDC, <1cm, Stage I, Grade 2, 0/1 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Juggling the meds is hard and confusing, because it is difficult to know what causes what, and everyone does react uniquely to meds and combinations of meds.  Everyone is chalking up all my severe bone pain to the Neulasta, but I \"hear\" that it may be the Taxotere, too -- I'm switching to Neupogen this cycle to see if that improves things, but if doesn't, I'll probably never know what's to blame... frustrating.
