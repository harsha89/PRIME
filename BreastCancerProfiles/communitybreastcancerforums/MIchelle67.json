I haven't started chemo yet - just healing from lump./snb last week - but meet my onc Jan. 20 and know I'll be doing some kind of chemo since I'm triple negative.  My hair is super striaght and baby fine, but tough (I've been coloring it for a looong time) and grows fast, and I'm wondering if hair type has anything to do with it not coming back? I'm scared that I'll be one of the few who never regrows hair after chemo since its fine. Anyone else have my hair type and have trouble? My hairdresser (who's also a great friend) said she thinks the Penguin Cold Caps may not work for me because of my hair texture, so this has me worried that I'll have all kinds of hair issues forever. Any insight is much appreciated - and I love all the encouraging pics and stories.",

I had an wire/US-guided excisional biospy last week and am healing nicely. It wasn't as bad as I thought it might be - I know this isn't exactly the same as what you have scheduled, but it is similar, so I hope this takes an edge off.  :) Two days ago, I got a dx of IDC and am going in for a second surgery - lumpectomy and snb - on Dec. 21, so I know how the waiting can be hard. I wish, whenever we each wanted, we could all hang out somewhere in the real world to pass this time a little easier -- it would be great to be able to twitch our noses like Samantha from \"Betwitched\" and all be in some great actual place. I'm thinking a spa resort on a tropical island! I send you positive, healing vibes for an amazing outcome and speedy recovery. Michelle",

I went for the dx bloodwork - three big vials drawn - and then treated myself (after the 12-gr bloodwork fast) to a bagel and good coffee! :) Them I went & had my hair done. I know it sounds stupid, but I actually waited until I found out that I probably won't need chemo (my BS said that, but I know it could change) to make an appt. My hairdresser was the first person I've seen face-to-face since my dx, other than my DH and two daughters. And I think this was meant to be - she has multiple sclerosis and a host of other chronic health issues, & although she's not had bc, it was so great to spend a couple of hours with her. Due to her health, she works out of her home, so it was just the two of us while we updated my punk-rock 'do (I go platinum with black streaks - always been a renegade!)  and we talked the whole time about how one phone call can change your life - and how that news doesn't have to be asbad as it first seems. She hugged me when I left and told me to call her anytimefor support - it wasalmost like hangng out with one of you guys & I felt better, tho' we both got teary. The last night my DH and I took our girls to a scheduled gingerbread house decorating party at my 6 yr.old's school. I thought I'd lose it and have to go hide, but it actually made me feel better, and I *didn't* think about it for an hour! We came home and watched old movies til 10pm and I actually slept for 8+ hours.  I think I will take the advice for the pharaceiutical assistance, though, just in case. I know the road ahead isn't going to stay so smooth. I cannot say how much I am grateful for you girls - I need to know there is that understanding out there, and positive stories. I send you all big hugs, happy tears and wishes for a fabulous weekend! :) Michelle",

Stomach upset, achy and really tired. Is this stress - just the normal \"just found out\" reaction? I spent yesterday obsessing about the 5% of my tumor that's still in my breast since the ex. biospy last Tuesday - I keep thinking about it in there, cut and dispersing evil cells all through me. I know my mind is making me nuts --- and maybe sick too? How long does mets take? So glad its Friday so I can have a couple of days with my DH and kids around me. I work from home (I'm a writer) so I've been alone all day the last two days and my imagination (usually a good thing) is not helping me.
