She is from the old school where you trusted everything the Dr said but you have to ask. Its so scary when they tell you they can maybe mantain your cancer but cant cure it. I have a 6 year old that I have adopted and I need to be here for her.",

Five years from first mastectomy I had my left brease removed because of family history. Very strong family history. I was clear for 6 weeks short of 11 years when I found a large lump under left arm. Its in lymphatic system under both arms, sternum, ribs and small spot on lung. My tumor markers were 238 before starting treatment. I will have another one this Thursday. I took 12 weeks of Taxol and Herceptin and I am now on Femara for 2 weeks. Im not sure why my Dr took me off Herceptin after only 12 weeks. Has anyone else had so few treatments of Herceptin? Dx 6/20/2008, 6cm+, Stage IV, Grade 3, 1/7 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
