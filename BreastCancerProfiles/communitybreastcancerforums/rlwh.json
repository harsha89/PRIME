So tired of people giving me that \"I'm dead already look.\" I do more comforting of others than anything: go figure. I am feeling the need to just hole up in my house and lock the door.  My church family are really good visitors, and I don't want any after that biopsy. My house is a mess, and I am not in the mood to clean. I just want to be left alone.  Just want to cry today. Hate this. So sad.

I suspect the doctor doing the actual biopsy was an intern, but she was fantastic. The older doctor occasionally gave her advice quietly, such as move over here. She let me hear the sound the needle would make when it would clip the tisssue before she started. Honestly, I felt no pain whatsoever during the whole procedure. The two doctors carried on pleasant conversation about all of our children the entire time they were working on me. They were fantastic. I just can't get over how easy it was. The Lidocaine didn't even burn going in. I go to Vanderbilt: everyone there is fantastic. Oh, by the way, the doctor that did my biopsy looked like the Asian female doctor on Gray's Anatomy. I had to tell her. She laughed, and said, \"Everybody tells me that.\" She was so pretty, and so kind. After, my \"cheer squad\" and I went out to  Cracker Barrel to eat, and I even felt like shopping a little while. I went to church tonight: I always go to Wed. night Bible study, and I felt like it so I went. All in all, not a bad day. Still awaiting results. Dr. Armstrong (Gray's Anatomy chick) did this song and dance about how it could be this, that, yata, yata, and not cancer.  I just looked at her and kindly asked her to not give me false hope because the radiologist who discovered the lump and the NP at Vandy had already said it was most definitely cancer.  I said it as nicely as I could; I know she was trying to be kind, but I know.  Oh, by the way, my Mom finally got the nerve to say the C word today. Totally amazing. It is what it is. I'm a fighter. I'm a survivor. But I sure need you guys. You are awesome.  Carla, keep me posted about your results. We all have to hang in there.

I put on this brave face for my parents, and I feel pretty brave during the day. However, at night, I have anxiety and cry.  I guess that is all just part of it. I will beat this. I have to, and it is doable.  Still, I am so depressed. My Cymbalta has been upped from 60mg to 90mg.  My rheumatologist upped the Cymbalta for RA pain before I found out about BC. Tonight I was doing some reading and found out you can not take SSRIs while taking Tamoxifen, and I think you have to take Tamoxifen first before other endocrine therapy.  I think you can take Celexa or Effexor and there is no danger of their interference with the effectiveness of Tamoxifen. I have taken Celexa before, but was changed to Cymbalta due to anxiety and panic attacks.  Also, my rheumatologist likes the Cymbalta for pain relief of arthritis, but I would rather be alive in pain than dead from recurrance of BC.  I wil have to have some antidepressant or will not be able to function because depression is chronic as is anxiety, but managed by meds.  I feel so overwhelmed by all of the decisions. I have noticed something about depression though. It is worse at night and when I am tired.  I will just have to add the antidepressant question to my list of questions that I need to ask. Most of my questions have been answered, but I wish you guys could have heard the nurse explain how to use this numbing creme to prepare for dye to be put in my breast for sentinel node biopsy. She explained it so fast that I don't even think she took a breath. It had to be near the end of her shift. I am going to have to ask a few questions concerning that.  She said two inches out from the nipple. Does that mean the \"nipple\" or does that mean the areola?  If it wasn't so aggravating, it would be comical. Come to think about it, it was comical. I had to keep telling her to slow down because she was having me write down the instructions in my own words so I could repeat them back to her. There are words for women like her, but my Mama doesn't allow me to use those words. hahaha!!!! Ronda",

Sometimes I cry at night any way. I only sleep for about 4 hours at a time, then wake up and can't go back to sleep, and I am taking muscle relaxers to go to sleep. So hard. Well, I know you guys are dying to know the specifics. Here is all I know. I have lobular carcinoma, grade 1, low proliferative rate.  I don't know if it is insitu or invasive, probably invasive, but I don't know. The mammogram just looks so ugly. The cancer is both estrogen and progesterone recepeptive. I think I already told you guys that the tumor is 1.2 x .9 Cm.  I go for an MRI on Thursday of this week and also see the surgeon at Vanderbilt, a Dr. Mark Kelly. For bad news, I guess that was good news. I know when I heard it was grade 1 I immediately praised God out loud while I was still on the phone with the nurse. I was just so thankful.  This whole business is still crappy, but I am pulling myself together and getting ready to fight like I have never fought before. I hate the phrase \"Fight like a girl\". I prefer fighting like a Mama Grizzley Bear.  As far as I know, I will be having a lumpectomy, unless Dr. Kelly changes his mind after the MRI. I don't much think he will. I will be having at least radiation, possibly chemo. I don't know what stage it is.  Do you find that out after surgery? Ronda",

About the time she had her surgery for O cancer, I left my first husband and moved in with her. I am now remarried to a wonderful man who is the love of my life and adores my children and claims the grandchildren as his own.  My younger daughter (26) introduces him as her step-dad and both my children, marrried women, love him dearly. I helped, along with my parents and her husband, to care for  my sister during her illness. She lived 6 yrs past dx, 5 and one half longer than the doctors thought she would. Five of those years were wonderful. Our family made the most of the extra time that God gave us with Sandy. We traveled, enjoyed holidays together, and Sandy often went to the movies with me and my husband, who she considered her \"brother\".  When she passed, our entire family was encircling her bed and telling her wonderful stories about her life. It is said hearing is the last sense to go. We also sang \"Blue Skies and Rainbows\" to her. It was her favorite hymn. She went to be with Jesus while holding her husband's hand and my daughter, Blair's, hand. Blair was holding our Mother's hand. Mama could not bear to hold Sandy's. I was holding Sandy's little foot. I was at the bottom of the hosp. bed.   She went as peacefully as possible, but, yes, it haunts me.   But, I know where she is. When I lost her, I was going through a divorce and had to go to work. When I lost her, I lost, not only my sister, but my best friend. Throughout the years I have been a teacher and a mental health professional.  So  yes, I am a nurturer; it is who I am and what makes me who I am.  However, I also recognize when someone needs therapy, and, at this point, I don't because I am coping too well with the situation.   When my first marriage was breaking up, I sought counsel because I needed it.  Now I don't.  I do not have characteristics of unmanaged depression (overeatting, undereatting, oversleeping, undersleeping, lapse in hygiene, lack of interest in hobbies and daily activities, etc.)  Believe it or not, these forums are very much like group therapy, and that is why I chose to participate in them.  At this point in time, this is all I need.  Also, I have an excellent support system. My younger daughter is a minister's wife and a very good listener. I can talk to her and she doesn't judge me; she is a very good listener and encourager. Also, my husband is the best man listener I have ever met in my entire life, except maybe for my Daddy, who is still alive along with my Mom, by the way.  My husband lets me talk and doesn't  try to solve problems; he doesn't throw me a pity party either. He is an encourager, a soulmate, and my best friend in life.  I also have a best friend whose Mom died with BC.  Also, I am very spiritual and pray a lot.  Believe me, no one listens better than our Heavenly Father. Thank you for your suggestion, and you have not offended me. My dosage of Cymalta has been increased and anxiety meds have been added.  Considering the situation, I really don't think anyone could be doing any better. I am always worse at night, especially if I try to not take my anxiety meds, and I had during that post.  I do, however, plan to continue monitoring my status, and if my husband or one of my doctors suggest that I need to talk to someone, I will consider it.  However, it is very hard for someone in mental health to go for mental health treatment because they tend to know what is going to be said, but believe me, I am as fine as anyone with BC can be.  Can any of us be totally OK?  If we were, then we really would be crazy.  Right now, I am just looking forward to the weekend because then my MRI and meeting that are Thursday will be over, and my older daughter Brooke is coming to see us this weekend. I am looking forward to seeing our grandson. He is three. We saw our granddaughter (2) the day of my appt with the NP. Also, I am considering writing a book. I think it will be very cathartic, even if it doesn't get published. But, who knows, maybe it just will. There are quite a lot of us out here, and I think we would buy it.  Have a great night, or morning, depends on when you read this.  Unfortunately, I like to burn the candle at both ends.  Hugggggs Ronda",

The 30 minutes was over before I knew it. I met with the surgeon and had pre-op tests done (CBC, EKG, and chest x-ray). I also talked with nurse about pre-op instructions and talked with another nurse about anesthesia. OK, now for the staging results.  I did not think they could tell you the stage until after surgery, but Dr. Kelly said he is 90% accurate from MRIs.  I have invasive lobular carcinoma, Stage 1, grade 1, receptive to both estrogen and progesterone (85% to each).  He gave me two options: lumpectomy and radiation or mastectomy.  I listened to the pros and cons of each and chose lumpectomy and radiation.  My surgery date has not been set yet but should be late November or very early December. I will be moving to another forum for my dx. Thank you everyone, but going to lobular carcinoma forum.  May pop back from time to time  to see if I can encourage others and \"hold their hand\" like you guys did mine.

Due to having started it late, and starting with twilight but ending up giving me general anesthetic, they kept me overnight. Minimal pain but arm swelling and nauseated.  Still, all in all, I am in pretty good shape. I had surgery on Friday and felt well enough to go to church Sunday night and out to dinner with friends after. I am going to be fine because I am one tough old bird. Well, let's skip the old. I refuse to feel old, but I do plan on getting very old, just not looking it or acting it. haha!! Ronda",

I have already been informed that the tumor is cancer because of various characteristics including uneven edges of mass. It is small 1.2 cm by .9, and Mary, my nurse practitioner thinks I will be having a lumpectomy with radiation and possible chemo. Vanderbilt has already scheduled my appt with a surgeon. I am so scared and so sad. My sister died of ovarian cancer a little over 2 years ago, and I am my parents' last living child. My mom can't even say the word cancer. My blood pressure is out the roof, but I am trying to practice relaxation techniques and am under Dr's care for this.  I so desperately needed this place to talk to people who know what I am going through. Thank you for being here. I know I will get through this with God's help and my support system. However, some days all I do is cry. It is just so recent. I still am having a hard time wrapping my head around this, but I am doing all I can to educate myself so I can make good decisions. Again thank you, and please pray for me.

Now I feel like they feel like they are losing me, but I am no where near that. I feel very positive about beating this due to it being found so early. It is so crazy though. I keep telling them I am going to be all right, and they keep telling me I am going to be all right so we are all comforting each other. My family loves each other so much that it almost hurts. Can you love too much? Other than God, family is all of our priority. My husband is devastated. We have only been married 4 years this past June. He hasn't shed one tear. I keep telling him that it is ok to cry if he needs to, but he says he is fine but feels like it but he is fine.",

Night is so hard.  Antidepressants won't do anything for true despair, and that is where I am. My parents seem to be taking this so well that is almost frightening. I am wondering if they realize the seriousness of this. Surely they do since they lost my sister to ovarian cancer.  My mom still is so concerned about when we are going to do family Thanksgiving, which is supposed to be at my house. Finally I just told her Saturday after Thanksgiving, which seems to fit when some extended family can come.  Neither of my children will be coming for Thanksgiving. This will be the first one I have not had them with me for that holiday.  Oh, well.  However, this coming weekend, my older daughter is coming for a visit. I haven't seen her since late June.  The younger one came for my first appt. with the NP.  I am blessed with precious adult children, 2 sweet grandchildren, and 2 fine sons-in-law, and both my parents are still alive. I guess for a 54 year old that is pretty good, even if she does have BC. I keep telling myself to count my blessings. Night all.",
