I was on BCPs to help control my awful periods from the time I was 16 until 38, which was when I had my hyst. I was only off of them when I was pregnant) I have not been on any hormones since my hyst, since I still have 1 ovary. I feel like there is a good chance that if there is a genetic component here that I would have inherited it from my grandmother as I take after her in every other way. People always wonder why I don't look like my parents and I tell them I skipped a generation and took after my nana instead. I'm a spitting image of her. I wish my mom had told me sooner about our risk, but she's not exactly proactive in her own health. She'd rather not know anything and doesn't get checked. I respect her decision, but it's not for me. I'd rather know, and know early for the best possible chances. Now I am terrified because I'm wondering if I should have had frequent monitoring, knowing that I had very dense breasts and couldn't realistically self exam.",

I should be very happy this scan was clean, but I would have felt better if the lump showed up and looked benign, as opposed to not showing up at all. After all, my breast surgeon found it on her ultrasound! Why is it hiding on the MRI? Is it because it says my breasts are heterogenously dense and there is moderate background enhancement? The radiologist recommended yearly screening for malignancy and that 3D mammogram was warranted. I was given a Birads 2. I still have to follow up with the surgeon and see what her recommendations are, but I expect she will just want to recheck in 6 months. She told me that if it got bigger she would definitely remove it no matter what. I am just bumed as I was hoping for more answers, not more questions... :/",

My insurance doesn't want to cover breast MRI or genetic testing unless I already am diagnosed. It is so confusing and frustrating.

I want to believe this is a good sign but unfortunately I know of too many cases where it was later found on MRI or biopsy to be cancer. I also know even small lumps can be aggressive. I think for my own peace of mind I have to pursue this. I am more worried about leaving it be and having a possible cancer grow than if I were to find out right now. I will post my U/S results and Mammogram notes, but as I said, neither one found the lump. However, as I already knew (and why I wanted MRI in the first place) my breasts are EXTREMELY dense. I really hope my doctor will order it and that my insurance will cover it now that I've done the other standard testing. U/S: HX: UNSPECIFIEDLUM IN RT BREAST UIQ CLINICAL INDICATION: 41-year-old female with right breast lump FINDINGS: Sonographic evaluation in the areas of palpable concern at 2:00 and 4:00 in the right breast as directed by the patient was performed. No discrete solid or cystic mass is seen by ultrasound. The patient has not had prior mammography. Diagnostic mammography is recommended at this time. IMPRESSION: No solid or cystic mass seen to account for the areas of palpable concern in the right breast. Given that the patient has not had prior mammography, diagnostic mammography is recommended at this time. Mammo: HX: LUMP IN RT BREAST UPPER INNER QUADRANT This study was interpreted with computer aided detection software iCAD version 8.1 INDICATION: Right breast lump COMPARISON: Baseline mammogram TECHNIQUE: MLO and CC views of both breasts.Coned compression of the right breast in MLO projection and exaggerated axillary cc view of the right breast BREAST COMPOSITION: The breasts are extremely dense, which lowers the sensitivity of mammography. FINDINGS: There are no suspicious masses or calcifications, and no increasing asymmetries or architectural distortion. There is no correlate to the palpable finding in the upper inner right breast. IMPRESSION: No mammographic evidence of malignancy. RECOMMENDATION: Annual screening mammography. The palpable mass should be managed on its clinical merits since there is a false-negative rate with imaging. BI-RADS: 1 Negative  ",

I'm glad we will soon know for sure what this lump is. I still want an MRI in the hopes to fully evaluate both breasts and make sure nothing else is \"lurking in there\" but will cross that bridge later. I also like your suggestion about color genomics, light1candle, and would really like to do this but unfortunately it will be some time before I could afford it.",

She found the lump and marked an \"x\" on my breast with permanent marker. I noticed it was not on the spot where I was feeling the lump, but didn't think too much into it because I figured it was positional, and that she had marked it when I was laying down. (Normally when I felt the lump I was standing in the shower or sitting.) She told me it was 1.5 cm and looked good because it had rounded borders. She said it was likely benign and that she recommended checking it again in 6 months, and that if anything changed between now and then, she could surgically remove it. I asked her for a breast MRI and she said she'd order it. Well, I went home that night a bit unsettled. She was wonderful and I liked her, but I was not comfortable waiting 6 months on this, whether the lump \"looked benign\" or not. There was also that matter of where she drew the \"x.\" So I examined the mark myself, and sure enough I felt a lump there. It felt \"tough\" but not as hard as the other lump I was feeling. So it was definitely not the same lump. I felt around more and sure enough, I felt the other lump (which feels like a hard BB) further up. So there are definitely 2 distinct lumps. I called the office back the next day and told the nurse what happened and that I'd thought it over, and I wasn't comfortable waiting 6 months. She told me my MRI was approved, so now I'm just waiting for scheduling. I'm somewhat relieved, because even though I've felt the lumps in my right breast, I have been concerned about symptoms in my left also, so this should tell me if anything is going on in that one too. At least I'm hoping the MRI is sensitive enough. I'll update when I have it and what I find out. Please keep me in your thoughts. oh, yeah, and I forgot to ask her about a genetic counselor. We talked a bit about genetic testing because she said my history as concerning and that I SHOULD be tested, but insurance is a nightmare. I got the impression I didn't have any options in that area.",

I will ask to put in touch with a genetic testing counselor. @mustlovepoodles: I am disabled from MS and have Medicare & Medicaid which complicates matters. I'm not sure if it the case with all genetic testing, but I looked into myriad and they did not offer financial assistance to those who have my insurance. I will look into the one you suggested though, or maybe speaking to a counselor as Lula suggested will point me in the right direction. @Michelle_in_cornland: I understand your suggestion and the reasoning behind it. It could make detection a lot easier and also be a prophylactic solution. However, my breasts are actually small and dense. I believe in order to remove the density it would remove my entire breast and I would not want to do that unless it is found that my lump is indeed cancerous. I noticed you deleted a comment. May I ask why? I hope it wasn't because you second guessed a comment. Thank you, everyone. I truly appreciate everyone who has taken the time to read my story and help see me through this difficult time. I got my appoinment for the breast surgeon. It is May 21. Seems so long! I will be anxiously awaiting that date, but will update everyone. <3",
