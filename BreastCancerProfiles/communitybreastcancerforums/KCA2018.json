I had my bilateral lumpectomy and 1 lymph node removal on May 22nd. Just call me 3 scars or scar cubed! After a rough go after the anesthesia wore off, I ended up going to immediate care the next day for fluids and I feel sooo much better now! I learned I do have bad reactions to anesthesia now and hoping I wont have to go thru any more surgeries! Crossing Fingers! Take care! ",
