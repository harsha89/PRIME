In September 2014 my Gyno sent me for an bilateral diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound on my right breast, the results came back B9 with a BIRADS of 1/ scattered fibroglandular densities. I guess with my mom being diagnosed at 56 (Stage 1, she opted for a mastectomy) and REALLY REALLY high anxiety i started to second guess my B9 results. After a month of constant breast checking (which resulted in painful arms and neck) and possibly some swollen tissue I then went back to my Gyno who suggested i get an ABUS screening ultrasound of my entire breasts to give me peace of mind. Well i just got my results and they came back INCONCLUSIVE! I AM IN FULL BLOWN PANIC MODE. \"In the left breast 4 o\"clock axis, apprx 3.8 cm from the nipple, seen only on the left lateral projection, is a questionable sub centimeter hypo echoic lesion versus artifact. A direct hand held left breast second look ultrasound is recommended.\" Can anyone give me some insight into what this means in real person talk? I am terrified and they can't do my ultrasound until monday (02/16) and I am not even sure they will give me my results when the ultrasound is finished since my Gyno refuses to ask for a STAT reading. Please advise. I'm really upset. Log in to post a reply",

About four years ago I had a litany of testing done due to some lumps that ended up being nothing. Now I have noticed that since my milk came in a week ago I have a lump that\u2019s at least doubled in size! I\u2019m really scared. It feels rubbery but I can\u2019t tell anything else other than when my milk fills I can feel it right through my skin. I\u2019m terrified it\u2019s advanced cancer. I have my two week post op for my c section on Tuesday so I\u2019ll mention it to my OB but I don\u2019t know if this is typical for breast changes during lactating or if I should start to prepare myself. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m a mess. The lump doesn\u2019t hurt which I know I\u2019ve read is never good. Log in to post a reply",
