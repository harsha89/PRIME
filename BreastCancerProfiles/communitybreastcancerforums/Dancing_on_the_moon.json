First off I am 24(female) and I know that changes the dynamic a lot according to the doctors. So 3-4 years ago I started a new birth control. Within the month of being put on the birth control (lo Orval) my LEFT breast swelled up. It became red (angry), it was itchy, tender, and painful (it hurt so bad to wear a bra). Within the month that birth control landed me in the ER due to some serious side effects. I brought up my breast and it was examined. I was told that I was \"allergic to estrogen based birth control\" and that my breast would return to normal within a few weeks. During this time we moved across the country and I got a new provider. so 3 months from the start of all of this my breast was still that bad. I saw a general practitioner (PCM) at my new location. She examined my breast and ordered an ultrasound. I was told that the birth control \"likely activated some cyst\" and I had fibro cystic breast. I was told that my breast would return to normal when the birth control got out of my system and I would more than likely always deal with this and the pain and \"lumps\" would come and go with my cycle. So later my breast returned to normal (about 8 months from the start of things). Fast forward a little and I can feel a lump on the bottom side of my left breast. it is tender and about the size (or smaller) than a pea. Fast forward about a year and a half and I got pregnant and had my baby. Breast feeding off my left breast was AGONY. my right breast was painful but not \"bring tears to my eyes I can't do this\" painful. My left breast barely produced milk (Lactation consultant said this was normal). I could get 6-8oz out of my right and I would be lucky to get 2oz from my left. I stopped breast feeding. Fast forward to last year. My lump in my left breast seemed to be bigger (almost dime sized). So I had new(better) insurance and I was in a new location so at my gyno visit I brought it up and my past problems, the pain and tenderness, and if we could do something to drain or remove the cyst. She felt my lump, said it was a cyst, was fairly rude to me. Emphasis on rude. and said she would send a referral out for a mammo and US. A week goes by and I call up to her office and to make a long story short after 4 weeks they didn't and wouldn't refer me out (This was November of 2017). In Feb of 2017 the lump area was so painful and I started having a few droplets a day of clear discharge. and it seemed like it is getting bigger still. So I go to a different doctor (a general practitioner). She does an exam and feels a \"spot\" in the 2 o'clock area (that i didn't know was there) and she also confirmed she felt the spot where i was complaining. She sent me off immediately for a mammo and US. The results showed ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. The mammo noted that I had \"extremely dense\" breast tissue. That was it. So i followed up and she said that I had nothing to worry about and as for the pain to manage it with over the counter noninflammatory and compresses. Fast forward to Aug 2018. The 2 oclock spot that the doc felt is horribly painful and I can feel a lump/spot. I'm still leaking about 10 droplets of clear discharge. And also note that the spot in the 6oclock spot hurts but it is not agony..And this weird sensation has popped up in my mid back. not a pain but an uncomfortable spot when I laugh, cough, or sneeze. So I go back to the same general practitioner I saw and I couldn't see her (out of the office) but I saw a Nurse practitioner and insisted that I see someone who can biopsy and possibly drain the spots in my breast if it's drain-able. She thought the first course of action should be antibiotics but I disagreed. So she sent me to the local surgeon who reviewed my mammo and US, felt the one lump at 2 oclock (he said there was nothing there) and then felt the area at the 6oclock spot and said he could definitely tell it was fibro cystic tissue. He said that there was nothing on the Mammo and US and therefore he wasn't going to biopsy and he could not feel a \"palable\" lump or mass. I just can't understand how I feel something there and how if \"there is nothing\" there I could be in so much pain. He also said that if it was cancer it wouldn't hurt(i've read enough in the threads to know that is B.S.) and it would be statistically very low for this to be \"problemmatic\" he also said that many women complain that fibro cystic tissue is unbearably painful. After leaving the general surgeon I called back to the nurse practitioner and had her call me in antibiotics just to try something to see if the pain will ease. Should I get a second opinion? Who should I see since my Gyno didn't take me seriously, my regular doctor said there wasn't anything more we could do since nothing was on the US or mammo. And the surgeon said there is nothing there to biopsy.. Or is it really time to accept that this pain is my \"normal\" and that the doctors are right ( I mean technically 3 of the 4 said it was cyst/cysitc tissue) and this is nothing. I hope this all makes sense. I'm not wanting something to be wrong but I just can't understand how up until the birth control I had perfectly normal pain free boobs and now I can't stand to hug my spouse, lay on my belly, or have my kid lay on my chest because it hurts so bad.
