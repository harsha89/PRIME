I start radiation on Monday (well, really on Tuesday--Monday is the simulation), and I appreciate the tips I've seen here, and well as the sharing of SE experiences. I'm a really fair-skinned person, so particularly worried about a burn, but actually my dr. says that it doesn't necessarily mean I'll have a bad burn. We'll see! By the way, he recommended a lotion called \"My Girls\" (which I thought was a pretty funny name), and said that most of his patients have found it to be the best they've tried. I got it on Amazon.",
