    "Content": "annart wrote: I had a lumpectomy for IDC last week.  My pathology reports that all of this tumor has been removed and there is no lymph node involvement.  Unfortunately it also indicates \"extensive ductal carcinoma in situ with involvement of the lateral margin as well as coming within < 1 mm of the medial and inferior margins\".  Of course my surgeon is on vacation.  Does anyone know what this means?  No one has mentioned I may have DCIS.  Will I have to have more surgery? Dx 3/29/2012, IDC, 1cm, Stage I, Grade 2, 0/1 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
