I am seeing a good lymphedema therapist in NYC-- she wants me to wrap for about 2 weeks and then she thinks I can probably just use a compression sleeve for exercise and flying. The problem is that the wrap itches horribly, esp at my elbow. I just had to pull it off (after about 5 hours) and my skin was very inflamed. I am already seeing results though--so I want to keep it up. Any suggestions?? Christine-- Aromasin, LE Dx 4/4/2009, IDC, 3cm, Stage IIIA, 1/22 nodes, ER+ Log in to post a reply",

I was diagnosed in april 09--ALWAYS had a yearly mammogram, but bang-- stage 3 IDC with a LARGE mass (size of a lemon!) with two tumors in it, 2.2 cm and 1.8 --plus lymph involvement. YES I felt it but I have very large breasts and a history of fibroids and all kinds of lumpy stuff. I noticed it in october, showed it to my gyno in november and she said to not worry-- and I took her at her word. Cut to mammogram and sonogram in march and the nurse whispering to me \"honey-- I think it looks bad! you should come back for a biopsy as soon as you can!!\" SO-- chemo first to shrink my big a** cancer. 4 tx A/C, 3 taxol, switch to 9 abraxane.  Chemo ended last week and I had my MRI a day later-- all cancer gone! tumor TOTALLY disappeared. My surgeon says not so fast, there may still be stuff in there. I decided on a double masectomy with no reconstruction. That is thursday-- kind of anxious! Still though-- can't believe I have come this far. And of course: radiation after. So I get the whoooole cancer package..
