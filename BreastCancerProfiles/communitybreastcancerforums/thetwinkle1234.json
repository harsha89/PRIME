Thank you for your time and may God bless all of you :) Log in to post a reply",

I was just wondering if anyone knows what does it mean when an ultrasound reports states that you have prominent lactiferous duct visualized? and mine is only on the left breast..as far as i know, lactiferous ducts are like canals which transports milk? i am 21 this year, am not pregnant but had just ended my menses a day before the scan...could it possibly be due to that? Would appreciate help on this matter, thank you ladies Log in to post a reply",
