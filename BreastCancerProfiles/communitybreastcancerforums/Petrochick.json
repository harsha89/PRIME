Did you have the entire breast radiated or was it more focused?  This is another question for anyone else out there.  My rad onc made it sound like she always wants to the do the entire breast.  I'm thinking, we can at least cut it down to the quadrant we know the tumor was in.  My tumor was only 1.5 cm and in the upper, central quadrant (the reason my surgeon doesn't want to do surgery - the scar would be visible in most clothes and you run the risk that the margin was actually on the chest wall).  So if they can focus the rad in that area, less chance of arm issues if we don't have to radiate that part of the breast?  And maybe less chance the skin will be too damaged?  Just my thoughts.  I'm sure they're rather nuke it all just to be safe, but I'm thinking about the complications.  Curious what others have had done.",

So when I go visit my plastic surgeon tomorrow I can find out what the thoughts if the team are. I just wanted to see what others have done too. The plastic surgeon is concerned about contracture with rads and thinks there is risk of still not getting everything with another surgery. This is why he brought up the whole tram or wherever flap idea after rads. He's been good about listening to me and my desires. I guess we'll see what my skin looks like after the rads. I too am very pale and freckled. First round of chemo was not too bad. Hair started coming out and I got it buzzed on Sat and I'm wearing my wig at work now! Round 2 is Thursday. Hopefully no worse than the first which was mostly just a really bad weekend (fluish).",

I'm thinking I want to do everything to make sure the cancer is gone, but I'm worried about the long term side effects since I'm only 30 and plan to live another 50-60 years 1  ;-) I realize I may be at higher risk for a recurrence since I'm triple negative and BRCA1 positive.  I'm pretty frustrated since I chose the mastectomies and tissue expanders/implant route thinking I could avoid radiation.  Now my surgeon is talking about deflating my expanders and not being able to even attempt another surgery for 6 months post radiation completion.   I'm probably looking at a skin transplant after the radiation and I'm not a happy camper!  Does this mean I have to go back to being completely flat and be bald?!?  Grrrrrr. Sorry - sort of a vent but also curious if anyone out there has been in a similar boat.
