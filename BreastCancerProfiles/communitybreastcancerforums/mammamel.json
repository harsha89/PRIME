I am feeling really anxious because yesterday I went to see my GP about a lump in my armpit that I first noticed about a month ago- but have been experiencing weird throbbing feelings under my armpit for over 12 months ( went to Dr 12 months ago and he could not feel a lump at the time). Anyway- he said there is definately a lump and he thought it was a lymph node. He has ordered a mammogram and Ultra-sound, and needle biopsy only if they find a lump. He thought my right breast- the side with the armpit lump on it- felt diffusly lumpy, but wasn't sure. To me it feels and looks like it always has- it is a but lumpy and slightly thicke than the other side- but I dont think this is new. The lump in my armpit feels rubbery and long. It is kind of like a rope and the lump is a knot in the rope. It moves slightly if I push really hard. There is a visable swelling in the area- much more swelling than I would think would be appropriate for a lump maybe 2cm  long and .5 of a cm wide. I guess I am wondering if there is any thing else this could be apart from breast cancer. I'm 39 years old and have three very young children and I am anxious for them. I would be interested in hearing what everyone thought. Mammamel Log in to post a reply",

There was a cancellation so I got in early  I thought I would get the results there and then, however they said I needed to get the results of my doctor tomorrow.   The worst thing about this whole thing is the waiting. I have a lump in my armpit and diffuse lumpiness in my right breast, near the armpit lump. I think that breast has always been diffusly lumpy!   Anyway the mammagram woman took away the film and said she would come back and get me from the waiting area if she needed to take more film- she never came back.   I read somewhere that if they see something suspicious they take more film- is this true?   Next , the ultra-sound women came and got me and did the ultra-sound. I asked her if she could see anything in my breast and she sad no. She said I can see the lymph node but nothing in your breast.   Is it too early to be feeling relieved? Would BC show up in a Ultra-sound?   I guess I will know tomorrow.   Would love to hear what you all think. Mamma Mel Log in to post a reply",
