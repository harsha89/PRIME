My Lymphodema therapist also does some stretching exercises with my arm to help regain mobility. After the massage she has me do a couple of exercises on the gym equipment. I also started yoga at the cancer wellness center at my local hospital. My therapist was pleased to hear I was doing that. She also highly recommended swimming. But i need to make sure my drain holes are completely healed.",

I do find it humorous that 47 is considered young. I don't necessarily feel old as I have a totally immature personality. That could be because I have taught middle school for the past 24 years. But I am still pre menapausal. I also started lymphodema therapy this week. Love those appointments.",

I had 2 tumors and chose to have them removed through nipple sparring mastectomy with reconstruction. 3 of my lymph nodes tested positive so a second surgery was scheduled to remove remaining lymph nodes. 1 of the 12 tested positive. My oncotype score is 17 and I am taking tamoxifen. My breast surgeon thinks chemo will not be needed but I will definitely have radiation. Of course the oncologist will make that call and Isee him on June 26. My concern is, what if radiation misses something? My BS was not expecting positive lymph nodes because mine are so tiny. She had never seen lymph nodes as small as mine. In addition to the 4 positive lymph nodes 2 others showed some suspicious stuff.
