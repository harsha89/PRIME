You've had your cancer for years already based on the size of your tumor and the cell division time it would take to create it. So a few days or weeks is not going to do much to change things. It's probably more important now to get the appropriate tests done and meet with your surgeon and oncologist and radiation oncologist to get a treatment plan in place. That will take a couple of weeks I would think. I'm sorry about the anxiety--we've all been through it. I've been through it twice.",

I have, for example, and there are ladies here who have had it much worse than I have. Still, we live on and laugh again and forget for long periods of time we even have cancer. You will too.

Other than Imodium, I can't think of anything that you won't learn from your oncologist and get as part of your chemo regimen. For example, you'll receive \"pre-meds\" that minimize any allergic reactions and nausea. I didn't have mouth sores, so I have no experience with that.

Treatment is doable--some things are worse than others, but so far I haven't heard of anything that was too unbearable, or for which there wasn't a good substitute. Your life will change, that's for sure as you'll be in full scale doctor mode for months, but don't anticipate that you'll be consigned to your bed or anything like that. Years ago, people who did chemo were vomiting all the time and barely dragging around. Now there are antinausea drugs that virtually eliminate nausea.

Once you know your full diagnosis, which will take some weeks, and you get your full treatment plan in hand you'll have more of a feeling of control. I'll tell you the tests that were done on me as an example of the diagnosis process: after a biopsy confirmed cancer, my surgeon referred me to an oncologist who ordered a number of scans: Pet/Ct, breast MRI, brain MRI and maybe something else and full blood tests. Seems like a bone density test somewhere in there. I did have some mets to my spine so I was stage IV. Then I started a course of chemo and a targeted drug which pretty much reduced the breast cancer to nothing. Then I had a mastectomy a few months later. This started in October, 2011 and I had my mastectomy in May, 2012. That doesn't mean that you'll have chemo before surgery, but sometimes it is recommended. Either way, the cancer is attacked and destroyed, hopefully completely.",

In the end though, the insurance company was glad to see me hit 65 since I must have spent $500,000 of their money. Since I've been on traditional medicare (with an AARP supplement) I think I have paid nothing, or at least it has been so small and so infrequent that I don't remember paying for it. That includes a hospitalization, several outpatient surgeries, expensive chemo drugs, many doctor visits and lab tests. I pay $105 a month plus about $150 a month for the supplement.

      "Content": "Nov 20, 2015 09:48AM WinningSoFar wrote: Dear Kandy, My understanding is that traditional Medicare pays for chemo drugs (typically infused, but in pill form also if available) under Part B. That means that Medicare pays 80% of the Medicare approved amount and you or a supplemental plan pays the other 20%. The Medicare approved amount is the big deal because it is a fraction of the retail price of the drug. I am on Xgeva which is covered under Part B, retails for over $4500, but the Medicare approved amount is $1400, so at the worst (if I didn't have a supplemental policy), I'd have to pay 20% of that, or $280. Since I do have a supplemental, I pay nothing. I am also on Xeloda, pill form, which is covered under Part B also. I don't have the numbers for that one since I just started on it. Medicare Advantage plans combine parts A, B and D (see below) into one insurance company plan plus sometimes some other benefits. Be careful though about how the company pays for chemo drugs because you are not allowed to have a supplemental plan. I was warned by my oncologist' office NOT to get a Medicare Advantage plan in California unless I was prepared to pay the other 20% (I'm not sure if the 20% is $280 or $900), but they have patients who have had thousands of dollars each month to pay because they inadvertently got a MA plan instead of traditional Medicare. Now, if you are talking about other kinds of drugs, like the kind you get at the local pharmacy, that's a whole different story. Traditional medicare does not cover any of them. You'd have to get another plan (called Part D--for drug I guess) for which you'll pay something like $50-$60 a month. The impression I get from the Part D plans is that the insurance companies have a lot of latitude in what they cover, and in which tier (another big deal--the tier). There are tools on Medicare's web site that allow you to input your pharmacy drugs and see which plan is best for you. I don't know how your husband's plan factors into all this. Every state has free non-agent counseling for new medicare recipients and I highly recommend it. In California, it's called HICAP.",

I happen to know that because I've had both cellulitis and IBC at different times and there isn't a heck of a lot of difference in the looks of the two. Second, IBC can be IDC with lymphatic invasion. Mine was. When 2/3 of the breast is involved (in the skin), that is one of the criteria for IBC. That's why they say that IBC is a clinical diagnosis, because someone has to assess whether 2/3 of the breast lymphatics is involved. There are a couple of other clinical conditions, but right now I can't remember them. When I was diagnosed with IBC, I remember only two tests that tended to point to IBC. One was an ultrasound where the skin looked thick, and the other was a biopsy of the skin where cancer cells were detected.",

I've read that pharmacists are also good people to consult with for drug/supplement/chemo considerations although I admit I haven't taken advantage of that. In the supplement area, I take only vit D3 because my vit level was low. It is rechecked every 3 months to make sure I'm in the right range. That's not to say that other supplements are not indicated, but they aren't indicated for me.

If I have to be exact, I have been NED from May, 2014 to now, which is really about 16 months. Guess I getting a little excited to make it 18 months. Anyway, my oncologist had me on 3 month pet/ct scans in 2014 to make sure that Abraxane was working, then I 'graduated' to six months scans after that. For me, Abraxane has been extremely effective. I also get a monthly Xgeva shot so that might have been helping too. Who can know which one, or if both, are working. It has occurred to me that this new lesion might not be for real.

I did have only one breast removed since the studies seem to show there is no advantage in a bilateral mastectomy, but I'll admit there are times I think I was crazy not to have a bilateral. I also hate to be the bearer of bad news, but having a mastectomy or two does not mean you won't have a recurrence. I run into women all the time who've had mastectomies and have their cancer come back. There just are no guarantees. Once you have cancer, you will always have it in the back of your mind. ",

It was my decision to Abraxane the second time after 6 cycles. I'm sure the oncologist would have been happy to keep me on it continuously, but really, there is such a thing as feeling normal. I wish there was a chemo that would be easier to tolerate, although I shouldn't complain about Abraxane. It's not bad, but taking no chemo is better.  ",

Have they done a biopsy on the distant mets? I just had that done and found out that my mets are not triple negative, but are E+. This could turn out ok for your mom. I have been living with 2 kinds of breast cancer for 20 years--both E+ and TNBC. And inflammatory. I'm still doing ok. Just plugging along. Hope for the best because it can happen. BTW, I did have Abraxane and it was very effective. I knew from the first infusion that it was working. Be sure they give her a good antiemetic. I used Emend but everyone has their own favorite.",

They were not in the same building, but in the same general area and knew each other (from Tumor Board meetings I think). I believe that the BS also recommended a radiation oncologist, but that might have been the oncologist. I recommend getting an initial consultation with the RO just so you understand all of the primary treatments and how they interact. The BS acted like the initial navigator of my treatment, until I started chemo, then I would say the oncologist took on that role. Forgot to write this: the BS knew who specializes in oncology for breast cancer, and in my case, inflammatory bc. Some oncologists see more colon cancer for example, something you might not know yourself. My first oncologist in 1999 was a colon cancer guy and I never knew that. ",

Sometimes, we think we have one shot at everything and have to be ready like a soldier armed for battle, with every conceivable weapon hanging off our belt. Let the surgeon goes through her/his spiel of what to expect. I would suggest you take someone else with you to the appointment to take notes (or a tape recorder).

They have seen it all and can tell you that it's nothing to worry about and what to do about it. That way you have more than one person at your onc's office to ask. I had a really embarrassing problem that I had to ask the onc's pharmaceutical nurse--really embarrassing because sing I had to admit I had gotten a script from my cousin for an antidepressant which was the wrong drug because I was too loopy to remember the right name. And the drug was causing all sorts of suicidal ideation which then caused the whole medical establishment to rush to my side in case I did myself in. How embarrassing was that? Very.",

Sorry to tell you, that's not true. There are a fair number of women on this board with just such a result. IM humble O, perhaps the way to look at it is that statistically a lumpectomy with rads = mastectomy in terms of recurrence (but recurrence is not zero in either case, but it is pretty low in both cases). I know I'm treading on dangerous grounds here, but have you considered going to a therapist to help you with your fear of surgery. Perhaps that would help you more than anything. I wouldn't think that with DCIS you'd have to take action immediately so that would give you time to come to terms with your family history. I know from personal experience that fear is paralyzing. I needed to have a D&C years ago and I just could not do it. Luckily, I guess I really did not need that D&C since I never had it.",

I also have hypertension, high cholesterol, but not diabetes (yet anyway). My conditions are also under control. I am well over 60 so we have that in common. I'm carrying too much weight, hope that's not the case with you. I'm just saying this to say that we might be similar. I've had two lumpectomies and a mastectomy, all on the right side, over the last 15 years. I really can't say that there was much difference to me between the lumpectomy and the mastectomy with regard to pain, range of motion, recovery etc. I didn't find any of the surgeries painful or recovery hard, but I think I have a high pain tolerance. Obviously, there's a big difference in cosmetic results. I've had radiation after the first lumpectomy. Nothing much to it, except driving there every day. I've had chemo twice and if given a choice between chemo and radiation, I'd take radiation any day. In your case, with DCIS, chemo is not one of your options, so you don't have to make that choice. Just wanted you to know that I though radiation was a breeze. I didn't have any reconstruction after my mastectomy for more than two years. After two years, I decided that yes, I wanted reconstruction, so after a year of tissue expanding (which also never hurt), I got the implant (which also didn't hurt). Outpatient surgery, in fact. I'm still not symmetrical because they couldn't expand my radiated side enough, but it's a lot better than it was, and I was prepared for that outcome. I feel like the surgery queen. In addition to the above breast surgeries, I've had major colon surgery due to perforated bowel and another major surgery to close the colostomy. Now, those surgeries were hard. Breast surgery is a breeze in comparison.",
