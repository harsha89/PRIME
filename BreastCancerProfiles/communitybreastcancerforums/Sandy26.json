I did IV chemo therapy for 4 months and had a double mastectomy on Oct 12th. I am in the process of going through reconstruction with expanders. The chemo didn't work as the doctor's had hoped...so as preventive measures I am taking tamoxifin for 5 years and another round of chemo (xeloda) for 4 months. I have made it through everything just fine so far and didn't have too many crazy side effects of anything. Hang in there!",
