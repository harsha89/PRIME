My sister shaved my head , hair started falling out 3rd day post 2nd DD A/C . I dont miss my hair , and i totally believe that we all get emotional when we lose it not because of vanity but beause of the association with BC and Chemo , it becomes a more of a reality to us all . Bought my wig so expensive 500, been wearing buffers and scarves , just more comfortable. Hannariggs , hope you're feeling better and loved your story about the dog . JeriGrace , thank u for support Rambo , so happy to hear you're enjoying work and feeling good Soriya , hope you're SE subside Realitycheck , hang in there !
