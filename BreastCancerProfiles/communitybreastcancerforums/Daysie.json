      "Content": "Daysie wrote: Hi Everyone I have IDC which is Triple Negative, quite a large tumour so I am having FEC-T, to shrink the tumour before mastectomy.  I started my 1st FEC last Friday 18 Nov.  I am really worried because my bad breast has gone very pink and feels full and swollen and heavy.  I am also Diabetic and had a mild steriod with the FEC. My Oncologist said yesterday that the FEC may have reacted with the steriod or because I've got diabetes or he said that the FEC may not be working.  This is the bit that worries me, because when I got my treatment plan he said that FEC-T was the only treatment that is suitable for me because of being Triple Negative.  If the FEC isn't working then I haven't any other hope have I? Has anybody else had a Pink Swollen Breast after FEC?  I am scared to high heaven that the FEC isn't working. Any experiences or knowledge shared would be great to hear from you.
