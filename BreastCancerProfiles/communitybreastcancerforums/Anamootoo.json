Last night I allowed my darkest fears to take hold and drag me to the land of \"what if's\".  I feel better this morning, It's Fathers Day so the house is full of laughter and squeals. It's hard to be scared and fully enjoy something at the same time so today I'll just enjoy my family. Thanks for the links and the kind words. I know you guys can't diagnose me but there is something disturbing about not being able to determine possibilities. And something sadistically comforting in finding yourself-- even if it is in dangerous surroundings. I can face anything, good or bad, if I can at least prepare for it's possibility. It is the complete unknown that is driving me nuts. I have been hoping to find some condition or disease that matches my symptoms, not so that I can avoid seeking diagnoses but so that I can string my hope to something benign. I'll use the statistics you offered and try today to remember that the odds are in my favor!  I may be back tonight when the darkness and quiet allows all manner of crazy thoughts- lol, If not I will return tomorrow. Thank you again for reading my plea and trying to comfort me. I really appreciate it!  Happy Fathers Day everyone! I hope you have a wonderfully silly day.",

I have a mammogram scheduled for 9 am Monday morning but I am scared to tears tonight and just want to talk to someone who has been in this place and knows what it feels like.  I had been noticing some pain on the inside and upper quadrant of my right breast but just chalked it up to my underwires pushing on the tissue and ignored it for a few weeks. Recently I did my monthly breast exam and I noticed some swollen vessels, very hard and very distinct just deep to the skin. I decided to schedule a mammogram but had no luck as I am under 35 and cannot do so without a doctors order. I thought maybe I had mastitis (it feels like mastitis sometimes) and went to the ER. The doc there said I did not have mastitis, and either had a cyst or cancer. I am no longer breast feeding (last bf 2 years ago) and the doctor made me feel like a complete idiot for even suggesting mastitis in the absence of nursing, and refused to order a mammogram because he was unable to follow up on it. I contacted my local health dept. for assistance in obtaining a mammogram without a doctors referral and they put me into a program they offer for women over 45 without insurance even though I didn't meet the age requirements.  I have never been one to sit and wait on anything so I have googled every variation of \"Swollen vessels in breast\" that I can find and never get a good match. I don't have a palpable lump, I just have this ridge that runs from the inside of my breast all the way over to the middle and 3 or 4 hard lymph vessels between 2 and 4 inches long each. Cancer is the only thing that comes up and this symptom isn't included.  So my question is : Has anyone here had this symptom? They are almost certainly lymphatic vessels but could be grossly enlarged blood vessels, I suppose. They are fairly sore to the touch and I get a burning sensation a few times an hour. Early this week I developed pain under my collarbone on the same side. I keep hoping this is a symptom of stress and not lymph nodes. So long story short, I am scared to death. Not as scared as I will be if I get bad news but the waiting is terrible. All I can do is cry. My family keeps saying it's probably nothing.... and they're probably right. But what I need is for someone who has walked in these shoes to say..... I know this is scary, I can relate. Log in to post a reply",
