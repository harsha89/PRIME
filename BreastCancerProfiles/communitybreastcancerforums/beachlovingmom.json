    "Content": "beachlovingmom wrote: I am struggling to make a decision about which chemo is most effective for my invasive lobular carcinoma.  I am stage IIIA, with a 6.5 cm tumor, 2/4 lymph node involvement, ER+/PR+, HER2-.  My oncologist recommended 4 AC followed by 4 Taxol with lymph node surgery to remove the rest of my lymph nodes.  I sought a second opinion and that oncologist recommended 3 FEC followed by 3 Taxotere with no lymph node removal surgery.  I see my original oncologist tomorrow and want to start chemo this week.  I have tried researching extensively but have not found much in the way of advice for one regime over the other.  I am young (42) with young boys so I prefer to error on the side of aggressiveness.  Does anyone have any insight or suggestions other than a long discussion with my original oncologist?
