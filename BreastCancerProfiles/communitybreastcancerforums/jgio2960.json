The problem with lumpectomy is you never know 100% what is inside till the surgeon is in there. While there is no 100% guarantee with a reoccurrence the rise of a secondary bc developing is way lower with a mx. As far as reconstruction, my mom has immediate diep flap she has two more surgeries but first glance her new girls look amazing you couldn't even tell.",

When my mom was diagnosed I thought my life was ending but positivity and prayer go along way. I am so beyond happy for all of you who have reached that 10 year mark, though every milestone is an accomplishment. For the women on here who were concerned about there not being more 10+ yr survivors, I will say a lot of women have either forgotten or moved on and just don't write anymore. My grandmother had 3 sisters all of which were diagnosed in the 80's and were in the advanced stages. They battled like hell and not one of them passed from thins disease. Unfortunately they were all in their 80's so has no idea this website existed lol. But believe me surviors are amongs US everwhere",
