I pointed it out to the oncologist who didn't seem to think it was anything to worry about.  But that area is where the constant pain is located.  I had a reduction, no reconstruction (went from DD to B).  No changes that I can think of.... I hate to run to the doctor for nothing, but then that little worry is always there poking at you that maybe this is something that needs to be checked out.",

Starting last night the pain has been constant.  Anyone else experience this???? Log in to post a reply",
