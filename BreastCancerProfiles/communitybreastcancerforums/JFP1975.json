My mom's biopsy was yesterday; they did an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy of the mass, also did an FNA of the cyst in her other breast, and did an unplanned lymph node biopsy as they observed some lymph node swelling. They told her 3-5 days before they have results, so the waiting continues!",

I live in another state and so haven't seen the report or talked to the radiologist yet. They referred her for an ultrasound, which she had yesterday. She called me to let me know what the radiologist said, which was that they saw masses in both breasts. The right one the radiologist apparently dismissed as a cyst. The left one is approximately 3.2cm, with calcifications, and \"very suspicious\" so she was referred for a biopsy which is scheduled for the 22nd. She told me that the radiologist also mentioned referring her to a surgeon, and spoke to her about having chemo/radiation prior to surgery to shrink the tumor. I have been reading about ultrasound results, and I am unclear on whether an ultrasound can actually be diagnostic re: cancer vs. not. Can someone clarify whether the radiologist was just potentially discussing possible outcomes/treatment or whether he saw something that led him to believe this is very likely (or unequivocally) cancer? Thanks. Log in to post a reply",
