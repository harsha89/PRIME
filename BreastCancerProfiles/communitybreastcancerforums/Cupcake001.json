I have had to have a xray on thursday because i have a chest infection and am on antibiotics, anyway i woke with severe pain in my ribs this morning like i had broken ribs even though i know i havn't done anything to myself, and it's on the side of the treatment. I was taking pain med's but there not really working. Anyway i eventurlly rang the hospital that i attend and spoke to the house doctor, he advised me to go to the nearest hospital for a xray and that they would give me stronger pain med's. He also said that it was possible for the rads to fracture a rib????????

Can anyone explain please the feelings they had during their rad therapy, I am feeling all sorts of emotions at the moment, and everyone close to me is driving me mad even though they are doing nothing wrong, plus my feelings are going from happy to sad to angry to lonely and all in between. Did anyone else feel this way and if so how did you cope, oh and I am taking Tamoxifen so I kinda understand that it can change my feelings. Lately I am some kinda of monster type person whom I hardly know. Please help.  Thanks, Cupcake. Log in to post a reply",

I found out last week that the tamoxifin has brought on the menopause and i now have a better understanding of it all. I had a good talk with my professor and got great advice, i also talked at length with my partner, who i really have been putting through hell... The biggest thing i guess is to talk and not keep everything bottled up, and most of all be positive in all things good and deal with the bad by talking.. I have a three hour journey there and back and usually a two hour wait in the hospital, so i do find it very tireing and get annoyed at the fact that it has totally taken over my life for a bit. I have been told that i finish october 5th but they have written that i have to have 8 boost's??? what is that about. I will get the aleo vera gel tomorrow as it seem's to be working for you all. My breast is now very red and swollen with a very big nipple, I am going on holiday the 18th october and assuming that i do finish my treatment on the 5th will my breast have gone back to its normal state by then?? Sending out love and hugs to ye all",
