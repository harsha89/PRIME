      "Content": "MotherT wrote: I was diagnosed in May 2013 with Stage 3 IDC Breast cancer, 1.8 cm primary tumor and some very small micro areas, 6/11 lymph nodes positive, ER/PR +, HER2-. I had a lumpectomy, a follow up surgery to clean up the margins, 8 dense doses of chemo (AC/T), followed by 35 heavy shots of radiation to breast and clavicle area. I was then put on a daily dose of Arimedex and was told I would be on that for at least 10 years. After treatment, I had a bone density scan that showed osteoporosis (I am 48), and had blood drawn every 3-4 months for a year. I had a mammogram in June 2014 that showed NED, but since then, I have had no further testing. My MO \"retired\" from practice, and I just met with my new MO. I told him I was not happy with the Arimedex side effects, so we are changing it to something else (name escapes me right now). When I asked if he planned to do blood work, he informed me that there is no research to indicate that is the least bit effective in indicating the disease. I asked him about tumor markers, and he said the only one that is indicative of breast cancer is extremely unreliable. He did not think it necessary to do any further scans, and said he recommends a yearly mammogram (I have that with the head of the breast center, as she said my mammo would be difficult for a regular doctor to read) and a yearly bone density scan (he has taken me off the Fosamax and suggested the twice annual IV infusion for my case). My question:Â  does this seem like we are playing Russian Roulette? To me, it feels like I went from regular checks to nobody watching anything VERY quickly. Part of me thinks I should enjoy being \"NED\", but then there is part of me that thinks I'm burying my head in the sand, and by doing nothing, we may not find a reoccurrence until it is advanced. I'm definitely not trying to borrow trouble, but I also don't want to sit idly by...is a once-a-year mammo enough of check in this situation? I'm just looking for thoughts of those who have \"been there, done that.\" Thanks! Log in to post a reply",

I then went yesterday for my Neulasta shot. I am getting four rounds of dense dose AC, every two weeks, and then four rounds of T, also every two weeks. Other than being tired, nothing horrible yet. I think the anticipation was the worst part. I was almost relieved to get started, just to get it over with, if that makes any sense. I know I'm going to lose my hair, and I'm sure that's going to freak me out at first, but I just keep envisioning kicking the cancer to the curb...I want it OUT!!! I am inspired by all the amazingly resilient women I have come in contact with...bless you all!",
