    "Content": "togo wrote: Hi, I have a  question. When I went for my first mammogram and us my birads was a 2. My dr sent me to a breast specialist because of the thickening we felt. I was sent for another mammogram 6 mth follow up. Thickness was the same, no change, great news but they found a hyperechoic nodule consistant with a focal area of fat on the other breast. That did not sound bad to me,I thought that also was good news, so why did they upgrade my BIRADS to a 3? I know from research that means probably benign and  6mth follow up but life happens that was a couple of years ago . anyway I have a mammogram wed(10-29) and Im making myself crazy thinking I should not have waited so long. My left breast still has thickness and my right feels smaller then usual (if that makes sence?) i am not having my mammogram at the same place do to a mix up but they asure me they will order the results to compare all. Im 38 with maternal grandmother and aunt both with bc. thanks for listening just wondering about the BIRADS upgrade thanks. Log in to post a reply",
