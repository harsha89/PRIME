I didn't have to stay overnight. I think they used a different anesthetic on me though. I forget the name. Propanol? Commonly referred to as the Michael Jackson drug. It felt so good to have that thing gone. It was a double port so we're talking BULKY. Don't worry, the surgery isn't that bad.",

All was going pretty good until I was diagnosed with a blood clot just before my 3rd treatment. Now taking blood thinners (sub Q, in the stomach). I'll update my profile with the chemo drugs I'm on as I hadn't paid much attention. All I know for sure is it's some cytotoxic BS, and the first 4 are supposed to be the worst. I'll be having the 4th treatment next thursday then get switched to something lighter.",

There are many artists that can create a hyper realistic nipple tattoo. Some insurances like Medicaid (in NY) cover it. Also, I reallyliked headcovers.com when I was bald from chemo. Huge selection. Stay strong sister. You got this.",
