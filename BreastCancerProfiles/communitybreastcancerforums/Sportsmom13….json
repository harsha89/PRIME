It was relatively small with measurements under 1cm. Now, after two years of the watch and wait approach, it has continued to grow to 3cm. I have had two core needle biopsies during this time, with the most recent one just about a month ago. My biopsy report mentions  things like \"hypercellular myxoid\" which sounds scary, but it also clearly states \"Benign\". Why do I still feel so scared that something isn't right?? I am scheduled to have it surgically removed Sept. 20th, which I am hoping will bring me some sort of mental relief. All the while, I feel like I have made this decision out of fear. Anyone have some words of clarity or wisdom to share? And for all of you ladies diagnosed with BC, I am so sorry you are going thru this and send you all healing thoughts and hugs.

I'm just curious, has anyone had these on the inner, upper quadrant of their right breast.(2 o'clock position)? Most of the material I have encountered seems to suggest they primarily take place in the outer quadrants. Also, is this growth rate considered rapid or normal? The most recent radiologist who reviewed my US mentioned ruling out a \"Phyloddes Tumor\", but that was not noted on the biopsy report.",
