I had a regular screening mammo May 10th and have been on quite the journey for this past month. I've had diagnostic mammos, several USs, 3D mammo. Then 3 biopsies, core needle, US guided. At the end of that, they did another mammo to make sure it and the USs images agreed. They didn't. There was a 4th place, still in the same breast. Had a stereotactic biopsy last Wednesday. Seems like I just kind of go from one procedure, wait, then on to another procedure, wait. But, that's just the way of things. ;)",

I have an appointment with the surgeon and radiation person next Thursday, the 22nd. No recommendations are being made until I see the surgeon. I am doing ok. I am wondering about this -- I developed a hematoma after the last biopsy (stereotactic), and that's been painful. I am also having times of brief pain underneath my arm, and I'm wondering if could be a sign that there is involvement in the lymph nodes. The NP I've been seeing has reassured me that she doesn't feel any enlargement there.",
