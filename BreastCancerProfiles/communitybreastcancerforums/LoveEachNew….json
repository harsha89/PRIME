I see my surgeon at Noon today to discuss.  Unfortunately, he recommended that I go to work after 2 weeks.  I'm unable to take a new short term disability, so I'll need to accomplish this within the confines of a full-time job.....I don't move my arms much, mostly typing or walking. Thanks again.",
