It's inspiring to see such strong women come together like this. :) My mom was diagnosed with stage III breast cancer in October. The tumor is large, it was in two lymph nodes, but a body scan showed no evidence of it anywhere else in her body in November. Treatment is chemo, followed by mastectamy, then radiation, then hormotherapy.  After the first round of A/C, her tumor shrunk from 12x9 to 9x8, which was amazing news. Today, we were supposed to have a third round of treatment, but the doctor noticed a rash on her breast. While the area shrunk further (down to 8x8), he said that the rash is, worst case scenerio, that the cancer could be trying to spread. It could also be something as benign as a localized reaction to the drugs. I wasn't expecting the news, and it knocked me back  a few pegs. The news had been so amazing before her second treatment that I was expecting to hear the same type of thing again.  They are adjusting her chemo schedule and giving her the four rounds of Taxotere now, followed by the final two A/C rounds at the end before surgery. I asked the doctor how concerned we should be, and he told us that it can happen, and that he's not certain that it's spreading. He also said they could biopsy the rash, but regardless of the results, he would recommend this course of treatment because this is the drug they want to use to treat any loose cancer that could be in her body. I'm trying to trust the doctors, trying to stay away from googling too many things, and just wait until tomorrow to talk more to the nurses, but I was wondering if it is common for doctors to make these kinds of adjustments going through treatment. We didn't toss out the battle plan, just switched things around, but at the same time I feel completely naseated that the chemo caused something that was localized to go crazy. I'm starting to really understand what they mean when they say it's a battle with cancer. While the doctor and nurses all said it happens, I'm just really curious if it happens a lot, or if we're in a small minority right now. Anyone have experience with this?

At first, we were doing well with massage and compression. She was fitted for a sleeve, but the compression wasn't enough, and she had a flare up. While that flare was happening, she was wrapped constantly waiting for a higher compression sleeve--about 6 weeks. Since then, we've been up and down and up and down. Sometimes she gets massaged and wrapped and it works. Other times, not so much. She's had wrappings on for the last five days, and we aren't seeing any kind of reduction in the swelling. In the meantime, she's also had a lot of shoulder pain. The doctors were worried about mets to the bone, but after a CT scan and a follow up MRI, she was given the all clear from cancer; but she has been diagnosed with arthritis, brucitis and tendinitis, along with two small rips in the muscle. We met with an orthopedidic surgeon who wants to treat with physical therapy and perhaps cortisone, but would rather avoid the cortisone. All that said, my actual question: has anyone else had lengths of times when they just can't get the swelling under control? Can the inflammation from her shoulder be causing more blocks in her lymph system? The therapist keeps thinking that the cancer is back, but nothing is pointing toward that--except for a slightly elevated tumor marker number. She's in the process of trying to get s lymphedema pump approved, and I'm hopeful that will help, but in the meantime, my mom is entirely miserable and I don't know what to do to help. I just keep trying to keep her hydrated, keep massaging as often as I can, and try to keep her eating well. But it is terrible to have her arm so wrapped so constantly. I'm willing to try just about anything. Tips or recommendations would be so, so welcomed. Thanks, everybody! Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Emilylaughed wrote: Hi everybody-- My mom had a really rough summer, but things have been looking up for the last few weeks. She had a recurrence to the skin and it seemed that the lymphedema that presented was due to the recurrence of cancer. They also found about 3 liters of fluid in the lining of her lung on the unaffected side. She's currently on Eribulin and her tumor markers dropped from close to 200 to about 40 with 3 treatments. My question today is about the treatment for the fluid around her lung; she couldn't breathe in August and instead of doing the pleuradisis they performed on her affected lung (she had a recurrence to the affected side last year), they installed a Pleurex Catheter. She's been draining every day, sometimes easily, sometimes it's a bit more complicated and difficult, but the quantity of the fluid is slowly decreasing as she's taking more of the chemo. The last two days, while the quantity of fluid is still a bit lower than it normally as been, the color is changing. The nurse called her lung doctor and he said not to worry about it, but as it's now the second day, and the color is red, I have my concerns about what's going on in her body. Her mood is slightly shifted as well--she's been in a great place, and now she seems to be slipping a bit. There's a call into oncology to see what they think, but I was wondering who here has had experiences with the Pleurex--I'm struggling to find stories. She had a few clots in her lungs that they were working on breaking up with a blood thinner--but she hasn't had a chest x-ray or scan for a few months now. I'm concerned that there could be some internal bleeding -- but I have a tendency to jump to the worst case scenario. She just had a complete blood workup and everything is looking pretty good; Her bun/creatine ratio is just a teeny bit elevated, but otherwise, her counts are really, really stable. Thanks for any kind of info you might have! She's been stage IV for about 2 years now. She responds well once we get her on a treatment path, it's always the in-betweens that get a little funky. And we just finished an in-between, and I was hoping for a nice, long stable middle of treatment. :) Don't know if we're going to get that, but I've not given up hope! Just want to make sure I'm asking the right questions. Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Emilylaughed wrote: Hello friends. Late in the afternoon on June 7 my mom slipped away when no one was watching. Her fight was long and hard, and she never complained, and always corrected any of us if we began a spiral of self-pity because of what cancer had done to change our lives. She gave our family a beautiful gift by the way she chose to fight, with grace and determination and extraordinary spirit. Her unwavering faith kept her strong. In the last week, she had lost much of the spark from her eyes. Her spirit was far too beautiful and expansive to be weighed down under a body that simply couldn't support her anymore. Thank you for your support -- I was incredibly grateful for an intelligent and caring community to support me any time I had questions on my mom's behalf, or any time I just needed to hear that I wasn't alone. On the day she died, she spent extra time with me in the morning; she asked me to re-wrap her arm, even though I knew that would be difficult. She joked with me about being worried about who was taking care of George Clooney and his new babies. (It was the day after his wife gave birth). She told me to go to work, spent time with my dad and brother... She was struggling to eat anything, but tried to eat an ice cream cone late in the day. My dad left the living room to call me for just a moment to tell me she was weak but ok; and just 2 minutes later she had stopped breathing. As peaceful an ending as we could have hoped for after a very difficult 4 years. We had a simple Catholic Funeral for her, sang her favorite songs, played some folk music before church, and had vanilla ice cream cones in her honor at the doors of the church. I'd like to share with you the words I shared at my mom's funeral mass--very few of them were about cancer because I believe that the rest of her life was what defined her; cancer simply became a path at the end that she was gifted to walk down. I wish you all light and love, and hope that your journey remains a good one; my mom would have said it's what we've been given, and shame on us if we don't thank God each day for what he has offered. Love and light, love and light. -Emily ------------------------- My mother probably would not love seeing me standing in front of a church talking this morning. I've wondered all week if a thunderstorm would hit right at this moment, and if it does, you all will know exactly what she thinks of the fuss we've gone through to place this gorgeous, loving, warm-hearted woman to rest. I decided to risk it; I think I would regret it more if I didn't say just a few words aboutmy incredible mother. Adam wanted to talk, too, but we independently had the exact same idea of how to say what we wanted to say, we both were raised in the same way. He decided he was the science brain and I was the art brain, and so these are words from both of her kids. His talk would probably be a little shorter, but I won't let this last long. My mom lived a quiet, humble life. \"Nothing special,\" she would say. She was the happiest in her home, with her dog, and sometimes without any of the family around. When everything was done, and the house was cleaned and she could settle in with a cup of coffee she was at her very best. She truly believed that everything that she had was perfect. My mom was good at many things\u2014she was crafty, kind, empathetic, faithful\u2014but she was best at being a mother. Any one who she offered her motherly advice to\u2014and I know that extends well beyondmy brother and I\u2014will likely agree. We may not have always agreed with what she said, but in the end there was never a time she steered us wrong. In that spirit, I don't want to take up too much time today (she would be saying to get on with it, already), but I'd like to leave you with ten lessons that I learned from my mom. Lead with love. My mom never put herself first. We weren't a family that said \"I love you\" often or at all, because it was simply a given. We always had everything we could possibly need. She was able to impart that same feeling on to everyone that she met, with the words she would pick to use, the look in her eye, and a heart of pure gold. Enjoy the simple things. Coffee and donuts. The front porch on a cool evening. Puppies. The first snowfall of the season. Birds singing early in the morning. Trees glowing with the splendor of autumn. A giant rubber duck on the river. Movies, but only after they came out on DVD. My momfound the greatest joy in the simple comforts of life. She was happiest at home with Maxwell House coffee, her puppies \u2014 Duchess, and then miss Lucy. She couldn't understand my desire to travel when everything she wanted was completely within her reach. She built a beautiful home and her family flocked to it and her because she had created something so beautiful. The kids come first. Halloween was my mom's favorite time of year. She would buy the really big candy bars, send most kids off with more than one, and kept very close track of how many kids we had so that we could be prepared next year. \"They only come around and ask for this one night a year\" she would say. \"We should treat them well.\" I believe we always will. It's all about perspective. \"There is nothing too special about getting hurt, getting over it that takes the work\" My mom never saw a problem as 'too big.' It just needed to be worked through, and we had enough to figure it out. Her own struggles were absolutely no harder than anyone else's and we should respect that we are all in it together. Above all, have faith. My mom instilled in both of her kids an unflinching belief in God and in something that we couldn't see, but instead had to believe in. Her faith was unshakable. When asked how she was, she would always respond that she was \"Great! The Lord gave me this day, and shame on me to not enjoy it!\" and could say this as she went for chemo, surgery, or wound up in a hospital room with the same verve as she would if everything really was peaceful. While she loved science, she'd be the first to say that we don't know everything, and it's the guy upstairs who really has control. Do some slightly crazy things with passion. She would not like me for saying it, but my momcollected Beanie Babies. And I don't know what to do with them, now. She also made sure that her kids had any new hot toy for Christmas, and NEVER came up short. My mom loved having a quest. It wasn't so much about the thing\u2014It was about finding the joy in the hunt and it was about love. It was also about knowing that not everything that we do in this life needs to make sense; sometimes something a little bit crazy is perfectly acceptable. Don't put it off. Adam got this lesson hand's down\u2014He will not rest until the important things are finished. I'm still working on this one; somehow I took after my dad. Things not being finished keptmy mom up at night. It didn't matter if it were big or small, simple or complex, there won't always be a tomorrow. On the day that my mom died, my brother was cutting the grass; he left it half-cutfor a night\u2014and nothing was more important the next day that getting it finished. That would have made my mom crazy, and it made my brother crazy, too. (As for me, I might not have noticed.) Trust that you are right where you ought to be. To outsiders, my mom walked down a tough road. She didn't think so. And she never complained. It may take time to see the bigger picture, but we were here for a reason. If anyone began a chorus of 'why me' she would immediately turn it around into 'why NOT me?' She believed that her entire family was learning from her experience with cancer. She showed us what it looked like to never, ever stop living. Persist. Before that was a thing, my mom knew how to do it. This past Christmas my mom wrapped a gift for me. That doesn't sound like much, but consider that she only had one hand with which she could wrap\u2014her left arm was not mobile enough to help. Can you fathom wrapping any gift with just one hand? It wouldn't be easy. But my mom thought it was important, and knew it was nothing that she couldn't overcome; so she did it. I kept it wrapped as a reminder of her determined spirit. I'd like to believe that this one I have really taken to heart\u2026anyone who I work with will tell you that I don't seem to take 'no' for an answer, and find ways to make pretty much anything that seems important happen. Listen. No one could listen as well as my mom. She heard what you said. She heard what you didn't say. Any time one of her kids came to her with a crisis, she would listen carefully, and often would not offer advice. She would listen so fiercely that we would keep going until we began to unravel our own problem. Instead of a harsh spike of the ball, she would react with a soft 'volley.' It was a gift. I have found that what I have craved the most in the last week has been quiet time. It will not be the same to find quiet without her supportive presence next to me, but I think that in the stillness and in the quiet and the softening I will hear her voice again\u2014supporting and loving and listening in a way that few others really can. I learned so much more than that from my mom. She gave so much, and asked for so little in return. Mymom had a thing with angels. She has a beautiful collection, and they circle our home. She used to say 'may the light of the angels circle and protect this home until morning' each night; and I believe that many of you were angels to my mom and to my family. This week, perhaps as a bit of a distraction, I thought it was very important to make something for anyone who came to her mass today\u2014they are at the doors of the church, and I hope you will take one with you and hang it somewhere to protect you. I thank you, and hope that the angel protects you as they have protected us. Just one last story before I go\u2014On the day my mom died, we were struggling to get her to eat anything. Finally, late in the afternoon, my dad got her to try to eat a small vanilla ice-cream cone, which she ate as well as she could. My dad walked away from her for just a few moments \u2014 calling me to tell me that mom was weak but ok, I was about to be on my way home from work, my brother, after visiting for a while after work was outside cutting the grass \u2014 and when my dad came back, he found that she had stopped breathing. She slipped away, just like that. Truly on her terms, at home, with all of the people she loved around her on the last day, eating an ice cream cone. So, in the spirit of my mom's incredible spirit, we ALSO have ice-cream cones at the doors of church today. You don't need to linger--Enjoy it like you would have when you were a kid\u2014Before lunch and everything. My mom would have wanted you to walk away from this service with a smile on your face and a laugh in your heart. She would tell you, as I do right now, that you ought to enjoy this beautiful day\u2014it is an incredible gift, and it's up to us to honor that and do everything we can to love each and every moment. And one final word of advice directly from my mom's mouth, if she is still living, or even if she is not, call your mother, tell her that you love her and that you are doing great. God bless. http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/triblive-valley-news-dispatch/obituary.aspx?n=lorraine-balawejder&pid=185827847&fhid=4271 Log in to post a reply",

We thought we avoided lymphedema -- and honestly, with everything else that went on, life was good without it. But a few months ago, my mom's affected arm blew up. We haven't found the right combination of sleeves, wrapping, massage, exercise yet, and my mom is starting to get vaguely depressed over this complication. We have one good day followed by six bad ones, but we're working on it. All of this is a preface for my question: she has what look like two spider bites on her unaffected arm. They aren't swollen, but they are full of fluid. Should we be concerned about this as a complication? They aren't red, they aren't hot, we have been treating with neosporin and she is also on a general antibiotic for a suspected touch of pneumonia (4 days into a 10 day regimin). Can something like insect venom (presumably) cause issues? Any info anyone has would be so appreciated--and any tips to help us get this all lined out again would be wonderful.
