I hope you are able to have that time line brought up through a cancellation if nothing else.  Hoping the best for you.   ",

Atlanta01 - Chickenpants has it right, use the time to educate yourself.  It really helps, I did the same and am not panicing about my long wait time for the excisional in Sept.  I've been told the tumor is B9 and am not too worried even if something is uncovered that couldn't be detected.  Putting this in prospective aint easy at first but with educated knowledge of breast cancer and reading the experiences of the sisters here with breast cancer. It makes the wait a little more tolerable. I wouldn't say that because we don't pay for our healthcare that it's not a very good standard.  Long wait times are a headache but I feel most provinces try and address important issues that directly affect patient care.  ",

Yes, there many very good treatments for breast and other cancers now but it's the feeling that your fears aren't or shouldn't be validated and that you should just suck it up. OH REALLY!!!!  Now we all know that breast cancer is in the spot light quite often.  But, even with that, so many people don't get it.  Some want to and others don't.  You soon learn the people to keep close and those who should be kept at a distance if bothered with at all.  There's nothing easy about the diagnostic process emontionally.  I liken my emotions to being up and down like a toilet seat.  Not knowing is the hardest part of this and that's very understood here.  Be kind to yourself and don't push how your feeling out of the picture.  Coming here allows for emotional and very practical support.

On your question about birads 4, mine was birads 5 because the papilloma was surrounded by dense tissue and there was scar tissue.  There was too much going on but it turned out to be B9 even with a higher birads.   Wishing you the best for a B9 outcome and keeping you in my thoughts.  ",

There is only regular bruising with the excisional and today some uncomfortable but, manageable pain. Call your dr on Monday anyway just to be sure.  When I saw the surgeon for the first time in July, I told him the breast still hurt.  He told me it can take 3 months to properly heal from the biopsy.  I feel the healing is going better with the surgery then it did with the biopsy. Look at your instructions for care post biopsy and see if anything suggested there might help with the pain.  Take it easy too hon.  Yes a biopsy is minor surgery but preasure and movement can cause issues. Take it easy, hope your dr can help.  Hugs ",

Lifting and such can cause discomfort too and that might have just agrivated things a little.  I did have alot of discomfort in my under arm and I noticed it because my summer tops rubbed on that side.  Now they don't.  Ya, I was told, no alcahol and no anti inflamitories like asprin and ibprofen (?sp) and such.  As for me, I'm still trying to wrap my head around what happened.  Difficult intubation is handled by intubating the patient while they are awake so certain meds don't have to be used that make it easier for intubation.  They didn't follow the protocol from the last time where I was semi awake and I think they will have to answer to their boss for that cause he set that protocol for me.  And as to why the local freezing didn't work that great....That ment the surgeon couldn't go as deep as he wanted.   So I'm really not feeling great emotionally.  What happrened to me has so many implacations in regards to any future surgery I may need and I'm having trouble coming to terms with that.  Then there's waiting for the results from the excisional.  I know, I know, it's *very* unlikely it won't come back B9 but I'm not feeling too confident about anything right now.  Sorry for dumping on your thread Kimmer, didn't mean too. You don't need anymore to worry about either girl. :)  Let us know how your doing and what the doc says.  Hugs",

I'll know where I'm going with this once I see the surgeon.  But given recovery from the biopsy didn't go as I thought it should have, I'm a little concerned regarding surgery.  It's so stupid because it's a small procedure but I am concerned about recovery from surgery.   I continue to support my friend who's mom has BC and pray that all turns out well for her and her family.  I go for my 6 month check up for melanoma in a week.  I had 3 lesions removed in Dec. and hope all is quiet on the westron front at this next visit. Again, thanks to everyone for your support.       ",

It's wonderful to know how much others love you and how important you are to them and, how valuable their support is to you. It's not weakness to be scared. It's good to cry and even better to laugh. It's time to allow for forgiveness and to be forgiving in turn. It's wonderful to be blessed with the knowledge that nothing is for granted and to appreciate what we have and who we are. Hugs to all. ",

It can be frustrating when we only want the best for them but hey, they are our moms and I'm sure they felt the same when we were kids and we made them worry. LOL   I can still hear the, 'get home before dark', 'phone me when you get there' and the best, 'don't go out without clean underwear on'.  No matter how old we are, they worry about us though and will still say that they, know best cause they're mom.",

The core biopsy came back with the same but the papilloma was in dense tissue so the surgeon didn't want to second guess anything. I got the final results on Monday GreenSeaTurtle - That's very interesting about fish oils and vitamin E.  I have had many excisional biopsies for melanoma and have noticed lately that I bleed easier now post surgery.  Not open flow just need to do more wound care now.  Hmmmm, I intended talking to my doc about that when I'm next in.  I'm going to mention this, thanks.  I don't take either but, it's got me thinking that there might be soemthing else in my diet that's causing the issues I'm having.",
