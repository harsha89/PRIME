I felt a little bit more than just pressure. :( I was also unprepared for the drilling sound that the needle made. Anyway, I'm ok tonight. I'm not sore and feeling fine. I should have the results on Wednesday. I'm requesting prayers and positive thoughts. The radiologist that performed the surgery sounded hopeful and gave me some ideas about what kind of benign conditions were possible. Thanks again for your support.",

I called a Breast Care Center in Atlanta, I think they are supposed to be the best around here. They can't see me until mid-December so they suggested that I go ahead and have the biopsy as planned on Monday and call to schedule with them after results are in whether positive or negative. Does that sound good? Either way, I may go back to the surgeon for him to give me my results, but I'm not going to him for any surgery or treatment plan IF needed. Also, is a BIRAD category 5 ever NOT cancer?? Anyone experienced that. (Be honest) I LOVE the thorough information and advice. Keep it coming! The more information I have the better I feel. Is that weird? I guess I feel that information is power in these situations. Thanks so much ladies.",

I was so upset! I told her that I wanted to be told over the phone either way and her response was, \"we'll see.\" Thankfully I also had a copy of the report sent to my GYN and I called them yesterday. One of the dr's was sympathetic and said that she would call me as soon as she got the report (which she expexts to be TODAY) and would let me know over the phone either way. What a relief. I'll be updating later today. Thanks as always for your thoughts and prayers.",

No malignancy identified.  THANK YOU GOD!  I am concerned that the surgeon's office simply called and said, you're fine with no details.  I pressed for them to fax me the report and they finally did.  Many of you stated that they would probably want to take it out anyway, but there was no mention of that.  I am not one to borrow trouble, but I am still going to the Breast Care Center here in Atlanta and see what they think.  Maybe even have them take a look at the slides??  What does everyone think?",
