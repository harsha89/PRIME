Some good news about the whole waiting game.  I received the \"where to go for the MRI, a questionaire and where to pick up the dye\" packet in the mail yesterday.  Things are a bit different over here.  We actually have to go to a pharmacist to pick up our own dye and bring it.  Anyway, the information from the MRI center said that the radiologist on site will give me the results before I leave.  Cool.  No waiting.  The only thing that has me ever so slightly worried during this long wait until I can get the MRI (due to the whole post-period thing) is that I live in a country with socialized medicine which means the state pays for all this and therefore only performs an MRI for high risk patients.  Something like 80% come out positive here.  I have a slightly weird question now... has anyone experienced the clinical personality change thing?  By that I mean when you go in for a round of screening at first your treated like a number and shuffled through, but then when they find something everyone turns super sweet and says \"ah\" a lot?  I think the sudden personality change in the clinical staff has me more worried than anything.  That and the fact that the radiologist said that get a frequent flyers card soon as we'll be seeing a lot of each other.  A little joke that I actually found funny at the time, but now find myself walking around the house saying \"bugger bugger bugger\" all day.",

      "Content": "MsP wrote: Firstly, hello and happy new year!  I've had one of those weeks that I'm sure many here know all too well.  A routine gyno visit on Tuesday found a lump I hadn't noticed - I have very dense pre-menopausal breasts.  The doctor called right away for an emergency mammo.  Thursday the mammo showed a big cyst and the radiologist decided to do ultrasound right then and there.  The ultra sound showed a couple more cysts and 7 non-cysts (all between 1 and 2cm, 5 on the right and 2 on the left).  The radiologist then asked when I expected my next period and made an appointment right away for an MRI.  That's on the 26th due to having to wait until my period is over.  Anyway, the nodules that aren't cysts are basically oval with weird shaped surfaces, there's some calcification and they are densely packed together on my right breast.  The radiologist said there is no point in biopsy for all of them and wants to select candidates after the MRI.  They appear grey and speckled on the ultrasound. He also said it was too difficult to see if there were more with ultrasound because they were in a sort of nest on the right side. Bit of history... I'm 46, breastfed for 2 years, smoke, drink have a stressful job, blah blah blah.  I'm a scientist so speak fluent techie and I live in France (thank God for the healthcare system here!). Oh, and for the record I didn't smoke or drink while breastfeeding! :) Anyway, I have the usual \"no flipping clue\" what's going on syndrom.  It's all happening so quickly.  Thanks for any words of advice in advance.  I'm sure it's nothing.  All the best, P Log in to post a reply",
