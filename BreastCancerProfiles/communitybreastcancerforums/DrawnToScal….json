I would think that parents (or those looking to become parents) would do what they can to provide the best for their child.  Isn't a 50-80% likelihood of early onset cancer worth avoiding?   Has the survival rate for breast or ovarian cancer changed much over the last 20-30 years?  I'm counting on (and so is my genetics councelor) similar outcomes 20-30 years from now.  As for legitimate reasons to abort - many people abort simply because they are not ready for a child.  Isn't this an even better reason? My sister (who is BRCA1+ and was diagnosed with BC at age 39 and had double mastectomy & ovaries out) tells me that if I have a child the \"normal\" way, that would be the ultimate in selfishness.  What do you think of her opinon?  Joel",
