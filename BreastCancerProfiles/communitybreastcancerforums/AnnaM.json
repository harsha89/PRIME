I did not feel any of what you are describing, but I do know the mind can play tricks on you. It's a good thing you went to see your doctor. Ask if they can schedule you as soon as possible when you talk to the people at the breast center. Be honest with them and tell them about your fears. Waiting is always the worst part. I hope you get very good news, and soon. I'll be coming back to your thread to hear from you. Know you are not alone. Anna",

Right now it's coming down again and we already have an additional two inches. Hubs has a bad back and the dog is too short. I'm a bilateral girl. I'm taking it very very very easy. We go out (minus dog) and do 20 minutes of shoveling or so, then come in and play a game of cards. Obviously we can't do the driveway or anything big. We hired someone with a snow blower on Sunday and might have to do that again. What we did have to do is dig out one of our doors so we can get out of the house in case of an emergency if the power goes out and we can no longer go through the garage (electric doors). I figure as long as we take our time and I don't keep going too long I'll be okay. I clear out the dog's pee patch off the back porch just about once an hour; that way there's never too much and I don't get tired. Thanks for the reminder to drink, I tend to forget that at times . . .",

Early. No problem as long as I react and all that. I had a bilateral mastectomy with DIEP flap reconstruction on September 14th. I was told there was a 1 - 3% chance of positive nodes, but they would do a sentinel node dissection on each side all the same. I had positive nodes. 0 of 4 on one side, and 2 of 2 on the other. My pathology report still is not complete. They can't find the invasion in the breast tissue and are trying to get the hospital where I had the initial surgical biopsy to recut the slides to see if there was a tiny tumor in there that might have been overlooked. I saw one oncologist last Friday who said I am now stage III. I cried all weekend. I just lost it. It was worse than grieving over losing both breasts and all feeling there. She called back yesterday and said it's more likely I'm stage II. That came five days late. I'm trying to get my hopeful attitude back. She said 4 rounds of A/C and 4 of Taxol. 3 weeks spacing. That sounds like a whole lifetime! Then radiation. She wants to know if the breast surgeon is going to take out more nodes. He said there is no point, the jury is out on that, it'll only make lymphedema concerns worse. I'm seeing another oncologist today. I'm pretty lost. I don't know about the estrogen factor. Will the pathology report automatically tell me about HER 2? I have to recuperate more from the reconstruction to start chemo. If I had had any idea maybe I wouldn't have put myself through the reconstruction.",

      "Content": "Mar 30, 2009 02:11AM AnnaM wrote: I agree with both of you, the worst part of any medical experience is the waiting! One of my friends works in a doctor's office. Every time she gets sent for a PET scan or any kind of test, she asks the doctor to write \"wet reading\" on the script. This means that the testing facility gets back to the doctor's office with its preliminary reading right away. If you then tell your doctor's office that you will call for your results you might have less of the hellish wait time. This is why computerizing medical information (in a safe way, of course) would help us patients. In other countries you get an MRI in the morning and your doctor's office has the results (sent via computer) that afternoon and you can get your results immediately. No, it never hurts to ask for an earlier biopsy date, Momof6. I hope they honor your request and call you if there's a cancellation, etc. You are right to stay positive and to remember that the vast majority of suspicious lumps are totally benign. Take a deep breath and know that you can handle this. Nboerner, oh yes they sure would be interested in anything that looked even slightly suspicious. Don't think being called back means something ominous is going on. Radiologists always want to be absolutely certain that inconsistencies are just that, inconsistencies. I had no pain anywhere before my diagnosis, and I don't believe pain is necessarily a clear indicator of cancer. I found the MRI guided needlebiopsy to be one of the less stressful of all the diagnostic tests I had. I hope both of you get your answers soon, and I hope your answers are the ones that will make coming to this site unnecessary. If not, know that you have a lot of sisters here who will help you in any way they can. One final suggestion: I would stay away from Dr. Google for the time being. Everything there always sounds so terrifying and all of us can find ourselves somewhere in the vortex of symptoms that make up the online medical world. Thank goodness you have those little ones to keep showing you what matters. Anna",

I too got that wonder drug (Emend) and didn't ever feel nauseous. They gave me something called Ativan in case I ever felt anxious and while I didn't take it often, it made me feel very peaceful when I needed to. Yes, my hair fell out (actually, I shaved my head before it did so because I didn't want to go through seeing hair on my pillow), but I did chemo during the winter and loved wearing soft hats all the time. I discovered I have a beautiful head and had to keep my family from rubbing it all the time. I felt nauseous after every surgery, but not with the chemo. I joined a group of women on these threads who were doing chemo at the same time I was and we shared tips and laughed together. We still keep in touch via that thread and others on this site. Chemo was very doable. You deserve to do everything you can to stay here as long as possible because we need you here. Anna",

The pathologist had to do three studies on my breast tissue because they couldn't figure out where the cancer cells came from. They were all less than 3 mm. There was no tumor in the breast tissue. My BS advised against going back and taking out more nodes. That's why I got chemo. Dianne, your hair will indeed come back. Mine came back very very curly and it stayed curly for about one year. It's back to where it was before now, but there seems to me more of it. Weird, huh? I really can't complain. I got myself a cheap wig during chemo and it was very cute, but I only wore it a handfull of times. I got lots of compliments and couldn't figure out why people didn't see it was a wig.

I agree with London-Virginia (by the way, I live in Virginia so I'm partial to your name, L-V), you have to learn to be selective. I pretty much tune out things that sound worrisome and have developed a friendly bubble for protection. Anyway, you must be incredibly overwhelmed. I remember before my diagnosis, when I'd go in for a mammogram and they'd make me come back or stay for an ultrasound because I had such dense breast tissue, I remember thinking please God don't let me have breast cancer because I don't ever want to have to learn all that stuff they need to know. Well, I was right about all the stuff I had to learn about. Look forward to the day when you can forget all about it. That day will come. 31 years old! You are so young. And so many of you have young children. Thank you, Diana, for your positive post. I love to hear those things. I'm four years out from diagnosis. How did I hear mine? It was ten days after my bilateral MX. I thought my surgery was entirely prophylactic. You know, widespread, multifocal DCIS on one side and LCIS on the other. It was a Friday and I was relaxing on my couch with a book. My BS called from his car phone on the way to a bar mitzvah, I remember him saying that. Then he said they couldn't find any cancer cells in the breast tissue but that I had two positive nodes (micromets) on the side where they had taken two nodes and nothing on the side where they had taken nine nodes. I sure wish they had taken more nodes on that 2-node side . . . He said it was all very mysterious and that they would re-do the pathology on the breast tissue and then he went into a tunnel and we were cut off. Since it was a Friday I had to wait till Monday to talk to him about it. That was a bad weekend. I did the doctor google dance and it was a bad dance. Hugs to all!",

It's good to come home!  I hope you get some good news, Mouse. You and Lauren are just a year older than my daughter! Sooooooo young.  About tests, my onc. says only when I present with changes. I have had to go in for a few, once when she felt something different under my arm and once when my PCP was worried about a persistent cough. Both times led to the terrible testing wheel they put you on when a test is either inconclusive or shows something that can't be easily explained. In the first instance it ended up being some scar tissue, in the second it was acid reflux. Both times were terrifying though, one led to an ultrasound guided needle biopsy and the other led to CT scans with and without contrast. I to wish I could get an occasional \"all's clear,\" but I am trying to learn to live without because tests never seem to give me that.  ",

In terms of wigs, I got a synthetic one and nobody (exc. for my close friends and family who saw me without the wig most of the time) knew it was a wig. Call the American Cancer Society and ask them if there is a \"Look Good Feel Better\" class scheduled in your area. Many hospitals sponsor this class once a month. They'll show you different types of wigs (my local hospital even had wigs to lend out, you can wash them and they're good to go) and how to use eyebrow pencils etc. so you don't feel weird without your facial hair. They'll teach you how to care for your wig as well. There are some strange things you wouldn't think of that go along with losing your hair, like a runny nose, for instance. Those little nose hairs really do their job it seems. I doubt you'll want to invest a whole lot of money into a wig anyway. You might find yourself wearing a nice turban, a scarf or just a fleece hat much of the time. Real hair wigs are very hot. There are light synthetic ones and heavy synthetic ones. The light ones are obviously less uncomfortable. There's a mail order company that sells oh so many different styles and colors of wigs for low prices (www.paulayoung.com/). They also sell turbans and other stuff. Anyone who has had surgery to the breast is at risk for lymphedema, regardless of the number of nodes taken. Do yourself a favor and check out the lymphedema (LE) board here on this site. I had some LE issues one year post-surgery (on the side where two nodes were taken), caught it early and followed Binney's (one of our kindest members here, a real darling) advice. I have been okay since I learned how to avoid stressing my system and how to care for myself if I do. (Knock on wood.) I do not have to wrap. Many do. it's good to be in control. Don't expect any advice from your healthcare providers. Medical techs don't know there is such a thing as lymphedema. Doctors don't want to know anything about it. it's something they can't control and they don't study it in medical school. Nobody knows who is LE-risky. It has to do with how your lymph system works and everyone's is different, just like that thumbprint. I hope all of you who are starting chemo have found a group of chemo sisters here. If not, go to the Chemotherapy thread and look. You'll get so many tips for how to deal with any issues that might arise from people who are going through what you are going through. And many women who are a month or so \"ahead\" of you will post on your thread with their input. I remember being totally unprepared for the steroid high I got six or so hours after receiving Decadron with my Taxol infusions. I'd be totally psyched and would clean all my closets and drawers and then look for more to do. Unfortunately this always happened at night, so there was nobody to sing and dance with and it didn't last into the next day. It only happened 12 times. I haven't had to clean my closets or drawers since. Hugs to all of you! Anna",

I'm not sure how they do things in the UK, but I would think that if she's had a bilateral MX and they've gone back in to remove more nodes it's because they want to be sure about the staging. That will tell them if your mom will need chemo and/or rads. Waiting two weeks for the pathology report seems awfully long. I hope you find they were being overly cautious. Good luck.

To Heidi's family: I hope it will one day give you some confort to know how much love Heidi has instilled in all of us here. I imagine that love is mirrored by all the people she has touched in her life. Heidi, I pray that you continue to feel the serenity and peace that Little Bro has described for us here. Your final steps will take you home, where love and comfort will surround you, and where illness will cease even to be a memory. I have no doubt but that you have instilled in your children the same joy and love you sent snowballing through these pages, and I believe they will be forever strengthened by your example. It is hard for us to let you go, but I know I will meet you one day and I hope that I can follow your example and finish my journey in grace and beauty. I believe we are all here on a path to perfection. I guess I am still here because I have more to learn before moving on. You are so young - you must have be very far ahead on your path. You are obviously needed elsewhere. I send you all the love I have, and lots of very gentle hugs, too. Anna",

The new one is fine, but she was concerned about a node in my armpit and wanted more information. I have had an MRI and an ultrasound study, but both were inconclusive, so she has me scheduled for a needle biopsy of that node on Tuesday. I am freaking out. It's not just the fact that this is a replay of where I was exactly two years ago. I have been so careful about needles/cuffs/everything and have managed to control my LE thus far. Is there anything I can do to minimize my risk of aggravating the LE during and after this procedure? Anna Bilat. MX + DIEP 9/2005, 0/9 nodes and 2/2 nodes; IDC, Log in to post a reply",
