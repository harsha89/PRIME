Thanks for the information it was nice to hear from you hope all goes well for you.  By the way we both share the same birthday only I am a few years older 49 wishing I was 38 again!!! Eileen",

This is my second experience with breast cancer and I have just finished my Radiotherapy(15 treatments) and completed 4 cycles of Taxotere and 2 cycles Zeloda. I am still on three weekly cycles of intrevenous Herceptin. I would like to ask anyone who has been on these treatments, mainly the Taxotere, whether they have experienced arthritic-like pains in their leg joints?And if so,how long did they last? My Taxotere finished in January yet I am still in severe pain with aches in my legs that are severely affecting my ability to walk and carry out normal everyday living. Anyone with similar experiences? Log in to post a reply",

I have not had ANA test but will consider  mentioning it to my ONC. Hope everything goes well for you thanks for the info Eileen",
