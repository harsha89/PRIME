I have had regular mammograms since then with nothing showing up in that area. Dr is sending me for an ultrasound but saying \"It feels like a lump of scar tissue\". If it hasn't been there for 14 years and just developed over the last 6 months, how could it be related to the prior surgery? Log in to post a reply",

It is very close to the skin and quite some distance from the original surgery. It doesn't help that my usual ob/gyn that I've had forever has had to retire due to health issues and this is a Doctor that I just met this week :( kfletch63",
