After suffering from the first time burning, a loving lady in the Rdiotherapy clinic told me about Radia kit. In fact it changed the adverse effects on my skin 180 degrees. I did not suffer any burning but just slight reddness which disappeared later leaving no scars like what happend in my first radiotherapy. Now I am 63 and stage IV and taking Tykarb + Xeloda, I am thinking to ask my physician to add Femara. Did anybody tried this combination Tykarb + Xeloda + Femara ?, any feedback will be much appreciated. God bless you friends Magda F. Todary  Log in to post a reply",
