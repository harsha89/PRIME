I started rads a month after my last chemo and don't have any experience with doing both simultaneously but I just wanted to tell you that I too have had issues with my underarm area. I also had my RO prescribe silvadene. I have had 29/33 with last 5 being boosts. Using a lindiskin cooling pad and lotion has also helped soothe the skin. I hope your skin heals quickly so you can continue with chemo.",

My back has also been bothering me but not to the point where I need to medicate. Over the last few days, the knee pain has intensified and now my leg, arm have started to hurt. I had a pet scan 5 weeks ago & it was clear. I've brought this to the attention of my RO but she says it's due to the chemo. I was basically called a hypochondriac by my gynecologist when I went to him a year ago about the pain in my breast. He said bc doesn't hurt. The pain in my breast is what led me to go back to that dr in Janaury of this year. He dismissed me again. No mammogram, just a physical exam. I'm grateful I listened to my body and went to another dr which resulted in my diagnosis. Anyhow, I'm confused as to whether what I'm experiencing is se of chemo or something else. I just turned 41 & was very active prior to this, was running at least 2-3 miles five days a week and now I feel like I'm 90 yrs old. I'm triple negative, BRACA1 positive, and quite honestly scared out of my mind.",
