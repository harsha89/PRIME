I started popping 2 with every meal before I started the radiation and I never even turned pink!! I'm very, very fair and blonde. The techs told me later they really thought they would crispy fry me! So I don't know if it was coincidence or truly the curcumin, but its only a pill form of curry and certainly can't hurt. I still take it because there's some other reseach out there saying they are studying it for other preventative measures. As far as the braless thing, I was also told that. Got some really nice camisole tops with the built-in bra shelf....they work wonderful! By the way I got my curcumin on the web.....Pure Prescriptions. Make sure none of your lotions have that ingredient in it that comes along with the sunburn warning alert. Can't think of the name right now. And also do your stretching exercises!!!!! I stopped for awhile right after the treatments because i thought the exercises were a waste of time, but I paid for it when all of a sudden i realized I couldnt lift my arm over my head without pain. Keep doing them! My doc had me \"write\" the alphabet on the wall every day!!!!! Keeps you limber. Good luck ladies!!!!!!!!!! ",
