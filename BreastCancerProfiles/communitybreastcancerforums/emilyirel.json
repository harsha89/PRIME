I've been unwell since June and have gone through asthma, flu, infection, etc and now definitely bc malignant and I'm in a bit ofa shock bubble. It's Friday and I getting calls from different people booking me in for urgent appointments next week.. this is before seeing the oncologist some time next week for a proper talk prognosis etc. it's a roller coaster.",

My first cancer diagnosis was so quick and simple and I went in to staging and treatment straight away. I am attending the same hospital which is big and well resourced. All the specialists are there. The main difficulty is that the techs can't tell me anything,. I have to wait for my doctors to meet next week and then my consultation after that. In the meantime I'm quite unwel with this respiratory thing. The first CT was of my chest, no contrast. This Identifies a shadow round my left bronchial tube and partial collapse. The second and third CT were the chest and abdomen using the contrast solution. Gave us more info about the lung problem, and identified the gynaecological problem. ",

Different from my initial diagnosis which was cancer as soon as I saw the mammogram picture... I've had a bad chest cough for months and many tests. I still have no diagnosis and am in some discomfort with breathing and coughing.... we are hoping the flixotase im huffing will help calm the irritation. over the last weeks I've had multiple GP visits, a consultation with my oncologist, a blood test, chest X-ray, 3 CT scans, spirometry test, coming up tomorrow another spirometry test, bronchoscopy the next day, then a visit to the respiratory specialist next week- hopefully with staging/ a diagnosis, also have a mammogram and as of today, I've been referred to see a gynaecologist about cervical issues..... lungs- left not inflating properly, but no signs of calcification, infection, no inflamed lymph ( this is good). Left bronchial blockage - need to take samples to decide on a remedy- possibly breast/ or lung cancer. Heart- good Liver, kidneys and other organs - good ( tho liver enzymes v. High) Lady bits- TBC. Thickened lining and irregular heterogenous appearance...gynaecologist wil need to take samples and check fior cervical cancer. Hoping for an easy resolution to all this. Thanks for reading",
