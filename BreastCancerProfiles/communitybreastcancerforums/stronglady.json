My LE therapist's objections to bracelets are twofold: 1) she's not convinced that emergency personnel actually look at them, 2) she thinks the ones that look like jewelry are particularly likely to be overlooked. So she says that if you're going to wear one, make sure it's the ugly, traditional medic alert style. (Personally, I found one that's sort of in-between: it has a jewelry-like bracelet with a big ugly medic alert-type tag. So, as Rose suggests, I can turn it over to look like a bracelet in meetings, etc.)",

      "Content": "stronglady wrote: Hi, folks. This is partly a rant and partly a question. My LE had been doing really well lately: the arm measurements were in the normal range, I was wrapping at night and wearing a sleeve & gauntlet during the day. Also wrapping to exercise. I'd never had any hand swelling except in the early days, when we were adjusting the bandaging. Then, a couple of weeks ago, my knuckles started to swell. I assumed it was because the gauntlet had started to stretch out. Fortunately, another gauntlet had been ordered to replace a defective one (what did I used to do with my time?). So since Thursday, I've been wearing the new gauntlet. Yesterday, my fingers swelled up for the first time in a gauntlet. So now I can't figure out whether: a) the original knuckle-swelling really meant that a gauntlet is no longer adequate and I now need a glove (DARN!) or b) the new gauntlet is a problem. I'll call me LE therapist and the gauntlet provider tomorrow, and I'm bandaged up for now. So the question part: has anyone else had their lymphedema show up in new places after months (in my case, around 8 months) of treatment? Or longer? And the rant part: I just needed to have people who would understand it when I say that THIS STINKS!!!!!!!!!! -Leslie Stay strong! Log in to post a reply",
