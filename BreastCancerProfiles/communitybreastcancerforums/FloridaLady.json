I used milk thistle for my liver, curcumin, iodine, enzymes for digestion because chemo's kill all of them in your stomach.  I took many other vitamins/supplements that I do believed helped me. I have continue to work through 7 different chemos, 3 surgeries.  I could rebuild my blood within 3 days after chemo. Wishing you the best. Flalady",

Usually move to real bad places.  Also you have time to look at treatment options. I've had 53 nodes all positive for bc.  Still no other mets! If they can be reached by surgery push for that!  My tumor's did not respond to chemo's more than two hits. Also if you have not had radiation don't do it.  Rads keep chemo from going to tumors on radiation chest wall because of slowed blood and cellular activity. 11/5 - 1st radical mast than DD ACT & rads (1) 7/6 - I found other breast (2) and spread to skin (3)    started Avastin (not in a trial) with Gemzar and Carboplatinum    This did clear up my skin. 1/7 - MD Anderson Houston - did a Phase I trial because if you do not respond to standard protocol with no mets, they don't know what to do with you. For me the trial did nothing. 6/7 - 2nd radical mast. 9/7 - met back on first mast site - chest wall and under arm(4 &5) 12/7 - back on 2nd mast site - deep under arm(6) THAT IS SIX NOT FIVE! I have not had chemo in 8 months because of severe neuropathy from drug trial.  (I feel great other than the neuropathy.)I have a PET scan on the 6th.  Hoping for some good news for once. Wishing you a easy journey with getting the proper treatment. Living in hope, Flalady",

Over the past 20 years, more than 15,000 women with advancer breast cancer have been treated using this unproven modality of treatment. This idea stems from the unproven theory \"more is better\" in terms of chemotherapy. High dose chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplant exposes the patient to very high risks of side effects from the chemotherapy. This treatment uses very high doses of chemotherapy in an attempt to kill all the cancer cells. The bone marrow is not able to tolerate such high doses of chemotherapy, hence bone marrow stem cells from the patient is collected prior to chemotherapy to give back to the patient once high dose chemotherapy is completed. This taking of bone marrow stem cells and giving it back to the patient is called autologous bone marrow transplant. In the early 1990s, after a few studies showing encouraging preliminary results, breast cancer patients and advocates began demanding the treatment. Even some state legislatures responded by mandating that insurance companies pay for the intensive procedure, which can cost up to $100,000 per case, much more than conventional treatments. Vast majority of patients who were treated with high dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant received the treatment outside the setting of any clinical trials. This resulted in continuation of this experimental modality of treatment without proper evaluation. In the late 1990s, many randomized clinical trials were initiated to evaluate this treatment modality. The results of three of these trials were available by early 2000. The results from two such clinical trials showed that high doses of chemotherapy were no more effective than standard chemotherapy for women with advanced or high-risk breast cancer. Results from the third study contradicted these findings and came out in favor of the high-dose treatment. However, this study was later discounted after the lead South African researcher admitted fraud and misconduct. As the results of these clinical trials became available the high dose chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplant started falling out of favor among oncologists in the United States. At that point, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommended that women receive the treatment only if they were taking part in a \"high-quality\" clinical trial. Leading medical journals like the New England Journal of Medicine and Lancet expressed agreement with the ASCO recommendations. At this time high dose chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplant remains as an experimental approach, which needs further evaluation, using randomized clinical trials. Studies are ongoing in this field, but it unlikely to show any substantial benefit that would justify the side effects of high dose chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant.",

Over the last 30 years, researchers have developed more effective treatments for cancers like childhood leukemia, Hodgkin's disease and testicular cancer. Death rates for some common cancers, like breast and prostate cancer, have gone down due to advances in early detection and prevention. However, the survival rate for patients with many advanced cancers has not changed significantly for decades, and cancer is still the second-most common cause of death in the United States. At the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center, we believe one reason for this lack of progress is that traditional therapies - like surgery, chemotherapy and radiation - do not destroy the small number of cells driving the cancer's growth. Instead of trying to kill all the cells in a tumor with chemotherapy or radiation, we believe it would be more effective to use treatments targeted directly at these so-called cancer stem cells. If the stem cells were eliminated, the cancer would be unable to grow and spread to other locations in the body. Commitment to Cancer Stem Cell Research What are cancer stem cells? Cancer stem cells are the small number of cells within a tumor that are capable of fueling the tumor's growth. These cells generally represent fewer than 5 percent of all cells in a tumor.   Read more The U-M Comprehensive Cancer Center is one of only a few research institutions in the United States and Canada that has made an institutional commitment to cancer stem cell research. Organized teams of U-M scientists are studying cancer stem cells in many different types of cancer - including adrenal, breast, colon, head and neck, leukemia, lung, melanoma, myeloma, pancreatic, prostate and thyroid cancers. By working together and sharing information, Cancer Center scientists hope to make progress more rapidly than would be possible for individual scientists working alone. We believe new treatments designed to target and destroy cancer stem cells could revolutionize the way physicians treat cancer. Our goal is to be the world's leader in research on cancer stem cells and in the development of new stem cell-based therapies for cancer patients",

The purpose of receiving cancer treatment may be to improve symptoms through local control of the cancer, increase a patient's chance of cure, or prolong a patient's survival. The potential benefits of receiving cancer treatment must be carefully balanced with the potential risks of receiving cancer treatment. The following is a general overview of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant for the treatment of stage IV breast cancer. Circumstances unique to your situation and prognostic factors of your cancer may ultimately influence how these general treatment principles are applied. The information on this Web site is intended to help educate you about your treatment options and to facilitate a mutual or shared decision-making process with your treating cancer physician. Most new treatments are developed in clinical trials. Clinical trials are studies that evaluate the effectiveness of new drugs or treatment strategies. The development of more effective cancer treatments requires that new and innovative therapies be evaluated with cancer patients. Participation in a clinical trial may offer access to better treatments and advance the existing knowledge about treatment of this cancer. Clinical trials are available for most stages of cancer. Patients who are interested in participating in a clinical trial should discuss the risks and benefits of clinical trials with their physician. To ensure that you are receiving the optimal treatment of your cancer, it is important to stay informed and follow the cancer news in order to learn about new treatments and the results of clinical trials. Stage IV breast cancer has traditionally been considered an incurable cancer. In the mid to late 1980's the average patient with stage IV breast cancer treated with low-dose chemotherapy survived 8-10 months before their cancer relapsed and less than 5% of patients could expect to survive 5 years without their cancer recurring. In 1988, the results of a small clinical trial treating 22 women with stage IV breast cancer treated with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant were published. Fourteen percent of these patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy survived without their cancer recurring beyond 5 years. By 1997, these patients had been observed over 10 years and the original 14% remain alive without a relapse of their cancer and appear cured of their disease. It is important to understand that because over 50% of patients with stage IV breast cancer relapse, it is not useful to compare the response rate to chemotherapy, the average duration of survival or time to relapse. When evaluating treatment strategies in stage IV breast cancer, patients should compare the percent of patients alive with or without relapse 3-5 years from treatment to determine whether a treatment is truly superior. Over the years since the original publication describing high-dose chemotherapy for the treatment of stage IV breast cancer, thousands of women have been treated. All of the more recent publications demonstrate that the complete remission rate for high-dose chemotherapy as initial treatment for stave IV breast cancer is 40%-60%, the mortality from therapy has decreased to 1%-5% and the number of patients alive without evidence of cancer recurrence is 15%-25% 4-5 years from treatment. The results from two clinical trials comparing high-dose to lower dose chemotherapy have also been published. In one clinical trial published in 1997, women in complete remission after induction chemotherapy were treated with high-dose chemotherapy or no further treatment. At 5 years from diagnosis, 24% of the women treated with immediate high-dose chemotherapy survived without disease recurrence, compared to only 8% of the women who did not receive further treatment. Researchers from several medical centers, however, more recently treated 553 women, ages 18 to 60 years, with 4 to 6 cycles of a standard-dose chemotherapy combination. Then, patients in a complete or a partial remission were assigned to receive additional therapy with either continued standard-dose chemotherapy or a single course of high-dose chemotherapy. Results showed that, of the 553 women treated, 10.5% had a complete response and 46% had a partial response to the initial standard-dose chemotherapy. Then, 110 patients were assigned to receive the additional high-dose chemotherapy and 89 patients were assigned to receive the additional standard-dose chemotherapy. The 3-year survival rates were 38% for those receiving the standard chemotherapy, and 32% for those receiving the high-dose chemotherapy. Twelve percent of those in the standard-dose group had no progression of disease, compared with only 6% in the high-dose group. Furthermore, there were more side effects in the high-dose therapy group, including one treatment-related death. This study suggested that there were no differences in survival between the standard-dose and high-dose chemotherapy regimens in women with metastatic breast cancer who had a complete or partial response to initial standard-dose therapy. However, the number of women treated in this trial does not allow the identification of any subsets of women that might benefit more than the overall group from the high-dose regimen. High-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant treatment for previously untreated stage IV breast cancer appears safe; however, the benefit of this treatment approach is currently unknown. It is known that many factors may influence an individual patient's potential outcome if treated with high-dose chemotherapy. Patients without prior treatment, those with small amounts of cancer, and those whose cancer responds to conventional chemotherapy all do better. Additional clinical trials directly comparing conventional chemotherapy treatments to high-dose chemotherapy treatments are currently ongoing to help determine which patients may benefit most from high-dose chemotherapy treatment. The main reason patients with breast cancer fail treatment is relapse. Relapse of breast cancer occurs because the high-dose chemotherapy is either unable to kill all the cancer cells in the patient and/or because cancer cells \"contaminating\" the stem cells are infused back into the patient. The majority of relapses occur because all the cancer cells were not destroyed by the high-dose chemotherapy treatment. However, some relapses may be due to infusion of breast cancer contaminated stem cells. Doctors are performing clinical trials designed to improve the treatment of breast cancer with high-dose chemotherapy that include the following approaches alone or in combination: Increased Treatment before High-Dose Chemotherapy: One strategy to improve outcomes is to increase the effectiveness of induction therapy so that patients have significant reduction in the number of malignant cells in the body before high-dose chemotherapy. Increased Dose Intensity:Since more treatment kills more cancer cells, increasing the intensity of treatment delivered to the cancer cells by utilizing high doses of anti-cancer therapies or by delivering multiple cycles of high-dose therapy is one strategy to improve cure rates. While increasing the intensity of treatment may kill more cancer cells, this approach may also damage normal cells and increase the toxicity or side effects of therapy. Monoclonal Antibodies: Monoclonal antibodies are a treatment that can locate cancer cells and kill them directly without harming normal cells. Herceptin® (trastuzumab) is the first monoclonal antibody approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of breast cancer. Herceptin® recognizes a protein on the cancer cell surface of 1 in 3 patients with breast cancer. In order to be treated with Herceptin® your doctor must test the breast cancer cells for the protein that Herceptin® recognizes. This protein is called Her 2-neu. Herceptin® or other monoclonal antibodies are not substitutes for other cancer treatments but have the advantage of being administered during or after high-dose chemotherapy and killing cancer cells by a different method than chemotherapy with the goal of improving the total treatment. Clinical trials are currently being performed to determine whether monoclonal antibodies administered during or after high-dose chemotherapy can improve survival or cure rates. Minimal Residual Disease: Following cancer treatment, patients often achieve a complete remission, (complete disappearance of the cancer). Unfortunately, many patients in remission still experience a relapse of their cancer. This is because not all the cancer cells were destroyed. Doctors refer to the this as a state of \"minimal residual disease\". Many doctors believe that applying additional cancer treatments when only a few cancer cells remain represents the best opportunity to prevent the cancer from returning. In addition to monoclonal antibodies, several centers are investigating vaccines which stimulate the body's immune system to kill breast cancer cells. None of these vaccines are yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration but are being evaluated on clinical trials. Biologic modifiers that stimulate the immune system are being evaluated to prevent or delay relapses after autologous stem cell transplantation. One such agent that is being tested in patients with breast cancer is interleukin-2. Newer biologics agents are in the developmental phase. Cell Processing: When stem cells are collected from a patient for infusion after high-dose chemotherapy, cancer cells may contaminate the stem cell collection. Although the majority of cancer relapses occurring after high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant occur because the high-dose chemotherapy did not kill all the cancer cells, it is possible that some patients may also relapse from infusion of the cancer cells \"contaminating\" the stem cells. Many techniques are being evaluated that effectively remove cancer cells from the stem cell collection. It is currently unknown whether enough cancer cells can be removed to decrease relapse rates.

      "Content": "FloridaLady wrote: Standard chemo works better against metastatic BRCA1/2 breast cancer than against sporadic tumorsApril 17th, 2008 in Medicine & Health / Cancer The first study to investigate the effects of chemotherapy on metastatic breast cancer in women with the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation has shown that standard chemotherapy works better in these patients than in women without the BRCA1/2 mutation. The authors of a study presented today (Thursday) at the 6th European Breast Cancer Conference (EBCC-6) in Berlin found that women with BRCA2-associated breast cancer had a significantly higher response rate, a longer time without the disease progressing, and a longer overall survival when treated with anthracycline-based regimens than did women with sporadic breast cancers that were not associated with BRCA1/2. Women with BRCA1-associated breast cancer also did better than women with sporadic breast cancer, but the rates were not statistically significant. Researchers at the Daniel den Hoed Cancer Centre/Erasmus Medical Centre (Rotterdam, The Netherlands) conducted the study. They matched 112 women with BRCA1-associated metastatic cancer and 29 women with BRCA2-associated metastatic cancer with 141 women with sporadic breast cancers. The women had been treated with anthracycline-based or taxane-based regimens, CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil 5FU) or other chemotherapy regimens. BRCA2 women had a higher response rate to chemotherapy (89% versus 50%), a longer progression-free survival (nearly a third better) and a longer overall survival (47% better) than did women with sporadic cancers. When the researchers looked more closely at the type of chemotherapy the women had received, they found that the improved progression-free survival mainly occurred in patients on anthracyclines and disappeared for those treated with CMF. The lead author of the study, Dr Mieke Kriege, an epidemiologist and project researcher at the Rotterdam Family Cancer Clinic, said: \"It is difficult to make firm conclusions about response to different treatments from our results so far, but it does seem that the higher sensitivity to treatment by BRCA2-associated patients is especially caused by the anthracycline regimen.\" The project leader, Professor Jan Klijn, medical oncologist and chairman of the Rotterdam Family Cancer Clinic, said: \"Our findings show that various standard chemotherapy regimens are clinically effective in the treatment of metastatic BRCA1/2-associated breast cancer. The observation of the high efficacy of anthracycline-based regimens is especially reassuring. However, we would like to emphasise that larger, additional studies are urgently needed to investigate further newer regimens containing taxanes and platinum compounds.\" Dr Kriege said: \"Currently, there are very few studies on the efficacy of chemotherapy in BRCA1/2-associated breast cancer - mainly a few, very small studies with less than 44 patients in the neo-adjuvant setting. Our study is the only one in metastatic disease and, with 141 BRCA1/2 gene mutation carriers included, it is by far the largest study in the world.\" The authors believe that an explanation of why chemotherapy seems to work better in BRCA1/2 breast cancers than in sporadic cancers is due to the lack of a working BRCA1/2 protein. \"Functional BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins are involved in DNA repair,\" said Dr Kriege. \"Most chemotherapeutic agents are active by damaging DNA (especially anthracycline-based regimens). In BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, who have no functional BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins respectively, DNA repair after chemotherapy might be worse than in sporadic patients resulting in better treatment responses. Pre-clinical studies showed that BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutated cells are especially sensitive to chemotherapeutic agents that cause double-strand DNA breaks (such as anthracyclines and platinum).\" The researchers now plan to investigate the effects of adjuvant and neo-adjuvant treatments in women with BRCA1/2-associated breast cancers, and to evaluate taxane and platinum therapies further. trip neg stageIV spread to IBC (2X) & 7 recur's, Treat Alt & Conv Log in to post a reply",

High blood sugar (hyperglycemia) wasn't tied to men's overall cancer risk. But when researchers looked at specific types of cancer, they found that both men and women with the highest blood sugar levels were more likely to have pancreatic cancer, urinary tract cancer, and malignant melanoma (the most deadly type of skin cancer) than those with the lowest blood sugar levels. Keeping blood sugar levels within the normal range \"may reduce cancer risk,\" write the researchers, who included Par Stattin, MD, PhD, of Sweden's Umea University Hospital. For the study, Stattin's team invited all residents of a county in northern Sweden to sign up for the study when they were 40, 50, or 60 years old. Nearly 64,600 people accepted the offer. All were nonsmokers without diabetes or a history of cancer (except for 1,435 people who had had nonmelanoma skin cancer). Upon enrolling in the study, participants took a blood test after fasting, and another after drinking a sugary drink. Most participants had normal results in both tests. The data show normal blood sugar results for at least 85% of the group after fasting and at least 92% after the sugary drink. Study's Results The researchers followed participants for eight years, on average. Overall, women with the highest blood sugar levels upon joining the study were more likely to be diagnosed with cancer before its end, compared with women with the lowest blood sugar levels. Also, cancer of the lining of the uterus (endometrial cancer) was more common in women with the highest blood sugar levels, compared with those with the lowest blood sugar levels. Breast cancer was more common for women younger than 49 with high blood sugar levels, compared with those with the lowest blood sugar levels, the study also shows. The results held when researchers considered other factors, such as participants' weight and age. Their study appears in the March edition of Diabetes Care.",

Alzheimer's disease is linked with type 2 diabetes, but researchers say the link may develop much before patients are identified as diabetic. The condition with high blood sugar levels that is not yet in the established diabetesrange is called pre-diabetes. Researchers from Stockholm's Karolinska Institute said that people with higher than normal blood sugar levels could be at an increased risk for developing Alzheimer's disease at a later stage. The researchers presented the findings of their nine-year study on the opening day of the 10th International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders in Madrid. The study, which was conducted in collaboration with researchers from the Stockholm Gerontology Research Center, included 1173 people aged 75 and older. They found that the risk of developing dementiawas highest in people with pre-diabetes who had high blood pressure as well. However the risk occurred only in those who did not carry a gene called apo E4, which raises the Alzheimer's risk. At the beginning of the study none of the participants had dementia or Alzheimer's disease. Around 47 of them were diagnosed as having pre-diabetes. The researchers followed the participants of the study for nine years and kept track of how many patients developed Alzheimer's. People who had pre-diabetes at the start of the study were found to have 70 percent increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. \"I was a little surprised,\" said lead researcher Weili Xu. Xu added that since increased exercise and changes in diet can improve borderline diabetes, it could also help in dementia. Another study found that the higher the blood sugar levels, the greater the risk of dementia. The study was led by Rachel A. Whitmer of Kaiser Permanente's Division of Research in Oakland. The conclusions were based on the records of 22,852 patients with Type 2 diabetes. None of them showed signs of dementia at the beginning of the study. Researchers followed up the patients for eight years. The researchers focused on glycosylated hemoglobin, which is a blood test that reflects blood sugar levels for the previous two months. The normal value is 7 or less. In the current study the researchers found the risk of dementia increased when this level reached 10. Patients with readings from 10 to 11.9 had 13 percent more risk of developing dementia or Alzheimer's Disease than people with levels under 10. Between 12 to 14.9, the risk of developing dementia was 24 percent higher and above 15, the risk rose to 83 percent higher. \"Tight control is important for the whole life span,\" Dr. Whitmer said. \"The older you are, the more likely you are to get dementia. With the whole diabetes epidemic we're seeing much more Type 2, so are we going to see even more Alzheimer's than we thought we would see? If we continue in this direction, it's a little bit frightening.\" Experts say that though these studies link diabetes and Alzheimer's the relation is not firmly established. The diseases are slightly similar to each other in that Alzheimer's disease comes about as a result of amyloid plaques in the brain. In diabetes, plaques are formed in pancreases and could kill off insulin-producing cells.",

      "Content": "Mar 1, 2009 05:07PM - edited Mar 1, 2009 05:08PM by FloridaLady The facts about sugar and cancer can be confusing. They often are presented in a way that is misleading and anxiety-producing for people with cancer. However, if you learn a bit about the science behind the connections between what we eat and cancer risk, you can make wise nutrition choices for better health. The concept that sugar feeds cancer is not useful. Sugar feeds every cell in our bodies. Our bodies need glucose, or simple sugar, for energy. Even if you cut every bit of sugar out of your diet, your body will make sugar from other sources, such as protein and fat. So cancer cells need sugar to grow, just like healthy cells. It helps to remember that there is nothing particular about sugar that \"feeds\" cancer cells any more than sugar feeds all cells in our body. Do I need to be concerned about sugar? Even though sugar doesn't exactly \"feed\" cancer cells, it is a good idea to limit the amount of simple sugar you eat. This is because when you eat a lot of sugar, your body produces a lot of insulin. Insulin is a natural substance made by the body. Insulin can tell cells to grow. In simple terms, insulin can \"rev up\" cell growth. For healthy cells, this is a good thing. This is because the cells in your body grow, divide, die, and are replaced as part of the natural process of living. However, cancer cells can be encouraged to grow more, too, when our bodies produce too much insulin. So while some insulin in the body is normal, excess insulin may encourage cancer cells to grow more, which is not a good thing (1-6).  This is the downside of insulin: Our bodies need it to function, but it's unhealthy if we make too much of it. In summary, sugar does not \"feed\" cancer cells. However, a lot of sugar can cause our bodies to produce too much insulin, and this is not good for health. Should I avoid all sugar? You don't have to avoid every bit of sugar in your diet. Nor should you avoid all carbohydrates. In fact, the best sources for healthy, complex carbohydrates such as vegetables, fruit, whole grains, and legumes (beans), are the very foods that appear to fight cancer best (7-17). So if you do not need to avoid all sugar and other carbohydrates, what is the answer? There are three other things in the diet that can help reduce the amount of insulin produced by the body when you eat sugar and carbohydrates. These are protein, fat, and fiber. When eaten along with even the simplest sugars, these three items help the body to make less insulin in response to simple sugar. If you eat sugar with some protein, some fat, or some fiber, your body won't produce as much insulin. Eating this other food helps your body process sugar more slowly, and this means that your body does not overproduce insulin. In short, protein, fat, and fiber help your body process sugar in a more healthful way. Putting the Information to Work for You For an example of how this works, think about fruit and fruit juice. The amount of insulin your body makes after you eat a piece of fruit is much lower than the amount of insulin produced when you drink fruit juice. Whole fruit contains fiber and that fiber helps balance out the sugar in fruit. For another example, think about eating specific foods together to get a healthier snack or meal. Instead of having two pieces of fruit as a snack, try having one piece of fruit and a small handful of nuts. The nuts contain protein, fat, and fiber. These three things help your body keep insulin in balance. The Bottom Line The most important point is that sugar itself is not bad. However, too much sugar, without enough protein, fat, and fiber to balance it out, can cause our bodies to make too much insulin. It is not the sugar, but rather the insulin that may be a problem for spurring cancer cell growth (18-33). To prevent this, you should limit the simple sugar in your diet. There is no need to follow a stringent diet and swear off every single dessert. The key is moderation. Use the following tips to help yourself find a healthy balance with your food choices:",

This week, the online life sciences magazine The Scientist published an article whose implications for breast cancer research are profound. Tumor cell lines - living cells taken from tumors and cultured in the laboratory - are the mainstay of cancer research at the most fundamental level, and are used as the model for studying tumor behavior and response to treatment. For the past 25 years, most of the laboratory research into metastatic breast cancer has been based on a single breast tumor cell line known as MDA-MB-435. At least 650 papers have been published on studies involving this cell line. Yet it has been revealed that this supposed breast cancer cell line may in fact not be composed of breast cancer cells at all. Instead, it appears that the cells are derived from melanoma. For 25 years, therefore, breast cancer research using this cell line - and it is one of the most widely used - has been based on an incorrect model. Melanoma-derived tumor cells are not biologically equivalent to breast cancer cells; they have different molecular and genetic characteristics. Cell lines - even when correctly sourced and identified - are an intrinsically flawed model, and in the past I have often cautioned against the tendency to read too much into the results of cancer research done on tumor cell lines. The inferential leap from Petri dish to living human cancer patient is simply too large: an enormous number of drugs and experimental techniques show significant activity in cultured cancer cell lines, only to exhibit no benefit whatever when given to human subjects in a clinical setting. Furthermore, cell lines can degenerate over time, becoming genetically unstable. But these are relatively small concerns compared to the discovery that MDA-MB-435, the cornerstone of breast cancer research, is not breast cancer at all. We are constantly being reminded that this is the era of evidence-based medicine. But if the very cell lines which have provided the foundation for breast cancer research for the past quarter century have now been conclusively shown to be melanoma cells, not breast cancer, how solid or trustworthy is the evidence on which current breast cancer treatment is based? Evidence built on such flawed foundations more closely resembles hearsay than science. A Case of Mistaken Identity by Megan Scudellari.

Biotechnology firms hope to cash in on women's fear of the disease COMMENTARY By Arthur Caplan, Ph.D. Fear of breast cancer has created a tempting market for companies to sell genetic testing directly to consumers. The disease kills 40,000 people a year in the U.S., with an estimated 212,920 new cases diagnosed in 2007, according to the Mayo Clinic. It's no wonder women would want a reliable gauge of their risk. However, American women should be aware that genetic tests for breast cancer are more hype than real hope. On Wednesday the biotech research company Decode Genetics of Reykjavik, Iceland, announced it will sell a new test for $1,625 that it claims will allow women \"to assess their personal risk for the common forms of breast cancer.\" Genetic testing for all sorts of conditions is all the rage these days. Everywhere you turn, some company is urging you to spit in a cup, take some blood or swab your cheek so your DNA can reveal your health risks, know who your long-dead ancestors are, pick the right mate or help you design a diet that is perfect for your genetic makeup. But, \"spitomics\" has gotten way ahead of genomics. Sadly, the tests Decode and other companies are offering are more likely to empty family pocketbooks and leave women with a false sense of security than they are to prevent breast cancer. There is simply not enough federal and international regulation in place to determine which tests are accurate or how heredity interacts with lifestyle to create individual risks. If the Food and Drug Administration and Congress do not rein in the corporate greed that is currently driving the sale of genetic tests for breast cancer and other diseases and conditions, we could soon have an industry that bears an uncanny resemblance to the home mortgage business. Marketing for genetic tests is already ubiquitous. The television commercials and magazine ads, which ran in Denver, Atlanta and various cities in the Northeast, promise women that cancer does not have to be \"inevitable.\" They also claim that the average woman can reduce her risk of developing cancer through genetic testing. Myriad Genetics, the Salt Lake City biotechnology company behind the heavy ad push, charges about $3,000 for a complete risk-disposition test. Myriad, which holds a patent on the first breast cancer test, has been taking full advantage of the genetic testing monopoly it enjoyed until Wednesday when Decode entered the market with its new, more generalized test. To date, Myriad has been very tough about enforcing the patent, even though medical centers in the United States and other countries say they could do the same testing for a much lower cost. Only small fraction would benefit In reality, the numbers about detectable risk don't really back up Myriad's ad claims. Of the more than 200,000 new breast cancer cases, only about 20,000 seem to be connected to the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes - the genes most closely linked to the inherited form of the disease that Myriad's test can detect. For women without a family history of the disease, perhaps 1 percent would benefit from the test. On one hand, it would seem to make sense to seek out genetic testing to avoid becoming a breast cancer statistic. Or does it? Contrary to the marketing messages, only women who have a strong family history of breast cancer - two or more parents, grandparents or siblings who have developed the disease - need to talk to their doctor or a genetic counselor about the value of any form of genetic testing.  Decode's newer test is not really accurate enough or based on a large enough sample of women to accurately predict much about an individual woman's chance of getting breast cancer.  If you are worried about your risk of getting the disease, or are thinking about getting a genetic test done for any other reason, talk with your doctor or a genetic counselor who can determine whether your family history justifies the expense. You may be surprised to find that you can make changes in lifestyle and monitoring your own health that can reduce your risk without testing. The genetic revolution holds much promise for improving our health. Currently, profit and market advantage are playing the key roles in shaping how genetic testing is evolving. These are not the right navigation tools to help women at risk of breast cancer - or the rest of us - capture that promise. trip neg stageIV spread to IBC (2X) & 7 recur's, Treat Alt & Conv Log in to post a reply",

Why give to charities that are only wanting too give mammo to a certain few.  If you are found to have cancer they would not even help you to get treatment if you have no insurance.  Your on your own! After talking to hundreds of patients who have not been helped by any of these charities other than a used wig that was turned in my another patient.  I've been very disappointed aftering the pink pushed down my throat for years... where is all the money? I'm not saying that there are not some wonderfull charties out there.  I feel bc charties are nothing but big business.  They thrive off the fear and gulit of our love ones.  Fear they may get the disease and gulit they didn't.  I have given in some thought lately because  of advancing stages...what would I want my love ones to do in my memory.  Number one NOT to do is give any money to these charities.  I really wish I could have something to do at my local clinic that has been so wonderful to me.  Something that I could share with the people coming there after me to make their life a litttle easier and bring a little joy while in treatment. The best support I got was from this website...maybe this is where I will tell my love ones to donate. Flalady",

      "Content": "FloridaLady wrote: Hi Ladies, I do have lymphedema in my chestwall/back and right arm that has been pretty bad in the last few months.  But I have a little different problem then most of you.  I have inflammatory breast cancer that had covered my entire chestwall/arm and going over my shoulder to my back.  I could not do regular lymph massage because of skin wounds and I possibility I would move my cancer around to much.  So I have learn to deal with it. Lucky it does seem to go up and down.  I'm having a little break right now.  But I saw this article today and thought of you guys.  I feel it really down plays how bad this can be.  And how many truly suffer with it. WASHINGTON - Hospitals in about a dozen states are testing whether some simple steps, such as arm-strengthening exercises, could reduce the risk of one of breast cancer's troubling legacies - the painful and sometimes severe arm swelling called lymphedema. Lymphedema has long been a neglected side effect of cancer surgery and radiation: Many women say they never were warned, even though spotting this problem early improves outcomes. And while less invasive surgical techniques mean fewer breast cancer patients today than just a few years ago should face lymphedema, it's a lingering threat for tens of thousands of survivors because it can strike two decades after their tumor was treated. \"I have ladies tell me the lymphedema is much worse than their cancer because the cancer's cured,\" says Dr. Electra Paskett, an epidemiologist at Ohio State University who is leading the first-of-its-kind research into possible protective steps. Among them: Wearing elastic sleeves to counter temporary swelling during things like airplane flight or heavy lifting, and doing special exercises with light weights designed to help keep open the lymph channels that allow fluid to drain through the body. \"The theory is building up muscles in your arm acts as a natural pneumatic pump to move the fluid,\" explains Paskett, herself a breast cancer survivor who developed lymphedema. When lymph nodes under a breast cancer patient's arm are removed or damaged by biopsy, surgery or radiation, lymph fluid can build up and cause anything from mild swelling to a ballooning of the arm. Lymphedema isn't just a legacy of breast cancer treatment. The leg can swell if groin nodes are damaged from other cancers, including gynecologic cancer. Melanoma treatment left former presidential candidate John McCain with facial swelling. Occasionally, rare diseases can trigger a different form of lymphedema. But lymphedema among breast cancer survivors may be most common. It's been estimated to affect between 20 percent and 30 percent of patients who have 10 or more under-the-arm nodes examined, called an \"axillary lymph node dissection.\" A surprising study published in November's Journal of Clinical Oncology suggests few such women may be diagnosed. University of Minnesota researchers analyzed records from the huge Iowa Women's Health study, to cull more than 1,200 patients who'd had breast cancer between 1986 and 2003. Eight percent had been formally diagnosed with lymphedema yet another 37 percent of the women suffered persistent lymphedema symptoms, including a swollen arm. Today, some women have far fewer nodes examined in a \"sentinel node biopsy,\" and separate research suggests those women are far less likely to get later lymphedema - possibly as low as 5 percent, Paskett notes - although many don't qualify for the smaller surgery because of large tumors or other factors. But perhaps most concerning from the Iowa data, only 40 percent of the women with swollen arms but no diagnosis had heard of lymphedema and less than 2 percent had sought care for their arm symptoms. Yet early care is key, as Anne Holman of Washington, D.C., can attest. In 2006, doctors found cancer in eight of 18 lymph nodes. She was undergoing chemotherapy to shrink her tumor before an eventual mastectomy when one day her arm turned red and itchy. Come in right away, said Minna Manalo, a nurse practitioner at Georgetown University Hospital's breast cancer unit. Along with a skin inflammation, Manalo diagnosed lymphedema - Holman's arm was just starting to swell. Daily for two weeks, she underwent what's called complete decongestive therapy, where a machine massaged fluid from her arm and it then was tightly bandaged to counter swelling. Once her arm shrank, Holman was prescribed a lifelong therapy: A tight elastic sleeve and fingerless glove to wear regularly, especially during her job as an international flight attendant, plus arm exercises to help push out returning fluid. \"I'm trying to stay ahead of the game,\" says Holman, 61. \"You can't cure this, but you can manage it.\" Paskett's study - now recruiting participants at Ohio State, Georgetown and a growing number of other hospitals - tests whether milder versions of those techniques could prevent lymphedema in the first place. Women recovering from a large node removal are randomly assigned to either a regimen including personalized arm exercises, or just lymphedema education. trip neg stageIV spread to IBC (2X) & 7 recur's, Treat Alt & Conv Log in to post a reply",

I have spoken to couple patients recently where there doctor's told them to study alternatives to manage their treatment and side effects because medical industries are pretty much at road block right now.  Researcher's right now are using old drug to see if there is anything that will help us.  For bc ladies I've only seen one new drug in three years Ixempra that was bad just for bc patients.  All the other chemo are from other types of cancer studies. I fear with the economy in the toilet, that funding will stop a lot of research.  I hope I'm wrong but I do wonder about insurance cutting treatment for stage iv cancer patients. Or just cost it to the point we can pay all the copay's.  I now have to pay a copay ($35) to have treatment or a scan ($75) that I never have before.  Just copay to see the doctor. I hope I'm wrong and we will have a cure for the next generation. Flalady",

This does really help a lot.  The ket it helps with leg & calf stress. Order online a BigFoot gas paddles this will help you find the pedal easier.  Just screws over the original. This thing is big and you can't miss it. Have someone do deep tissue massages on you feetl/legs and hands/fore-arms.  A lot of neuropathy issues are the nerve is damage and the muscles start freaking out.  You start walking and carrying your body weird that also pulls your muscles in painful ways. Acupuncture did help me some, also infra red heat done at my physical therapist.  I also order online a mirco-current hand held device that you can send tiny electric shocks into your hands and feet by yourself. Again I feel a big help for me. Freeze water bottles and hold them in our hands or roll your feet on them as long as you can stand it and them place them on a heating pad. Repeat for ten minutes. This shocks the nerve ending to wake them up. I do take Lyrica it does not help my neuropathy but it does help with restless leg. I hope you can use something from what I've learned.  Flalady",

I sad to say that most chemo do not hold aggressive cancer back more than 2 to 3 months at a time without progression.  The key for her is quality of life and possible hold the progression on the disease. Traveling extensively is very hard when you are ill. I would definitely get a 2nd opinion, but look for someone to treat her as recommend, that will do it closer to home .  Unless your mother has done all the chemo that is appropriate for her case, out of LuAnn's Cycotoxic chemos, these are the groups they will continue to work with.  You pretty much need to fell with this before they move on unless you go into Phase I trails. (they will mix Cycotoxic chemo's with chemo's from other categories. I hope you can get a 2nd opinion soon and have peace that she is in the best of care. Praying you find answers soon... Flalady",

(I'm not in treatment right now)  First chore was moving out summer clothes to move in winter.  Big mistake!  After about 2 hours of moving heavy clothes  my right arm started hurting.  Next day I woke up on my left side and rowed to my back and could fill the fluid drain down my back.  I knew I was in trouble.  I have been doing anything I wanted with in reason for the past two years and hope to skip this part...  I have mostly truncal and right arm. I trying to get my doctor to send me to a LE specialist. I'm not sure what I need to do to keep this under control.  I live alone and must do things for myself.  It's never just about the cancer...

Dr Elizabeth \"I love her\" Dupont. I have personally met over 50 women who have used her. She was one of the first to use mapping. Goggle her and you will see her papers.I would consider her for surgery, even if you go somewhere else for treatment. Dr Luis Franco - A humble, loving and extremely talented oncologist.  He treated me chemo combo's for triple negs three years ahead what other centers are just now using.  Also has access to chemo before they finish trials.  The both are at Watson Clinic Lakeland, a smaller clinic with top notch doctors without the hassles of a big clinic.

YES!  I have to tell you it looked so bad I did think I was going on a no return trip of skin involvment.   But God is good!  I'm still working, with my main issue believe it or not (I know you do...) lymphedema.  I battle pain under my arm going around to my back.  Right now I have a new issue my right arm does not want to extend fully??  Could this be a sign of lack of use?  Inflammation? I do have lymphedema also in the forearm on this arm. Now that my skin is not so involved I can tell the few lymph nodes I have are trying to do their job. Bless their little hearts:)  I started using my micro current device again to help stimulate the nodes.  This works great because my neuropathy is a little more involved right now.  But all and all I'm starting this New Year out with high hopes for a good year. Bless you Binney and all the rest of you, that you have a Great New Year! Flalady",
