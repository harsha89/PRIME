(I had a mammo at age 34 and it was normal, MRI done at 36 and it was normal).   The mammo was repeated with a magnifier and only on one side, I was sent to the conference room to talk with the MD.  I thought that should be good since all the other women I talked to were going in for ultrasounds after their repeat mammo.   I was wrong, she showed me my mammo, which had a cluster of brightness, I could see the shape- rods or linear as she stated that were very close together and only in one area. She said that it looked like DCIS but that it didn't appear to be in a duct.   She wanted me to have a biopsy done- to get an accurate dx,  so I waited a few hours and they were unable to do my needle biopsy as, go figure, I do not have enough breast tissue for it to be done.  So I have a general anesthesia surgery scheduled for next week, not sure exactly how since they were unable to do the needle core bx and now will have to place a guide wire- surgeon said he was unsure if they would be able to.   Has anyone had something similar?  I am more worried that it might be IDC,  I will have to wait for 2-5 days for the result from pathology-   Log in to post a reply",
