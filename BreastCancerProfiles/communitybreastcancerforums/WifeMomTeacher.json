I met with my surgeon today and he was very helpful in explaining what my very large mass could be, and what would be in my future depending on the biopsy results. He has me scheduled first thing Wednesday morning for a core biopsy. He is assuming due to the size of the tumor (5.5 cm X 2 cm X 1.8 cm), and the quick rate of growth (seemingly overnight) that it may be a phyllodes tumor or a giant fibroadenoma. He also stated that due to my age (29) and the growth rate that if the tumor is malignant it would be a very aggressive type of cancer and would require immediate chemo to shrink the tumor so that it could be removed. That was hard to hear. I'm trying not to go there in my thinking yet, but hearing the words aggressive, chemo, and tumor were a bit much. He also insisted he do the biopsy as soon as possible, even scheduling me before out patient surgeries technically begin on his surgery day so that if it is malignant, it is not left longer than necessary. For now, he explained regardless of it being benign or cancerous it is unlikely to stop hurting or go away. Considering the pain I've experienced with it since it's emergence 3 weeks ago, it is likely I'll want it removed eventually. I am happy to have some answers and a competent physician who seems to really care. This has been a long 3 weeks, and I'm sure the week wait until the biopsy and another week for the pathology will be just as long. But I am glad I saw a doctor the moment I noticed the lump, and I am on my way to more answers and solutions. Thank you all for your support so far. Log in to post a reply",
