Got the call yesterday, that all the three areas tested positive for breast cancer.  Invasive ductal carsinoma. I feel like I am in a dream.  I am 31 yrs old and have a 13 month old.   Now, I have to wait until Monday to start all my calls and schedule appts.  I am now more scared of my full body scans, to see if it is anywhere else in my body. I am so fortunate that  I have a very good friend who is an oncology nurse who is helping get set up with all right people. I don't think it has sunk in yet.  The worst was having to tell my husband and my parents. I guess it will become real on Monday. I just want to be there to see my son grow up.  Is it even possible to have more kids?  Probably not, I am just so lucky that I have one.  Log in to post a reply",

Everything moved quickly, I was seen by my doctor, then scheduled for an ultrasound and mammogram.  The radiologist scheduled me for a biopsy for Wed morning.  My gyn called today and said the doctor is concerned. I am so scared for my son, he's not even two.  I want to have more kids.   From what I read, not knowing is the worst, once I know, then I can start my plan. So nice to know there is a board out there with so many women on your side.  I can't get over thinking how unfair this is to happen to so many of us!!  Log in to post a reply",
