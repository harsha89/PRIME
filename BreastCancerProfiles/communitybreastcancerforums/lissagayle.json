I live in Arizona, with my husband( who is an only child) and our one 9yr old child. My family is back in my home state of North Carolina. So having people on here to share what I'm going through and not sugarcoat things has been helpful. My GP appointment was today, I was told I had a mass on the right side of my right breast that went under the nipple which could be causing the stinging like sensation. He said some of the mass was mobile but not much, also that it was larger than I thought. My lymph nodes did not appear to be swollen however they are very sore. I didn't even have to point out where the lump was, My doctor found it very quickly. While feeling he said we need you to do a mammogram and ultrasound as soon as possible, also possibly a biopsy at the same time. I have scheduled my mammogram and ultrasound for the same day November 8th. On his request he did but biopsy per radiologist (im not sure if that is verbatim of what he wrote) I was wondering if that means if the radiologist thinks I need one will he do it then or does that mean I will need a biopsy on a later date due to the radiologist who may be working that day will not be able to do it? I must say I cried when I got out of the appointment and have been having pretty bad anxiety attacks, the feeling of having a heart attack, jaw pain, muscle stiffness and other things. I am currently taking clonazpam which I take for my generalized anxiety order. However I didn't think with hearing the news, yes its a mass and here are the steps you need to do next, would cause me to panic for some reason. Did any of you have anxiety attacks or deal with them on a regular basis and then felt them get worse when told there is a possibility of cancer? . I am going to wait or at least try to wait another day or two to see if they get better. If I don't have any relief I am thinking of calling the doctor to see if I can be on a different medication or go to higher dose until at least the results come in. So final questions would be did you have a biopsy done the same day as your ultrasound or did you have to go back? Also dealing with the anxiety, I need to function daily and be there for my daughter and not in constant pain from the attacks. Would you recommend asking if there is something else I could take? Also did anyone have to be on anxiety medication before or even after they were told there was a possibility of breast cancer?  Again thank you to all who have commented. I truly appreciate everyone! I know everyone has a different case with different symptoms and that is why I wanted all the honesty.",

I have an appointment scheduled for this coming Wednesday Oct 31 2018 ( not really happy it is on halloween) A bit about my past I have PCOS. With my PCOS for me, personally it comes with he cysts on my ovaries and very, very irregular periods. To the point where I only have a period maybe once or twice a year. I will keep this short, hopefully. Last month I noticed tenderness in my right breast only on the right side of it. I thought in my mind well maybe my period will come. I didn't think much of it. Which is odd for me since I'm extremely anxious about everything and think the worst, to the point where my family calls me a hypochondriac and my doctor tells me to stop googling. Needless to say a period didn't happen, so I thought ok just hormones acting up. The pain grew more bothersome. Last week I was laying bed watching Netflix and started to massage the area under my armpit since that is where a lot of the pain was coming from. I moved in closer on my breast and near my nipple I noticed a hard spot. I wasn't sure and still not sure if this is a lump because it is hard, when I think of a lump, I imagine feeling something with a circular shape and also something that is visible. I asked my husband who is an ICU/trauma nurse to feel. He felt and even he wasn't sure, he said he could feel something, but since he never does this in his field. I need to make an appointment with my doctor. When I think of the pain, it reminds me of milder symptoms I had while breast feeding. Like mastitis hardness and my breast feeling heavy. I called my mother, since we close and told her. This is the part that makes me mad. All these years I have put no on my dr papers no history of cancer. When I told her I wasn't worried about the possibility of it being breast cancer, that it was probably just hormones, or even an infection. She proceeded to tell me that I had two aunts who had breast cancer when I was young and that also about 7 years ago my grandmother was diagnosed with breast cancer but since she was so far gone with Alzheimer's the doctor suggested that they not do surgery or treatment due to the fact she wouldn't know what was happening and that she would be at a greater risk of passing sooner. The cancer did not take her but Alzheimer's did at the age of 84. Im just very worried and it seems like the days have grown longer. I don't think Wednesday will ever get here.
