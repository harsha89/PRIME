I made it through 6/12 taxol and herceptin before I had to quit the taxol. My doctor then switched me to taxotere, which is in the same family, but not known for the numbness and tingling. My last chemo (taxotere) was April 20, 2010. Not to put a damper on things, but my feet have never been the same. I hope you have better luck than I have. After all these months I still have problems with my feet and it just infuriates me that it limits what I can do on some days. My nurse practitioner said that once you stop taxol you should see improvement between 6-16 months after your last dose if you are going to have improvement at all. I am now 10 months out and have just gotten a prescription from my doctor to try gabapentin for the neuropathy. I will get it filled today and hope to see improvement. Good luck! Talk to your doctor about Gabapentin/Neurontin. He/she may be willing to let you try it to see if you have any benefit from it.  ",

I did have pain at the lumpectomy site for at least a good three weeks (just from the healing process) and the incision under the arm has been a hassel. Since the node biopsy I have not had much feeling under my arm. I ended up having fluid accumulate in the breast cavity (which is not at all unusual) and had to have it drained twice in the last month. A couple of days after the surgery every time I got up I could hear fluid moving around. If this happens, just let your doctor know. Once I had the fluid drained most of the discomfort went away. I took prescribed pain medication for only two days and was up and about in no time. I went home a few hours after the surgery and went back to work in three weeks. Good luck tomorrow.
