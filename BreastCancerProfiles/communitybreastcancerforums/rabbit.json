I have a script of phenergan and I had zofran left over from ages ago.... it seems the zofran works best, but I've only had a touch of nausea, not too bad, so when I take a zofran it seems to never get worse.  I've been doing baking soda mouth washes 3-4x a day, I'm hoping to avoid that nasty thrush I keep hearing about, anyone have any other good preventatives for that?   Kim, I'm glad you are doing well, I have made a list of things to tell the assistants and Dr. Hargis when I see him Wed. I'm sure he'll help out, I think I've been pretty lucky over all.  Kim, did or do you have a port? When does that get out? I can't wait for that day LOL ",

I am just the perfect candidate for it. I think after seeing my MO Wed. and my RO the 23rd, I will then see another MO and get a 2nd opinion...a doctor that has nothing to do with my \"group of oncologists\". If that one agrees rads are the way to go, I may go with it. I still don't understand how there is no test to find if other nodes are involved without operating. thanks again all. I would be curious to see if anyone knows statistics of more nodes being involved if the sentinel node was positive and the 2nd node negative.  Hugs to all! ",

They weren't sure it was mets, because I had my biopsy done a week or so before and the lymph nodes could of just been inflammed from that.  I am guessing the grade 3 had something to do with it too but the size was the main thing. They wanted to shrink it and stop anything in it's path before surgery so I could hopefully get away with a lumpectomy, which I did. I have pretty much decided on rads....but not 100%, will make my final decision on Monday when I see the RO. I want to thank everyone for their input here, this forum has been unbelievable for me.

Is it worth a try or am I thinking of something else it helps? hugs to all!! ",

That docetaxel crap is killing me, it better be killing the cancer too.  The nausea came on during infusion but mild, wore a sancuso patch and got some ativan during infusion.  Was told ativan helps with nausea as well as relaxing you. Had to take a zofran towards the end of infusion. But came home feeling ok, just tired, took a nap for 2 hours, woke feeling pretty darn good.  The 2nd day was good most of the day, no nausea, no pain, but after dinner I got severe upper GI pain. This chemo is triggering all of my GERD and hiatal hernia problems, worse than ever. This has happened for 3 nights in a row now. I go through my max dose of 80mg of omeprazole, a handful of tums, half a bottle of maalox, all in a night.  The 3rd night, I went to bed with bone pain, nail beds tender as could be and they are getting worse. Because of the horrible upper GI problems I have not been able to swallow the LGlutamine powder, but have been able to do the VitB6 and Acetyl L Carnetine.  I am taking a 5mg oxycodone when I wake up and later in the day. Anyone have any suggestions for the nail bed pain or the bone pain? Will this fade anytime soon or am I stuck with this pain and problems daily for each tx? Thanks all! ",

The bad thing is like you said, the flu like symptoms linger worse the 2nd time, I have only been able to walk a few times this go around and am worn out when I do. If I can get the energy to do more exercise I think I can keep the weight part under control, but if it gets harder, it will be worse again on FEC number 3. :( hugs to you and keep us posted, maybe join our July chemo group?

Don't know the stage yet, do know that 2 of my nodes looked \"slightly inflammed\" in the MRI. The only difference is that I am doing chemo first, then surgery Dec 16th, praying for a lumpectomy if it shrinks enough since we know my BRCA gene is negative.  I do eat 4-5 small meals a day and find it helps..I eat TONS of veggies and some fruit, just had grapefruit for breakfast, normally I eat plain organic yogurt with blueberries or some fruit, it helps keep the yeast infections away and the mouth sores seem to be to a minimum.  I have been using cornstarch powder for my underarms, I got a little rash under both arms, but have had that happen before chemo, I think it's cause our bodies are so out of whack.

I told him I seriously did not think I could go through this 3 more times. He suggested I go to weekly tx of taxol for 9 more weeks, since I had a potent dose of docetaxel he said that would make up for about 3 rounds of taxol (normally it would be 12 weeks).  He thinks I will have fewer SEs with this lower dose of taxol and said the success rate of killing the cancer, recurrance etc. was the same with this drug as it would of been with docetaxel. Anyone here know much about doing taxol weekly as opposed to docetaxel every 3 weeks? I may make another post about this but thought I would ask here first :)",

I had a biopsy Wed. My Dr. already set up an appt with a surgeon on Monday at 4:30 where I will get the results. I am extremely nervous but preparing myself, I am a fighter and I am very optimistic, I also do a lot of natural therapies and have already started a liquid mixture called Mell-MH which is supposed to help starve many types of breast cancers. I've also started building my immune system doing Vit D, B, C, selenium...  I know 1cm is very small, and I think the radiologist said it was in the ducts...if there is tiny calcifications (possibly more spots of cancer) next to the growth, does that mean it's probably spread to the lymph nodes, any help and thoughts of what to expect would be greatly appreciated.

      "Content": "rabbit wrote: Did FEC for 4 rounds, started Docetaxel Sept 21st, 3 more rounds to go every 3 weeks. On day 2 or 3 of the Docetaxel, I did a detox bath of epsom salts, hydrogen peroxide and baking soda and used a loofa brush to do a lymphatic drainage. The bone pain and aches felt better later that day but I think it was that night or later that morning I noticed my feet were red, inflamed and just tender to walk on.  Then within 24 hours of that I noticed the soft tissue in between my index and thumb was the same, red, swollen looking and tender to touch. I looked it up on the internet, posted on here in a few places and it appeared to be hand-foot syndrome. I saw my onco on day 8, he and the PA decided it was not hand-foot syndrome that it was more a direct reaction to the Docetaxel, he said he sees this exact reaction in another chemo but it was the first he had seen it with Docetaxel.  He said to keep it moisturized and that it could possibly flare up through the rest of the treatments, but it should go away once I'm done with chemo end of Nov. I was told that my hands were more splotchy like the hand-foot syndrome but my feet were too covered with redness, it was not like the hand-foot syndrome symptoms.  A few days later, my hands got much worse, the redness and some patches actually spread around the sides and to the edges and tops of each hand and a few patches on top of my thumbs and a few fingers. I called the onco and was told to stop taking the B6, L-Glutamine and Acetyl L Carnetine (the supplements that I had started day of the new chemo to help prevent neuropathy) that it was possible it was a reaction to that.... I bought some bag balm (udder butter) and for the last 2 days have been coating my hands and feet in it, putting on socks and gloves to keep the moisture in at night and a few times during the day. I have been doing hydrocortisone cream in between these treatments. Today my hands are a touch better, my feet for a few days have slowly been getting better. I was just curious if anyone else has gone through this, or similar. I don't think I can do this for 3 more treatments, I am achy and moody, the bone pain was insane for 4-5 days and not being able to walk for days..it's a real PIA!  Hopefully someone has been through this and can help me out! I don't know if it's the supplements, hand-foot syndrome, or just simply a reaction to the Docetaxel.... thanks in advance and hugs!!  Ellen DOB: 9/7/1965 Dx 6/6/2011, IDC, 4cm, Stage IIB, Grade 3, 1/2 nodes, ER+, HER2- Chemotherapy 6/29/2011 Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide), Ellence (epirubicin), Fluorouracil (5-fluorouracil, 5-FU, Adrucil), Taxol (paclitaxel), Taxotere (docetaxel) Surgery 1/5/2012 Lumpectomy: Right; Lymph node removal: Right, Sentinel Hormonal Therapy 1/17/2012 Surgery 1/31/2012 Prophylactic ovary removal Radiation Therapy 3/10/2012 Breast, Lymph nodes Log in to post a reply",

I will ask the surgeon tomorrow and/or the oncologist I end up seeing. It is worth looking into more for sure, and you are right, I am sure it's not a cure all, but it may help slow it down or stop it from spreading, I use natural remedies for some things and have avoided antibiotics several times, and heard some incredible stories, but I do believe there is a time and a place for everything and obviously something as serious as this, I will be doing what the dr. says and possibly combine it with some natural steps, with the dr. approving of course :) Also,  because the radiologist said she was concerned that these tiny calcifications are in the same area as the mass, and she referred to it as possible \"satellites\" of the cancer. I hope you are right and it's just calcifications or DCIS.   hi Sara1970, the mixture is made by goodherbs, which I use several of their products, it's a combination of asian violet, asian dandelion, dulse, inkberry, japanese honeysuckle, prickley ash, sheep sorrel and based with 27% whole grain alcohol. It's a liquid I take 30 drops 3 x a day. I am going to keep reading the forum, I too have read tons of info, googled everything possible. Looked at my mammogram and ultrasound a dozen times..  My sisters, mother, father and best friend are all going with me to the appt. But I think I will just have my mom go in the room with me at first. I'll post once I know more.",
