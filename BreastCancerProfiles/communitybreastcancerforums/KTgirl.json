Anyway, I am at work and can't write as much as I would like, but I just want you to know that I am a 1 year Survivor and doing JUST GREAT.  They have such great treatment these days. This is the scariest part of the whole process.  You will get past this! You will be FINE!! Love from Sacramento, CA ",
