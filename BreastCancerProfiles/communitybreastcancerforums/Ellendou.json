Had lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy on each side on the 17th of June.  I have an appointment with the Surgeon on the 28th to find out what they have found........ and what the next step will be. I am having alot of pain in my  left breast, I am wearing a sports bra for support.  Also having trouble sleeping, I am not a back sleeper.

My surgeon is gone for three weeks, so I will be seeing her assistant, which I am feeling uneasy about...but guess it can't be helped. I am taking ES tylenol and Naproxen for the pain and being very careful how I move, had to understand why the right breast does not hurt very much but the left one hurts something terrible. Do you know when we are referred to an oncologist?  I live in a very small community so have to travel into Edmonton for everything, which is a real pain - 4 hours away. When is your next visit with the Dr? Sending Hugs and Prayers. ",
