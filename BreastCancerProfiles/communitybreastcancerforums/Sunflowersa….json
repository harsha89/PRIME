I know logically it is most unlikely to be cancer but....there's that little squirrel in the back of your head driving you nuts. I just want to know. I don't feel reassured at all. I do not believe it's nothing. There is a reason I have had pain for three months. There's a reason for the itching and discharge. In that respect I won't give up. Maybe it is worth getting a private mri done then? I'm assuming that's a sure fire way of knowing? Thank you all for your replies. They're much appreciated x",

He has asked that I go see a private specialist breast consultant which costs app Â£200. If the specialist feels an mri is warranted I can then be bounced back to the nhs. Although I'm not sure I would do that if I'm honest. I should hear start of next with an app so fingers crossed x",

I was told there's nothing wrong and if I'm really bothered by the pain they can refer me to pain clinic. I've said no as I want to know what's causing the pain not cover it up. Apparently I have no right to see or have any copies of my mammogram. The ultrasound was a 2 second job so doubt there's any screens from that. My husband has offered to take out a loan and pay for a private mri. I'm worried as I don't want more debt and it turns out to be something easily sorted. Plus I will have to get someone to refer me. I think my GP will - I've no idea how it works if I'm honest. I'm worried as two breast consultants have now stated categorically that: There is no pain with cancer The mammogram is completely reliable I'm lucky as women with dense fibrous breasts don't get cancer Google has shown me all of the above is a pile of poo. I have lost faith in that hospital",
