Teacher - My port does protrude--looks like a marble under my skin! Even though I had mine put in yesterday, it was used today for a dosing of Taxol. It was a bit uncomfortable being that it's only a day old, but the needle went in soo smoothly! I will have chemo for at least a year and will need labwork done weekly. I'm on a 21 day cycle, with Taxol also on day 8. I am thankful that the cancer treatment center I go to has trained phlebotomist's to access ports. I will not have to get stuck in the arm at all!!

As of right now, I spend a lot of time with my bestie and she has a 7 year old and a 1 year old. I watched both being born and always wanted to experience that same greatness of my own. I do my share of babysitting, but in the end, I go home to a house without a child. I know a lot have those fears of leaving their kids behind and a lot also would give anything to experience a child of their own. It is definately a tough decision to make, and certainly one I will not be thinking about within the next 6 months or so. My recent PET scan showed excellent results, and it only makes me more hopeful for the future. I do understand that I need to concentrate on myself for the time being, but I just can't stop thinking about the \"what ifs?\" My reproductive organs are still in working order and continuously get my monthly cycle; so I still stand positive that there may be a miracle in the works later down the road! My husband and I have discussed this and he knows how much of a touchy subject it is for me. He will be right by my side with whatever decision I make in the future. Much love to all of you and thank you for your replies. -Bethany",

My lymph nodes were originally positive at dx, PET scan showed chemo working and the nodes weren't \"lit up\" on the imaging. My onc is aware of this but doesn't seem too concerned about the swelling. I had an ultrasound done about a month ago to rule out blood clots, which came back negative. I have had radiation to the spine and mediastinum previously, but not the breast. I will most certainly check out the lymphedema board to gain more knowledge and will also touch base with the onc again to see her opinion of it. More fatigue has set in the deeper into the chemo cycles I go. I started my 5th cycle of p/h/t today with a taxol treatment on day 8. Onc states at least another year left, unless toxicity develops. I usually sleep it off in the room right after getting the benedryl (kicks my butt no matter how hard I try and fight it!). I've lost about 65% of my hair, eyebrows, eyelashes; leg hair is steadily growing (thought I would be off the hook with shaving by now). I've gained 15 pounds since being diagnosed on 2/1/13; stopped going to the gym from lack of energy and the steroids are not helping. I still have my appetite and taste is somewhat normal. My labs come back great (like a normal person) each week and my onc and nurse are very happy to see that. I'm working full time still, as long as I can handle it. I am scheduled to see a dermatologist June 18th to evaluate this acne rash that I have on my face, back, neck and chest. I do not have any nausea, but still taking medication for it just in case. Still get back pain where the lesion is from time to time. I've noticed a giant brain fog a lot of the time. I blame it on the drugs.",
