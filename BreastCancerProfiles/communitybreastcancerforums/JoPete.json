    "Content": "JoPete wrote: Have BRCA 2 and doing two breast biopsies this week. I have been considering a mastectomy but haven't researched what is involved.  Thinking it might be time to  do some research. Are two surgeons required - a surgeon for removal of tissue and a plastic surgeon for immediate reconstruction? Thought if I have a better idea of what is needed I might be able to figure this out. Thanks for any info you can share. Log in to post a reply",
