I'm doing my chemo in NJ though -- much more convenient but my oncologist works with/consults with the oncologist at Sloan. Where are you all located. Im in Manalapan NJ (Monmouth County)",

I really don't want to deal with it on Mothers day.",

The anxiety on the day of the treatment was overwhelming and i broke down. They put something in my IV and suddenly all was right in the world. Everyone said hydrate hydrate hydrate which i did but they had to keep unplugging me because i had to pee every 15 minutes! Monday was fine, just tired and Tuesday i was ok too. Had to nap twice and was queasy when my meds wore off but manageable. Wednesday exhaustion kicked in and I slept about 20 hours. Thursday I woke up fine, no queasiness, felt like myself. Thursday night the pain set in. It was not as bad as expected but definitely worse than i hoped. Same with Friday. By Friday night i felt fine. No fatigue, no nausea, no pain. Saturday was great. Was out and about all day and felt like myself. Sunday I woke up with a cold and was in bed all day. Fever, chills, sneeze and coughing. Felt crapy. Woke up today and feel completely like myself. Cold is gone and i was out and about all day. Everyone handles the treatment and side effects differently, but hope it gives you some insight in a week in my life. Note: If you do the math, more good days than bad.",

Wanted to stoxk up in case I wasn't hungry later. Chemo was easy. No pain, I was much more relaxed this time. Watched net flicks and even slept for a bit Came home and feel good. Hung on the couch with the kids since my legs were beat. Tried to eat some soup and failed. However gram crackers arefriendsoday so I had a few every couple of hours. Napped after dinner. Apparently I was out cold so my husband work me after a few hours to take my temperature. Slight naseua so I ate more crackers. I took a few puffs of the naseua strain and that immediately helped. Fell back asleep for a few more hours. Woke and needed conposine. Took a quick puff to tie me over in the interim till it kicks in I feel fine (just awake from all the sleep). All in all. Good day Bad...on my walk my hair started to fall out. Large clumps. By end of day more than 1/3 is gone. Going to get it shaved tomorrow with my best friends. I'm so upset. Knew it was coming but wow, notready",

He did a lot of research and is very informed. After my treatment last week, he wouldn't go out with his friends and insisted on staying home with me. This week i feel a lot better and we had a long talk that he has to go out with his friends and have fun. That it makes me happy to see him have fun. I don't want him to feel like my caregiver and he wants to be. I know he is nervous and it is his way of coping.  The 13 year olds are interesting. They are graduating 8th grade and like all middleschool boys, boobs are on their mind. How can the things that are so intriguing to them cause their mother so much pain. I really hope they are not scared for life from it.",
