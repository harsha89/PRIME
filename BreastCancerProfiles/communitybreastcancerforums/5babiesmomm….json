I have posted a few times on the boards but am new to here,I will be having a bilateral mastectomy with tissue expanders on dec 7th and I am scared scared! I've been told its not as painful as what I have in mind but in my mind it sounds pretty darn painful. I think im more scared of the uncomfortable ness of the expanders. Ugh I did my chemo before hand,my surgeon says he will take check 2 SN but from the mammo MRI ultrasound chest X-ray and physical exam they are pretty sure their is No nodes involved I hope their right..I'm wondering though wouldn't the chemo have taken care of that in the nodes..how would they know if it was ever in my nodes? I come here often mostly read and not post but am so thankful for these boards! I wish everyone well! Holly",
