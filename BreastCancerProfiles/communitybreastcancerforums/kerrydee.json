Especially since the surgeon told me there were precancerous cells present. My mother had recovered from breast cancer and is now receiving chemotherapy for lung cancer.  My doctor told me to cut out caffeine and chocolate and I found that wheat germ also helps the pain of fibrocystic breast disease, a benign condition that includes pain. (my self-diagnosis). Could anyone tell me if they have had success fighting cancer with nutrition (beans, soy, etc.) using or not using chemotherapy. I have read alot of differing stuff online but would like to verify from a real person what has or has not worked for them. So far I'm juicing with spinach, broccolli, carrots and grapes and making smoothies with strawberries and blueberries and tea with licorice root and spirilina. I'm also using turmeric, and eating tempeh with lots of raw garlic. Thanks for your help  ",
