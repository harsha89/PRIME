I would definitely get in touch with the hospital director and tell him in no uncertain terms what you went through.  Hope there's another hospital in your area in case you ever have another emergency.  Wow - what a story!",

I don't remember having much flaking during the treatments at all - only afterward when the skin began to heal. I believe that one reason they don't want you using lotion or creams is because, as you near the finish line, your skin gets more and more fragile.  The underlying tissue also gets really fragile.  It would be really easy to cause a break in the skin if you're using lotions or creams. I remember they put a little bit of surgical tape (the paper type they use on rads patients) on my breast toward the end.  When I finished my rads, I pulled it off and the skin pull off with it - yowee.  I can see where rubbing the breast with lotion would risk something similar happening.",

When I got a skin reaction, my rads onc gave me a tube of Lidocaine gel - it worked wonders for the pain.  Since it isn't a cream, it doesn't hold in the heat. You need to be especially careful if you have sensitive skin.  They also tell you not to scrub or wash your breast for the same reason.  It will get pretty gross looking prior to the end of treatment, but if you try to wash away the debris it's going to tear the skin up.  Rads sorta cook the flesh through and through, so the skin may look okay on the outside and still be extremely broken down underneath.",

I've seen women on this board who say their doctors recommended mastectomy over lumpectomy with radiation, but that was definitely not the case with me.  I was given the option of have a mastectomy, however.  It's really an individual choice and I'm not sure why they're not giving you that option.  An awful lot has been said in the past decade about women getting unnecessary mastectomies - a lot of criticism has been leveled at the medical community and I guess there is a movement to spare the breast at all costs in some communities.

They only radiate a very thin layer of the lung from I was told, so any scarring shouldn't extend into the alveoli, etc.  But I don't know if they're that conservative in all cases.  Anyway, it sounds like you may have an infection. I would just wait and see if you get any better and then go to the pulmonologist if I were you.  I'm living on 74% lung function right now and it really isn't that bad at all - my life is perfectly normal. ",

      "Content": "Jun 22, 2011 08:44PM - edited Jun 22, 2011 08:47PM by desdemona222b Hi, worried - There are many different types of breast cancer, some much more treatable than others, and as barbe said, they can't get the true size of it until the pathology report comes in from the surgery. They usually only get the type of cancer with the biopsy report, then after surgery, they get the \"whole story\" from the entire tumor area and lymph node biopsy. Basically, they can see certain things on mammograms and ultrasound that are usually a dead giveaway that it's cancer, such as spicules (NOT saying this is the case w/ your mother, though - the path report is the final word.)  The best thing you can do right now is try to help your mom just take this one day at a time, easy does it.  The diagnostic process is slow and very traumatic - you'll both feel better after you actually know what is going on and get a treatment plan.  Until you have all the information you need, just hope for the best and try to stay strong!  Just remember, there are many very effective treatments for breast cancer these days and you and your mom should try to remain optimistic, hard as it is.",

Now think about this,  the heart is a muscle.  If it can cause damage to the heart then what makes other muscles in the body any different?  They have to be really careful when radiating the left side to avoid the xrays from hitting your heart.  The xrays will damage anything they come into contact with.  The other muscles in your body aren't irradiated with the exception of the pectoral muscle and other muscles under the armpit, etc.  I have really bad muscle spasms in my pec muscle that don't seem like they will ever go away. Your body is awfully taxed by surgery, rads, and chemo because it's working so hard to build new, healthy cells, etc.  I'm sure the strain can cause many unpleasant symptoms like joint pain, etc.  I didn't have any but I hope you gals get to feeling better soon.",

The very worst thing a person can do in such a situation, IMO, is stay home from work.  It's really hard to keep going in when things are so scary - it seems like resting and regrouping will help.  But to me, actually giving in to the temptation to just collapse is a bad one - in my experience, all you have to do is think about what's going on and obsess about it, whereas if you're at work you can at least partially get out of that mindset. It's perfectly normal to swear and curse the lump while driving, showering, or cleaning house.    BTW - there's really no way they can get ALL the lymph nodes - there's millions of them.  The usual amount is 9-12. ",
