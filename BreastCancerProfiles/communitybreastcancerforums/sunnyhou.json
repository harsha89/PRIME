You will get more responses, although the weekend can be slow. I am a DCIS girl. I am 38 and was diagnosed last September. I chose bilateral out of fear. I did not want to do tamoxofin or radiation and I did not want follow ups every six months forever. My mom had it and chose lumpectomy, radiation and tamoxofin and 14 years later still goes every 6 months. This is fine for her because she is not a worrier. I would be holding my breath all of the time waiting for the other shoe to drop. I am happy with my results, and I am glad I chose double. I had a mammo and mri that said the \"good\" side was clear and healthy and it ended up having atypical lobular hyperplasia in it. So, I could have been dealing with a another DCIS diagnosis in my future. This is really a personal decision. Some woman do not mind the check ups etc. some choose what I did. Some women choose lumpectomy and do not get good margins and have to do a mastectomy in the end. I would go to the DCIS board and read as much as possible. Go with your gut instinct. Blessings to you, I know how hard it was when I first found out and all I went through to make a decision.",

I had a friend who is a radiologist for the breast center here and he said if you were my sister or wife that is what I would suggest. It is absolutely personal though. you do not want to have regrets it is all about what you can live with. Hope you are able to come to this decision soon! PM me if you need to talk or ask about the surgery.",
