Haven't been to work since my BMX on 2/20. Not sure when I can start managing working. I am an RN in the Float Unit at a Trauma I hospital so u never know what type of patients I will get each day. Curious, did you or anyone else work during chemo or radiation? Any problems with getting sick or neutropenic? I feel like I have chemo brain already-had to go back and correct many typos!!",
