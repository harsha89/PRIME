For me, once I knew my diagnosis it was a very quick (definately not easy) decision for me to have a BMX.  I have 3 young children and I did not want to have a lifelone struggle with this if I could help it. It has not been easy physically or emotionally and I'm still very early in this process.  I still feel like it was the best choice for me. This is just my experience.  I hope you find support here in whatever you decide. Sending hugs your way!!",

Keep us posted about your appointments.  We are here with you and you will get through this!! Love and hugs!",

No one wants to be part of this club but here we are and it can be a great place.  I know this is very scary  and being an oncology nurse you probably know all the different treatments and have seen so much.  You will get through this and your kids will be okay too.  I have 3 kids, who are a bit younger than yours but they were my priority too through this. From the time I had my Mammo and u/s, the biopsy and surgery (I had a BMX too) was about 2 weeks.  After the pathology came back AFTER surgery, the BS and Oncologist said that the type of DCIS was very aggressive  and that had I waited and put it off, my outcome would have been much different.  I would not be comfortable waiting as long as your doctor has your surgery date (but that's just me).  I think a lot can happen in 4 weeks in terms of the IDC spreading.  Although, I am not a doctor.  Good luck to you and I'm sending encouragement your way!",

My mother in law has a doctorate in natural health.  During this process (especially in the beginning), I had much unwanted advice on how I just needed to eat more green vegetables and the cancer cells in my ducts would disappear.  She was often condescending and made me feel as if my decisions were not the right ones.  She quoted studies and rattled off the benefits of natural medicine at every chance she got.  I finally had to tell her that I needed SUPPORT right now, not a lecture.  In anger, I also asked her if she were 39 with 3 kids and a BIRAD 5 diagnoses if she would be okay just eating more broccoli and \"waiting it out\"?? Maybe you could tell your friend that you love her but need her support through this the most.  This is a scary time and the more support you can find the better. We are all here for you and understand. Good luck in whatever you decide.",

I hope that you have support through all of this. I have found more information here than any of my doctors so you are in a good place.  My DX isn't exactly the same as yours but I did have a BMX recently and would be happy to answer any questions if that would help.  Feel free to DM me if needed. I found the Breast Reconstruction section helpful too, so it may be worth popping over there for some great information on different types of surgeries and reconstruction. Wishing you love and support!! There are people here that understand what you're going through even when it seems like no one else does.",
