I had mine done this part December along with some reconstruction. I am the biggest baby ever but the surgery was the easiest I've been through. AnotherMichelle is correct. The surgery is so easy that you forget to take it easy but you better because I learned the hard way that it's easy to overdo it! Your body will let you know when you've done too much. Give yourself time to heal. You will get tired really easy for the first couple of weeks. Fatigue will probably be your biggest complaint. I was really worried about the menopausal symptoms coming but I was pleasantly surprised. The biggest complaint I have are the hot flashes but that could be from the tamoxifen! LOL!!! If you take a couple of weeks off from you work, that would be great. Don't worry! You can do this!!! If you have any questions, please let me know! Hope this helps! Good Luck",

I switched oncologists after 6 months due to the oncologist not wanting to answer questions. I've never been happier! Good luck!",

It's a scary time (the beginning is the worst because you don't have a treatment plan in place). My suggestion would be to find a breast surgeon that you trust and then ask them which plastic surgeon to go with (they usually have someone they work with). I was lucky enough to have a great GP who suggested my breast surgeon and then I went from there. Whatever you decide, take a family member or close friend with you. You will not remember anything the doctor says because you'll still be in shock for awhile (at least I was). Once you start meeting with doctors, things go so fast. It's so hard in the beginning because you don't know what to expect. Read some of the posts on here. That helped me a lot. And ask lots of questions. You're in my prayers. Let me know if you need anything",

You came to the right place. You will get tons of information from great women with the biggest hearts! The beginning is the worst but it moves like lightning speed. First of all, take someone to the appointment with you because you will never remember half of what the doctor says. Or bring a tape recorder. The first thing the doctor usually does is a breast MRI to determine if it has spread to the lymph nodes. Also, ask the doctor if you can take the oncotype test, which will tell you how likely it is the cancer will recurr (if you take hormone therapy). And, ask the doctor what he would advise his own daughter (uni or bilateral). I went with the uni after my doctor suggested it over the bilateral. You will get through this. Just take it one day at a time. Let me know if you have any questions. Good luck! You are in my prayers",

When I had mine, I wasn't all of the way numb and when the doctor took the biopsy I felt the pinch. I was super sore for awhile after that. So, maybe it's that. Hope that the pain goes away soon! Feel free to ask any questions you want. This is a great place to get your answers. No one should feel alone during this horrendous time. So, come here and talk. You are among family!

I'm sorry that you had to join the club no one wants to but please know that you've come to the right place. there are so many smart and brave women that are on this site and they are more than willing to offer their advice and expertise. that said, I just wanted to offer a little bit of info. A lot of times breast surgeons do an MRI to determine if you have lymph node involvement and to determine how large your tumorous but this system is not infallible. I know in my case my surgeon went into thinking I had no lymph node involvement and when I got out of surgery 10 out of my 15 lymph nodes were positive. she was surprised, I was surprised so chemo I had to do. Its hard at this stage for you to not be scared and want answers right now. But to be honest with you things in the cancer world move a little slow sometimes. I think that when you go to your doctors appointment take someone with you and record what the doctor is saying. that way you don't miss anything.I hope that your appointment goes well. I think that sometimes CT scans are ordered vs PET scans because the insurance company tends to not approve those sometimes. good luck with everything. if you have more questions please feel free to ask. I'm sure someone will come along with more information",
