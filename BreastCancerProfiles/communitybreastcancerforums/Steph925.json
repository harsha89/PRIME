I'm 24, mother of 3 (4 year old son and 11 month old twins). 2 weeks ago i was sitting watching t.v. decided to check my boobs and realised my left was more lumpy than my right. immediately made a doc appointment with Ob for 3 days later. He said \"I think I feel what your feeling\" said it was probably nithing but lets go ahead and do an u/s. So I went next door to the hospital and they did the u/s. The tech took all of 5 min, went and talked to the doc said ok you can go we didn't see anything and I was outta there! So intially I was like GREAT! But then I started to google! and I'm sure you all know this is our worst enemy! So reading horror stories of cancer being missed I found a RADIOLOGIST that specialized in breast imaging at tulane Hospital in New Orleans and had an U/S done by her. She was awesome, took her time, slowly went through each part of the breast and surrounding areas that was of concern, felt what I was concerned about, spent a good amount of time there looking, explained each and everything that was coming up on the screen and in the end said she saw nothing, just normal breast tissue, but if I needed more self assurance I could always go see this really in her words \"famous\" breast surgeon, very well respected with many publications, named Dr. Alan Stollier. Sooooo thats exactly what I did, saw him today and he felt my breast, felt exactly or atleast I hope he felt it and said he feels it but it feels totally normal to him. And basically sent me on my way, told me not to worry. He did say that I have absolutely no fat in my breast so they will feel more lumpy than someone with larger breast. Now to my concern. What I feel is quite small, much smaller than a pea, lets say the size of about 3 grains of rice combined. Right below my nipple, lets say 5 o'clock. My concern, even after 2 u/s and a breast specialist is that the u/s is missing something and I'll end up in the ob in a year or 2 with a diagnosis ob b/c that may be stage 3 when it could have been caught earlier. I know I've written an entire book here but I am wanting to know if I should go get another oppinion? I mean is this lump or bump or grain of rice....whatever you want to call it not worthy of a biopsy? I'm a mother and a wife, this is my only life, shouldn't they take it more seriousley. I know I'm only 24, no real family history of bc, but it CAN and DOEShappen to women under 30 and from what I understand the statistics arent all that great.......so if anyone can help me out here. In what type of scenario would an u/s not show cancer? Why if I can feel something would it not show up on u/s. Also, I have...well one doc called it a ridge the other a thickening, in my lower left breast, the radiologist just said its normal breast tissue and the breast specialist said its my rib underneath making it feel that way....now this area is much larger than my \"lump\" so if it were breast cancer do you think it would deff show up? I'm sooooooooo paraniod, scared, worried, want to cry sometimes its so overwhelming. Please help!!! Log in to post a reply",

Its almost an obsession, I've made myself stop lately because it literally has scared me so bad I was unable to function in everyday life. I have three children under 4 years old so I can not live this way. From the time I felt the \"lump\" until the time of the last doctors appointment was about 1 1/2 weeks. So I saw my ob, an ultrasound tech...then went to the radiologist her self then onto the breast surgeon who said \"I'm kicking you out\" lol. I just feel like \"could they be missing something\" is there something else that I can do? The surgeon said if the u/s showed nothing but he felt something of concern to him then he'd go further but he didn't. My issue is, then why did my ob send me for an u/s in the first place if it is all just normal to the touch for everyone else? Is he just an idiot, or what? I've deffinately stayed on top of everything, after the u/s I went the next day and got a report myself to know exactly what was said, I did the same after the second u/s....the next day I was at the surgeon. I do feel I've done everything that can be done, I'm just frustrated because I'm afraid that because of my age that maybe they are not doing something with me that they may do with someone over 40. But thanks, I'm glad you said that you thought I did everything there is to do thus far, I dont want to miss something that I should have done. Oh and still does anyone know exactly how accurate an u/s is? The doctor said that u/s images dense breast very well, he said I have no fat in my breast strictly tissue, so in what case would an u/s miss cancer? I also read that u/s can pick up malignant calcifications, anyone else know if there is any truth to this?",
