    "Content": "Drooliagoolia wrote: I am 37. Last year I felt a lump in my left breast. I had a mammogram and ultrasound, likely a Fibroadenoma, but biopsy was recommended. I have breast implants, so they tried biopsy but could not safely get to it without risking the implant. They decided follow up was safe. Now it's one year later and I had my diagnostic mammogram. That mass has grown a bit, but they still think likely a Fibroadenoma. They want to biopsy anyway. BUT they also found a new mass on the mammogram. Ultrasound done and it is irregular, 0.7x0.3x0.8cm. Hypoechoic. Adjacent hypervascularity. I am scheduled for biopsies of both sites for Monday. They said Somethig about needing surgical excision anyway, but I missed it (anxious at that point- she started questioning if it was possible someone in my family has breast ca).. so- any words of wisdom? Is the adjacent Hypervascularitygood or bad? I know irregular is bad. Thanks!! Log in to post a reply",
