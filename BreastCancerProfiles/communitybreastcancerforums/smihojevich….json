I am still waiting for all my pathology reports from the biopsy. I am gathering together my medical team, and involving only those closest to me right now while I wait for the bigger picture. I started a blog so when it comes time to let my (huge) family know, I can post all my undates in one place, and when I feel like it. The idea of responding to inquiries makes me feel tired already. I'll let you all know how it goes. Waiting on the Her2 test......got good news on the ERPR receptor though. So, I'll take that and be grateful.",
