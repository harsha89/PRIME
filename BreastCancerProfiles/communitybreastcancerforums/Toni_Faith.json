Four years ago I was diagnosed with DCIS had surgery and life went on. This time its back and its IDC, ER positive with no node involvement. Treatment will be chemo, rads, tamo pill..Im 33 years old and very nervous and distraught about chemo and the posssibility of not being able to have kids. Im getting mixed feedback that TC is the harsh vice AC...Any feedback or support from those who have done the chemo TC 4 rounds would greatly be appreciated.",
