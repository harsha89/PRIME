What concerns me is the surgery that the breast surgeon wants to perform. I have a lesion on the bottom of my sternum, a mass growing in and out of the top of my sternum, and 1 node that is involved. Plan is to shrink the mass and then remove it surgically. It will be a major surgery. Siteman Cancer Center at Barnes in St. Loius does about 6 of these procedures a year. I trust my surgeon, but it just scares the crap out of me!!!  I am praying the chemo does its job and surgery will not be needed. Anyone have a procedure similar to this? Thanks all and hope all of your treatments are kicking the Cs butt!! Amy Dx 8/8/2011, Stage IV, Grade 3, mets, ER+/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
