I had bilateral dissection and will have rads on one side. I remember thinking, \"Great, I'll beat this cancer thing and then have to deal with L for the rest of my life, but then again . . . the alternative. I did check out the lymphedema board and there is some great support there on the chance I ever need it. My onc doesn't seem as concerned. Just keeps saying, \"Don't worry about it, we see fewer cases these days\". Yea, but . . . I've had to take this bull by the horns myself. Once again just getting as much information as I can. Hoping for the best, preparing for the worst. JFV: Welcome. I finished chemo last Wed too. 3 rounds FEC and 3 rounds Taxol. It's taking awhile to sink in, but I'm finally starting to think about my hair growing back (wonder what surprises that will bring:-), no more meds, no more needles. I'm still working through this round of SEs, but I'm beginning to feel a small weight being lifted. I wish everyone good days ahead.",

Sounds like I'm going to have to have a chat with my husband :-) I'll miss you on the board, but will keep in touch. Wishing you the best. MPH70: I hear ya as far as the legs and fatigue, but only wish my appetite was a little more suppressed. Eating it about the only thing I can do with gusto these days! As far as hormones during rads, my med onc is on the side of getting started right away. My rad onc doesen't have a strong opinion either way although he said if you're having side effects it's easier to figure out what's causing them if you don't have two things working at the same time. I'm still experiencing body aches and bone pain from my last chemo so I've decided to wait a couple of weeks until that all subsides and then I will start on Femara. My own personal compromise :-) DawnKY: I have sharp pains in my breast too, but have had it for years. I mentioned it to a doc once she just laughed it off. Sometimes it's worse than others and during those times Tylenol seems to settle it down. Let me know if your doc has any thoughts on the cause. DiamongGirl and fayebu: Whoo hooo! Two negatives do equal a positive. Great news about your test results!  I had my appt with my rad onc on Thurs and it was an easy one. We reviewed my case and then I had a CAT scan. I was marked up with permanent marker (3 Xs, midchest and both sides) These marks are positioning marks and are covered with waterproof tape. I will start my rads on Wed, Oct 6th. 31 blasts with the last 6 being boosts which are more direct to the specific tumor areas. I'm going to do both breasts and the lymph nodes on my right. The good news is that if all goes as planned I will be done by Thanksgiving! Get this, my doc doesn't recommend any lotion at all!! I had never heard that one before. His theory is that there is no preventative lotion so he thinks it best to see what symptoms develop and then treat the symptoms. I'm a little nervous about that, but have a lot of respect for this doc so I plan to give it a try (although I have a big jar of Aqhaphor standing by). I will be lying on my back, but did ask him about the face down position. He said, \"Oh, yea, that's a NY thing\". He does have a lot of respect for it, but it's not something that is done at this facility. He assured me they take all precautions blah blah blah. I don't really have much choice really and am OK with moving forward. I was warned that I will probably have some lung damage, but \"it will be minimal\", whatever that means. He doesn't seemed concerned about my heart at all, I guess that's good. My next appt will include the tatooing and simulation as well as my first blast. I'm going to enjoy the next few days before getting this party started :-) Thoughts and hugs to all.",

I had my simulation and treatment at the same time so the only hard part was keeping my arms above my head for 1 1/2 hours, but that was just a one time thing while they figured out the set-up. And it was probably longer than the norm since they had to do both sides. After today it should only take about 15-20 minutes. The tatts were a little bit of a sting, but nothing to worry about (it didn't make me want to go out and get a tattoo though) BTW - joan888: Enjoyed your comment to your son. I'll bet he thinks his mom is a \"bad @$$\" :-) I mean that in a good way. Enjoy the evening everyone. We made it through another day.",

Seems I never completely recuperated from one before I started another. (I went on a fast track to be done by Thanksgiving). I do notice an improvement since I've had a weekend off which gives me hope that when this is all over and my body has a chance to rest for awhile I will swing back (at times I wonder). I also felt a stronger sense of emotion lately. I'm so ready for it to be over and wonder how much a body can take.

I take a shuttle to my rad treatments and the first day I felt like I was being driven to a prison camp or something. Here I am on this rickety old shuttle that nobody wants to be on, going to a place that nobody want to go. Since I've gotten to know the other passengers it's turned out to be great experience, there's a true sense of comaraderie, but the emotion did get to me at first. They say the SEs tend to appear more after the second week so we'll have to see what surprises next week brings. I will also be seeing a lymphedema specialist on Thursday and know a few of you are interested in that so I will be sure to report back. Wishing you all the best, Lorraine",

I'm scheduled to meet with my rad onc on the 29th and hope to begin rads the following week so I can be done by Thanksgiving (body-willing). I've been reading the Sept Rads board and gaining much info to prepare myself for this next phase. Geez, it's almost as scary as chemo. The one thing that I read is that rads can minimize recurrance, but not necessarily overall survival due to the potential for collateral damage to other organs. That scares the bejeezus out of me. Has anyone heard anything about this? I've already been told I will more than likely have some lung damage and there's conflicting answers as to whether there will be \"heart splatter\" whatever that is!?!? Sorry, didn't mean to start on such a downer. It's just once I start a new phase I overload myself with info and then try to filter things out. Not sure if this is something to be overly concerned about. Angi: Your girls are adorable! I took a peek at your caringbridge site. I have one, too. I found that the communication part was surprisingly difficult at first (who to tell, how much, how often) and caringbridge sure filled that need. I'll be thinking about you on Thursday. Bo: So sorry to hear you are serving double duty on this cancer thing. I'm amazed at your attitude. Reading between the lines I sense you are a very strong woman with a positive outlook on life no matter what comes your way.  I look forward to sharing this experience and have a feeling we will all be learning a lot from each other. Sending good thoughts your way.

Met with my med onc yesterday and meeting with my rad onc today hoping to get started next week. Thanks to everyone for all the info. I'm armed with questions and will let you know how it goes. I'm 2 weeks out of chemo and still feeling some of the effects. I was relieved to hear a couple of you mention the 1000 lb leg syndrome. I am so feeling that, feels like my arms and legs are full of lead. I was afraid it was just me. It's somewhat comforting to know it's a fairly common symptom and will eventually end. I will be taking Famara and my onc said I should start taking it right away. I've been reading conflicting info on that. Some recommend waiting until after rads to start the hormone treatment. Wondering if anyone has a particular opinion or info on that. I tend to trust the info from this site over the docs many times. I will also start seeing a lymphedema specialist. My right arm has been swollen to some degree for the past 5 weeks. Hoping that's another chemo thing, but better safe than sorry. I'm at high risk for lymphedema and it will be something forever at the back of my mind. Glad to be on top of it. I hear the earlier you catch it the easier it is to control. Thinking good thoughts for everyone every day and thankful to have you all as part of my medical team :-) Hugs, Lorraine",

Nerve regeneration and stimulation sounds like a good thing. Next time I have them I will be thinking good thoughts :-) Hearing the debate about sentinal boipsy and node dissection has caught my attention. If it's deemed unnecessary I will be so happy for those to follow, but pissed!! since I had both on both sides ha!

Clare: Good for you showing the upside (or should I say the \"upright\" side) of treatment. And a makeover at Nordstroms . . . beautiful! What a treat. Pip: I chuckled at how similar our treatment pics are. We could be sisters . . . huh, I guess in a sense, we are :-)",

The name of the series is Healthy-Steps - Lebed Method and there are 12 short (5-7 min) videos in the series. The series I follow is the series numbered by roman numerals (I, II, III). There are quite a few entries so you have to dig a little to find them, but it's pretty easy once you get going. Here's the link to the first one: Healthy-Steps - Lebed Method Lymphatic Breathing Exercise Part I http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2luK4JRAbo&feature=results_video&playnext=1&list=PLA7581FC4F987C837  Also on another board someone mentioned using an exercise ball so I dug mine out of the closet, dusted it off and have been sitting on it when I do these exercises. Makes it a little more fun and I think I'm getting extra exercise without really realizing it . . . now isn't that the best kind :-)",

I've been anxious to get back in the pool and this may just be the tool to get me there. Thanks! Kudos to you and good luck with your classes. (Also, it's so extraordinary that we are able to share on an international level . . . breastcancer.org really does rock!)",

You did it once again . . . got such a chuckle out of your post picturing the Lebed Flash Mob :-) Natsfan: I do the same thing. I wrote up the exercises in sequence and keep that as a reference. Love that I can do the exercises while watching TV in my jammies without even leaving my recliner! Nitocris: Glad to hear you find this method fun . . . me too! I even bought some bubbles haha! Really didn't think I was going to go that far, but thought I'd give it a try. The best part, my dog gets such a kick out of them :-) I have to do it most every day to keep things in check so I figure I might as well enjoy it. I think it helps that you can feel the benefits right away, too. I always feel much better and looser aftewards.",
