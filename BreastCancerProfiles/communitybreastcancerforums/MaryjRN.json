I also had 1 node test positive.  I have never thought about not doing the chemo with my positive node.  Different parts of the country have different treatment plans; you'll find that as you cruise around the bco forums. You are NOT being a baby.  All of us undergoing chemo are apprehensive, but you have locked into a great group here, and I think we are a big support to each other. Koal...I take my steroid in the am.  Maybe that would help.  Good luck at your chemo.  You'll probably sleep when you get home.",

Just an example.  I learned so much from everyone here about how to take care of myself thru chemo, and I'm a nurse, for Pete's sake!  You are NOT taught this stuff unless you work in oncology.  And the onc nurse's did not tell me much! My Ambien does not help, either. Chrys...I'm glad you are getting your GI issues checked out.  You've really had a rough ride lady. VTEllen...I think you should be able to drive yourself.  It only lasts about 15 minutes/session. I was told that I would probably not have any symptoms the first 2 weeks. DebinUtah...the tart cherry juice has a high amt of Melatonin in it. I have tried the tablet form several years ago and it did not help.  I believe (for me) it is the menopause that is causing the sleep issues, not the chemo. The regular flu shot is an inactive, dead virus.  But you can still get reactions from it like a low grade fever.

She did not mention l-glutamine, but I plan on taking it. I think it may be hard for the onc to recommend any supplements.  I feel they have to go by what the AMA says; and I think their stand on it would be to say that most Americans get all the nutrition they need from a balanced diet.  I say hooeey.  It was the nurse, not the doc, that gave me the heads up on the taking Alavert with the Neulasta shot. My Taxol schedule of 12 weeks is because I did not fit into the parameters of dose dense treatment.  I have to go with the old standard. I really have no choice, but Ihope it works out well because my dd27's wedding is October 14 and I want to feel the best I can be for it!

(Those results weren't back yet) I have to make sure I am having a good week near 10/14/11, my daughter's wedding. I am assuming I will be starting the first week of August. Looking forward to 'hanging out with ya'!",

Also, don't be alarmed when the infusion nurse has an isolation gown on to give you your chemo.  Standard care.  And the neulasta injection is over in 5 seconds.  Mine was given in my upper/outer arm.  Tons of fluids really do help! Kayak2...your infusion treatment sounded just like mine.  I was also told to take claritin to help with the bone pain; besides otc Tylenol ES. I am due back for round 2 on 8/15 and I will go alone this time.  My hair issues are the things bothering me right now! Kasi...you need to call the MO and get an order for a different anti nausea pill.  It is common to start at the bottom of the list, and then they go upwards.  They will just order another one.  Ellen...I enjoy reading about your chemo day.  Glad it went well.",

I figured he was just going to prescribe Neurontin, but he was concerned.  He monitored it the next 2 weeks and it was only getting mildly worse.  When he heard about my gait feeling off, he just switched me over.  Taxotare drops the white count down, so I had to get a Neulasta shot.  The Taxol can also, but it is not a given.
