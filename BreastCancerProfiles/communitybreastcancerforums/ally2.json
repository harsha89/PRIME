Now I'm thinking about recon again, and in turn, am thinking about removing the other breast - just so tired of waiting for the other shoe to drop and tired of my appearance. I'm getting the genetic testing done - lots of prostate cancer on dad's side - but it will probably be neg. Anyone out there with a similar situation? All my mammos and MRIs have been fine, but I just started thinking about all that cancer and my age (35 at diagnosis) and my desire for a symetrical reconstruction. Just looking for some encouragement. The docs would support anything - but they don't really say that they prefer this over the watchful waiting.  I'm really struggling but 90% of the time I think it is the right thing. Just looking for any support you could give! Did anyone wait two years, then have the other one off? Thanks to all. ally Log in to post a reply",

My IDC had characteristics that are predictive factors in a contralateral breast cancer (intermediate to high grade, and multifocal, though they were all tiny) so I don't know what I'm waiting for. It is just weird to elect to have surgery, I guess, and I know with reconstruction I'll be in for at least one more surgery... but to have it all almost completely behind me, no more mammos, mri, would be so great. I've read that it doesn't change survival rates, but I just don't want to go through any of it again. Texas, just curious - did you need more time to decide, or did the docs not want to do a bilateral at that time? Thanks for the support! ally",

I've just about maxed out my friendships talking about this with people who haven't been through it. Even blurted out to my accountant (male) what I was thinking about doing! Counseling is definitely in order... Interesting that symmetry is not a guarantee. I didn't realize that. You hear \"better result\" but I guess that doesn't mean perfectly symmetrical. In doing the unilateral recon, the PS would want to alter my remaining breast and I'm really not comfortable with that idea. So I feel it is all or nothing with the recon but maybe I could re-think that. There was a big article in the paper's health section a few days ago about this very issue. They seem mostly to talk about the BRCA positives. I await my results of that test and will continue to debate. Thank you all. More comments welcome! Ally",
