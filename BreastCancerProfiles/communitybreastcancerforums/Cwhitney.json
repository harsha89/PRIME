I've love all of your pictures and can't believe I am looking forward to a pixie cut. I always had long bleached blond hair but I cut it super short when I found out that I needed chemo. I am at the halfway point with Taxotere and I haven't lost all of it yet. I have a five o'clock shadow on my head and my lashes and eyebrows are hanging on. I also continue slowly to grow hair on my legs and underarms. Weird?! I was hoping I wouldn't have to shave for three months! I wish that I invested in cold capping since the wig thing sucks in this Virginia heat. Anyhow, thanks for posting your pictures. They give me hope!",

I do have some areas that are sparse but my survivor buddies tell me it's normal. They also said my hair will grow much more 6 weeks after my last chemo. I also never lost my eyebrows or eyelashes on taxol. I too hate not having my long blonde hair but on the positive side, I am getting to see what different styles look like on me. Hang in there!",

I was nervous with the Taxotere with the permanent hair loss commercials. My husband and kids really notice it because they see me from behind. I never went completely bald so the hair that stayed is growing. It definitely is not thick normal hair but I'll take it. I have one more round until I'm done with chemo and I can't wait to see what happens! I never lost my brows or eyelashes.",
