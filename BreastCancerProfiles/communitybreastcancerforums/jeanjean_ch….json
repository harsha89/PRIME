He tried but took the wrong one. He said it's under the chestbone and near the aorta. I am arranged to have A/Cx3 dense dose and CMFx6 with 30 rads with targeted rads to the IM node area.  Will begin on April 13.  I google a lot here in Taiwan and find out my case is really rare. It's around 15%. It's only 1% to find it out earlier. IMLN seems like a grey area. Can anybody tell me what is SSD? I am not really familiar with these medical terms. Thank you!",
