I'm having my 2nd surgery on 12/1 to clear margins on 1 side & to remove more suspicious calcs found on my 11/28 mammo. I wasn't fearful about the 1st surgery on 10/28 nor this one either. I jsut want to get the hell outta the health system ASAP!",

I found out that the same team that did my 1st wire loc is doing the 2nd, very thankful. I want to shoutout especially to Mona, the mammo tech at the Women's Center @ UCLA/SM hospital. And I get to do my best \"Madonna\" cone bra imitation as she wheels me across to the main hospital for my surgery. That's a terrible thing that your work mates  aren't being supportive of you; dealing with this disease is no walk in the park.",

Oh Joy, I still have my nipple, funny the body parts you might miss.  I feel pretty good, but that may be due to the codeine Tylenol, oh and the chocolate marbled cheesecake I  made to get me thru the few days post surgery Would you believe my surgery was delayed 45 minutes the consent form had to be rewritten 3 times!!!! Something about wording wasn't proper.",
