Good luck with your recovery, evebarry, and take it easy! ",

It is so painful to realize that the one who is supposed to be our greatest supporter and ally has chosen not to do so.  I finally came to realize after much struggle that my marriage was already over; I just needed to file the paperwork.   I am NOT saying that you should get a divorce.  But know that if things don't work out, that you have options, and that you should do what is best for YOU. ",

Breast trauma: Physical damage to a breast. If a breast is injured by trauma, tiny blood vessels may rupture to cause localized bleeding (a hematoma). The hematoma can be felt as a lump. Trauma to the breast can also damage the fat cells in the breast tissue, a condition called fat necrosis. Fat necrosis can form a lump in the breast. This type of lump is not cancer. That being said, it can be difficult to tell the difference between necrosis and breast cancer by feel.  At the very least, you should get a mammogram and/or ultrasound and have a doctor evaluate you.",
