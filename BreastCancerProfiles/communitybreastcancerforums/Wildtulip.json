I found that after my BMX I had shoulder pain and determined that it was a posture thing because I was carrying myself differently. This summer I began reconstruction, and now during the TE fill process I am having neck and shoulder pain. Although it has been explained to me that as I'm stretched in front, it pulls on the back/neck muscles. (Of course, my mind did go there, and I was concerned for a while.) A chiropractor has helped me a great deal, so although a massage was mentioned and sounds fabulous, I wanted to throw the idea of a chiropractor out there too.",

I remember listening to the staff talking about their weekends as they went about their business. I think I felt an odd tugging when the port was removed, but not pain. I really don't recall if I was very sore afterward. However, I was given the option to be put out during removal (with twilight?), but opted not to because then I would need a ride. You didn't say when your removal was scheduled, but perhaps this is an option.",
