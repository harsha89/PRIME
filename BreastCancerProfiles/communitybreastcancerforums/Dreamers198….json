This is my first post but I\u2019ve been heavily creeping the boards since my diagnosis in July:) I started radiation yesterday and will have my second after work today. So far so good although I had little zingers from the site of my lumpectomy all day. Have had throbbing every now and again from the site since surgery but I suppose that\u2019s normal? Only other sensation that I would classify as uncomfy is the arms over my head during radiation. Everything along my armpit down feels pins and needles-y over the duration of the radiation. Anyone else experiencing this? Highlight of round one was the nurse playing \u201cheart of glass\u201d by blondie. Super distracting and had no idea when the session began and when it ended :). Took everything in me to lie still and not dance;). Best of luck to all you brave sisters xoxo",

No complaints here. Just one point below yours. Let us know what your MO says! (The tumour board at Princess Margaret also advised against chemo in my case) I think if they\u2019re for chemo in your case it may be less about the onco and more bc of your grade. Grade 3 will respond well to chemo ",

Only noticeable side effect has been the colour change. Left boob looks like butterscotch and right side more like milk chocolate. Guess I can live with that ;) For my rads sisters- One thing I find really soothing is asking for a warm blanket during treatment. I found it mentally challening the first few days to have my bare breast exposed or even just the gown on while the radiation was happening. With the warm blanket it was almost comforting to just close my eyes and drift away for those minutes. Maybe worth a try? Xoxo",
