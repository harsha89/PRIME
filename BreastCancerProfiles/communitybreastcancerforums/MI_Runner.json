Jayne in UK - it's nice to know others go through the same feelings. Mary - thanks for stopping by.  Good to hear that your surgery went well. Cherneski - hope you're feeling better today Candy - good luck tomorrow!  I hope everything goes swimmingly for you. Later all.  I have a final tomorrow.  Just finished my take home and got that turned in - all 20 single spaced, 10pt font pages of it.  One more day and I'm done with school for the semester. Oh, one other thing.  If all goes well I'll actually be flying at the end of the month for a professional conference.  Does anyone know where I get the compression sleeve?",

I'm in very good shape because I was planning to race a lot this summer and run a marathon in the fall and I feel like that should help me in recovery, but I really feel like I don't know what to expect.  Does anyone know how soon we can expect to be able to move around the house, when I can walk my dog, etc?",

My bilateral mx. was Monday, no reconstruction (I'm doing delayed).  It went well, and the sentinel node biopsy was clear in the preliminary analysis. I was in the hospital until late Tuesday afternoon and have been home with mom and bf since then.  I'm doing well since arriving home.  In fact, the hospital sent a visiting nurse on Wednesday and today - when today's nurse arrived, she was shocked to learn I was the patient - that's good news!  My arms and chest are tight so I can't reach high shelves or anything like that.  I've been walking along with the dog, but haven't felt comfortable holding her leash yet. Mom leaves on Sunday so I'll have to start, bf can't do it all.  The most annoying problems I'm having now are itchiness under my tape and getting tired of sleeping on my back - these things will pass.  I have two drains that I've been emptying a couple times a day and the amount of fluid is decreasing.  My post-op appointment is Monday afternoon. Hope everyone's surgeries and recoveries go well!",
