Big frowny face! The good news is everything is still showing just DCIS--no signs of invasive cancer so that is a positive. My BS is optimistic that another LX will take care of it once and for all ; but if not I will need a MX. Has anyone had more thanone LX and if so, did that take care of things or did you eventually obtain clean margins with an MX.? Any feedback would be appreciated. I am scheduled for an LX on September 12 but can always re-think which surgery to go with. Recovery (thus far) has been pretty easy and I like still having my breast... plusses for LX.",

I trust my bs so that Is a plus, too! The anesthesia did it's job... no memory of anything! My throat was sore due to the tube... other than that, all was good. The incision was a tad sore ( 3 on a 1 - 10 scale... 0 low--10 high!) They asked if I wanted a Tylenol with codene... yes, please. I am exhausted and drained... let's take the edge off and see what tomorrow brings! A pleasant surprise was that one of my third grader mom's was the head of surgery. She said she was going to make sure I got VIP treatment The best part was that she snagged me 2 more of those pink, super soft, closes in the front bras. Sweet! They are really really nice! I was told you can order them on Amazon. I hadn't eaten all day so was a bit hungry when I got home. Soup was the perfect meal for my irritated throat prepared to perfection by my eldest son! Overalll, the lumpectomy itself has been okay. Not worth the stress and anxiety I put in it. But it is the first day. I have a few weeks to yet slog through. And of course there is the pathology report. So I am not ready to exhale yet Thanks for all the positive energy and well wishes. My thoughts and prayers are with all of you as we plod along on this unexpected and unwanted journey. We can do this!",

I originally thought my lx was going to be (relatively) simple ...just go in and remove the bad stuff. But my MRI showed more suspicious areas so I then had more mammograms & an ultrasound. Without another biopsy, nothing was conclusive, but since the sites were close together, I had one big ole lumpectomy I was in surgery for over 2 hours. Don't know if that is long...just longer than what I thought it would be. My wound from the lx is sore, bruised, and swollen and looks God-awful. When I peeked at it yesterday , I expected to see a divot or a missing chunk but surprisingly ( due to the swelling) the size looks no different. There are these curved stitches so now my breast resembles a baseball. I tried to take it easy yesterday , a few light chores like laundry and deadheading to break up the monotony of Netflix & solitaire! And of course my mind is going full-tilt over the upcoming results. I am determined to stay positive but I have read that things like dense breasts, being ER/PR negative, and flat nipples are more risks for what I am not sure, but they aren't helpful! But it is what it is and I am what I am and what I am is determined to get through this as unscathed as possible. It is all about attitude, right? So I choose positive and hopeful yet pragmatic enough to be prepared (If that is posssible) to face the worst,",

Her response was that it was genetic. You wouldn't know how you reacted to radiation until treatment & that there was probably not too much you could do to prevent what would happen. Creams and lotions, diet, exercise, sleep and meditation may help, but in the end it's just the way your body reacts. As I read all of your different experiences I can't help but think my RO was right.",

I must say that you ladies have provided much needed inspiration and encouragement. What I have learned is not to sweat it... just to put your head down and GO! and moisturize, moisturize, moisturize! I have also learned that our rads journey is individual...some of us go longer than others, some of us are face down while others are on our back, some have a bolus and some of us need to use a breathing technique,... whatever best eradicates all traces of our disease...that is the treatment I hope we all are receiving! I wish each and everyone of you a lifetime of NED. You ladies rock!

Angela, holding your breath is to protect the heart so that technique is used when treating the left breast. As Shellsatthebeach said, it all depends on the rads machine that is used. My cancer was in the left breast and I don't hold my breath because the machine that is used on me makes other accommodations. Shellsatthebeach, thanks for the carbs tip. I slept awesome last night (10 hours.) DH brought bagels home for breakfast--hadn't had one for eons--so I indulged. Oh my goodness! I am sooooo tired--(it is only 10:50 AM!) Definitely not doing that again! Intgragirl--I re-read your earlier post about feeling like a cancer patient again and not liking it....I hope a week or so has put you in a better place. I know what we are going through is the same yet different...and it all is for crap...but I hope a weeks' closer to the finish line has made you rally a bit and know that soon this will all be just a memory. I mean, think about all you have all ready endured--it is over, done with...and so will rads! Brightness 4 (and anyone that is having the shortened treatment)... I am so jealous! I was prescribed 28 whole breast treatments and 6 boosts. I have completed 15..so I would almost be done if I were on the abbreviated plan. Alas...I have to trust my RO...But the good news is I have had very mild SE--just the hint of pink and some tingling here and there...and this ridiculous exhausted feeling (that I blame on the bagel so that is easy to fix!) So, chin up! 15 down--19 (good Lord!) more to go!",

She said that I was not a candidate for the hypo-fractionated treatment due to the size of my tumor so...it looks like I will be around all of November (and into December for a while, too.) Like all of you, I can't wait until this is behind me. So far, I have had eight treatments and the worst part is the drive (which when you think about it, is not a bad thing!) It takes me 40 minutes each way. It is not a bad drive, it just seems like such a time waster. I should listen to a book on tape or something to make it seem worthwhile! As far as the treatments go, it takes longer to get dressed, undressed, and into position than the actual treatment. One of the technicians said that the actual radiation treatment is under two minutes. Which again, isn't a bad thing! I have been slathering with Miaderm twice a day and Aquaphor at night. I have read that some of you say your RO doesn't recommend Aquaphor--I wonder why? I have not experienced any real SE yet other than some tingling near my incision. I have followed the advise of many of you and try to walk at least 3 miles each day and eat healthier. I don't know if it has done any good, but it makes me feel like I have a little control over this unwanted detour in my life. I got rid of my underwire bras and bought some of the Genie bras that had been recommended. I think I will ditch them too and just wear a cami when I am home--which is most of the time (except for rads--and I will definitely wear one there!) I retired from teaching in June (diagnosed 2 weeks later!) and I am in constant awe of you ladies that are working full time plus dealing with all this craziness.

I have Emu oil, Miadem, Calendula Cream and Aquaphor sitting on my vanity. I use only the Calenula 2x a day and Aquaphor at night...so I might have gotten carried away! I started the green tea brew today... will see how that goes. I finished treatment 11 today and so far so good, but it is the second half where things can get dicey. Time will tell, that's for sure. Prayers and positive thoughts are sent to each and everyone of you. Enjoy your day...hugs",

I guess that's the control freak in me. So besides all the creams and lotions, I drink 64oz of water daily (prior to diagnosis, water was only for baths!) try to eat only Whole Foods, have greatly reduced coffee& diet soda, exercise at least 30 min daily ( my favorite is just put on my favorite dance music and go to it!) and have taken advantage of the free Reikki sessions offered at my cancer center. I am also going to explore acupuncture and yoga as well as homeopathic supplements. I do not want a re-occurrence so these will need to be lifestyle changes forever. ",

There are many other articles on the topic as well. Ironically, it was my BS who told me about the \"Canadian method.\" I was really excited because I definitely wanted the shortened treatment (hypo-fractionated) My feeling was that a shorter treatment would lessen any side effects and even though I am retired, I wasn't thrilled about 34 entire mornings taken up by rads! I asked my RO about it when I had my initial consultation with her and she said I was not a candidate because my tumor was larger that 1-2 cm ( I hate to quote her on the exact size because I don't remember for sure.) She went on to say that the Insurance Company is requiring her to tell patients that it is an option and I had to sign something that said she had told me about it. Actually, rads goes by pretty quickly. I have already completed 10 treatments and I have (sort of) gotten used to the drive. Even though I had DCIS, it took the initial lumpectomy plus two re-excision surgeries to get clear margins. And I am ER/PR- so I will not benefit from any hormone therapy, so it is up to rads to wipe out any stragglers! What I am seeing is not a one size fits all treatment plan; rather an individualized plan based a myriad of factors. Next time I will count the songs that are played. I am in and out in about 20 minutes. The longest time is having the techs get me in position. On Monday, I plan to bring my little brew of green tea. I will have to remember to lock the changing room door, because it might take a little longer to apply it and \"the next customer\" walked in on me on Friday! Enjoy your week-end!",

I am 15/34 and far so good. Hopefully you will be fine during your long drive...safe travels! Lifechoices-- My RO said nothing about applying creams prior to starting rads so I didn't. I hadn't done a lot of radsresearch so I didn't even know others were doing it. My treatment is at 10:40 so it makes sense not to apply cream before treatment (plus my RO said not to) I am pretty much of a rule follower... so whatever my docs recommend, that is what I do. I do, however ask tons of questions and feel them out if there is something I want to do. Integragirl-- don't feel guilty about how you are feeling. I think it is very normal to have a jumble of emotions as we navigate this difficult and very personal journey. I find it easier to rant here--on this site-- or in my journal then talk to dear and caring friends. I can't tell you how many phone calls or texts have gone unanswered. I do need to be careful no to push them too far away, though. Rads is my last hurdle--( not counting the every 6 months check) and soon I can return to some semblance of normalcy.

I still have 6 boosts to get through but I feel like today I reached a mini- milestone. Tomorrow I get new mapping for the boosts. As much as I dreaded the long drive (40 minutes each way) it has gone quickly. Everyone at the Cancer Center has been lovely...do I dare day I will miss them?! My skin has held up through all of this... I am pink and a bit tingley, but all in all... not too bad. I hope I can still say this in a couple of weeks. Hugs and well wishes to all",

They drew a biggish circle on me with a smelly green marker and then made a t inside the circle--it sort of resembles a pie cut into 4 slices. it is around my scar. Stickers were also applied. I am not to apply lotion or creams to that area--they want the stickers to stay on but I can lotion up the rest of the breast. I am not sure if this is what they do at other centers, but this is what they did at mine. The actual boost felt no different but the machine was much smaller and closer. And every time I look at my breast, I crack up! On another note, yesterday I went to the dentist. I asked if having radiation would have any effect on my teeth. The hygienist said that radiation can cause Dry mouth. I hadn't really thought about it until she said that but oh my goodness my mouth has been really dry! I am constantly thirsty! She also said with not having as much saliva in your mouth cavities could be formed. Luckily I had no cavities but I am pretty obsessive about brushing & flossing my teeth! I have completed all of my whole breast treatments and one boost is in the books. Next week at this time I will be done with radiation treatment \u2026 Only five more to go! Yea me! Happy Friday everyone. Enjoy the weekend. Hugs!",
