I was diagonsed 4/16/13 (my birthday is 4/18 happy birthday to me) with IDC stage 1. I had a bilateral mastectomy on May 6th. My Oncotype came back 35 and I have BRCA 2 positive. Wednesday is the second anniversary of my mom's death from this dang disease. So I will be having my second treatment on the second anniversary of her death. Oh, has that been messing with my poor brain. I need to just get thru this week. I felt generally rotten after first treatment but it was low grade enough to not interfer to badly with my life. I haven't had any hair loss yet but I'm going to shave it off on Friday. I feel like I can't control anything in my life anymore but I can take control of when the hair goes so thats what I'm doing.",
