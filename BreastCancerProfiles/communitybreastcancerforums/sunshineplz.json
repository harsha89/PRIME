When I showed the mark to my mom (an RN of 25 years) she told me that it was just \"a part of me.\" However, I made the appointment with the doctor hoping it would end with the physical exam. I first saw my referral to the ultrasound as a confirmation of my deepest fears. But now I see that the doctor was just taking me seriously and being extra cautious. I'll take all of your words into my head and heart as I go into that ultrasound appointment in two days. Of course I'll update all of you when I get the answer, and if it's the outcome I so desperately hope for, I'll move peacefully forward in life, but always remember all of the stories of the men and women on this site.  Thank you,  Laura",

The left is much puffier and both the nipple and areola seem to puff out. It is on that areola that I have a long indent (almost looks like I had a suction cup- like a breast pump- which indented the tissue). However, I know that it's been there for at least two years. Probably longer actually, and im just hyper aware of my breasts lately because I'm a worrier. However, I have had absolutely no other symptoms at all and nothing has changed intwo years",

      "Content": "sunshineplz wrote: Hi everyone, So sorry to be starting a new post, but these are some questions I have for anyone with knowledge/experience: 1. The midwife who ordered me an ultrasound for my areola indentation (Nope- I'm not pregnant, by the way) said she wasn't worried. Do doctors generally say that to keep the patient at ease during the waiting period, or are they being sincere? 2. How long did it take you to get your ultrasound results? 3. What is the likelihood (generally and statistically) that a 24 yr. old with no immediate family history of BC would need a follow- up biopsy? 4. Is it common for a doctor to order an US for a young woman after seeing/feeling something \"out of the ordinary\" during a general breast exam? 5. What do you do not to obsess about the unknown? My wedding is only 3 months away and I'm struggling to show or feel any excitement for it because anxiety about my upcoming ultrasound ( March13) dominates my thoughts. I have drawn so much inspiration and wisdom from following this site. I feel connected to so many lives and stories here. When I have my answer, I'll be sure to update you all.

Of course, I still have to wait for the confirmation call of the doctor, but the radiologist didn't see anything at all. I cried with relief. Thank you all so much for your kindness and wise words.

I went for an ultrasound for the long, skinny indentation that puckered in the skin on my left areola on March 13th. Absolutely nothing but breast tissue was seen by the radiologist, and I received an official notice today from the doctor's office saying \"Congratulations, your recent breast ultrasound shows no abnormalities!\" This is all to say- get yourselves checked if you notice ANYTHING new, but don't try to self diagnose! My indentation is very strange looking and thus makes it so my left nipple/areola area looks NOTHING like my right- but I learned that this breast \"quirk\" does not equal cancer! STAY OFF WEB MD- DR. GOOGLE DOES NOT HAVE A REAL DEGREE.  Listen to your gut; listen to your doctor, and listen to the knowledgeable men and women on this site who really know their stuff.  Thank you all!",

      "Content": "sunshineplz wrote: Hi everyone, Life-long worrier here. I'm 24 years old with large fibrocystic dense breasts (34E), and recently noticed something weird in my left breast. Along my areola/following the vein that goes through my nipple is a vertical indentation. It's only visible when standing and raising my arms or when I lean forward, you can see the skin pulled in along that indentation. If you press hard, you can almost feel a long, hard, painless ridgey/ropey thing. I'm not sure how long it's been there, or if I'm just now noticing it (but I'd say it's been there AT LEAST a year). My mom is a nurse and she saw it and felt it and told me not to worry, but I went to the midwife today. She did look a little worried, although she said she wasn't. She scheduled me for an ultrasound and it's still 10 days away. She just kept saying that she notices a difference between my left and right breasts, but that an ultrasound will help her see what her eyes and hands can't. She also kinda seemed in a rush to get the ultrasound (she said MAX a week-2 weeks). My mom's had noncancerous lumps, but hasn't had BC. My grandmas both died of other kinds of cancer. I can't eat, can't sleep, can't function. I just cry and cry and cry. I'm terrified. My parents are away for 8 days, so it's just me. However, I figured this was a good place for advice and to not feel so alone. Log in to post a reply",

I'm definitely a hypochondriac, but I'm sure weird breast changes would freak anyone out. I'm clinging to my mom's assurance that everything is okay, and that the midwife told me that she wasn't worried. I'm doing my best to stay off Dr. Google and surrounding myself with friends and my fiance. It's going to be a LONG next 8 days, but I know I can push through. I'm also trying to avoid feeling the lump constantly and obsessing over it- that won't change the outcome.  Fortunately, because of my dense breasts, I'm skipping the mammogram and going straight for the ultrasound. I'm also not pregnant, but I saw a midwife because I went to the OB/GYN office instead of my PCP because it takes FOREVER to get in with her (my PCP).  Thank you both again! <3",

For at LEAST two years, I've had an inch long vertical indent on the right side of my left areola- it seems to follow the vein perfectly. When standing or bending forward, it's clear that the tissue is pulled in along that indent. If you press along the indent, it feels like an .5-1 inch tube-like hard, fixed thing (which might be the vein?) It might have ALWAYS been a part of my breast, but now I'm hyper aware. I had a physical and my PCP didn't notice anything, so I FINALLY made an appointment OB/GYN expecting that she'd send me away and say something like \"Oh, that's just hard breast tissue.\" NOPE- not so easy. I have an ultrasound scheduled for the 13th, and like you, I am SOOOO nervous. It's like one minute I'm free of the fear because I'm doing something enjoyable and forget, and the next moment, I remember, and it feels like my chest is falling into my stomach. BUT- Remember that 80% of weird lumps, bumps, changes, etc. are BENIGN! That's a HUGE majority! Also, to answer your question, I can feel tiny hard lumps in my upper armpit when I press- totally normal, and I DON'T have swollen nodes, as they've been checked recently by my OB/GYN. ALSO- DON'T GOOGLE! My mom's a Registered Nurse of 30 years and tells me NOT to use the Internet as a source- you'll psych yourself out too much! Fixed/hard lumps do not always mean breast cancer!!!! If you do need a biopsy, 80% of biopsies will be benign too! Anyway, if you feel like venting or just want to text more, feel free to private message me. I'm wishing you good luck and am eager to hear the results!  :)",

Secondly, when I was a toddler, my mom noticed bloody discharge coming out of her nipple with no other symptoms. Terrified, she rushed to the doctor. They performed a biopsy and found a clot of old blood toward the back of her beast (near her breast wall)- and it was TOTALLY benign. Scary what you're going through? yes. But remember that your age and statistics are on on your side.  Stay strong. <3",
