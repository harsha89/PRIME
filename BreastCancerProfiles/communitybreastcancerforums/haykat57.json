So far the side effects have been minimmal.  A couple of bad spells of nausea with profuse sweaty on the first day, but soon learned not to let my stomach get too empty or too full.  Lots of energy the first two days, but fatigue really kicked in on the third.  Went to Curves the first day of chemo and participated in the relay for life event the next night.  Lots of wonderful support from the community.  When they were calling off the names of cancer survivors and victims my husband was leaning over to say how God knows all those names by heart just at the moment they called my name.  What a special moment.  Made a new friend and ally with our new manager that night.  It turns out he lost his first wife only two years ago to breast cancer.  He was very tender towards my husband and I, so I feel much more secure at work now since my direct supervisor has been somewhat of a problem through all of this.  So today is starting out good, this is the first morning my stomach hasn't woke me up to tell me feed it or else.  Only taking one anti-nausea med today and may not need it much more.  So far, so good.  I'll take some time to read the other postings to get to know who my chemo buddies are.

Thanks, Kathy",

Yeah!! Angie27- I've read some of your threads here and elsewhere and hope you are feeling better.  I am not so much scared as I am mad.  Even with the cancer I feel healthy, but now I have to get sick to stay that way.  And all the side effects!  I am glad to see from the other postings that I am not the only one who wishes she didn't have to go this route.  Before they found the cancer in the lymph nodes they were only talking about the Tamoxifen and I didn't even want that.  Reading through \"tips to get through chemo\" on another thread helped me feel more in control and more optimistic about all this.  Here is one tip that might help those with nausea.  When I was pregnant with my daughter I had morning sickness anytime I was around food for seven months.  The one food that would always go down and stay down was oatmeal.  I hated the whole dry cracker bit.  Getting my dh to bring me some oatmeal in bed helped start the day off without a pit stop at the commode.  Figure I'll give it a try this time too.  Don't have a start date yet, but have a PET scan on the 9th and appt with onc on the 16th so I expect to start the next week. We'll get through this together.",

My surgeon from the start has said that by the holidays all of this should be behind me.  It's not what I planned for this year, but the holidays will be that much sweeter. ",

They are only $29 and have a money back guarantee so you could try a couple rather inexpensively.  Their website is thewigcompany.com.  I know what you mean about the wig sales associate wanting them all to look like her hairstyle.  I had long straight hair until I got in high school and decided to try something new.  I wanted a nice shoulder length bob and even had a friend come with me who had a hair cut like what I wanted.  I ended up with a page boy cut that looked hideous on me, but which was exactly the type of hairstyle the beautician had.  I hope you find something that you can feel good about.  Me, I just hate putting all this junk in my system, I'm not a total health nut, but I always read labels and avoid chemicals as much as is economically possible.  But like I said, we are all different.  Kathy",

There are long term side effects to the chemo, that had I been given the option you have I would have taken it, but peace of mind is worth a lot, too.  My mother-in-law had breast cancer over 20 years ago with no chemo and she is still around, although there was a recurrence in the other breast 13 years ago.  With the Tamoxifen that they give now, she probably would not have had that recurrence.  Hope you are able to make a decision that you are comfortable with.
