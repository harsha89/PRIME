I'm really trying to stay positive, but down deep inside I feel that it is going to be bad. Lately I've been having dreams about not being able to open my eyes & I'm always with my parents who have both passed away many years ago.  I can feel the crying stage coming back, I'm so scared.",

Thinking was he talking to me? I couldn't believe my ears, I wished that my Mother was there to talk with. (She passed away 34 yrs ago)  I'm trying to stay positive & yet I have this gut feeling that my nodes aren't going to come back clean.  I'm also waiting for the insurance company to okay my MRI, so we can be sure that the rest of my left breast is clear as well as the right.  Actually, I've already had the tumor removed but going back in to take more tissue, & some nodes. Thanks, for listening & giving me support.",

This site has been very helpful to me in deciding which course to take, Mastectomy or Lumpectomy. It has also give me hope from reading other conversations & stories on here. I'm going back into surgery on June 19 for a Lumpectomy & to have some lymph nodes removed.  Then the waiting game for pathology report to see if it has spread & what stage. Of course, I fear the worst & I'm trying to keep my thoughts positive. Mary Dx 5/20/2008, IDC, 1cm, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
