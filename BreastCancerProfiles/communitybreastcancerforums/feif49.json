I then waited a month for my Oncotype results and because they were low got to skip chemo. I am 4 weeks into radiation and wanted to let you all know that it is not too bad\u2026 I am taking LOTS of vitamins/supplements that I have read help with energy and while I am becoming progressively more tired as the treatment progresses, it is totally manabeable. I have been using coconut oil exclusively and the RAd nurse said she has never seen anyone wihtout burns after 16 treatments. I don't have a mark on my breast\u2026 I did have some nausea early on and some water weight gain. I learned that it is really important to drink TONS of water while getting RADs, your kindneys need it to funtion properly and that solved both the nausea and the water weight gain. I hope this helps a little and feel free to ask me anything\u2026 I am looking to see if anyone has begun their research on tamoxifen too? that seems more daunting to me than anything I have faced so far so I am hoping to share info on that as well. Thanks and so glad to have found you all!",

      "Content": "Jun 21, 2013 07:36PM - edited Jun 21, 2013 07:37PM by feif49 Hello ladies, I have not been on in a while but wanted to check in and see how you all are doing and give some updates. I have 4 treatments left and did really great with skin things until end of week 5 when my skin finally gave in and now my breast looks like someone took a blow torch to it. Unlike some of you, I did my 8 Acuboost first and that is the area that now looks the worst. Dark red and itchy. The nipple is pretty disfigured at this point (that is where my lumpectomy incision was) and it is also contantly pert as this point- nice huh?) wearing tank tops and going braless at home and that helps a lot!! I am continuing with the coconut oil and it is rather remarkable as I can see if healing if I keep slathered in it between treatments. I have used NOTHING else and all the nurses say my skin has done remarkable well. I start Tamo early July and went to a great support group at my clinic that helped me to be less nervous about the SE's. I recently went to a luncheon and was feeling kind of sick and tired of this whole process- I sat next to a woman my age who happened to be in a wheelchair. She was lovely. Later I learned that she had been attacked in her home by an aquiantance, almost raped and shot in the back while trying to escape. She is a vital and happy person who likes to enter wheelchaor marathons. I'm sharing this because it is easy to get mired in the treatment but there are so many people out there suffering EVEN more than us and ATTITUDE is everything. This really helped me to take a deep breath and keep going. So keep the faith & cheer going and know that you are loved and supported!!",

It is very oily but I slather it on after showering and then lay down for 10 minutes to let it soak in and off I go. I use it twice a day and have not used anything else topically. Today is 21/33 and still no burns or peeling so I am hoping it'll keep working. Heart2930- thanks, I'll look for those threads on no SE because I am very nervous about starting that when I finish up RADs. Congrats on getting half way thru every step counts\u2026",
