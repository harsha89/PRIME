First they said mastectomy. No way around it.  Went to chemo first, rather than surgery 4.5 cm x 4.5 cm, bloodwork everyweek, chemo every third week.  After 2nd chemo, tumor was down to size of a pea. Getting ready for 4th chemo. Treatments started 4/16 and end 7/30.  Then a lumpectomy apprx 3 weeks later, followed by 30 rounds of radiation.  M-F, 1/day, until 10/5.  Chemo includes Herceptin, Carboplatin and Taxotere. Changed diet, took out all excess suger, processed foods and meats with hormones or steroids, working with a nutrionist to changed diet, etc.  Eating more fruits, veggies and using a juicer to increase intake of foods more beneficial to fighting cancer. Oncologist is impressed with how fast the tumor shrunk down. Need to know what to expect for radiation.  Side effects?  With chemo, started loosing the hair on day 17.  I am overweight, but with eating more healthy, weight has dropped 15 pounds since February.  Still need to get to a more healthy weight.  American Cancer Society says, even if taking treatments, get the weight to a healthy level.....my tumor is feeding off of my own fat cells....Oncologist and surgeon both said diet will make no difference at all and oncologist said don't go on a diet to loose weight.  This seems to contradict what I have learned by reading different studies.  Anyone have any comments, suggestions?",
