I was surprised last night that I had pain - it felt like someone was pinching or stabbing me inside above my areola. I guess I didn't realize there would be pain, other than burning feelings. It was tolerable and I live with a lot of joint pain so I am not unfamiliar with the concept of pain, I was just unaware. Everything is fine today. And I have an acupuncture appointment this morning - one of the freebies and I always wanted to try it, so why not !  I am including a picture of the beautiful lake view at the top of my daily hike (I started on the 1st). It only takes 20 minutes to get up there, but it is steep ! Good luck to everyone today !  ",

When I had to lie there, and they tried again and again to get me in position and plan the boost beam positions, everything was just killing me - my head, my jaw (which is forced clenched by having my head down on the head frame \"cushion\"), my inner ears, my neck, my lower spine and both sides of my pelvis. And then my arms fell asleep and were really painful. And my breasts were itching insanely from my reaction to the prior rads treatments since Friday. I kept trying to meditate away to my 'happy place' but I couldn't, everything was just hurting so badly. I have a pre-existing joint/ligament pain issue but it was really intense and I could not believe I could not move for so long. Shear agony. When it was time to get up, I could not feel my arms or feet and was trying to explain that I had no sensation and could not lift myself off of the table. It took a while to get them to understand how bad things were and help me up. They were sorry that I was in so much pain but could not help how long it took. They put extra stickers on me and so tomorrow's final appointment should go faster but I will take some ibuprofen ahead of time just in case the headache pain returns. I immediately had to head to my weekly acupuncture treatment, for which I was 15 minutes late, and that is when I cried. I also had a return of the nausea, with the headache and the other pain, and I just couldn't hold it together any more. My acupuncturist was so kind and immediately just started rubbing my temples with soothing oils and I didn't need to explain anything or try to speak. I don't know that I could have done anything differently. Had I known how much this would hurt me, perhaps I would forego boosts. It is not like I have to go through this same exact scenario ever again and it reminded me of natural labor - the pain was made worse by not knowing how long I had to tolerate it. I guess the only thing I will do tomorrow is ask them to estimate how long it will take (which should be quick if all of the markers align nicely). I finished my goal of climbing to the top of a nearby (small) mountain peak every day in September - today I did it in the rain, and now I will search for new hikes to explore. I am headed now to see the movie Everest, just to belittle my accomplishment I guess...",

When he asked if I had any questions, I asked how soon until I am fully healed and he said \"one month.\" Then I had him totally befuddled when I asked how long until I could expose it to a tanning bed, and after telling me how horrible that was to do, and especially someone with blue eyes, he said \"six months\". I said, yes, but it can't cause breast cancer, right - and he said no. I'm not saying that I am going to go back to tanning, I am just saying that perhaps I did not have as bad a reaction because I had been frequently using a tanning bed prior to my diagnosis and so that maybe my skin had adapted. However, tanning burns the outer layers of skin, and radiation causes the skin to stop being replaced once it dies (or something close to that) so it may have nothing to do with it.  This picture is of me after 15 of 16 accelerated whole breast treatments. As I said in an earlier post, I did not realize I was being zapped on the non-cancerous breast, or down the middle, so I was not treating it with the biafine cream. The rest of the right breast is fine - maybe slightly more tanned than the left but I can't even see the demarcation of where I was zapped and where I was not. I have a diamond-shaped radiation \"tan\" and they carefully pull the left breast out of the way each time, and I lie on it, but some of it is still exposed as they try to get the area of the right breast that is required.

I am whining about my itching, and stretching pain when I lie down any way except on my back, but I have not had anything like that. Not sure how many days of treatment you had. The thought of having to go back for more radiation with that much redness is horrible. Maybe since the burns usually do not appear until the accelerated protocol is almost finished, I would think no matter how bad it is in the end, it is preferable to not have to go back for another two weeks once the burns and rash set it. I asked for the accelerated plan, and I asked for the prone position, after researching which facilities offered both, so anyone who has not started yet, I would ask about these as well. At least ask why you are not a candidate for them. There are factors that go into whether or not you can be prone, but the research for the accelerated program has shown it is just as effective as the 30+ day protocols. I think ROs are hesitant to change. And you have to be comfortable with the decision as well of course.  Gentle hugs meezers. I hope you heal quickly !",

I was diagnosed right before my May birthday last year, so I elected to wait until June (2nd) for my annual mammogram. My RadOnc had asked to have a diagnostic one done at the end of radiation \"as my new baseline\" so I had that in January. All was said to be fine. Monday I got the call to come back for additional images on the \"bad boob\" side based on Thursday's images. They saw new microcalcification growths in a cluster, since January. That made me so angry. Are you kidding me. New calcifications so quickly ? I have lost 40 pounds since January 25th and so I would l think my body would be slowing its cell growth patterns all over, but nope. Yesterday I had magnified images and the radiologist showed me the cluster - it was there a year ago but not removed (not as suspicious as the fine linear branching area that was removed and I was not even aware of this cluster but knew I had other kinds of calcifications in other areas that were not suspicious); the cluster was there in January (no change) and now there are more microcalcs in this one cluster. I saw my BS last night and have the stereotactic core needle biopsy on the 15th (earliest available). Of course, to quote my BS, if it is more DCIS (or IDC), it means \"I have failed conservative treatment and need to have a mastectomy\". How is radiation \"conservative treatment\" ?! Seriously. Anyway, hope everyone else is having a better time with their follow-up imaging and I will post the results when I get them either the 18th or 21st. My BS said she had 6 biopsy results in front of her right now for others and all of them were positive. Her evening of callbacks was not going to be fun but it makes me feel like maybe they don't do wasteful biopsies either. Cheers and good wishes to all !",

Because my left breast is above the table (and carefully pulled out of the way each time so none of it dangles down the opening) it is not being radiated either. But I don't know how much of an area they radiate for those with nodes which are positive (for non-DCIS). Friday they had to reposition me 3 times to get me lined up correctly. Monday and Tuesday I lined up correctly the first time. I don't know what was wrong on Friday. But I learned on Tuesday's visit with the RadOnc that my breast is swollen, despite my response that it is not. So maybe Friday, after 5 consecutive treatments, it was extra swollen with edema, I don't know. Obviously it is not massively swollen or I would not be so unaware. Looking in the mirror I can barely notice some darker color, and some pinpoint red dots. Yesterday I noticed some slight itching for the first time. But no pain or any other issues with the breast. Friday the fatigue set in. And nausea reared its head again. I had nausea the prior weekend and attributed it to something from the grandkids. Now I think it is from the rads although they say not. I am in the prone position, and the table painfully pushes on my sternum and lower ribs, and they said perhaps that triggers the nausea. But it did not start until Friday, after 4 days of treatment, just like the prior week. I did discover that drinking PeptoBismal stopped the pain instantly. I take Prilosec every day for other GERD reasons, so I was surprised the Pepto worked so quickly. I am still hiking every day but I was really dragging yesterday with the fatigue. I don't sleep any additional time (6.5 hours per night typically) but I feel lethargic. Sunday I bounced back and did a lot of yard work, including climbing a ladder and sawing branches off of a tree, but the RadOnc said I will find the \"weekend break\" on Sundays and Mondays to go away over time and the fatigue to become more constant. I finish radiation a week from Thursday but I am not sure when the fatigue will subside ? Is that one of the side effects which could go on for many weeks or months, or might it end shortly after radiation ? Good luck ladies ! ",

I brought it with me to my 1-week follow-up appointment with the RO and assistant, and they were impressed and had never heard of it ! They offer 1% lidocaine, or prescriptions for 2.5% lidocaine, but didn't know about this - I said I had not researched the inactive ingredients but I was happy with it. It really saved me from going insane from itching. The RN/assistant was going to mention this to her patients with vulva radiation as well (ouch - and, I didn't know that was possible). Magnolia - you will want to check that the calendula cream doesn't have alcohol as the first ingredient.

The dosage is based on the plan put together by your RO and dosimetrist. I am having 16 whole breast treatments of 266 centigrays each and 2 boost treatments in the \"lumpectomy cavity\" of 266 centigrays each, for a total of 266*18= about 48 Grays. The last two will \"burn less surface skin\" because it is not covering as much area. My RO expects my burns to be at their worst the week following rads (5th week) because they are not burning the skin as much as causing it not to grow back, and that rate would be about the same for everyone. I agree with KBee that the number of grays total would affect how bad the burns become.  Also, I have had a bad weekend - burns appeared Friday for the first time, and raised itchy-as-hell bumps appeared between my breasts and on my left breast - I thought it was entirely pulled out of the way when I lay prone ! And I had nausea and general intestinal issues was racing to the bathroom all morning today. That is the 3rd weekend in a row with bathroom issues.

KBee - I can't believe you have that much of a raw area - my raw areas are between my breasts, down the thin skin along the breastbone. I still cannot sleep on either side because it pulls and tears the area. I can't stretch my arms far, and I started hunching over when I stood as it was tearing it when I stand up straight. Of course, I am making myself stand up straight but I wince. The descriptions of the pain were very colorful (road rash, etc). I would say it is one giant paper cut that keeps tearing and also feels beaten. Even my left breast and nipple, which did not get radiated directly, now hurts internally. I have taken KBee's suggestion of alternating advil with tylenol and I put on either Silverdene (to prevent infection) or Recticare (to numb it) and I use the frozen gel packs, especially to fall asleep. I haven't heard anyone else saying their burns are between the breasts - not sure if it from the prone position or from sweating when I hiked - I know they cautioned against getting sweaty as that could make the skin bubble up, etc. Anyway, enough complaining. Tomorrow morning we are heading north for the weekend to Acadia National Park in Maine and I am going to sit on the cliffs and stare out at the ocean - this was my \"happy place\" I envisioned while getting radiated each day.",
