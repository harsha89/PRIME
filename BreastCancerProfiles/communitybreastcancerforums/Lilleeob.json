      "Content": "Lilleeob wrote: anyone have any experience similar to this? I found my lump out of nowhere, seemingly overnight.. in the shower. This was three weeks ago.About two weeks or so before that, I have severe tingling in my last two fingers but it kind of went away for the most part. (Although, if I focus on it I can still feel it a bit). Feels although it could be easily aggravated, for example I did a shoulder work out and experienced the tingling again, luckily I'm aware and stopped immediately. It went back down again thank god. My blood work all came back normal. Awaiting ultrasound and mammogram and CT scan. My lump feels like a band or tendony type thing rather than a circle, one edge can be felt very clearly and it's rigid, while the other edge kind of just fades away towards my nipple area, it's about 1.5 cm maybe? Hard to say due to irregular shape and can not be pinched between my fingers, it's quite hard, and the NP said it was moveable (whatever that means). Also experience pain in chest/breast bone and shoulder blade upon deep breathing. Other than that, I have no pain. I should add, my breasts look normal. They feel normal and I would think the lump was gone if well, I couldn't feel it with my fingers. May be worth mentioning sometimes the lump feels itchy inside. My skin has no visible symptoms.

Then shoved me down the rabbit hole lol, so I was laying there wondering if their mic was broke, for like fifteen minutes and wondering if the dye was in me or yet. There was very little guidance or telling me what they were doing. I wasn\u2019t not even asked to talk or breathe in or out. It wasn\u2019t at all as I was expecting, but I was really hoping for an answer today",
