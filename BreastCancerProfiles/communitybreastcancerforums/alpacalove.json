Please help me help my Mum! Just found out she gone back into hosp, she was dx with lobar carcinoma and taking arimidex pretty sure and except for bones are weak, it began in her lymph and bones tumours down spine and in pubic bone but not her organs. Family so shocked because boobs so small and doc could not even feel tumour!!!! Blood test show nothing they did biopsy and some scan to see it. She wasn't allowed to start treatment til she had rods put in her neck because cervical bones were too weak allow treatment to work but now she's had several session of radiotherapy starting on her neck as worst tumour there and working down ones on spine, but she in hosp now as due to dry mouth from neck radiation which got infected and then they found her t1 vertebrate has massively deteriorated :(.She's only 59 and still needs to do alot of things in her life!!
