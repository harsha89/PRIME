What they say is that the air is not being pushed from one liung to the next. When i cant breathe it feels like i am having a heart attack in the center of my chest, hope that helps",

An another thing, all these people saying they have cancer to get money for weddings and to buy themselves things are really getting on my nerves..... People don't want to think that you can die from this I guess,  they have their head in the sand we don't.  Education, well they have to pay attention to it.   We have drs. they tell people they are going to die in xx amout of time, why would they do that, if it was their mother they wouldn't like it.  We spend alot of time taking care of everybody else, not that I want everybody falling all over me, but come have some respect for me trying to survive today and tomorrow and hoping I will be here to see my kids graduate high school in 2012 and then if that happens the next goal is 2 years after that for my oldest grandchild.....don't feel sorry for me, just don't look at me like I have a disease and don't treat me any different.
