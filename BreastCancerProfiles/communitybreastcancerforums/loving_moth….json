When they remove the tumor and some of the surrounding tissue, how do most of you get that part filled in. My surgeon suggested that they can take some tissue from other areas, such as the hip. I don't want anything artificial put in and I don't want them to touch the other breast. What do you think if they just leave it without filling it in? Will I have problems due to the differences in the weights of the 2 breasts, such as neck or head problems? Has anyone gone through this route and can lend me some advice?  Also, are clear margins usually determined during the surgery? Like is there someone in the room with the surgeon who is able to tell when the margins are clear or do they usually need to diagnose the parts they take out to ensure clear margins are reached, and if they are not, then I need to go back for another surgery?",

I have nearly made my decision on a lumpectomy to begin with and I will see how it goes after I receive my pathology report. What do you think of my decision?  I am not going to get any reconstruction surgery done after my operation to remove the tumor until they confirm clear margins. I am doing this because the surgeon said that if they perform a lumpectomy followed by immediate reconstruction and fail to get clear margins, than a mastectomy is the only option. Has anyone ever done this? The surgeon said she has never seen this done before and I don't want to do anything wrong. I have read online that doing reconstruction after radiation is difficult so would it be okay to do the reconstruction after clear margins are confirmed but before radiation starts or has anyone undergone reconstruction years after a lumpectomy? I am not as worried about my physical appearance as I am worried about getting this cancer out of me! Any suggestions or advice is GREATLY APPRECIATED",
