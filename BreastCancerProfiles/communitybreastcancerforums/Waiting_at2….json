Because that would change the rest of my post if it does...they're very different types of situations) I don't have any personal experience with your type of cancer, but I've read a little about it. I'm so sorry for your diagnosis and what you're going through right now, just finding this out. I've read that IDC has a high likelihood of going into nearby lymph nodes, so those will need to be checked. \"High grade\" means that the cancer cells are poorly differentiated, in other words there is excessive cancer cell growth. Whether the excessive cell growth is located at one site, or has moved into other sites will be evaluated. It is probably a fast growing cancer, and your specialist will most likely discuss Chemotherapy with you. They will also check the cancer's hormone receptors (which contribute to its growth).Â  You and your specialist will be discussing quite a few options, based on the specifics about your cancer. There will be a lot of technical information and decision-making thrown at you. When you feel overwhelmed or confused or sad or pissed off, take a break and try to do something that you enjoy, or have always wanted to do. There are so many women here that I admire and they are so knowledgeable and kind. I think you're in the right place!",

That's what BIRAD 4 means. That biopsy tells you that there is cancer, they know what type it is, and will know more detail about its characteristics. That specific information will give you and your specialist a group of options for your course of treatment. You should expect to go through some diagnostic scans to check if it has spread to other areas, and determine the cancer's dimensions. How are you feeling today about this? What things are going through your mind? Was \"invasive ductal carcinoma high grade\" the only info they gave you?",
