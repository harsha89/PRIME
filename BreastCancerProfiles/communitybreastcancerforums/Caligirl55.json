My first treatment it hit me Friday evening ....maybe not this time. Seq24 ...we will all be here for you and I will be praying I need your date next week. For the head my friend who has been BC free for 2 years ...but unfortunately still hair free said she uses Sarna sensitive cream. It's in the cortisone type cream isle and it has a pump. I use it morning & night and it's soothing with no steroids or fragrance . I found at Target & Walmart. She Sid it just make wearing a wig more comfortable. djm ... It is hard because sometimes we don't want to be tough & keep telling everyone everything is alright. ..it's not. But we all know it could be worse but in the constipated, diarrhea, sharp pains, achy all over, fever moment it seems the worst .... So we encourage each other as best we can. I can honestly say I haven't dropped one dang pound .... Nope not a one and I'm eating much less. My PA said the steroids might make me gain weight ...lovely fat and bawled 😬 Sensitivehrt ...I love the face ... I think I practice that one a lot lately Adjclan.... I plan on using that ....hope you are lucky enough to say that naive line. I have always been a big sympathy fan when my teenagers would complain about something I always said ... Sucks to be you now I just say sucks to be me right now. Sattipearl....so so sorry for the painful treatment 30 minutes can seem like hours. Your CEO is awesome I hope you enjoy every moment and show us pictures. I want to go to the coast so bad. We live near Pismo which I know being a So.Ca. Girl we use to make fun of the beaches up here but when it's all you have you want it...just didn't feel like the 3 hour drive on my good weekend last week. Oh and DH comes home last night and says. ... Want to go to Vegas this weekend?? Considering at this point after my first treatment I just wanted to be able to drop my head on my pillow and rest when needed I thought he was funny ...or nutty... But he's the one telling everyone onthe phone \"We're doing good\" 🙄 I think as far as losing my hair & having my first treatment the antisipation was the worst. Love & hugs to all 😘",

The radiologist said he could drain it if it bothered me. I was thinking ahhh..no I will see my BS if I want anything drained. So I'm good for a year now just MO visits and my RO wants to see me every 3 months for reasons I'm not sure of ...I feel like he asks me about 4 questions and we are done.

When I got home last week my son and I drove to visit our family in Garden Grove...which was so nice to sit out in their shady backyard. Not possible here in Clovis...we have triple digits all week😰 Back in the lovely summer of 16 when I was diagnososed with breast cancer they found I had a genetic heart issue too ... so I was hit with a double whammy. I am switching cardiologists to get a second opinion of all these meds mine has me on. So far no word on my blood work. Don't y'all be jealous but I had my colonoscopy yesterday and to make it even more fun they threw in an endoscopy too!! For extra precautions. Hugs",

The air is bad and I am over this heat. We have had a record broken for most consecutive days in the 100's ever here!! Yepee!! Dara ...seriously?? and then you break your darn toe!! So sorry! Sorry about the sweat too that is just not fair..remember we said our cancer was the gift that kept giving. With it being our 2 year month I have some sad moments when I think back to our chemo days. I am so thankful we had each other and still do. I hope everyone is doing well. My endoscopy came back good and the polyps from the colonoscopy were all clear so that's a praise. Tomorrow it is back to work week with inservice meetings, trainings and getting my office ready for when the students return next week. I am hoping this is my last year. Stay cool girls and keep praying for those poor firefighters & California. Hugs 😘",

I have no idea but glad all is going so well with your calluses and keloid scars. Lucky you! Dara... Love your dreams of not being recognized. I know how you fill about your wig ...I will put mine on just in the house and I wind up flinging it off. I sure hope I get use to it after chemo when I feel better and don't get these rashes on my head. I am so glad your last infusion went so well. Mine didn't go so well. Jiffrig...sorry about the taxol & hospital stay ... That stinks. Lyn....don't you love auto correct ... Hehe I never know what will come out. I kept having that with my dates too but I finally gave up on some of them. As far as rinsing my mouth I started already tonight when I got home. So far no sores just my warm mouth so I drink and eat lots of cold things and whoever told us about the little sherbet cups they are great ...cold and they taste yummy and I am not a sherbet lover. Thanks! sensitive..... Welcome to my world, my doctor usually says after my calls its just the chemo but with my rash he did give me some Aterax to help my itch fest. Kelly ... We are here to whine to each other and encourage and help each other. I know Dara & I will be here to support our ladies. Kechla... Glad the cold capping & icing is working for you but I am so cold in the infusion room I don't think I could do it...I am the one requesting more warm blankets. My MO wants to see me throughout the surgery & radiation phase and then every 3 months for a couple years then every 6 months for a few years. I can live with that...more ways than one I hope. willa216... I had a horrible rash last treatment and the doctor gave me Atarax to help and I bought lots of anti itch creams ....about 4 different types. My friend made me a cream that helped the most. Oh Elizabth ... So darn sorry for you ...again! My #4 and last chemotherapy was today. After meeting with my MO to go over blood work and next phase I headed to the chemo lounge ..apparently MO was hungry because in a short time he went to lunch without sending med orders to the chemo nurses. So we set for over an hour. The nurse in training took my case & after 3 attempts at my IV we both requested my regular nurse Heather ...who in one poke I was set. Theyfinally started fluids then all the premeds. Finally get started a little behind schedule. Then nurse in training takes one of my chemos off and starts the next one so nurse Heather notices my meds stopped still had too much in it so nurse in training panics and after being told gently to clip off new chemo and reintroduce the one that needed to be finished so more time running behind. By the time I finished it was just Heather still working so I got a hug and I was ready to run out with my DH and that's what we did. Hope I can rest since my steroids have me bopping around the house doing stuff. Love & hugs, Vicki 😘",

Maybe that is why I haven't experienced any neuropathy so far? Have a good day y'all",

My daughter has thyroid cancer and when the cancer center here C-Care called our phone to leave her a message just hearing them on my message machine for herto see an oncologist was kind of upsetting. Not sure why? Think of y'all lots & always keeping y'all & Annie in my prayers. Hugs 😘 ",

Not thinking they will find anything like the last time but I will go along with the medical game that one person says one thing and the next Doctor says that can't be and then gives another idea. How can one doctor be so opposite as another?? How can one doctor say possible scar tissue and the next one say it can't be...are medical schools and books all wrong? Had my 6 month oncologist check and he didn't even want to weigh in with an opinion ....smart guy! Fall weather is coming to central California soon I think? Hugs 😘",

While seeing my regular doctor in June I mentioned it to her and she gave me one...and that was when it all went sideways with cancer. I had all my nightmare treatments, surgery and fun stuff then go in March for my annual pap again right after my radiation finished and fried my armpit and boob. I decided to tell the doctor my sad events of the past year and through in how they forgot to even give me the paper to get it done so it was done later as if it was their fault.

Thank you Dara for checking on me and snapping me out of my funk. I've been exhausted and a bit down this month. I feel over worked and overwhelmed but thank you for letting me rant. Had my 9 month check with oncologist today. He said it can take a couple years to be myself .. My age is a factor... Love that guy he is always so darn honest no sugar coating it. 🙄 Dara ... You have had a rough month. Your brother sure spent a long time recovering ... Glad he is finally home. I understand how lumps and bumps scare us now. I had a squamous cell cancer spot removed from my left arm and I was surprised how many stitches I got for a small sun spot. Too many Summer's at Huntington & Hermosa Beaches. I guessing the baby oil with iodine wasn't wise either but we had no idea back then. Lyn... You are right about this thing we call Cancer 😝 Annie... Glad your improving ... Seems you had to go back to work so soon. Always feel you have had it worse than many of us with all the extra things you have going in your life... I guess our inner strength has been tested for all of us. Kelly...you are right those darn pounds just leap on me too! Kelly B.. I did get my results last week on my lateral mammogram & ultra sound. It seems that seroma is just that ... They think it's just fluid so will monitor it. Maybe I'm just more sensitive to things but after what we all went through don't they know just keeping eye on it isn't very comforting? I've decided if I have to be put under for any surgery I have a list of other things I want done, fix my third boob growing on the side by my SN, then reconstruct both of the girls so they look like maternal twins again, then do my left carpal tunnel procedure and fix my eyelids as long as I'm under ..lol I was going over my journal that I kept when we were all having chemo, I kept it so I could keep everyone straight so I could pray for you all. It's stired a lot of emotions also showed me had bad I spelled and took notes. Hugs 😘",

My DH started a new job this year so taking much time off isn't on his list and I don't have a lot of energy to argue about it. Taking the 15 year old around would exhaust me.

Apparently my oncologist office send a routine mammo but we all need diagnostic mammograms now. They tried to get the orders changed but couldn't reach my oncologist. So they proceeded but I will probably have to come back for the more in depth one. Yippee!! It wasn't as painful as I thought it would be. Can anything be simple? Tomorrow I see my RO not sure why I still have to see him but i will be there. Kelly ... Congrats to your daughter. Sorry you both have so many appointments and your arm has given you more problems then you deserve. I hope it all gets resolved soon. Dara...you are keeping very busy. Some days it's like we are over this then others are like...we have been through so much I am not ready to just go back to life as if nothing ever happened. It's not like I want sympathy I just don't really know what I want. If I think of it too much I can get sad so I just bury it. I went to another Pink Heals home visit and it was a young girl I nominated for a visit. Lindsey is our Andrews friend who just had the double mastectomy at 29. Here's a picture with my spike do. ",
