I'm supposed to go in for full body checks annually, but I havent. :/ I found out from my mother that several people on her side of the family, namely her dad and aunt had stomach cancer. Would either or both of these put me at a higher risk for bc? Ive tried researching it online but cant seem to find any definate answers and being new to the board, im having a hard time navigating to find info. Im still waiting on the results of my mammo and u/s and even though im willing them to be ok, I still have a nagging feeling that something isnt right. Im reading too much and worrying too much but its hard not to. :(  Log in to post a reply",
