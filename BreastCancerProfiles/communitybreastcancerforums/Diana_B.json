The recurrence is in my axillary and internal mammary lymph nodes. The axilla was radiated and I read that only a tiny percentage of women have a recurrence in this area after an axillary dissection and radiation. For this reason, people might be a little skeptical but insist if you think there might be something there. If you feel anything weird in the middle of your chest, have that checked out too. I felt something strange there for months - a kind of \"blooping\" sensation, almost like a watery or blurred heartbeat - but everyone pooh-poohed it. Once again, do insist! I didn't know anything about the internal mammary lymph nodes until this happened to me, and as they're not mentioned a lot, I'm sure most of us aren't alert to this possibility. So there is still one stage before stage 4, but it's still a pretty devastating place to be.",

I myself have got second opinions twice without having to pay for it. One thing you might speak to the oncologist about is bone drugs, the two most common being Pamidronate and Zometa. They are said to strengthen your bones so that it's harder for cancer to eat away at them, and in this way they prevent bone fractures. It's probably a matter of course that they'll give them to your mum, but definitely ask for it if they don't (I'd insist if I were you). Hopefully, as the others have said, an antihormonal can arrest or even reverse the cancer. Having it in your bones is not fatal, so the goal is to keep it there and prevent it from spreading. I know this may be small comfort, but if you've got to have stage 4 bc, your mum's got it in the best possible place. Regarding that 2 week thing, that's an alarming thing to say and is not true. I asked my oncologist about the likelihood of suddenly dropping dead from this disease and she said it's not likely and that you usually know if you're anywhere near death.  Where are you located? I'm in Toronto. Send me a PM if there's anything else I can help you with. Warmest regards, Diana_B",

It doesn't make that much difference to activity because the bones can go doing the slightest things - I don't even know when 3 of mine happened - and at least it would get rid of the surprise factor. Basically any strong, unexplained pain could be the mets or a break from the mets. Hopefully the Xgeva will prevent a break. I haven't heard of anyone as bad as me in terms of fractures so I don't think it's the norm at all and it probably won't happen to you. I think my bones were weakened by 2 years of AIs, which you haven't had. That's too bad about Zometa not having anti-tumour properties. Too good to be true perhaps?",

One thing that's worked for me is I say \"let's have a no-talking day\" or \"i'd like to have a no-talking day\". I had a similar problem with my partner: too much time together and too much boring, repetitive talking and story-telling. Being totally unable to speak made my partner more aware of his talking and also of how energizing it is to have breaks from talking. If you can't manage a whole day you could say \"let's not talk until dinnertime (or whatever)\". Even if he won't agree to do it just say \"I'm not talking today\" and walk away and he'll have no choice but to go along. My father also reminisces endlessly and monopolizes the conversation and I find it deadly boring. I've had to be really blunt. Sometimes now I say \"let's stay in the present\", or I say \"I get tired of your reminiscing. I don't like having to listen to all those stories. You can do it once a day  and that's it.\" And then I enforce it. I had a laugh recently because my father said \"That reminds me of when I was a little boy -\" and I cut him off and said \"Everything reminds you of when you were a little boy!\" That did the trick. I had a boyfriend years ago who used to give me detailed synopses of all the movies he'd seen and enjoyed. I would pick up a magazine and start reading it. That always worked. I'd say \"let me know when you'd like to have a conversation with me.\" Sounds harsh, I know, but nothing else works with people who are really extreme in these behaviours. My partner would also \"explain\" the most obvious stuff - exactly the same scenario.It's infuriating and exhausting (not to mention insulting). Even though it sounds mean you'd be doing him a favour and he'll end up happier because he'll start making some real human contact/connection. Right now he's not talking to you but to himself and to people and issues from his past.  I wouldn't bother analysing him though : that's his business. People who do this kind of thing tend not to have enough to do and not enough social contact. Can he get another job/volunteer/get a new hobby?",

I also have mets throughout my spine, right hip, right elbow and forearm, most pelvic bones, femur and skull (all over!). It's just crazy.

The onc said if this fails we should probably look at chemo, which i'm totally dreading. They haven't removed the node because they found cancer in 1 and possibly two more places and they're using this node as a marker. Also I told them I didn't want it removed because i read that the worst cases of LE happen when there's an axillary re-excision. Swedish massage is the kind you think of when you think of massage. It's what they show in movies! I guess it can be kind of deep. Thanks for the advice Binney. I haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary but I'll be extra careful. Giving up massage will be so difficult - I hold all my tension in my back - but it's probably a good idea. Hopefully it is the cuts and burn. I'm seeing my onc in two and a half weeks and I'll watch it until then. I'm feeling quite pessimistic but who knows maybe I'm wrong and everything will be okay. Binney - no problem about the fashion advice - if i could just get this disease stabilized I could work on more fashion solutions! All the best and thanks again, Darya",

My biggest piece of advice to you or anyone is to have a PET scan when your treatment is over. That way you have a better sense if they really got it all. I know you hate the testing and it's incredibly stressful but I wish I had done it when my radiation was over as was recommended to me. Also, listen to your own body and follow your sense of things: if something feels strange or unusual, pursue it and don't stop. I wish you the best of luck. This disease is unpredictable and just because you're stage iii doesn't mean it will come back. Be good and kind to yourself. You're new to this world but you do eventually get used to it to some degree and you start enjoying yourself again and thinking about other things. Sincerely, Darya",

Perhaps what the surgeon is saying about the date in November reflects her unwillingness to do the surgery: in my case they feel the ooph is crucial -- i'm highly er+ -- and are doing it asap (I'm in Toronto too - I'm wondering if it's the same surgeon.) It doesn't sound like they don't think the mets are significant enough to remove, just that surgery is not the best option. I've heard that some women with mets feel as if the doctors have given up on them, and I'm wondering if that's what you're feeling. I get the feeling that more pressure needs to be exerted in your case. Do you go to your appointments alone by any chance? I think it still helps to have a friend or relative along - almost to play good cop bad cop - they can be very forceful and somehow I believe they remind the doctors of how loved you are and how much people want you alive. I know what you mean about looking and feeling fine, but it's hard to say if the way you look is affecting how they treat you. I always try to look as good as possible for appointments, with the hope that they'll see me as \"worth\" saving, and a friend told me that her friend who died of lung cancer had the same instinct. So I guess there are different theories. It's probably not worth expending too much energy on. I'm also wondering which hospital is your home base. I'm at PMH and Mount Sinai and I find that they all know each other and see each other regularly and so they co-ordinate things quickly between them and everything can be done there. I got in quickly, for example, with my new oncologist because my surgeon bumped into him on the stairs and they discussed my case. Originally they were going to refer me to someone much more junior. I think it's human nature to care more about things that are not anonymous. As I say, I don't know where you are, but perhaps if you are at one of the outlying hospitals there might be some value in moving to PMH? Take care. I'm sorry you're dealing with this dilemma.

I think \"so much money just to save one life.\" It's not that I don't think I'm as valuable a person as any other, or that anyone begrudges me all this treatment. It's broader than that. I think about how resources are so unequally distributed around the world, and even within one society. About the fact that very small amounts of money in some poorer countries could save thousands of lives or give many people a tiny portion of the things I've enjoyed, such as education, a safe environment, adequate housing etc. They're philosophical questions that definitely cross my mind. And yet at the same time I don't want to die, and have sought and accepted every treatment I could have that would extend my life, without regard to the costs. I think when you can avail yourself of the means to survive you do.  We tend to operate as if our resources are limitless, but are they really and will they always be? They say that cancer drugs are getting more and more expensive and putting huge pressure on healthcare budgets. I think it's reasonable to contemplate where the resources should go and how much is spent to save one life.",

I've looked high and low for stuff to connect with, but haven't found anything, for the reasons everyone else has already expressed. The only thing I haven't read is Audre Lorde's Cancer Journals. Has anyone read that? Sometimes when I'm looking and looking for a book and nothing seems right, it occurs to me that the voice I'm searching for is my own. I'd been writing a lot of poetry over the past few years, but when my cancer took a turn for the worse last summer, and then when the mets spread to my liver, the fear became so great that it's been hard to concentrate and to write. I suspect that's why there's so little out there: stage IV is a hard place to write from. We could try, though, to express something on the topic. Anyone up for a thread on sexuality? I think it would be much different from anything expressed at other stages and sometimes quite difficult and wrenching. It is for me at least. It may be too poignant and vulnerable a topic. The whole \"sassiness\" thing we're encouraged to feel in early stage is gone. And what's come home to me, that I didn't know, is how much desire is connected to health.",

I have a ton of bone mets pain myself and it really is the most incredible, soul-destroying pain one could experience. However, I don't have to work and I don't have children, so I can only imagine how difficult it is for you to keep functioning. I wanted to tell you though that my pain doctor just started me on the 12 hour slow-release pain med too (it's a hydromorphone/oxycontin mix), together with naproxen and a little dexamethasone, and it's working for me. In fact, I find it less scary than the hydromorphone  I was taking every few hours because I feel a lot less high and dopey and more like myself - for better or worse because I cry a lot too! We talked about other possibilities if this doesn't work over the long run and these include methadone and a few cannabis-based medicines. I found it comforting to know that there are these other possibilities. Take care, dear. I hope you're able to relax a little on these days off, and that you get some relief from the pain. I find when I'm in pain I cannot think, decide, and figure out what I need to do for my future.",

Namely, have you ever had swelling in one of your remaining lymph nodes -- eg. further down the armpit toward the arm -- after a swedish massage? I've had 20 nodes removed and have only the mildest of lymphedema, namely a very slight swelling in my hand that comes and goes. I went for a swedish massage the other day and the following day my lymph node was greatly swollen. I'm making the connection but i'm not sure if the massage had anything to do with it. The reason it's so concerning is that my cancer has recurred in that lymph node and I just had an ooph to try to control the growth, since an AI and zoladex were not working.  I would say the node is a little smaller today, which would support the massage theory. I thought perhaps there was an increase in lymph fluid that could cause the swelling. On the other hand, I have massages quite often and have never had this happen before. It was just a general back massage. I also have three small injuries on my affected hand, namely two paper cuts and a tiny burn from an iron, so I'm hoping maybe my system was overloaded.

It's also a slight stimulant: I found when I was on hormonals they made me extremely tired so this helped quite a bit. I have to tell medical people what drugs I'm on very often and I find people do seem a little embarrassed when I say \"Wellbutrin\". Especially if they don't know what it is and I have to say \"it's an antidepressant\". Some people try to sound so-unjudgemental that they sound overly accepting and I'm reminded again of what you call the \"stigma\".There's a feeling like I've told them something too personal. I try not to let it bother me. It's so predictable that it's begun to amuse me. In general, I think the doctors appreciate the need for things to help us deal with all this. Whenever I ask for Ativan they seem relieved, happy even, probably to be able to help in some way. I think that it's non-medical people who don't understand because a lot of people think they'd be \"better\" patients themselves and aren't around this disease enough to know what it really entails. The medical people often ask me if I'm \"depressed\". I find this really confusing and I'm not sure how to respond. Generally I don't feel \"depressed\", so I suppose the Wellbutrin's working, but I do often feel despair, fear, dread and grief, which are appropriate to my situation, I think. The only thing that will relieve me of these feelings is probably a cure. I hope you do what works for you and enjoy your busy month of May, DivineMrs.M (I love that name)!",

I think they want to be sure they can do that because the pain of bone mets is so intense. If you have a lot of mets they use the radiation for pain control and chemo to really kill the stuff. Also, I think radiation to the bone can actually weaken it. But then when they kill the cancer it allows the bone to repair itself. So it's a bit of a catch-22. I could be wrong but this is what I've gathered from what they've told me.",
