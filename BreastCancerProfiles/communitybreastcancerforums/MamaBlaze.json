I had a bilateral mastectomy last year as well as TC, radiation and a year of Herceptin. I finished Herceptin May 25, 2010 and got the \"all clear\" 5 weeks ago. Woo, hoo!!! I am now looking forward to reconstruction Oct 21st. Can't wait to have some boobs again :)  Thx to all of you 5+ years survivors for posting. It's a great feeling to read your stories. Thx also to Frankie for starting this thread :) Liz. ",
