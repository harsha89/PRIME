I was focused on the left breast because it has always had more tissue than the right and I always thought that if I ever had a breast problem it would be in the left.  My cancer is in the right breast.  Still, I think there is something to intuition. I'd like to think my deceased father's spirit was prompting me with all those evening wake ups.  That's just the way I like to think of it. Since finding the mass I have slept very well.",
