    "Content": "Feb 8, 2012 11:08AM - edited Feb 8, 2012 12:48PM by lsacrowe I have been on Xeloda since August 2009, 4500 mg a day, 7 on and 7 off for breast cancer that has metastasized to the bone..   The worst side effect for me is hand and foot syndrome.   I find that a product called Tattoo Goo The Lotion works the best for me.  I use it morning and night.  You can get it at most tattoo shops or online.   Next worse side effect is extremely dry eyes and Walgreen's brand Lubricant Eye Ointment helps the most. ",
